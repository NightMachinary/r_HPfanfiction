#+begin_quote
  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...

** Like you, I read a lot of HP fanfic when I first discovered it. It took me some time to read through a bunch of stuff and then to moderate my consumption a bit. Now I go through phases where I read mostly/only fanfic for a few weeks, and then I switch back to reading books from the library, re-reading old favorites, or diving into my massive collection of cheap e-books. It's all good, and there are much worse things I could be doing with my time than reading. (I typically read about a dozen hours a week.)

I think if you feel disappointed when a story is over, that's a sign that it was a good one - I get that with plenty of books of all genres. Curling up with a good story for an entire weekend sounds great to me, although it's a luxury I only get every few months or so. I would only start to worry if you get so involved in fanfic that you're routinely failing to take care of your other obligations (to yourself, family/friends, work, etc.) - and that would be a problem if it happened with any hobby! Otherwise, just enjoy the reading.

Well I got to like chapter sixteen and realized there wasn't a chapter after it, and the footnote for the story said it was abandoned. I almost threw my tablet out of the window I was so mad.

** I don't know, as someone who read GoF in a day when it came out, reading lengthy fic in the same amount of time is pretty usual. At worst it just feels like I'll never grow up because I can't put the fandom away. It's kind of nice to have this perpetual link to one's childhood, I don't think it would have been possible without fandom.

** I can definitely sympathize, especially with the part about feeling a bit empty each time I finish reading a fic. When I reached the end of the denarian trilogy a couple days ago it felt like I was slowly dying. I had absolutely no idea what to do for the rest of the day. I call it the Limbo stage, because you're in the middle of fics feeling all lonely and empty. God I hate the the Limbo stage...

** I started reading HP fanfiction just over a year ago, tracked all the fics I've read in a spreadsheet, and ended up with over 50 million words read. Plus I probably have at least another 100 fics bookmarked in my backlog.

Its definitely a real problem sometimes when I can't reel it in. I find myself reading honestly awful fanfics sometimes just because it feels weird to not have anything I'm currently reading, and I occasionally spend an entire day or two just eating, sleeping, and reading - sometimes without the sleeping part.

** It was June 3 years ago that I first found out about fanfics. I did not stop reading until college started in September. I was reading around 18 hours a day, barely eating anything because I was to caught up in the fics, and destroying my sleeping schedule based on how addictive the fic was (ohh its only 200k words I can read through that quickly! Oh look there's a sequel, 300k... won't take a moment...). When college started I had to regulate myself abit more, was forced down to 8 hours of reading a day and it's pretty much stayed like that since. Am I addicted? Yes. Definitely. But it's a good addiction, a non-dangerous one that lets me go back to my childhood.
