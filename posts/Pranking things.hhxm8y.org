So, the recent thread on the word 'Prank' [link below] got me thinking. Are there any 'nice' prank fics (like Potter Club, though even that has some undertones to it) where pranks are more 'magical display' or politely poke fun, or prank fics where the borderline-bullying-with-a-crowd-pleasing-twist (great description from [[/u/WhenYouKnowTheReason][u/WhenYouKnowTheReason]] in that other thread) pranks that certain fics favour are actually pointed out to be driving those Death-Eater scion kids further into the arms of the Pureblood Purist cause?

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** There are some excellent jokes and stunts pulled in the linkffn(Pureblood Pretense) series, where the Weasley twins appoint themselves as the protagonist's PR team, but also exchange fire with her. For example, they air drop hundreds of paper flowers with personalised messages of appreciation and thanks for everyone in the school, after a mammoth reconnaissance effort, and sign her name to many of them - without her involvement or even advance knowledge. She retaliates by covering them in glitter and making them ooze a purgative from every pore and orifice, because they made everyone think she's a puddle of goo on the inside. They put a notice on the board, falsely claiming that she's volunteering to anonymously deliver any Valentines that people want to send by the end of the day, and she gets flooded with notes, having to call in multiple favors to get them all done (not wanting to let people down). She tricks them into using a secret passage that is heavily trapped, and covers them in desserts. And they jointly arrange a succession of boxes claiming to be sacrificial altars, where food vanishes, eventually turning out to be donated to those in need.

*** Just so's y'know, you need to not leave spaces between the >! things and the words you're attempted to tag, otherwise it doesn't work. Luckily, I've read enough of Pretence to have seen some of that, but please do re-spoiler just in case those who haven't come along.

Thanks for the rec! I didn't finish the fic during my last read, so it's good to get the reminder to go back. :)

****** I think I'm still seeing it differently from you. For me, the quote in your reply is mostly spoilered out.

Edit: I've changed one; has it made a difference for you?

******* Really? Huh. That's weird. I see everything in that quote, but if I get rid of the spaces between the exclamation marks in the spoiler tags and the first/last letter of the words in the thing being tagged, it spoilers properly again.

I wonder why that is?

******** What client are you using to view Reddit? I use the Android app and Firefox on Ubuntu.

Edit: Ah, are you perhaps using Old Reddit? I can reproduce the bug there, but New Reddit works.

Edit2: Thanks for leading me to discover this bug. I've now fixed up the spoilers in my comment history (or at least for 4 months back, which is as far as it seemed to go).

********* Ah, apologies. I'm on English time, so I had to go sleep when you responded. But yes, I am using Old Reddit. Congrats on finding the bug and the fix. Not everyone would go back and fix four months of it, so go you! :)
