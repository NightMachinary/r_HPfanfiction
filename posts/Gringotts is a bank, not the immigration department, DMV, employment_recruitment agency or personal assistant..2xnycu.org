** I am guessing that the perceptions of many teens is that if you are very rich, your bank becomes sort of like your personal butler.

Which could be possible if one was the type of client to take advantage of bureaucracy where one or a few people are responsible (inside the bank organization) to try and make sure your large amount of money remains within the bank, by pressuring said responsible employees into being your personal assistants in return for not screwing over the only task set to them.

Except that in HP world, there has never been a mention of any other banks to which a spoiled rich wizard could reasonably threaten to transfer funds.

In fact, most fics that go overboard with services Gringotts provides (usually for Harry) also combine it with going overboard with the size and power of same bank, often making it a worldwide organization and holding a contractual monopoly on banking in Britain and/or the enture wizarding world - entirely missing the part that if the bank actually had that much power, they could make a point of using rich wizards as human toilets, as an add-on to their financial services, and there would be little said rich wizards could do about it as long as their entire fortunes remains hostage.

*** If they actually were using wizards as toilets the wizards would probably rebel though. And generally the rich wizards have more respect in the community, so couldn't they just convince everyone to pick another form of currency? The money itself doesn't have intrinsic value, beyond the fact that it's made of a metal, does it?

**** A fanfic I read a while ago (can't remember which) theorised that the Goblin rebellions were all about the economy and that essentially the Goblins /won/.\\
Gringott's operates the magical world's mint (canon: Galleons etc. have Goblins on them, not wizards) and only banking system.

This actually makes some sense. While we know gold cannot be created without a Philosopher's Stone nothing is preventing wizards from scamming each other (or Muggles) with leprechaun gold or the like, so you'd need a way for the coin of the realm to not be forged.

Goblins have magic (otherwise it makes no sense to /deny/ them wands) so it's not a stretch to say they use their kind of magic to keep Galleons from getting manipulated.\\
Loophole: Hermione's fake order Galleons. Unless these were complete fakes, or a spell on top of them.

** This. The thing to remember about Gringotts is that we don't see any evidence that there are other wizarding banks. The goblins don't need to bend over backwards to keep you happy or make sure that your every whim is "taken care of."

If you have a large amount, they'll probably be nicer to you because they know that you're more likely to take advantage of whatever services they /do/ offer. But they're concerned with maximizing returns and aren't going to do anything beyond what's required to get their hands on as much of your money as possible. They don't care about "customer service" and they don't need loyalty.
