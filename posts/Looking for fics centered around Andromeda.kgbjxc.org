For a very minor character, she has an incredibly interesting backstory, but I feel like she's not very prominent in fanfiction. Does anyone have any recommendations for fics that feature her? Some things that I'm thinking of are

- growing up/ Hogwarts years as Bellatrix and Narcissa's middle sister
- being disowned for marrying Ted Tonks
- later in life raising Teddy with Harry's help
- her relationship with Molly (her sister's murderer)
- her relationship with the Malfoys after the war

Thanks!

I tend to avoid stories that have Andromeda reconciling with Narcissa after the war; often the implication is that Bellatrix kept them separate which I think is absurd. Bellatrix was in Azkaban for nearly a decade and a half, if Andromeda and Narcissa had wanted to have a relationship, they would have. Until the very last moment, Narcissa was on the side that killed Andromeda's husband, daughter, and son-in-law. Narcissa would have been in her ~mid-teens when Andromeda left the family, I just don't buy a desire for reconciliation on either side there.

But I definitely agree she is an interesting character and the Black sister dynamic is one of my favorite concepts!

Edit-- included the link because I can't figure out how to get the bot to work haha

*** That's a really good point, but I think you could argue that all of the Black family and then the Malfoy family would've also prevented any sort of reconciliation. I'm sure Harry would tell her that Narcissa lied and it saved his life, but I don't know if that would be too little, too late. I also can't see Lucius wanting anything to do with her. The only reason I could see Andromeda being open to any kind of relationship is that, besides Harry and the Weasleys, she is entirely alone.

Thanks for the rec! " The Blacker the Berry" was definitely worth the read!

*** Thank you! I really liked the line

" These children see life as so completely black and white, it amuses her. Good or evil. Gryffindor or Slytherin. Red or green. Sides taken at the drop of - or decision of - a Hat."

It reminded me of Sirius saying that the world isn't split into good people and death eaters. It felt like a nice connection between him and his favorite cousin.

** What We Lost

Formatting's a bit wonky, but good fic set after the war that explores Andromeda's (and Harry's) mental state as they deal with their loss and grief. Andromeda/Harry pairing.

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

*** Thanks! I've never read that pairing before, but it sounds interesting! Yeah I see what you mean about the formatting; it's over 100,000 words but it's all in one chapter
