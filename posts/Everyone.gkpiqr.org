"8th year" fic (maybe just a ficlet or a drabble)

Harry swallowed a lump in his throat. Ginny hugged him tightly. All up and down the platform, everyone that had been here last year were all doing the same thing. They were all staring at the carriages, dumbstruck. Or crying. Or doing what Ginny was doing, holding somebody tight.

Everyone could see the Thestrals.
