We see Dumbledore animate statues in canon. We see Hermione attack Ron with birds. We see McGonagall animate desks in a badass charge. We see Draco conjure a snake. We see Voldemort transfigure fire into a snake. We see Dumbledore animate water. I'm sure there are more examples I'm missing.

In fanfiction, I've personally seen birds, butterflies, chairs, giant hands, humanoid statues (very popular), centipedes, massive wolves, lions, and pandas used for all sorts of purposes.

In a canon-compliant world, I would transfigure and animate a giant metal scorpion. I think it strikes a nice balance between everything you would need. It's metal, which seems to do well in combat and frees the construct from biological constraints (OoTP). The stinger would provide a stabbing-based weapon and be large enough to provide fair stopping power. The claws can be used to bludgeon, crush, and cut which adds variety to what the scorpion can accomplish. A scorpion should be mobile enough to close range effectively and block spells for its caster as needed. If possible (with a canon magic system), I'd transfigure magical properties to imbue the construct with as well along the lines of a quintaped or chimaera.

What would you create to assist you in combat? Assume you have the magical ability of Dumbledore.


** Probably simple forms that are efficient and effective, and easy to transfigure in masse on a whim, like a sphere with spider-like legs and tentacles with sharp points. Or like in a Cadmean Victory, small flying objects to use as a shield.

Then again if transfiguring something you know is easier, then I think animals, they tend to be good at physical combat and efficient at moving.

Tigers are particularly agile and destructive, not to mention scary. I probably wouldn't resist animating metal warriors with swords and spears to help though.

Probably would do something with water, it can be quite destructive with enough pressure applied.

I of course if allowed, would not hesitate to cast animals made of fire and do the good'ol firestorm, it's destructive, scary and looks epic.

*** Aww yeah ! The sadistic joy of chemistry, transfigure a statue near the enemy, or even the fricking floor, and resolve the situation with a nice stream of water. In the same way, throw some magnesium on fire and wait for them to extinguish it... with water.

For my part, dinosaurs would have my interest.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

** Avatar TLA has some truly incredible and dynamic projectiles and combat involving what essentially conjuration and shape manipulation.

Toph in her initial fight come to mind in her use of barrier as offensive weapons as soon as a threat is neutralized

Naruto has some others.

Ultimately full animals feel like they'd be incredibly time consuming and wasteful when they would be completely bisected by a cutter.

Another thing would be the shape change of harmless objects into things like metal shrapnel or gasses.

And finally in the heat of battle animating things I think should be a largely disruption and distraction tactic.

** My first thought is antimatter, as used in a few science fiction / space opera stories. Turn a speck of dust into antimatter and you have a respectable explosion. Unfortunately this ability can easily become overpowered and lead to stupid levels of power creep, not suitable for a one-planet civilization.

There's also the idea of magically powered lasers with perfect crystals and perfect mirrors and batteries. The shots travel at the speed of light. Lasers are also dangerously close to being too powerful for the setting.

The wizarding world is so ignorant of muggle advances in science, technology, and imagination to the point where a wizard with sufficient interest in technology should be able to indulge in a reign of terror. How long that reign of terror lasts will depend on the wizarding world's willingness to apply technology and science.
