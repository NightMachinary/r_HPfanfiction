I've been writing on my own for a few years now, and I've decided I want to try writing a fanfic, probably Marauders era. Is there any advice on how to write a good story that seems believable?

I'm also worried that I'd be called out for copying /Life and Times/*, because Mary MacDonald and Marlene McKinnon seem to be Lily's only named friends in canon, so I was planning on using them. Is that bad?


** I think people will react negatively if you were to invent other friends for Lily instead of including the known canon characters. 'Who's this Wanda Fulbright girl? Why didn't you just use Marlene?'

A good story has a beginning, a middle and an end. Seems obvious, yet fanfiction is replete with stories with great concepts, wonderful characterization but that never go anywhere, much less arrive at their destination.

A good story is also about change; where things are at the end shouldn't be the same as the beginning. You have to make the call- how are the main characters going to be by the end of this? Does the plot actually take them along that path? This applies to all the main characters- protagonists, antagonists, obstacles and assistants and comedic distractions alike.

** Plan it out. Pretty much every writer I've ever encountered plans differently, so the specifics of that are up in the air. But before you get into it you should know exactly what it's about, who's in it, why they're in it, what plot points happen when and why, and how long it's going to be.

The last one is the one most often overlooked. Most people, when they start writing fiction. Have no idea how long a 60,000 word novel is. Have no idea how long a 120,000 word novel is. And have no idea just how long 200,000 words is. ((Hint, it's about 400 pages, single spaced, of prose writing in a document or approximately the length of Deathly Hallows)).

As for cannon characters, just don't have them act exactly how they do in someone else's work and it doesn't really matter. Hell, they can even act similar just don't have them say 'exactly' the same thing.

Another hint: the exact number of words per page depends on the format of the book and stuff, and generally varies from 300 to 550 words per page. At least one version of Rowling's works has an average word per page count of about 330. This means that, if using her style, a 200.000-word-long story would be about 600 pages long.

PS. I know it's a nitpick, TE7, but “canon”.

**** I specifically said 'in a document' meaning a word or google doc. Using standard formatting, most prose in .doc form, single spaced, averages 500 words a page.

Docs are also the form most writers are familiar with.

** If you've been writing for a while, then you'll probably know to do something similar to this already - treat your characters, and the way they behave, like /real/ people.

Too many fanfics have characters make contrived, confused or out-of-character decisions because the plot forces them too, and at the same time have problems with the realness of their dialogue. Work your conversations and interactions between characters into a place where you can easily visualise the conversation taking place in front of you. Read and re-read your dialogue (from the start of a scene to the finish) to see that it flows well, that the conversation occurs - particularly on an emotional and character expressiveness level - the way you want it to go.

It can be a bit of a time-sink at times, but the reward for being thorough makes your characters that much more /real./

Also, if you're worried about your actual writing in a grammar/spelling sense, I recommend finding a beta or a someone you know who'd like to read things through before you post them online, and also to bounce ideas off of. I can't overstate the importance of having a secondary perspective on your work when you need it.

Good luck!

** No, it's not bad to use names lol.

Anyway, when you're writing your story, always ask yourself the following question:

*Would this make sense in the real world?*

Obviously, only apply this question in terms of human interactions, events occurring- since magic is not possible IRL.

Don't create drama /just for the sake of it/. And try your best to avoid doing the whole "main character doesn't explain himself/herself quick enough, making the romantic interest leave off in a huff" garbage- lots of people fall for this trap.

This isn't /that/ important though. I think we can all agree that our dear Joe Rowling put in a lot of things that wouldn't make sense in the real world (Dumbledore's behavior, ...)

**** Which is why the fanfiction section is full of ideas because she took her story and ruined it with her strange views.

From forcing cultural segregation in school, to completely wasting the potential of the magic in the series...

***** I wouldn't say it was her strange views that ruined it. It was a myriad of small details that added up. Each of them harmless (class-size, evil slytherin, harry's abuse, dumbledore's behaviour) but taken together it made the world so inconsitent.

And there aren't that many stories that do magic better. Either they apply "Eragon-Style" energy-based magic, mana-pools ("magical cores") or other similar boring concepts. Rowlings Magic is delightfully unlogical, and I love it.

A few stories that do magic and magical culture better are linkffn(A long journey home by rakeesh; Dodging Prison and stealing witches; Prince of slytherin) - but the majority is actually worse.

Most of the stories with an evil or manipulative Dumbledore are quite horrible. Additionally, it feels like with the FB movie JKR has learned - it's a lot more mature, and makes a lot of sense, just look at the villian. I mean Grindelwald has a point, while Voldemort hasn't.

Sure, elements of the series could have been improved, but HP is already great in my opinion.

Edit: Since the reply to this is deleted, I have to answer here: The /magic/ is unlogical and I'm fine with that. It's unrestricted, and doesn't follow very set parameters (compare: Eragon)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Usually I get the idea for one or several scenes to begin with. Like, one day I might just go "oh, what if Harry takes Luna to Slughorn's Christmas party, but DOESN'T leave to go after Draco?" I'll write that specific scene out first as the premise, and try to build an outline around what the changes in canon would be with that divergence.

Really, I just start writing. You can plot for 10 or 20 thousand words, but without getting some actual story out to make use of it, it's really just words. So really, I just like to take an idea and see where it goes.
