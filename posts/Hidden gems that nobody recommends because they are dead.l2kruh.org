There is an absurd amount of fics I never recommend or even forgot about because they died midway. I'm looking for anything like those.

No real requirement for the content, just really well done fics that just died. No oneshots though and If possible, do include trigger warnings if theu author didn't.

I kind of need some pain in my life right now.


** Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow, dead since 2014. linkffn(3557725)

Out of the Night by Raining Ink. It says Complete but it's not: this is a reposting of the incomplete story by somebody else. (Includes a disclaimer from the original author that it's okay to post as long as the disclaimer is included.) linkffn(12723942)

On the Way to Greatness by Mira Mirth, dead since 2014. linkffn(4745329)

Adventures in Magick by Pseudonymous Entity, last entry only a year and a half ago, but that chapter came after a 3-year hiatus so probably not going to see another for a while. Gotta admit I still rec this one because it's so awesome. linkffn(11671069)

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged?

** Well, I still do recommend Nightmares of Futures Past, and technically it isn't dead, but it only updates about every three years, and then FFN deleted it. It's still my most reread fic. Time travel that does a good job of balancing foreknowledge vs the butterfly of doom. It has a powerful Harry, but that doesn't usually matter, because the focus is on building up his friendships again and trying to support people better this time, so him being good at combat doesn't take over the story.

The author has health problems that keep him from writing very much. He maintains that it isn't abandoned, though.
