This post is inspired by this over on [[/r/Narutofanfiction]]:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/61jch2/sex_and_sensibility/]]

I'm curious if (m)any HP fics go into the realm of social gender identity and sex in the wizarding world in a meaningful way (not pointless smut). Please post any you know of and would recommend below.


** If you're in the market for a bit of a long-winded one linkffn(To Reach Without) could hit a mark. In it Harry becomes a girl - in sex, at least - and what follows is a bit of a identity crisis. I say long-winded because the fic tends too loose a bit of focus throughout its course.

Another interesting one deals with crossdressing and, what I think is called, gender fluidity? Not sure about the terms here. Anyway, its a great fic by the name of linkffn(Harveste Addams and the Sorceror's Stone).

*** While being a very funny and enjoyable fanfiction in its own right, Harveste Addams doesn't really have any deep-seated emotional reason for Harry dressing as a girl. It's more of a quirk that's completely accepted and barely commented on rather than a fic with introspection, social issues and emotional issues that I'm looking for.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

** Session Transcripts is amazingly well written and poignant and includes a trans character.

linkffn(7508449)

Red Headed Stepchild (not /that/ one) includes a trans protagonist, but the transgender side of things isn't a super prominent feature of the story if I remember correctly.

linkffn(9037058)

Edit - I remember seeing a oneshot somewhere in which Harry was a metamorph who in conjunction with time turner abuse lived simultaneously as several female characters, but I don't remember which collection this was in.

  When you've always known you like girls, it's easy to grow up believing you were really meant to be a boy. After all, that's the way the world works, isn't it? Boys like girls. Girls like boys. If you like girls, you must be a boy, especially if you were born with the bits boys have.Everyone reminded Draco he was a boy as he grew. The first born son. The much awaited and desired son. The son and heir. His masculinity was celebrated.Which is why it took so long for Draco to realize he wasn't a man at all.
