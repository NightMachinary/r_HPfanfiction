It was a fanfiction where Harry had a younger brother who was named something along the lines of Eric. When the dark lord came Harry defeated him but Eric took all the fame. Eric was basically Dudley (fat and jelous with Ron's eating appetite that disgusted everybody. Harry went to Ravenclaw (i think) instead of Gryffindor. Not an urgent request since i still have a fanfiction i need to finish reading.

Edit: I found it. It was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6864381/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Veela][Harry Potter and The Veela]]


** Ugh. I stopped reading a few paragraphs into the story. As soon as I saw that child Harry telling voldemort "I am a precog". Make the kid a kid, damn it!

** Wow. That sounds like a really awful premise/title. Why'd you read it?
