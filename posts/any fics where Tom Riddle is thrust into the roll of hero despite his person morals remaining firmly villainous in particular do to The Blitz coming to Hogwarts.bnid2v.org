Releasing of the basilisk on the invading army very much preferred. (perhaps with intent to petrify but intent to kill also works)


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11261838/1/The-Unwinding-Golden-Thread][The Unwinding Golden Thread]] Harry accidentally changes the course of history, and Tom Riddle must fight against a greater enemy.

In The Wayland Smith's "Wandering Devil" trilogy, an immortal Tom Riddle often ends up fighting on the side of "good" for his own selfish reasons.

  Part 1 of 'The Wandering Devil'. Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. Harry and Voldemort took oaths to end their long and bloody war. Over a century later, a convoluted plot forces the two (slightly out of practice) immortals into an adventure together.

  Part 2 of 'The Wandering Devil'. Harry and Tom left our world behind, but the new world is far more dangerous. Death himself has come to claim his due. Dragons, fairy lords, sorcerers and a town under threat, it's practically your average day. A story of Harry and Voldemort in a dark and dangerous fairy-tale world. No relationships.

  Part 3 of 'The Wandering Devil'. The year is 1996. The Second Wizarding War is in mid-swing. A traveller from another dimension is searching for a forbidden text. Forced to work with Dumbledore the traveller finds himself trapped between his quest and the war with Voldemort. Gods, demons and dark lords, he's seen them all before, but as reality grows thinner can anyone remain sane?

  Mark and Se√°n have ended their YouTube careers. That leaves their Egos with one option to keep themselves from fading as the fans start to forget them: Leave their dimensional plane, and live in the humans'. But the Outside is new and unknown to the Egos, with rules and laws they have a hard time understanding.  Warning that this series will contain Major Character Death, Graphic Depictions of Violence, Strong Language, Manipulation in the form of Gaslighting and development of Stockholm Syndrome, Major Character Injury, Mob Mentalities, and more. All chapters are tagged with proper warnings (ones without warnings are older and need updated), and if you want a tag added, please inform the author! They will be added immediately, and the author encourages readers to say something if one is forgotten.

*** Or.... the author could just make things a bit unrealistic so the plot works? The introduction of any HP universe stuff is already making things massively different from actual reality anyway. You could easily handwave whatever problems you could name by having Grindewald help the Germans with some magic if an author felt like it.

**** But the existence of magic doesn't really change much of the other aspects of the world other than the layout of Kings Cross Station.

If you are going to write a story about a military conflict, you ought to pay close attention to the capabilities of each side. Otherwise, you end up looking like a cheap action film with the "useless military" trope. Or you would need to come up with a realistic way the Royal Navy is taken out (you can sic Grindelwald at them for all I care, but it has to be done).

***** For the aircraft at least increasing fuel efficiency could be easily explained away with some kind of magical enchantment to make the aircraft, the fuel, or both, lighter. I believe such a spell is even in canon already though maybe not used just mentioned.

Though I do agree the author at least would need to plan out carefully the capabilities of both sides in a fic focused on war, lest things rapidly become really absurd and inconsistent with various sides having to hold the idiot ball to not ruin the plot. The audience wouldn't necessarily need that knowledge given to them, especially not right away, and maybe not ever depending on if say in a first person story the character(s) would never learn that information.

Also I'd argue that magic not changing the world more is mostly Rowling not letting it rather than it not making sense for those changes to be there. Even still there is way more than Kings Cross, we got hidden dragon preserves and who knows what else magically hidden away.

****** You could place featherlight and expansion charms on the fuel tanks, both of those exist in canon. Although if you are willing to throw magic at the problem, disillusioning the bombers would be the better choice. But either of those would involve Grindelwald, and canon says that Britain was almost untouched by the conflict with him. You could obviously diverge from that, but then you have to resolve that somehow.

The other issue is interception (assuming no magical stealth). Operating from Northern France or the Low Countries, any incoming raid would have to cross a lot of Britain to get to Hogwarts, which gives the RAF plenty of opportunity to shoot the incoming bombers down. And either the fighters hold formation and are practically useless, or they can be drawn away at some point, which again leaves the inbound strike undefended. Or you come from Norway, which means crossing Scapa Flow, which at that point is probably the biggest concentration of AA guns on the planet.
