So, am I the only one who does not mind flames.

To be fair, my story has had none so far but my last chapter gave me something I know I would rather have flames then. 0 reviews. My story is not big, nor is the reviews on it hitting every minute, but I have had a healthy response of 1 to 4 reviews on every chapter, until my last one. I would rather have someone destroy my text then to have no interaction.

What do you guys think?


** One reader scolded me for getting Tonks all wrong. This reader informed me that since Tonks is one of the good guys, she can't have any flaws. This was for a story in which I portrayed young Tonks as starting off with the same anti-werewolf bigotry as the rest of her culture. She overcomes this only later, after she meets Remus.

Another reader was outraged because my POV character believed things that weren't true. I explained the concept of an unreliable narrator, but I don't think it got through.

I enjoy comments like that for showing me how other people's thought processes work. There are some strange ideas out there.

*** I think that is a thing with some readers. They read the fic because they like the characters but they have a very set idea of who that character should be so get very angry when the character dosent conform to the version that exsists in their head

** I'm fine with flames.

What I'm not okay with is people asking questions using a guest account. What's the point in asking a question when there is no way to reply? Jut don't understand what is going through these people's minds.

*** I am lucky and have avoided such a situation and hope to avoid it forever. I only had one guest review and it was just, good job! Haha

*** I think its because they dont have an account or cant log in at that time so they leave the review/question and hope that you,ll answer it in the authors note of the next chapter

**** Technically responding to reviews in a chapter is against FF.Net terms of service (which require that chapters contain only story content).

** But are they actually interacting or are they just saying "You suck!"

**** I think it depends what they are actually saying..........if they say write a lenthy paragraph on why they dont like the story. They have still read it so you could take what they say on board even if its rude

​

But if the flame is just "you suck" or "this is shit"..........how do you know theyve even read it...........whats the point of having it up there? Its taking up space

​

I think people who come in to tell you theyve not even read it because they dont like the pairing..........why even bother informing the writer? its pointless and not needed

​

thats my take

***** It's a good take. Like I said, I just experienced a non reviewed chapter. It feels weird... like I wish someone would say something.
