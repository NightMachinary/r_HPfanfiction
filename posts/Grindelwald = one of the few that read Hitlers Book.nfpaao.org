As the title says. That would also make it possible for Q. Goldstein to redeem herself. She has - at least that is portrayed in the film - a brother in law With original behaviour and a family with Jewish origin. It would make perfect sense for her to fall for Grindelwald telling her about the monstrous man and swearing to end it. I am currently playing around with various ideas to that end.
