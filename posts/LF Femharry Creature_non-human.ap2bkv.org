I'm looking for fanfics where Fem!harry is some sort of creature or non-human being. Would prefer other creatures rather than Veela or Vampire. I'd also prefer only f/f or Gen.

Something like linkffn(13001898)


** always on the lookout for new and good femharry stories, so ill keep my eyes open here and hope to find something for myself too! ;)

** linkao3(The Fire that Swallowed the World by RowlettLesbian)

In which the killing curse successfully destroyed or ejected Harriet Potter's soul from her body and left behind a husk. Six years later a fire moves in.

I've been enjoying this recently and it's still on-going. Mostly it's about Harriet trying to blend in with humans to some degree of success. It's quite fun.

#+begin_quote
  Harriet Potter died at one year old. What was left of her slogged through life, alive in body and mind but not soul. Six years later she was finally cremated. This is not the story of Harriet Potter. This is the story of the brilliant flame who inherited her place, and her journey in the strange world of humans.*****Harriet is trapped, surrounded by humans, and painfully easy to extinguish if she doesn't keep her flames hidden. After the Dursleys, Hogwarts is a step up for her, but now she has to unravel the mysteries surrounding the body she stole and fight to survive against a monster who may be even less human than she is.As friends of Harriet, Luna, Hermione, and even Draco are playing with fire, and the price of failure is greater than they ever could have known.
