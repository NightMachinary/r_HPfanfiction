** Nothing drives me nuts more than Slytherin!Harry running straight out to befriend the same old people. Maybe it's okay later, once he's had time to establish his own identity and sink or swim without the (often overpowering) influence of Hermione. Neville is okay to me as a quick friend, because he's more neutral.

Fem!Harry that is friends with girls in her own house, as well as some others that aren't the ones you've mentioned.

It's so annoying how often Harry ends up with the same friends(usually Hermione) no matter what other changes the author makes. Even the most AU Harry has to fight the troll, apparently.

**** That's fair enough, fem!harry isn't my favourite either. However, I'm of the opinion that Victoria Potter is the very best one out there, so I really recommend you at least try it. The author does so much fun stuff with both the universe and magic while maintaining the canon tone. It's really great.

I unfortunately don't have any other recommendations. I'm of the bad habit of not bookmarking fics I like and then forgetting they exist, so I only remember the ones that really make a mark.

Too often have I read "I hid in the library for ages. while there, I read books on mythology and wiccan practices, found my magic and plan to learn everything there is to know" and then, he gets the Holly wand and the Hat puts him in Gryffindor.

***** I don't think the wand would change that much, Holly is not THAT temperamental as say Ebony who only accepts those who are extremely set on their ways and will fight for it.

And Holly Wand allows for a realistic excuse for Harry to meet Voldemort and survive by himself.

The Sorting, however, yeah, in canon there were very specific events that lead to Harry villanizing Slytherin, had he met different people, or rather had a guide who wasn't Rubeos 'All Slytherins are EVIL' Hagrid, not met the single worst Slytherin in the year and Ron , all he would've heard from Slytherin is 'You'll be GREAT there'.

Harry who has a specific desire to be great and learn a lot of magic will either be Slytherin or Ravenclaw. Harry's canon reasons where:

-I don't really know, but Gryffindor would be okay.

-Not Slytherin, NOT Slytherin, NOT SLYTHERIN!!!.

So, yeah I get mighty peeved too when people just repeat canon until Harry meets whomever he's supposed to be with and then he does a 180. Honestly, people, it's fanfiction, you are supposed to change things around other than Harry's robe colors and who he takes to Yule Ball.

****** That really depends on how AU you're getting, if all you're changing is Harry's house and the direct impacts from that then Quirrell is still going to let the troll in as a distraction, Ron is probably still going to make Hermione cry, and he'll either ignore her and she'll die, he'll tell a teacher and she may or may not die, or he'll go to save her and they both probably die.

Just saying Harry isn't in x house so this event that happens in canon that isn't at all related to his house isn't going to happen is a bit of a stretch if you ask me.

Hermione is generally disliked or ignored by her peers and they continue to dislike/ignore her after Ron and Harry stop disliking her. None of them were involved in any of what you mentioned. As such, this stuff not happening won't stop Ron from disliking her.

This has nothing to do with seeing Ron or Hermione hurt or demeaned. I can only stand a passing mention of both in a 'different sorting' fic. I just don't see how Harry not being in Gryffindor changes Ron's feelings towards Hermione, his characterization, or Flitwick's decision.

We have no evidence of her being disliked or ignored. For example, her relations with other Gryffindor girls were at the very least cordial, if not very close: when Hermione was crying in that bathroom, Lavender (or one of the other girls) went to check on her; later (IIRC) they helped her prepare for the winter ball in GoF.

The reason Hermione was hectoring Harry and Ron in the first place is that they kept getting into trouble, occasionally taking her with them. No Harry means no trouble, and no trouble means Ron and Hermione aren't on each other's radars.

The reason Ron's words affected Hermione so badly is that she considered them friends, in some sense. Consider that she acted as if her giving /them/ the silent treatment was a punishment of sorts.

************ Hermione was literally friendless for the 1st two months and whenever Ron wasn't speaking to her because she'd either snap at Harry or Harry would be mad at her, too. Nothing suggests that Parvati went to check on her. All is overheard is that she was crying in the bathroom and wanted to be left alone.

Hermione bothering Harry and Ron 3-4 times in 2 months doesn't change Ron's feelings about her from meeting on the train or Hermione being a snappish show off on Halloween and Ron reacting badly to it.

Ron's words affected Hermione because she didn't have any friends full stop. There's no way she thought Ron or Harry were her friends, especially after Ron says something like 'don't stop speaking to us now. It was doing us good.'

These things change at the author's discretion, but pulling the Gryffindor thread doesn't unravel the whole plot entirely.

******** The only one of those I'd consider mostly viable would be Ron sitting somewhere else in the class. Ron and Hermione up until that point, as far as canon tells us, had only really interacted on the train, which would have happened regardless of Harry's presence as she was going around looking for Trevor. As for not being near enough to hear him say it, that's got nothing to do with Harry either, as Ron says it while leaving from that class, she could have gone any number of ways from that class, she wasn't specifically following Harry around. So the only really plausible one that Harry being in Slytherin would change is the seating, and it's entirely possible that wouldn't change either.

***** Four chapters in so far, let's start with the glows and then the grows.

You have a gothic flourish , which is pretty interesting and unusual in Harry Potter fanfiction, but it sets the mood very well for your premise of occult studies and demon summoning.

You also do a marvelous job at painting a scene, and really driving home the feelings of regret, desperation and hopelessness that the characters are facing.

I enjoyed reading about the types of magic Harry perforned. This may be obvious, but I think its critical to explore interesting magics in this story since its your central premise and I expect some infernal magics and contracts as well since demons were mentioned.

A bit nickpicky, but I noticed a couple of Americanisms such as making a mcdonalds analogy and referring to a "baggie" in Gringotts. I would rewrite the scenes without mentioning McDonalds (yes, there are McDonalds in England, but its an American icon and i dont think you should draw attention to it) and rename a baggie into a sack or something.

Also, I might be jumping the gun a bit here but it seems like the first few chapters were setup expositions to acquaint the reader with the AU. This is fine, but I'm itching for some conflict and raised stakes :).

****** Thank you so much for the feedback, why reddit chose to not notify me about it is upsetting.

Thank you for reading first and foremost, it brings me nothing but joy to find people read my work, and more so when they enjoy even parts of it! I am trying to hit on the style you pointed out, so seeing as you understood that means it worked!

A quick fun fact for you, you are the first person to realise that I will be featuring demons in an increased capacity in this fic (or at least to say something about it)!

I am glad that I am getting emotion in my writing, it is one of the main reasons I took up the helmet of writing in this community as fictions that display scenes in meaningful ways are in short order (of what I have found).

I love magic and as an avid pathfinder player ruled magic is something I enjoy even more. I am trying to bring what JK did and merge it with a more rule heavy system and I hope it turns out well.

I am really trying to limit my Americanisms, I do quite extensive research on them actually. I am from the midwest in the USA, about 0 British people live here, thus you see me trying my best. When a beta is finally gifted upon my soul I pray they are British.

Yes I am writing a character heavy story and thus it is settling as of the first few chapters, but once you get to The Waning of Time I hope you can say I write a scene with a more robust conflic, other then the normal character conflict.

Again, your feedback is amazing and I truly wish to hear more, but more then that I hope you enjoy my story!

** Shoot, I /don't remember the name/, but it's starts out where Percy had to double back for something at home, ergo Harry never meets Ron at the train station, and Draco sees him, remembers he's /Harry Potter/, and goes over to help him because he wants to make friends.

Draco's spoilt, prejudiced, and unintentionally cruel a lot of the time, but he slowly learns for himself that whatever he's been told is wrong. Not all muggle-borns don't "deserve their powers" or whatever, because Harry is innocent and brave and eager to learn. He's also someone who isn't friends with him for his father, unlike the rest of his slytherin friends. Draco takes some time, but he he realises Harry isn't prejudiced in any way, because he wasn't raised to be. He just thinks of himself as good as any other boy, a little lesser actually. So Draco feels immense guilt, cuts the pure-blood crap and starts being a real friend to Harry (and his confidence therefore rises).

They don't meet Hermione until the troll incident, and again, it takes them a lot longer to make friends (namely, it's done through secret meetings in the grounds and in the library). He likes her though, because his first meetings with her are that she knows so much about the wizarding world despite being from a muggle background, yet in some ways she's just as confused about things as she is. (He doesn't know she's a bit of a snob until much later, so it doesn't stop them from becoming friends, and it annoys him a bit later but not enough to tear them apart.) Draco's furious when he finds out about them, but it cools down.

Ron and Harry never make friends though.

- Oh, and Harry /does/ keep visiting Hagrid. There's no way he'd stop, in any universe.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.

The author took a bit to find his style and for everything to click but it's just amazing. It's still in progress, check out the discord server for chunk updates and some contextual stuff from the author. Ignore the seemingly irrational James potter, there's a very very good reason for his action.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
