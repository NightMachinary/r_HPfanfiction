Want/Need more stories where we see Severus bantering with Minerva and/or Filius, At times it seems cruel to an outsider but Minerva and/or Filus know that Severus doesn't really mean the things he says. And they give it as good as they got as well.

** Does anyone remember that story where Severus, Minerva and Filius bet as to which of the first years end up in which house? And Severus barely takes part but when he does, he never loses. I think it was a story where either Hermione or Harry (but most likely Hermione) went into Slytherin. Anyway, they had some good banter in that story.

  Do you ever wonder what the staff meeting was like the day Dumbledore pitched the Crystal Maze Philosophers Stone protections?

  It was probably going to be the rarest eclipse in her lifetime. In 3 lifetimes. But despite a tower filled with chattering people and their biased tongues, Minerva could barely bring herself to look at the slowly darkening moon... For The Houses Competition. Prompts: [Character] McGonagall, [Location] Astronomy tower during an Astronomical Event.

** linkffn(7937889) portrays Snape as rather liked by the staff when he gets out of his bully teacher persona. He teaches Flitwick how to play cards and has a friendly rivalry over Quidditch/House Cup with Minerva.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
