*** If Draco was prophesied to defeat Voldemort, Voldemort would probably want to kill him to prevent it, and Draco would want to kill Voldemort out of self preservation. And his parents are certainly much more concerned with their son's survival than they are with supporting any Dark Lord.

**** what would be the point if he didn't have draco's character? the draco in the book wouldn't fight the dark lord and usher in a new era of loving-mudloods. especially not when he is younger.

****** i think he'd have to practically be raised a weasley to not do a tom riddle the instant he found out he was a malfoy. the whole point of his cannon character is he's a rotten to the core shit, but never quite get's past his fear of murdering. he'd just be a bwl called draco.

#+begin_quote
  AU. When Sybill Trelawney recites her first prophecy a bit differently, the effects are far-reaching. An orphan girl is raised by her Aunt and Uncle along with her overbearing older cousin, eagerly anticipating the day she can leave them all behind, while a raven-haired boy grows up in his father's shadow, dreaming of making his own destiny once he reaches his parent's alma mater.
