I always loved this one. Was written before half blood prince was released.

**** I had been using [[http://fanficfare.appspot.com/]] but that seems to be erroring out lately a lot.

I ended up just downloading the calibre plugin mentioned on that sites homepage. Hope that helps.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
