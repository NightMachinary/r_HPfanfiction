Edit: Note! I do know that this is like canon, but what I was meaning was that this is more explored and expanded on, than it was on canon. That was what I was meaning/wanting.

He doesn't join Voldemort, doesn't become dark, or anything like that. He questions things more, is more cautious about Dumbledore, the Order and the like; but doesn't go evil or dark.

Morally grey is fine, or questioning things is also fine.

Please Read:

Too often when Harry finds out that Dumbledore hid things from him, the Weasley's are bashed, I don't like that; since I really like the Weasleys.

So please; no Weasley bashing.

No Harem Harry

No Seer Luna.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

I want it to be written in a somewhat believable way. I don't want the Order to be against him; I don't even want Dumbledore to hate Harry or fear that he'll be the next Dark Lord, Harry just finds out the truth, that's all I really want; if he starts treating Dumbledore differently, I'd like for it to make sense.

No Harry is heir to Potter/Malfoy/Black/Weasley et cetra.

No Harry has a ton more Gringott accounts and the like. Those tropes tend to be rather done to death, and don't really add anything overall.

Just Harry finding out Dumbledore wasn't honest. Rather he finds out that Dumbledore knew about how shit Harry's childhood was, Harry finding out that he has a Horcrux inside of him; or whatever.

No Dumbledore stealing money from him or over the top things like that either.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash


** In the Kancolle crossover Harry And The Shipgirls ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.413375/][Part 1]]/[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-prisoner-of-shipping-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.630637/][Part 2]]), Dumbledore admits that he knew Harry would not have a good childhood at the Dursleys, but the protections placed upon him required that either he lived with a blood-relative of his mother (Petunia being the only one who qualified) OR that he lived with one who truly loved him in a purely maternal way and since everyone in the Magical UK knew him as the Boy Who Lived, even those who under normal circumstances would most likely to be able to do so would also love him for defeating Voldemort, thus inadvertently breaking the protections and leaving him vulnerable to those who wished to avenge the Dark Lord.

Due to circumstances, a young Harry is discovered and adopted by the shipgirl Nagato, who fully qualifies on the second part, as well as giving Harry extra protection in the form of an entire fleet (plus allies). By the time he reaches Hogwarts, he also has an entire /Abyssal/ fleet (including two Installation Princesses) and multiple supernatural entities (including at least two Kitsune and a dragon-spirit) looking out for him.

The general consensus among readers is that Voldy is totally screwed.

** My own "No Longer Alone" fits this. Harry is adopted by Andromeda after the Third Year and they suspect that Dumbledore is deliberately messing with Harry, but the adults know when to pick fights.

The Tonks know that they cannot oust Dumbledore and that even most accusations won't stick. Dumbledore does not like that the Tonks got custody over Harry, but there is little he can do without resorting to actions like kidnapping or blatant abuses of power which might get him sacked. When Harry ends up in the TWT, Andromeda agrees that Harry has to participate because there is no way to guarantee that Harry is not trapped in a magical contract with unknown but crippling consequences. And there is no way to sue or interrogate a goblet (which one reviewer suggested).

It is a character-centric slice of life story. My goal is not to come up with a completely different plot but rather show how Harry's life would change if he was adopted by a loving family. He is not suddenly the top student or the most powerful wizard. No Weasley bashing, but one chapter throws some shade at Molly. The one character I really threw under the bus is Pomfrey. Neville hates Harry for in-story reasons surrounding Bellatrix Lestrange, whom I try to paint as an evil character who used to be good before being made a monster by Voldemort after she joined to protect her sisters and was forced into a marriage with Lestrange.

  Unable to clear his name, Sirius asked his cousin Andromeda to take care of Harry. This turns out to be the best decision Sirius has ever made.
