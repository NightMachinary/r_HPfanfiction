I had started a story that would have had a thestricorn in it but abandoned the idea for now. My story darkness ascendant (and potentially a trek to the stars) will have a dragon egg that is hatched by a Phoenix in the style of basilisk resulting in a rather fey dragonette with butterfly like wings and a feathered body that becomes a popular pet with the song ability of a Phoenix and the fire breathing ability of a dragon with no teleporting ability but able to carry massive loads (tonnes literally).


** Oh no, wasn't the manticore/fire crab crossbreed in canon bad enough?

...Actually, hang on...fire crabs have jewelled shells...and nifflers are attracted to shiny things...

/They successfully combined a fire crab and a niffler to create a gemstone-coated niffler./\\
/The plan was to create a prestigious pet that would be satisfied with its coat and leave other valuables alone./\\
/But the crystal niffler used its coat of gemstones to rally conventional nifflers to its side, forming an organised tribe to steal and hoard the world's treasures./\\

*** Ooh, I've got another one; Diricawl x Golden Snidget.

   :END:
/The crossbreed between the diricawl and golden snidget was done by an unknown actor centuries ago; an uncatchable snidget, to protest against the use of golden snidgets in Quidditch./\\
/The initial hybrid vanished into the wild shortly after their creation; with no subsequent snidgets showing teleportation ability, it was assumed that the hybrids were sterile./\\
/But now, it seems the warping snidget has bred true; widespread throughout the south of England, hundreds of muggles are reporting the same thing; round golden birds that vanish before their eyes./\\
/Not all think they're hallucinating it, and the camera doesn't lie. The news threatens to spread worldwide, and it won't be long before scientists set out to research the phenomenon.../\\

*** Horny wizard walks into his greenhouse one night drunk off his arse. He sees a surprisingly busty looking mandrake and decided to try fucking it. It becomes his fetish. Soon he has gotten a whole crop of mandrakes pregnant. They give birth and the hybrids escape into the wild where they continue to breed.
