  Kingsley Shacklebolt had never expected his habit of solving Daily Prophet crosswords to uncover a security leak. But when Potterwatch passwords started to appear in them as answers to clues, he had little choice but to investigate who was behind it ...

** My favourite Moody fic is linkffn(Geminio by Portus). It intertwines a great backstory for his character set during his Hogwarts years with an interesting plot set during the events of DH.

A consistently great and engaging writing style combines with good plot, character development and a twist to make it one of my favourite fics of all time.

Bonus: it even works with canon (if in a bit of a roundabout way).
