What other "bashing" stories have you read that are surprisingly "well written" (not over the top)?

Edit: Most bashing stories are poorly written i.e. A series of rants without actual plot or over the top (all the Weasleys are evil, Dumbledore is evil, Dursleys are evil-er than usual, even your mom is evil, etc.) At least in this one, it seems like Ginny is the only one who had a personality transplant and there was an actual plot.


** I just read it, and it's pretty shit to be honest. It's the ten-millionth "I hate this relationship so Ginny really used a love potion, hahahah!" story, and it's not even well done.

Choice quotes from it:

#+begin_quote
  "that monster in my chest has been given a quick AK".
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  "Give me one reason I shouldn't send you to Hell by way of the Killing Curse train"
#+end_quote

That is *awful* writing.

To be fair it is over a decade old

**** That concept was over-used even back then. It got old about a week after Half-Blood Prince was published.

** meh, I read it before and it wasn't that outstanding for me, seemed like a normal bashing fanfiction, but maybe that's just my opinion.

  Nineteen years later, life was going great for Harry Potter. He had everything he had ever wanted. Friends, a wife, children. It was perfect. Then he opened his eyes...

** Oh well, to each his own. Here's another one that's pretty ridiculous just to contrast: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4746187/11/What-a-Bunch-of-Nonjon]]

** I actually liked it. It's not great and I don't think it's well-written either but it is entertaining to a certain degree. At the end, Harry was about to go dark and I would've loved to see that. It's definitely above-average for FF.net though! Thanks for the rec!
