*** I read a Spiderman story recently and the author did that exact thing.

I comment on ao3 so the author can respond directly.

*** Yesssss. So many times I've seen people call Harry a "parseltongue" when he is, in fact, a Parselmouth who speaks the language Parseltongue. I also hate it when people write muggle-born, pure-blood, or Half-blood, when it is Muggleborn, pureblood, and half-blood. Nobody pays attention to proper capitalizations or spellings these days.

** I tend to start fics when I'm still publishing a fic. Or I start a rewrite of a current fic that's a little different than what I've already written but I prefer it so I want to delete the old one and post the new one. Currently, I'm writing my own version of linkffn(The World Without Me) by Eternal Cosmos and I started it off wrong but I'm already around 20k words in but I've written 25k of the same fic but better without any stupid parts that I'm not even going to write about in the future.

#+begin_quote
  Harry won the war against Voldemort but at a terrible price.Fawkes gives him another chance in a new world where he died as an infant and where Voldemort still lurks in the shadows...but not for long, because when one exists the other cannot survive. AU
