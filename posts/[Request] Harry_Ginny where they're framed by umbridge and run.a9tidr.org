I can remember a lot about this but just can't seem to find it. Harry and Ginny are down by Hagrids cabin talking about Parseltongue when Umbridge and the disciplinary squad turn up to try to arrest them for dark magic. They fight and the pair escape through the forest to hogsmeade where a clothes shop owner helps them go undercover and escape. It turns out there's some kind of muggleborn escape team that smuggled people out during the first war that were still active. The rest of the story is about everyone trying to find Harry and Ginny while they live regular lives and become a couple. Thanks!

*** The bot is quite flexible. Just use linkffn with your best guess at the title, and it will usually pick it up. If you know the author, you can add "by JoeBloggs" to narrow it down.
