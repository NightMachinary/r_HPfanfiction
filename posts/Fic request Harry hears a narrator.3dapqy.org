Any short fics where Harry or another character hears their their life being directed/narrated by a fanfiction author? I never saw it, but something comparable would be the Will Farrell movie called /Stranger than Fiction/ where his life is being directed/narrated by a writer.


** The Harry Parable...

Yes, please

*** "He saw the girl, his best friend, and he knew there is no one else to ask to the Ball."

"Absolutely not."

"And then he decided that this is not going to be a Harry Hermione pairing. A pity, really."

** There was one where he was adopted by Deadpool, of the Marvel Universe(s). Thinking in Little Green Boxes or somesuch, and it breaks the fourth wall a few times. Maybe even frequently, I can't remember. But it's good.

**** Ugh I can't stand Deadpool for that. They skipped right past humorous, trounced over ironic, and landed smack dab in the middle of obnoxious fan-service. If superheroes were subreddits Deadpool would be exactly what [[/r/circlejerk]] is parodying.

***** Circlejerk...why is that a thing. I never really read comics, but I can see how Deadpool would be very annoying. Especially if you are interpreting him as sounding like Ryan Reynolds.

** There is one where he realizes his life is a video game and proceeds to, well, game the system for all its worth--[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9708318/1/The-Adventures-Of-Harry-Potter-the-Video-Game-Exploited]]

Definitely a fun but quick WIP that breaks the fourth wall.
