Hello, first time posting. I've been reading Fanfic for the first time in a couple years. Looking for anything that has well done ritual magics and/or either druidic or witchcraft undertones. I've read a few of the classics such as Prince of the Dark Kingdom and the such, and recently began reading New Blood, which prompted this.

The longer the better, any character as long as it's well written, and if its still being updated that great! But if its completed or abandoned its not a deal breaker for me. And I'm certainly not opposed to some darker stuff.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))
