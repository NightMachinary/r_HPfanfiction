I read this years ago so can't remember if it was Ginny/Draco or Hermione/Draco - leaning towards Ginny!

It was set post DH. Draco had a young daughter, Pansy was also in it as a friend of Draco's. G/Herm was the owner of a small children's bookstore that I think had murals painted? And pretty sure at one point the daughter flooed herself to the store running away from home.

Would love to re-find and re-read if this rings a bell for anyone! Tried googling already with no luck.
