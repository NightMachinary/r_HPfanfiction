:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It took place in the Hp verse and Fairy tail was just a manga/anime there. Harry then uses it as inspiration when he learns that he has magic early. He had a cool teacher (I think she was a librarian at his school?) that showed him the manga. He then tries to recreate Lightning Dragon Slayer magic by chewing on electrical wires in his cupboard room. I think he also blew up a tree with lightning. If anyone can find this please send it my way. I never got to finish it, and I can't find it. Can't even remember what it is called or who wrote it. :(

#+begin_quote
  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.

** The story you're looking for is Fairy Tale by Araceil. It is an unfinished fic. They have deleted everything from ffn, and it is not posted in their AO3 account.

I have a saved copy in MSWord. LMK via private message if you want a copy.
