*ACT III, SCENE V*

#+begin_quote
  *SCORPIUS:* He wasn't supposed to do it alone. Cedric was supposed to win it with him. But we humiliated him out of the tournament. And as a result of that humiliation he became a Death Eater. I can't work out what he did in the Battle of Hogwarts --- whether he killed someone or --- but he did something and it changed everything.

  *SNAPE:* Cedric Diggory killed only one wizard and not a significant one --- Neville Longbottom.

  *SCORPIUS:* Humiliating Cedric turned him into a very angry young man, and then he became a Death Eater and --- and --- it all went wrong. Really wrong.

*********** Okay, but consider that the express is also used for the Christmas and Easter holidays. Since the castle is almost empty for Christmas, let's say 80% of the student population. For Easter, let's go with the same number. So the total number of student riders the HE has in a year for beginning/end of term and the holidays is: 280/(2+2/.8+2*.8...) which comes to 1456.

For a total of 3000 pasties produced per year, you just need to have an average of 2 pasties consumed per rider, per ride for it to work out. Setting aside Ron-types who can eat a half dozen just on the ride there, I imagine there's a lot of people who eat and take one to go, since they aren't served at hogwarts itself.

Always wanted to do that.)

** Tom Marvolo Riddle was a stubborn person. Cruel, yes, and willing to harm others to reach his goals, but he was, above all, strong-willed.

Even a mere /fragment/ of his soul, of who he was /as a teenager/, should have been enough to overpower most adult wizards, let alone the mere child who first wrote into his diary.

But, even if he was a genius, the spell matrix that allowed his Horcrux to replay his memories, to communicate with other people, to /have a personality/, was not designed to cope with more than one, two people at the same time.

The older students were suspicious of the diary, of course, but their suspects were put to rest as the spell matrix broke down, worn off by the constant onslaught of minds and souls and the /mundane, *inane JOtTiNgS OF hOuSe H̺Ư͒͑͢f̴̴̪͛̒͗̀f̼̺̖͔̿̾͛̀l̷̰̃̓͘ͅE͎͍̗̲͙͊̓͂͘P̴͙͕̮̑̂̓̈́̾͢͠u͚̹̫̇F̗̌̊̃f͇̦͉͇*/.

The diary became quiescent, whatever personality it once displayed /gone/, but the Horcrux was still there - and with every brush of the fingers, with every tear falling on its pages, with every drop of ink soaking its paper, fragments of the contained souls left it.

Tom Marvolo Riddle was strong-willed, but not strong-willed enough to take over dozens of people.

And yet, the fragments of his soul lingered.

Not strong enough to control the children who interacted with him, but strong enough to influence them.

And even if Hufflepuff is known as the house of the duffers, of the underachievers, Hufflepuff is also the house of those who work hard. Who are loyal, who support each other. Who keep in touch after school. Who are patient.

Who can bide their time.

 

*Edit:* seeing the prompt I couldn't help but think of Wizard Lenin in /Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus/, but I didn't get far enough for the CommiePuffs to stage their revolution. They'll probably change their house colors at some point, though.
