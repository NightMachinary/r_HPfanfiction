My preferences are kind of weird, since I've read a lot of these already. Not a fan of runes or romance right away. Prefferably the original timeline or later, and prefferably an OC that isn't overpowered but is also pretty capable.


** Calista Snape series by Arinus on fanfic.net is pretty good! She is Snape and Bellatrix's daughter and goes through a realistic 7 years of school.

** Well, linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is technically Harry in name, but so different that she's effectively an original character. She's a careful planner and a natural academic, who is singlemindedly passionate about brewing potions, raised by both her parents, with Sirius and Remus being "uncles", and Sirius' son being as close as a brother. There was no war and there's no prophecy about her. However, since Tom Riddle went into politics instead, she faces legalised discrimination that canon Harry never did.

Book four recently finished, bringing the series to over 1.4 million words; book five is starting later this year. The plot is very clever about introducing canon-inspired elements taken in a whole new direction (eg the first flying lesson is significant for quite different reasons), expanding and explaining canon ideas (eg the Boggart in Defence class is used not just to teach the students how to deal with a Boggart, but how to deal with fear in general), while very much telling its own story rather than any kind of rehash.

** linkao3(Seven Devils by please_dont)

Not sure if you're into Tom Riddle fics but this one is my fave OC fic!! The main character is a Muggle from our modern time who has knowledge of the books and gets thrown into the HP world just before Harry starts at Hogwarts. Her main goal is to destroy Voldemort's horcruxes before he comes to power and she thinks they can use Tom Riddles diary for it.

It's a really slow build up to romance, I thought there wasn't even going to be any for a while but when it comes it's really good. Most of the focus is on the plot! I like that the main character doesn't try to change every little thing, she knows things and knows what to keep to herself and what to share. Also she doesn't have magic but is still badass I thought her character was awesome. Highly recommend!! It is a Tom redemption fic so he's not a psycho killer playing mind games, if that changes your opinion!

  “Are you implying that I am responsible for Voldemort's actions?” Dumbledore's voice had finally turned cold.“No, I'm saying you're responsible for neglecting a young boy! You treated him with nothing but suspicion and coldness, and when he grew up suspicious and cold you took that as confirmation that you were always right about him.”“I assume you have a reason for laying these heavy charges at my feet,” said Dumbledore quietly.She sighed. “I just think... maybe you should take your own advice and try to solve this problem with love, not destruction. You don't have to destroy a Horcrux. You can heal it.”“You speak of remorse,” Dumbledore didn't sound impressed. “If I may, I see very little chance of convincing Voldemort to feel empathy for the things he has done --”“Not Voldemort,” she interrupted. “Tom.”“You are suggesting that we use Voldemort's first Horcrux to reanimate sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle.” Dumbledore's tone left much to be desired.
