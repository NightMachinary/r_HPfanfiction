Some time ago I read a comment here that the most of Jesus's Miracles can be described with magic:

- healing people - charms;
- turning water into wine - transfiguration;
- food multiplication - charms;
- even raising dead can be explained like some advanced form of inferi;

Even miraculous conception can be explained by participation of some wizard with Obliviation (or something similar) afterwards.

Therefore it makes Jesus a very talented half-blood.

Not mentioning that Rowling herself consider Harry as sort of new Jesus of the Magical Britain.

What do you think?


** I think no one cared one whit about blood status 2000 years ago. That said, it'd take an extraordinarily talented wizard to interfere in his own conception. It'd be more accurate to wonder if John the Baptist was a wizard with a twisted sense of humor who pulled a fast one on Mary by seducing her, Confunding her and then using a charm to restore her hymen.

(Please note that Memory Charms were introduced in the late 1500's - early 1600's by Mnemone Radford, though I suspect that it was Perenelle Flamel using a pseudonym).

I dunno. We have very little data about what the ancient times of the Wizarding World were like; in some conceptions, wizards were instead even more sealed off from everyone else in those days, having set themselves up as castes of gods, such as the Olympians. (Demigods like Hercules being half-bloods in this scheme.)

**** In canon, there's no difference in capability between pureblood and half-blood wizards (unlike Percy Jackson, where the gods of old were actual Gods and not just wizards with reputations that sparked muggle creativity).

I think the difference between 'gods' and 'heroes' at the time was whether the child was raised by the wizard family to be taught how to leverage their powers, versus being left to grow up with muggles and only discovered their abilities by accident. If Zeus wasn't such an unapologetic nymphomaniac, they might have all been raised as 'gods'.

***** Sure, that was also my thinking. What gave you the impression that I thought otherwise? My only slight point of disagreement is that I don't think Zeus having so many darn kids was the only reason they weren't raised as Gods, though there probably /was/ that; I find it likely that even then, the "gods" favored children who were fully of the blood over half-"mortals".

The way we occasionally see gods like Zeus swooping in and granting the full "godhood and immortality" deal to demigods after they've lived a sufficiently heroic and admirable lives sounds to be a /lot/ like the way Death Eaters are prepared to accept half-bloods into their ranks if they prove themselves thoroughly enough (i.e. Snape).

*** Under "some wizard" I didn't mean Jesus himself üòä More like scenario you described.

Also while no one cared about blood status in the past, it doesn't mean we can't use it to classify wizards now as we're using races.

Especially because in the Canon the most powerful alive wizards are half-bloods.

*** That would be similarly impressive, since, according to the Biblical narrative, Jesus and John the Baptist were roughly the same age.

** Christ isn't a demi-god though, so the analogy doesn't follow through. Plus Lazarus returned from the dead in whole health, not as a corpse.

** This is going to be controversial.

Jesus could have been a wizard who use magic to perform "miracles" and thus claim to be the son of the Jewish God, inspiring an entire new religion centered on him that accidentally also ended up persecuting wizards after his death. Magic can plausibly accomplish most of the things he is known for.

If that's the case, there's no particular reason to say he's a halfblood instead of a Muggleborn or pureblood. Unless you're assuming a halfblood would be trained by their parent but a Muggleborn has to figure things out on their own, back before wizarding schools existed. I think an untrained or trained wizard could conceivably pull off those things, though, if they're particularly talented.

Or, Jesus could be what he claimed, and magic had nothing to do with him.

Or he could be as he claimed, but also a wizard, but his miracles were accomplished through divine power and he only used magic for little things like projecting his voice when preaching.

** Pretty much everything he did was pretty normal for wizards, yeah (For example, multiplying the bread and fish instead of conjuring it from nothing.)

His blood purity wouldn't really matter, I should think, the earliest depictions of him make far less emphasis on him as a divine being.

** Harry is very much Jesus

but I was thinking Jesus could actually be a Muggleborn

like, maybe not even himself would know it was Magic

*** It's very unlikely that he was a muggleborn. The conception happened without Maria's knowledge (or the knowledge was blocked/removed) and it looks like a wizard's work.

** Okay, since everyone here is pro- JC is a Half blood... I'll play as devils advocate and say no.

JESUS is PUREBLOOD. Heck if you want a step further... The Abrahamic God is a DARK LORD so JC must be a pure blood.

Dude... The Abrahamic God had children.. which are the Angelic of nature right? Angels are pure beings that will smite people at he word of God.. God ordered all the Nephilim or Half breeds to be killed. He cursed Job because of a bet with Lucifer. Sodom and Gomorrah, Sending Bears to Murder Children,helping Samson kill people for paying a debt. Killing people who complain that he keeps killing people. The tower of Babel. The Passover. Everything He Did to Job.

Don't get me started on Angels

+Raphael bound the demon's hands and feet, found a hole full of rocks, dumped him in it, and buried him alive in the desert 

+a peculiar tale of an angel of the lord (believed to be Uriel) getting sent to torment and essentially scare the foreskin off of Moses

+‚ÄúI am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. But now, because you did not believe my words... you will become mute, unable to speak, until the day these things occur.‚Äù  

+Uriel and his self-righteous posse were not at all happy that humans and angels were mating and producing a race of hybrid

+Archangel Samael- often referred to as an angel of death - decided to step in and actually intended to murder baby Jacob while still in his mother's womb

+This shit....‚ÄúAnd when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented from the calamity and said to the angel who was working destruction among the people, ‚ÄúIt is enough; now stay your hand.‚Äù And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.‚Äù

Do you really think he'll Let his Son and Heir be a Half breed... No! I think since Maria is Deified and is believed that when Mary was conceived, she was miraculously free of the taint of original sin thus chosen to be worthy of blessing of having JC it must mean that JC is a Pureblood.God sent the Holy Spirit down from heaven to plant His son directly into Mary's womb.
