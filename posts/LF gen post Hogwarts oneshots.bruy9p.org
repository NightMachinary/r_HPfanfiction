I'm that person who is sick of all that romantic fluffy stuff in fanfiction. I like canon but not JKR's attempts in romantic relationships. So. I want to read fics focused on other themes.

Give me your best genfics about post Hogwarts era, guys. Any plot as long as it well-written. If it's about Golden Trio, please only friendship, I'm not fan of Hr/R and H/Hr. Rest pairings are fine, just no slash. I really like minor characters.

Canon compliant is good, epilogue can be dropped.

  Once a week, every week, Dean Thomas allowed himself to pretend nothing had ever happened.

  It was funny to call it normal, but life can be funny sometimes: that was what Lavender had said, and Dudley, who knew he wasn't very clever, was bound to agree with her.

  Just how did a new translation of The Tales of Beedle the Bard by Hermione Granger make it into Muggle bookstores? Minerva McGonagall explains.

  All Harry has ever wanted is a family to call his own - but now, as he approaches fatherhood, he fears he may not be up to the task. Fortunately, there's someone to turn to.

** You should try reading Harry/Daphne, Harry/Ocs, and Harry/Susan based fanfiction. Some of them are very well written and slow burns that make them realistic

***** oh, I told about oneshots. I like almost all canon pairings (especially Hermione/Viktor, Fleur/Bill, Hermione/library haha). As for fanon, Ron/Luna, Ron/OC, Dramione. Hermione/Charlie, Hermione/OC. I can't remember all. Now I appreciate fics with no pairings)

** It's not post-hogwarts, but I have a mystery/action story that isn't romance-focused, but eventually develops a Harry/OC slow burn if you wanna check it out. :)

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable.
