As has happened already in these fics, Harry gets caught up in one of the Grail Wars of the FATE universe, and summons a servant. Except... the servant he summons is himself. A version of himself who is empowered by all of the myths and legends surrounding himself, and has all of the knowledge neccesary to steamroll most of Moldyshort's forces...

** Fictional was a awesome Fate crossover.

*** I liked it. But I liked the one where he summons Lancelot more.

** Why would Voldemort even need to be a factor. The Fate series has so many more threatening THINGS ( from characters to powers to concepts and implications) in it that it would be so much more fun to see an ignorant (mby Isekied) Harry have to deal with all that even with an overpowered servant. Mby make the servant all knowing and all powerful, but only concerning Wizard magic, and not Magecraft (but he is still so overpowered that he can easily contend with noble Phantasms and all those world shattering implications that Fate has).

*** Honestly this would probably end up as a crack fic. Got talking to someone and decided that the funniest person for Voldemort to summon would be Kiyohime.
