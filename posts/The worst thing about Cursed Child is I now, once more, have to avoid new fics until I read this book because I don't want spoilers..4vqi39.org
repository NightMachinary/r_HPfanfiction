Anyone else doing this? Avoiding reading new stuff coming out because they haven't been able to read CC for whatever reason?

****** Isn't that the goal to aim for? Making one's stories worth reading, I mean, not doing it wrong.

Although some would probably say that “doing it wrong” is still better than what Thorne managed to do, so ... yeah.

******** There are? I though the play scared them all and they all migrated north.

You learn something new every day, I guess.

Honestly though, I wasn't sure if it was a joke, but I did suspect it, so my previous reply wasn't entirely serious either. I'd tried to make it into a joke too, but as tired as I am now it ... well, kind of didn't happen. Maybe it'll get better tomorrow.

** I read a synopsis about CC, so I don't have that problem. But I /do/ avoid fanfics for other fandoms when I haven't caught up on a book or episode. It sucks because I love reading fanfiction, but I think of of it as, "Well, when I /am/ caught up the backlog will be pretty nice!"

** I dont really have an issue with "spoilers" from new stuff. mainly cuz they dont utilize the whole work, or if they did then its for a way the work has changed. For example, I read Red X Rising before watching the Teen Titans (mainly because I was going thru a rough time..) Red X Rising can arguably spoil a ton of TT. However the changes the fic makes moves the content enough so that I can watch the rest of the series.
