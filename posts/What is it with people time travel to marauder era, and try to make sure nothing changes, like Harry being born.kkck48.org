The person, just by being there, changed history. Talk to Lily, or James, do something even as minor as playing a prank or playing chess with either... Just standing in place ensures Harry isnt born. And even if James and Lily grt together and have a baby, it won't be Harry.


** I mean, yes any form of time travel would change /something./ But why would that something be Harry's birth? It could be anything. Time travel to the Marauders era could create a situation where, idk, Snape learns to wash his hair. Nothing to suggest it specifically has to be the existence of Harry Potter that changes, even if we accept the butterfly effect and not an established time loop as how time travel works in canon (and PoA pretty much indicated that time travel in canon is the loop theory).

** It is the most canon compatible way to write time travel. The principles in PoA seem to be :-

- You can't change anything the traveller has knowledge of (e.g. H/Hr don't try to prevent Pettigrew's escape).
- The traveller's actions have already occurred on the first iteration (e.g. the patronus driving off the dementors by the lake) so the butterfly effect doesn't apply.

I agree it is very hard to write well for long range time travel, the protagonist ends up looking very passive and cynical.

*** Or, alternatively, those are just things Hermione makes Harry do in order to avoid "terrible things happen to wizards that [play around with time, Harry]".

If that was all time travel in HP could actually do, Hermione's warning would be pointless. This is especially true if you see it as a loop... which a lot of people do.

And thus we find the Cursed Child where Albus would've caused time to be unfixable had he not been travelling with a character who happened to exist in one of the new presents.

Hermione's warning is still valid if time travel is deterministic. If you go back in time to kill someone who is definitely still alive, then you /will/ fail somehow. It could be as simple as spraining your ankle, or you could trip over and break your neck.

**** *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly%20effect][Butterfly effect]]*

In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state. The term butterfly effect is closely associated with the work of Edward Lorenz. It is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as a distant butterfly flapping its wings several weeks earlier. Lorenz discovered the effect when he observed runs of his weather model with initial condition data that were rounded in a seemingly inconsequential manner.

** Let's start out with a simple fact: if time travel is possible (nothing suggests it is and rather a lot suggests it isn't), we don't know how it'd work. As a certain recent movie claims... "either it's all a joke or none of it is".

So... let's move, instead, to what might be a rule of thumb when it comes to writing: only put something in there if you know what you're going to do with it.

If we take the butterfly effect literally, you can't know what it's going to do. How, then, do you actually write the butterfly effect into your story? You can't just introduce changes because maybe it's not the butterfly effect... maybe it's the case that you've time travelled to a different point in the timestream of a parallel universe. And how do your characters know something is a change and not something they just failed to observe the first time around?

The closest I've ever encountered to that is Looper, which does this very, very weird thing where the time traveller's memories are changed by the actions he takes in the past. I can't think of a single other (even in HP fanfiction) version of time travel where that sort of thing happens. But the problem with this is that, implicitly, your character's personality and identity are going to be unstable as they interact with the world. You're effectively using time travel to write a story about brainwashing... where the main character is brainwashing themself and it's never going to be fixable. And then you get the bigger problem... paradoxes: unless somehow the time traveller always ends up with a new reason to have travelled to the past. And voila... now you're just writing Memento.

The butterfly effect sounds really cool, but how do you actually use it? I mean, outside of "one character believes in it but another one doesn't and they argue about it" as done in The Last Continent (a Discworld novel... which actually sort of has that memory thing as well, "was that thousands of years ago last week?").

Far easier, indeed, just to go with predictable changes and the decaying relevance of future knowledge as those changes mount. And, sure, some might say the butterfly effect is this but, um, they'd be wrong.

*** The butterfly effect exists because it can't not.

- If time is deterministic, then the rogue element that is the time traveller creates an effect in the deterministic timeline that creates differences through its existence alone. air is displaced. mass energy increases. that sort of thing. differences create differences. butterfly effect achieved.

- If time is non-deterministic, then events which are random and have equal probabilities of occuring won't happen the same way as before (theoretically, they could, but the likelyhood is too miniscule to be relevant). Differences are created. Difference and chance create more difference. butterfly effect achieved.

The only way the butterfly effect is subverted is assuming some sort of higher power that insures the integrity of the timeline, which is bogus from a scientific perspective. It's called "god did it", and would get you laughed out of any scientific institution.

Means: time travel isn't real. Or, more exactly, if time travel is possible, we can't know how it'd work since we can't figure out how it is possible (let alone how to do it).

Moreover, if you were right in your conclusions, the butterfly effect exists regardless. Nothing you say is actually contingent on time travel. The question, then, is what is the state of our understanding of the butterfly effect outside of time travel? To which I'd charge... as far as I know, God does play dice with the universe. Of course, you have a statement for that:

#+begin_quote
  (theoretically, they could, but the likelihood is too miniscule to be relevant)
#+end_quote

Are you familiar with the idea that life was created by chance? One resolution to the idea is that life given the rules of the universe (whatever they actually are) had a probability of 1. You're sort of taking the other position... that we live in a fundamentally unlikely world and, yet, here we are in it.

(There's also a problem with independence but let's gloss over that.)

The simple reality is that I'm not talking about the real world. Even if we were to take the absurd suggestion that the chance is too small to be relevant, what we're actually engaging with is the notion of /why would an author incorporate the Butterfly Effect?/ The plausibility of any given circumstance isn't relevant to the artistic merits of those circumstances *in most situations* and/or *to most authors*. Even I think it's ridiculous and I routinely use pseudo-random processes to assign sexualities to side characters or come up with (admittedly usually binary) genders for the same.

** I remember an awesome fanfic about time-travel. Harry hides in the Forbidden Forest, people think he's a squib, he works at the pub for Aberforth.

He constantly panics about changing the timeline. /Constantly./ Even after he kills an important Death Eater, he still goes into panic attack about how the world will end because of it. Like, seriously, fuck off. It really sucked, because the fic was very well written imo, and the author just ruined it about gravitating around this pointless gimmick. I don't know if things change in the narrative eventually, I gave up on it.

*** I know the fic you're talking about, I think. And yeah, it was frustrating to the extreme.

Imo this plot could be done beautifully. Imagine a time travel fic where everything that can reasonably be altered is altered. death eaters are replaced with golems. Spells are faked, victims are saved and sent into witness protection. The story (and charade) ends when the time travellers have caught up to their moment of departure, and instantly dismantle the illusion they've carefully maintained until then.

This would prompt some major existential questions. Did they really live in an illusion before they went back the first time? Was anything they did before real? is anything /now/ real, or simply a second, bigger illusion, created by their future selves acting in the background right now?

** There's more than one theory about time travel. In POA he sees himself cast a Patronus and thinks it's his dad.

It's quite possible that the canon we see is the result of Harry having gone back - perhaps he tries to hide his dislike of Peter, but in an environment where everyone was suspicious of each other it was actually the reason Peter gives in to the Death Eaters. Since Harry's appearance in the past comes first chronologically, either the 'alternate' time line never occurs or no-one remembers the original.

Quite possibly, Lily and James name Harry after Harry.

Another theory is that universes diverge with every decision, so the world splits apart from his time line when he appears/a significant enough change happens. The world Harry was born in exists in a parallel plane and so he continues to exist but is not born again.

Alternatively, time is deterministic and whatever happens was going to happen regardless; it just appears that people have free will. Harry's sperm wins because it was always going to win.

**** By all means, enjoy fics where everything changes but people who keep fics consistent with the canon aren't being nonsensical.

The examples above are of ontological paradoxes; I didn't invent them. The butterfly effect isn't the only theory regarding time travel. Although I did spend a headspinning amount of time learning about it in philosophy and ethics lessons at schools.

In any case, the laws of magic don't allign with real world physics. Further, time travel AUs are break the rules of the magical canon.

After all, it's no more mad than fixed time events in Doctor Who.
