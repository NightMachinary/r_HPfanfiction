Could be that its crouch jr. That is under contract, as the goblet cant possible read (and the whole intent thing)

Perhaps Harry decides that Dragons are BS, and kills that beast as the only sane option.

Rescues Hermione from the lake, because seriously why would Ron be the most missed thing that year?

Or even more insane ridiculous stunts (especially a Harry that doesnt take it seriously, as he isnt a "real" champion

*** Yeah, Ron is a great friend, but with the fallout of their spat until the first task, Hermione might easily have taken the top spot as most important person. Yeah i prefer stories where he befriends the dragon instead, but killing the "evil" dragon might be a big hassle, making problems for the ministry, or be a way to show how Harry is way over his head and is forced to resort to drastic measures.

***** He might be, i doubt he got over it that quickly though. Besides Hermione is loyal and has pretty much always been there for him. Pretty sure she should be much more important than Ron. There is also the fact Harry has discovered hormones, that might make Hermione a better choice too :P And if he shows up with Ron, people might think him gay. All good reasons for Harry to see Ron and Hermione under the water, be confused over why Ron is there, and then just rescue Hermione

How are they wrong? Lol. One is arguing an opinion. The other is arguing what actually happens in the books.

It is established in get books, even while Ron isn't speaking to him, that Harry /prefers/ Ron. Harry Potter isn't killing an innocent dragon. Harry /was/ over everything that happened between him and Ron by the time the second task started. Hell, he was over it when Ron came to apologize.

Oh yes, Harry would kill the Dragon if he sees no other option - he would use the AK if that is what it takes to stay alive!

  [COMPLETE] Harry has been entered in the Triwizard Tournament, but during the shouting match with Ron he realises that he doesn't actually have to risk his life and look like a fool in front of everyone - he really only needs to show up for each task and make a token effort.
