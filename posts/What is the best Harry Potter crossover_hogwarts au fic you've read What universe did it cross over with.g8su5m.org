** I haven't finished it, but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12307781/1/Heroes-Assemble][Heros Assemble!]] has got to be one of my favorite fics ever. It's a post-hogwarts marvel crossover and holy crap is it long 603k words 128 chapters and is complete!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens]]

Author does an excellent job of bringing a very different Harry into Hogwarts, and raising the villain's power levels to compensate for a Astartes Inquisitor in Power Armor. And most importantly, the author just ~gets~ the Glorious Imperium of Man.

Excerpt - " There was a dangerous glint in Carrow's eyes. "The Inquisition is always needed," he snarled, "our work is never done. If there isn't a threat from an outside force then there is the threat from within, of the mutant, the heretic, those tainted by ruinous powers...it never ends.."

He pointed at Faulks with one large finger, the ruby eyes of the ugly skull ring glinting in the autumnal sunlight, "...and you, boy, have the mentality, the potential to join our ranks" "
