** I don't think so, maybe prophecies depend on the situation and the people present who will hear it ?

The first one : Was made in the presence of Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape, 2 people who played a big role in it being fulfilled

The second one : Was made in the presence of Harry, even if he didn't understand it at the time he did play a big role in Wormtail joining his master.

** Causality is an interesting thing when you include fate, isn't it?

If there is a fate, then the prophecy needed to be heard, and as such Snape needed to be there. If he hadn't been there, it would have been uttered in some other context, where someone else could relay the words to Voldemort.

But the way it's presentend in Canon, the entire point of the story is that there is no such thing as fate, only people that believe in it. And hence the prophecy only matters because Voldemort thinks it does. He is utterly free, and could have reigned supreme for all eternity, but for being trapped by his own mind. Using this meta knowledge, it seems likely the prophecy would have been uttered all the same, even if literally no one was around.

And yet: What if fate works such that the very fact that some believe in it, and others don't, is already baked into its inner workings? And what is fate but inevitable events, regardless of /why/ they happen?

The Greeks had a curious definition of fate: The inability to escape your own shadow. They called it Hamartia: What determines your path is not celestial outside forces, but rather your own nature. You can't stop being who you are, and hence Voldemort, despite being free, never had the chance to do anything else than what he did. And likewise Harry, who was similarly free to walk away, was never going to, because his very nature demanded he be the one to kill Voldemort and avenge his parents. And thus are set in motion the events that were not destined by anyone or anything, and also never not going to happen.

I'll leave the rest to your philosophical musings.

** Yes, she would have, because the Hall of Prophecies is full of "dead" prophecies that never came true or whose circumstances were never fulfilled. It is, supposedly, a coincidence that the conditions were correct for Trelawney's prophecy to be carried out. The only real weight the prophecy had on the plot was that Voldemort believed in it. We are told, repeatedly, that like Oedipus, the only reason any part of the prophecy came true is because one of the parties involved in it (Voldemort) took it seriously. Dumbledore, I am pretty sure, even directly uses the term "self-fulfilling prophecy."

What I'm about to say isn't really canon, but it is something that is logical given what we know is canon. A true prophecy seems to definitely be something that CAN happen. A true prophecy will never describe events or scenarios that are impossible. However, just because a true prophecy describes a real and plausible outcome for the future, does not mean that this will definitely be the outcome that occurs. Some prophecies happen because the people involved try to avoid making it happen (like Oedipus). Some prophecies DON'T happen because the people involved try to MAKE it happen. Some prophecies never happen, they just get recorded automatically and sit on a shelf somewhere forever, and whether anyone hears about them or cares does not really matter.

So tl;dr, yes, Trelawney would have given the prophecy irrespective of whether or not Snape was lurking outside the door. The fact that Snape was there was entirely coincidental to the plot. If it had not been him, then it is entirely possible that Voldemort could have learned it from somebody else, like Pettigrew, or that Voldemort could have ended up fulfilling his portion of the predicted sequence of events entirely blind.

*** I suppose for me it's more a question of how much control destiny, fate, and prophecy has over free will and choice. Basically, did the circumstances that followed from the prophecy being verbalized need said verbalization to bring them into existence, or would they (or something similar) have happened regardless of their utterance?

**** I guess it depends whether the prophecies are completely self-fulfilling and depend on the people hearing them and acting accordingly (whether trying to fulfill them or avoid them) or they are full-proof and one way or the other lead to the prophesied destiny, or if the are 'sentient' enough that they are always given in a way that they might be self-fulfilled.

If the latter, I can imagine Trelawney (or even a different Seer!) might have give in at another time allowing for someone to relay it to Voldemort, or Dumbledore, while acting with the best intentions, would unintentionally cause it to leak/put suspicion on Potters/Longbottoms and cause Voldemort to attack them anyway.

I personally like the interpretation that the prophecies can, in theory, be avoided - but that would essentially require a Seer speaking it to themselves and noone else knowing about it, because the knowledge itself will always cause people to act a bit differently or make a different decision at some point.

**** I actually have a similar headcanon about how prophecies work. Prophecies are heard by those who have the power to (directly or indirectly) bring about the events they describe. They actually end up being fairly similar to how the closed loops of time turner's work. Seers "see" the future, then give a prophecy to those who will make that future real.

** I think because of the nature of prophecies it would have still been made, but it would have been fulfilled differently.

Like Voldemort could have just decided to target the Potters because they were working against him, and since they fit the parameters of the prophecy Harry would have been marked as his equal without Voldemort having any forewarning.

**** Maybe this is a scenario where Neville ends up as the subject of the prophecy. Although since Snape is still privy to some plans he could still find out Voldemort is planning a raid at the Potter's house only this time they don't have fidelius protection, so he he still begs for her life and/or goes to Dumbledore to help her so she still has the opportunity to sacrifice herself for Harry.

** Snape was always going to be there, because the Harry Potter universe is completely deterministic, as proved by Time Turners. Prophecy's don't themselves cause events, but predict them. A universe in where Snape isn't there means a universe with a differ prophecy, or maybe no prophecy at all.

** Nope, because it wouldn't have come to pass, then. Prophecies are tricky and weird - they rely on the situation they are spoken in in order to come true - but they aren't random; they're the definition of deterministic. If there is no real way for the prophecy to come true (i.e. if the writer doesn't reach into ridiculousness) then ergo it would never be spoken.

** Personally, I think it wouldn't have, or at least shouldn't have (the whole "massive chamber filled to the brim with unfulfilled prophecies" thing throws a wrench in this interpretation): I like to think that prophecies in the HP verse work on a "they'll only get made once they're more or less set in stone" basis )(so for instance, if you flip a coin, a prophecy couldn't say whether it would land on heads or tails, but after you've flipped it, it could tell you on which it land/ed/, even if the prophet doesn't know).

By the time Trelawney began the prophecy, Aberforth was (in this interpretation) already en route to discover Snape eavesdropping, he arrived at just the right time for Snape to hear enough to identify the subject, but not in time to warn Voldemort about "mark him as his equal," Snape, a loyal Death Eater, would obviously relay what he'd heard to Voldemort, who was always going to act on the prophecy, see a bit of himself in Harry, and choose him as iys subject because of that. Upon realising that Voldemort intended to go after his old friend's family, Snape would of course beg Voldemort to spare her, Voldemort would agree if only to keep a useful servant happy, Snape naturally wouldn't be stupid enough to rely on /Voldemort/ not murdering a muggleborn when given an opportunity and all the reason in the world, so of course he'd go to Dumbledore for extra insurance, and so on and so forth until Voldemort ultimately dies at his own hand, the final victim of his hubris.

** By the traditional definition of Divination, it refers to art of seeking answers from external forces... be them gods, fate, nature, inner eye, whatever. If we go by the traditional definition, we could assume that fate decided to play a trick on Voldemort and have him send Snape to spy on Dumbledore that very day. Actually my headcanon was that since killing is a great violation of the laws of nature and he had killed so many by then, it was the universe's way of punishing him by having Snape spy on Dumbledore the very day Trelawney's inner eye decided to open but Aberforth showed up in time so that Snape wouldn't hear the whole prophecy. I think that an unexplained divine punishment would be in line with the themes that appear throughout the story.

However since JK never provided any explanation, we cannot really know what she was thinking. But that's the beauty of it... we can make whatever we want out of it.
