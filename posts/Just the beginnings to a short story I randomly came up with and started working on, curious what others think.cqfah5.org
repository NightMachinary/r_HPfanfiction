It was the year 2000, willow Smith of Slytherin, was opening her presents. She sat under the tree with 5 other 11 year old girls from her house. The fire was ablaze keeping the air warm but the stone floor was still cold so they all sat on pillows wrapped in blankets for extra comfort in the morning.

Willow opened her present and shrieked with delight, she'd be begging her parents for one of these for so 2 years!

The other girls looked at her then at the box in her hand and all had a look of confusion except one, Brittney, I am better then everyone else, Balon. She was half blood, not all Slytherins accepted her but a lot more then those who accepted muggle borns. Her mother was atleast a pureblood.

"I had a furby when I was 9, they are so lame now" she sneered, and reached into her blanket wrapped around her "why would you want that stupid babies toy when we have these. Wingaurdium leviosa."

The box flew out of Willows hands and she quickly jumped out of her blanket trying to grab it, Brittney waved her wand around keeping the toy dancing just out of reach.

The girls all laughed, Willow pulled out her wand and hit the box, it opened upside down and the furby fell on her head.

Willow picked up her new present and ran for the stairs, running pass the flytherins commons room to the nearest bathroom. She almost knocked down Jared on her way entering the hallway but was too upset to talk or apologize. She just kept running.

In the bathroom in the stall, just in her pajamas, willow sat tears falling down her face but still smiling at the furby. She pulled out the tab stopping the batteries from connecting and turned it on.

Sparks flew and Willow jumped throwing the toy against the door, it fell out and under. As she opened the stall she saw a girl in a robe with blue. She recognized the girl as Penelope Waters a first year from Ravenclaw.

"Are you okay? I heard you scream" Penelope asked as she bent down to pick up the furby for Willow.

"Yeah I'm fine, just scared me. The toy must have broke when it fell out of the box" willow replied glumly whipping the last of the tears away trying to look strong infront of this other girl from a rival house.

"Well it probably wasnt broken before but with all the magic around us turning it on would have fried it forsure!" Penelope said turning it over and reaching behind her ear where Willow just noticed a 9 1/2 inch wand was sitting half covered by her beautiful blond hair. She said a spell Willow didnt recognize and the screws popped up.

"What are you doing?" Willow demanding reaching for the Furby, she was to slow though because Penelope took a step back and then started pacing the bathroom while looking at the wiring. Willow repeated herself now feeling upset people keep taking her stuff "what are you doing with my Furby, you're breaking it?!"

Penepole didnt even look up, just replied between spells she was mumbling "I'm fixing it, magic breaks electronics, my brothers have been working on a way to get electronics to work here since they started in 95 and their gameboys exploded. They taught me a few spells, and we got a TV, and a playstation in the Ravenclaw lounge. right now they are working on their new playstation 2. It's really cool and the spells make an AI that you can play games against that learns how you play and gets harder as you go."

Penelope looked up and held out the Furby, it looked as good as new, the eye lids opened, and the furby turned a little to face willow and said "I'm Furby, who are you?"

"Wow, I thought they just talked gibberish!" Exclaimed Willow to Penelope before turning to the furby and replying "I'm Willow"

"They dont, I think it must be the spells that allow electronics?" Penelope replied looking at it "I have one but havent turned it on since I brought it, the gibberish can be annoying."

The furby turned in her hands and looked at Penelope "I'm annoying?"

"Oh no, I didnt mean you, I am so sorry" she said flustered then looked at Willow "maybe I can go set mine up and they can have a play date, and we can hang somewhere outside of the bathroom"

They both looked around the room awkward, Willow nodded and they left to head to Ravenclaws common room.

To be continued (possibly if I'm not to lazy)

*** It could be that if you want it to be, I just picked a random name, Smith is just a generic muggle name and I wanted to give her an S last name because she is in Slytherin.

This was all very much written on the spot
