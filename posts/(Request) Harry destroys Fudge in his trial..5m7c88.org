Just finished an abandoned fic about an extremely old Harry from the distant future. Many chapters had this Harry preparing to a level where it looked like Fudge would be lucky if he wasn't impeached.

We'll never know cause the fic is abandoned just before Harry's trial, so wondering if I can get some closure elsewhere?

Edit 1: The abandoned fic was Destiny Done Right by AlthosHol.


** It wasn't at the trial but as a consequence of it: linkffn(A Bad Week at the Wizengamot by DisobedienceWriter). Harry is convicted, his wand snapped; and everything went downhill from there.

  What would have happened if Harry had been convicted by the Wizengamot after defending himself from dementors before his fifth year at Hogwarts? Humorous! Followup stories on Sirius Black plus Cornelius Fudge's attempt at becoming a dark lord.

*** That was awesome. I liked his calm "if it all goes wrong I guess I could just effortlessly kill everyone in the room" attitude.

  Harry Potter sacrificed everything for the world and it all amounted to nothing. Now in his final moments will Destiny take pity on an old man without hope? Fate had her turn. Now it's time for Destiny to show everyone how it's done right. Will you try again Harry Potter? Will you save them all or let history repeat itself?

** I want to read one where Harry isn't from the future, or has some secret powers, or anything, but still utterly breaks the trial just by asking tricky questions and making troublesome observations.

Like 'But Minister, the dementors have disobeyed orders before. Remember how they attacked the Quidditch match at Hogwarts en masse a couple of years ago?'

And 'But didn't you use a dementor to have Moody's imposter Kissed before he could be identified or questioned about Cedric?'

I don't know how to write Fudge, but maybe I should try. Harry mocking the idea that Barty Crouch Jr. didn't die in Azkaban but was kept under Imperius by his father for 14 years before inexplicably escaping, overpowering a retired Auror, managing to masquerade as him for a whole year and keeping his father under Imperius in turn for half that time, all for an elaborate scheme to get Harry to touch a portkey Triwizard Cup to take him to a graveyard for...um.

Really, what was Fudge thinking? A double kidnapping, a murder, and he has the only accomplice in their grasp Kissed and the only witness publicly vilified?

Maybe instead I should try something where Harry refuses to go to the Ministry on the grounds that Fudge has obviously been Imperiused by Malfoy since the end of the last school year. Hence the witness-silencing-and-vilifying.
