Ignoring the few stories were Harry himself goes into Ravenclaw then the house tends to have very few characters involved in stories. Luna doesn't count, she's an oddball by all accounts but pairing wise we see very few Ravenclaws. For Slytherin I've seen and read, Harry/Daphne, Harry/Tracey Harry/Pansy and I've seen a fair few Harry/Hufflepuff tales. I think I've seen maybe one or two Lisa Turpin pairings. What are your thoughts on why?

My thoughts are that Ravenclaw as a house is fundamentally boring. They like books. That's not something you can really write a story around and if it is you have, for better of for worse, Hermione lingering in that void. Cleverness isn't restricted to Ravenclaw either, its a house where being clever is the end goal not a means to an end. Slytherin girls are often written as intelligent (sometimes far too much) but being in Slytherin opens up opportunities for conflict within that house and the school in a way Ravenclaw just doesn't.

What are you thoughts on the relative lack of Ravenclaws in Fanfiction and/or do you have an stories featuring them?


** Wherever Harry ends up is where he will be having most of his interactions realistically speaking you'll see people in your own house way more then others especially with how divided the houses are. I mean Harry actually dated a Ravenclaw in canon which was Cho Chang. Off the top of my head the only Ravenclaw females I can think of are Luna and Cho which is certainly the problem. It's not really the house that's the problem there just isn't much to go off of you'd damn near be creating OC's. The lack of Ravenclaws isn't even a problem only in fanfiction we barely see them in canon. The same goes for the other houses that aren't named Gryffindor.

** IIRC, on Pottermore, Ravenclaws are described as the opposite of boring. They're more about quirkiness and individuality, and value learning new interesting stuff and experimentation over getting good grades grades and reading lots of books. This would make the quintessential Ravenclaw someone who doesn't particularly care about what other people think of them, or external judgment scales like grades, and just does them and what makes them happy, and likes exploring and discovering new things. So basically, luna is the ideal ravenclaw.

We never really find out enough about Cho or Marrieta to see how they handle school work, but they clearly care at least somewhat about the actual stuff they're learning, otherwise why wouldn't they just do Umbridge's assignments and get good grades rather than join an illicit study group? I think a story about a ravenclaw would make for a good mad scientist plot, or a ravenclaw who is really interested in how magic works and discovers the core system of magic and revolutionizes the Wizarding world, sending it into a kind of magic renaissance.

I think there's a lot of material to work with in regards ravenclaw plots, but as it is we only know of school age class 3 claws, 2 of which aren't portrayed in the best of ways and 1 of which is written as an omniscient omnipotent God half the time, and a crazy ~lol I'm so random~ lunatic the other half. If you take into account adult ravenclaws however, you can extract a lot more information. I don't know anyone that would call flitwick a boring professor, if anything he seems to be the most fun teacher at hogwarts. And Lockhart, for all of his flaws, would never be described as having a common personality.

tl;dr: Ravenclaws are the opposite of bookish boring nerds, I have way too many thoughts about them and accidentally wrote an essay.

** I think the main reason for not pairing Harry up with Ravenclaws besides Luna is that the two girls who got most "screentime" in canon were Cho and Marietta, and neither is depicted as very sympathetic. Also you already have Hermione if you want to pair Harry up with a brainy girl.

I never really thought all that much about the Ravenclaw characters so it's pleasantly suprising to read a fic that features them at all.

I think that Ravenclaw characters didn't come off well in the novels, Luna is of course a fantastic character but she was seemingly bullied by those in Ravenclaw house, which probably doesn't sit well with most people. Other Ravenclaw characters: Cho Chang, Marietta and Michael Corner all have mildly antagonistic relationships with some of the main characters.

** Studying.

Ravenclaw as a house is only as boring as the author writes it to be. Then again, thanks to tropes and the like, houses (with the exception of Gryffindor and Slytherin of course) tend to not play a huge role in the story, but rather serve as a plot device to make the MC seem 'cool' or super progressive by either switching houses, uniting all the houses (of course) or just plain disregarding any and all tradition regarding houses.

Read a Ravenclaw!Harry fic if you want them to be acknowledged :P

** Yes you can! They don't just "like books" (and even if they did: It's probably books about magic that the 'claws like the most, sure many of them might pleasure read, too (stuff like us reading HP or Star Wars novels etc.)), they like KNOWLEDGE (!)

I mean it wouldn't be out of character for a Ravenclaw to look into dark magic out of intellectual curiousity (!) or to challenge the ministry deffinition of dark magic (who are they to judge what magic is dark? I mean you can kill with a levitation charm or with a cheering charm etc. it's the intent that makes something dark IMHO!)

People just seem to prefer Slytherin (because of the potential for conflict that you mentioned) or because Draky-Poo (Sorry, I hate Draco - that damned ponce literally gets away with murder and I've seen people like him do the same in RL (I've been bullied at school by people like him!) and I absolutely hate it!) is in that house or because you can bring Snape in easier (he's after all their head of house!) etc.

Gryffindor is a given (canon Harry and a lot of characters close to him are or were in that house!)

As for the Puffs? A lot of people like them because they seem to be the friendly underachievers who had their one bright star (Cedric Diggory!) murdered by Voldemort...what people often forget is that the 'puffs are a cruel lot as well (they loved wearing Draco's badges and they also shunned Harry the supposed heir of Slytherin!), quite unlike what the hat says (fair and open minded indeed!)

I'd love more Ravenclaw Harry fictions (I myself am either Ravenclaw or Slytherin in house tests, so I like those houses best - no, I am not tailoring my answers on tests especially for that, it's who I am! I am an ambitious bookworm...sadly it's not educational books, I prefer reading for pleasure!)

** I see Ravenclaw as the House of learning. People who go there want to learn. They have no ambition to take over the world/magical Britain, their morals are not strong enough to justify Hufflepuff but they do not think that the end does justify the means like in Slytherin.

If you go for tropes you could do the marriage contract thing with Padma Patil (whether she gets a contract with Harry or tries to avoid one her parents want).

The superiority of muggle society and morales could be done with Penelope or any minor character instead of Hermione.

Of course, there's little we know about anything besides what the books say (and sometimes that makes little sense) therefore the author can always tailor Ravenclaw to meet his needs. Ravenclaw can be the House of bullies, the house of learning, the house that actually thinks, or have it as framework for their plot. It works good with obscure but not necessarily evil magic.
