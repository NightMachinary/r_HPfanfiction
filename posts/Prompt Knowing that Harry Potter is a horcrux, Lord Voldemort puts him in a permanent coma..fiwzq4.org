Somehow, I cannot see Lord Voldemort risking his horcrux's wellbeing by allowing him to be a Death-Eater ( which is a hazardous job according to canon) if Harry agrees to join him; and canon Harry is too dangerous ( for Tom) to roam about freely and canon Harry will in all probability attempt suicide when he finds out that he is keeping Voldemort alive.


** I've read a few fics in which Voldemort puts Harry into a coma, though they all have Harry inevitably waking up:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/832559/][Keep Your Enemies Closer]] - Voldemort strikes early to win the war and take his horcrux captive. He puts Harry into a coma soon after, but something forces Voldemort's hand and he allows Harry to wake up. linkao3(832559)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17604014/][Mine]] - Voldemort captures Harry and puts him into a long sleep filled with lucid dreams that they occasionally share. Harry finds that he can only interact with the real world when someone says his name. linkao3(17604014)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18851794/][Mi Aedijekit]] - Thousands of years after being drugged with Draught of Living Death, Harry wakes up to a technomagically advanced future in which nothing is familiar. linkao3(18851794)

  Voldemort conquers wizarding Britain and discovers his human horcrux. Harry is allowed to live under the new regime. Attending a darker version of Hogwarts, he struggles with vengeful classmates, a strange connection to Dark Marks, and worst of all, Tom Riddle whispering inside his head. AU dystopia. Story is mostly gen, though praised for its gradual platonic intimacy between the two arch-enemies.One reviewer says of KYEC: I just found this story a couple of days ago, and I'm thoroughly gripped by it. I could barely stop reading in between chapters, but had to, of course, since your tale is already so deliciously long. The plot is thrilling and well thought-out, and your characterisations are spot-on.

  The liquid flowed thickly down his throat. It tasted of tainted honey and carried the ineffable weight of centuries down with it, until they hung heavy beneath his ribs and drowned his lungs in ice crystals.Harry Potter and Voldemort, and the inevitable baggage of a millenium. (alternatively)The fine art of historical revisionism.(No longer updating quickly due to grad school re-commencing. Slowly adding hand-drawn title images to already-posted chapters.)

** I think that happens somewhere in the abandon/reclaim series? I'm pretty sure I stopped reading it because it was developing gaslighting tones, where Voldemort was infecting Harry's dreams. Harry was kidnapped and dreaming continuously (read: not allowed to wake up for months on end) and Voldemort was abusing the mind-link between them.
