I know this is probably asked on here every day, but I've just finished “Sarcasm and Slytherin” on AO3, and even though it wasn't the best Slytherin story I've ever read, it made me want more. I would prefer it not be time travel, and definitely no slash or multi pairings. I will read dark Harry, though over the top evil Harry should be avoided at all costs. I would also prefer he be powerful in the story. He doesn't have to be super powerful or anything, but I would rather not read stories where he's as incompetent as in canon.

As the title suggests, I am preferably looking for long stories that are well written. Oh, and before anybody recommends “Harry Potter and The Prince of Slytherin” I've already read it twice.

Thank you in advance.

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

  Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with snakes in the garden, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing that's happened to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. [Fem!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, AU Retelling]

** I'm in the middle of reading this series where Harry is resorted into Slytherin. He steadily grows in competence and power, but at a realistic pace, and it's very well-written and thought out. The author has quite a lot of fics along these lines that I've enjoyed. Check it out:

** From the same author of Sarcasm and Slytherin (actually i like this story better than SS) but the downside is that i think she plan it as a series but is just the first year for now... but is so good give it a try please [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13893606/chapters/31970736]]

This one is more of a fluff with a bit of angst(? Is a series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/906288]]

*** Apparently, sunmoonandstars has closed her AO3 account, thus orphaning her works (Souls Touch and the Sarcasm and Slytherin series). Stories are still there, but I guess S&S is now officially abandoned, and Souls Touch will never get the promised sequels.
