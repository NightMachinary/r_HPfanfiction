Hey I am looking for fic where Harry is a royal or imperial member. I would like him to take over eventually but it's not needed. It can also just be him as a lord or duke. What I am really looking for is political intrigue and magic maybe even some Romance. If Harry has to build back up his lands that's ok too. Please help me if you can.


** Your flair should be Request, not Recommendation. Recommendation is you recommending something. You will probably get more responses if you change to Request.

  Voldemort's attempt at possessing Harry had a different outcome when Harry fought back with the "Power He Knows Not". This set a change in motion that shall affect both Wizards and Muggles. AU after fifth year: Featuring a darkish and manipulative Harry
