** I am ashamed to mention linkffn(11396276) (and yes, it is completely NSFW and pure lemon), but that's basically it (actually, Harry was not a natural girl, just a “victim” of a curse).

More non-porn and more gentle is linkffn(13285012), but that's a femslash Harmony.

  When Harry wakes up one morning to find himself suddenly transformed into a beautiful girl, all hell breaks loose in Hogwarts. At least Ginny doesn't seem to mind. Harry x Ginny, fem!Harry x Ginny, femslash, gender bender, and much lesbian fun! Hermione x Luna (Moon Sage) established!

*** Thing is I think that's different because he is male just transformed by magic. This person was insisting that Harry was always female despite being continually referred to as male in the text. He is the boy who lived

I just found it very strange. Even going as far to say Ginny was bisexual as she loved dean Thomas a boy and And a girl Harry
