I would say that to probably feels like the best parts of slipping into a bed with fresh warm sheets on a cold night,Slipping into a hot bath,the feel on a cool breeze on a warm day,ect but even if that explanation falls short being something that person just has to feel for them selfs to understand.

And do you think that feeling ever goes away or does it feel just as good every time someone holds their wand?


** For the first time solving a maths problem that no one else in the world could solve, not because you're so much smarter than everybody else, but because the solution has to do with who you are and how you yourself think.

** This probably isn't all too relatable, but I'm trans, and I tried out a bunch of different names before settling on the one I'm now in the process of legally changing my name to. Some of those names felt better than others, but none of them felt quite right, even after a month or three of using them. The one I finally settled on, though, felt exactly right the moment I thought about it. I could tell it was me instantly, and it made me feel great just thinking about being called that.

I think wands are probably similar - the moment you take it, it feels like a part of you that you didn't even know was missing until you found it again.
