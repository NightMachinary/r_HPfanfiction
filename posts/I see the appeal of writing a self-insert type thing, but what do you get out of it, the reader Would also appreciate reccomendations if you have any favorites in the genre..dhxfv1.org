** This is my favourite fic that can be defined as a self-insert: linkffn(So How Can I Weaponize This?)

The key, I think, is to make it more detached from the actual plot. If the SI is an actual character, the work loses all coherence for me. With a different view on the plot, it makes an entirely different adventure running parallel to the canon one.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy

** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/better-living-through-magic-harry-potter-si.756754/]]

It's an SI going to Hogwarts during the mid/late 60's, so Voldemort's already out of school but the Mauraders are still just little kids (and won't start school until after the SI graduates). It's a slice-of-life/adventure story where the SI has his own adventures, and it does a lot to expand the worldbuilding of the HP universe.

** I have not found a good SI fic in the HP fandom. But I like the ones where a person is dropped into GoT and they then try to fix canon (usually through industrialisation). Because that's what a good SI should be about, trying to right the wrongs rather than try to hang out with character X or bang Y.

There is something very enjoyable in seeing the bad guys get thoroughly fucked because their secret plots are no longer secret. To read how Clegane's raiding party got shot by snipers before they could rape and burn their way through the Riverlands.

Edit for clarification: When I say fix canon through industrialisation, I mean that as in using some elements of the industrialisation, I mean use that as a force multiplier to change the balance of power. I am well aware that a single person could not do what happens in those fics. I've toyed with the idea of dropping Hermione into GoT and even through abusing transfiguration and her bookish curiosity, it is difficult to come up with a convincing plan to get that done. But the GoT SIs are still enjoyable because they take the reader along on a journey where the SI tries to improve the outcome of the books. Most are not really about saving the world but rather getting the tools to counteract the Lannisters.

For HP, it's a bit trickier because the SI has to learn magic. Their knowledge of the plot will not repel 100 dementors or save Harry from Voldemort.

Also, there is the matter of age. GoT SIs tend to be adults put into adults. For HP, you will probably need to insert the narrator into a child, which raises all sorts of questions and causes awkwardness even if the author mercifully forgoes a romance.

** I think it's a neat and very unique perspective you just can't find anywhere else. But there are many cliches, so these stories are usually cooler when there's a clever and creative twist of some sort.

Linkffn(scourgify) is quite funny and I really liked the MC in linkao3(rose petal red). There was also this one story where the SI knew HP through fanfiction instead of canon, but I don't remember the name.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?

** The times I've enjoyed an SI fic were because the perspective of the SI provides an interesting meta-commentary on the world they have become stuck in. When done well it's a bit like /A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court/, but hopefully without the imbalance of the SI's knowledge-level making all of the other characters look like cavemen in comparison.

I dont want romance hell I dont even want to be a part of this Voldemort mess. Dont want to go back to highschool no hogwarts for me.

Let me go explore the egyptian ruins, the world of the giants, see what other wizarding countries look like. Are wizarding colleges a thing? Love to see that. That sounds amazing.

linkffn(why time travel should be illegal and other morals) is the only one I've read in this particular fandom that comes to mind. I feel like there must be more but I can't recall them at the moment.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

** Well, I suppose it's as close you can get to feeling as if you were there yourself while reading a work of fiction. Sadly HP isn't a very good place for SIs, simply because it's hard to make them interesting - after all knowing the plot here would basically allow you to wrap things up fairly easily with minimal conflict. There are ways to deal with that issue, but they all run into their own set of problems that also require skill to deal with.

Examples: So how can I weaponize this - it focuses on humour more than anything else so it works - also good use of plot bunnies and characterisation that makes all the divergences kind of believable.

Umbrus Shade the incredibly annoyed Ravenclaw - good writing skills and a cast of OCs to prevent sticking too close to Canon work fairly well, although the MC ends up a Sue.

What's her name in hufflepuff - I think the best one I've read, unfortunately unfinished. A cast of OCs as well, great writing, and dealing with Canon problems in cautious yet effective and smart manner.

Better living through magic (on SB forum) - good worldbuilding, avoids Canon due to timeline. However it suffers from lack of any actual plot from that decision.

** My favorite SI is the one where an entity named "Jerry" gets stuck inside young Tom Riddle's head.

(Yes, cue in the Tom and Jerry joke.)

It's a silly story, really. The SI gives advice to young Tom on how to be a proper evil overlord based on the SI's knowledge of book events and the Evil Overlord list. Since he's stuck in Tom's head, there's no worrying about creating a new family and background story for him. I like how this SI's aim isn't to reform Tom and turn him to a good person.
