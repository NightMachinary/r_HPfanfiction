Interested to see if there's any fics where Harry does have a twin, but he's still the boy who lived, James and Lily are still dead, both of the twins grow up with the Dursleys. I remember reading a couple, years ago, one where he and his twin were sorted in Slytherin and Gryffindor, and they'd switch place regularly, and one where no one knew there were 2 Harry's and they'd also switch place a lot. Just wondering if there's any other fics out there, since usually it's them getting separated and they hate each other and/or James and Lily are alive and love one child and neglect the other, and that's not really what I prefer to read.

Thanks!

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance, HIATUS, but being worked on as of 2-1-16

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/896679][White Heather for Protection]] has Heather as Harry's older sister. So not twins. But Harry is the BWL, and Heather is his protective older sister. Story is from Heathers perspective and is her story. Heather/Snape. Very very slow build - they don't get together until after she's left school
