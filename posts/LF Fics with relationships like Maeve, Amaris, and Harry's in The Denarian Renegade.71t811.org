So, one thing that i loved about the Denarian Renegade series was the relationship between Maeve, Harry, and their daughter Amaris. Are there are stories with similar premises, cold relationships, Harry having a child with someone for unsavoury purposes, a child like Amaris being Harry's, etc. Anything else you can think of really. I would also love any recommendations in which Harry is a Fae or half-fae and/or has a relationship with Maeve or Mab.

Thanks in advance for anything you come up with.


** Maeve has more of a mother/son relationship with him in this. There are other Fae also and Harry is technically human but starts gaining more of a Fae nature over time. I found it pretty interesting linkffn(Grimm: A Fairy's Tale by Krahae)

  Pre-Hogwarts. The stuff of legends, myth and majesty were the realm of the Fey long before wizards named him Boy Who Lived. Maeve of the Unseelie Court has decided to take one of wizarding kind's myths, to shape as her own. Vastly AU.
