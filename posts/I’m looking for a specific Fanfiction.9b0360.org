So I've been searching for a specific fanfiction where the Dursleys abandons harry in London and he becomes a thief and meets hermione who ran away and they start a street gang and don't attend hog warts instead raid diagon ally and learning magic by them selves it's supposed to be pretty dark in later chapters can anyone help me????????

Edit: It's like the Dursleys abandon harry when he's young and hermiones parents die and she is sent to her aunt who she hates and runs away to end up meeting harry at ten and they both start a street gang only to receive their hogwarts letters and think do we want to learn magic or stay here??? So they let Hagrid take them to diagon ally and the decide not to go to hogwarts instead to learn all the magic they can to protect themselves from the magical authorities I think


** It sort of sounds vaguely like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]] but Harry isn't a thief and they don't start a street gang or anything.

** That sounds a bit like The Anti-Heroine by Cheshire_Carroll, though I think they did go to Hogwarts in that, but it fits the dark + street gangs linkao3(8132578)

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle
