Any good Ron as a time traveler or him as a seer fics out there ? I'd prefer 20k or more words. But if its a already complete I'll make an exception.


** The Book of Morgan Le Fay, followed by The Final Reckoning by LavenderBrown. An all-time classic.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU
