**** Oh that's cool. I'd say that's a reasonably short fic though. There are one shots, then there are short fics 20,000-30,000 words. Then medium length 30,000-80,000. Next long fics 80,000-250,000. Finally, the insane length of 250,000+.

This is just my opinion, but I'm gonna go and read your fic now. :p

******** Oh thanks for the warning. Just a heads up for your writing, you need to watch out for random capital letters at the start of words in the middle of a sentence, otherwise it's all good :)
