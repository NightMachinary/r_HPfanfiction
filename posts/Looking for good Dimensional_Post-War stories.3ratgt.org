I've recently finished rereading Stages of Hope ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope]]) and ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11420452/1/Through-The-Looking-Glass]]). Are there any similar stories involving a strong, but not unstoppable Harry, dimension travel, and his postwar struggles?


** *Delenda Est* and *Para Bellum*, linkffn(5511855;9754483). In Delenda Est, Harry traveled back in time of a different dimension and turned Bellatrix into a force for the good. In Para Bellum, a Voldermort from a third dimension found his way into both the canon and the Delenda Est universes. Needless to say, a gigantic inter-dimensional war is about to begin with 2 Voldemorts and 2 Harry Potters.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  An ambitious Voldemort prepares to lead his armies into the Delenda Est dimension to topple Minister Black III. But, he has lost the element of surprise, and there is a Pre-OotP dimension in between his dimension and the DE dimension where he will have to fight Minister Black's armies, spies, and civilian meddlers, not to mention two Harry Potters and the infamous Black Triplets.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
