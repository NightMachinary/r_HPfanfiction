  In the days after Sirius falls through the veil, Harry retreats into silence and watches as the scene repeats itself in his mind's eye. He knows that if he can just understand what was said by those whispering voices, that he could rescue his godfather.

*** Spoilers:

The goal of Harry/Hermione, outside of the normal research aspects you'd expect from such a mission, is to find Sirius beyond the veil. However, the story as of yet has not quite reached the point where they find him. If they ever will.

EDIT: I was remembering the wrong SW x-over. Woops! (Though, he hasn't found Sirius is this, either).

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
