Can I get recommendations for stories with Harry learning what is considered dark magic but is actually just seeing magic as alive or more like a religion. I've read ‘Out of the Night' by Raining Ink (best story btw. I wish she finished it) and ‘Discovering Magic' by The Artistic Fool and thought they were both great concepts. Thank you!

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

*** I cannot possibly gush about Evitative enough to justify how good it is. Looking forward to the sequel with bated breath. Can't wait to see the Black family library reveal itself to Hermione. ( Dramionarry poly plz!)

The Rituals. OMFG, the mofuggin' ritual magic descriptions in this fic are amazing. The way they talk about Light and Dark. The beats they hit about 'The Old Ways' and Dark magic falling out of favor. Harry's relationship with Dark magic and Sirius' mentorship are amazing. It's tasty and it scratches all the itches you have about Dark Magic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10991501/1/][/Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance/]] does a fairly good job of that kind of thing.
