What do you do, when you start a story, it's going good... and then you just stop writing? When you don't have the drive to write?


** Be kind with yourself. Take some time to relax - burning out on writing is real and understandable. Do some things for inspiration: read other stories, listen to music that makes you think of new plot points, consume other fiction or media. Enjoy things. Write a few words every day if you can - even if they're out of order, even if it's only a sentence or a line or just a word that you think may help you later. Often, I find, if I can get myself writing just a little I do more than I want to. Or not, and that's okay too, and I try again tomorrow. If you have no motivation for the fic you're working on, write something else. Do a free-form poem, or a haiku. Write out some random dialogue. Follow a prompt.

Your brain is a muscle, writing is a skill. You need to exercise it and use it consistently to get better, but you also need to rest and relax to allow it to recuperate.

You'll get back to it.

And if you don't, that's okay too. This isn't your job, it's a hobby, and it should be fun!

*** My main problem is that I start a story, update it for a bit, then start a new story. It gets frustrating when you realize, oh shit, people are threatening to kill you for not updating.

**** Well that's their fault. People demand shit from authors that they have no right to. :/

You could try making a backlog of chapters so that you'll have a bit of a buffer before you start posting?

Or also, write shorter stories! One shots, or 5 chapters! That's all totally fine too, don't forget.

****** I'm gonna be honest, I'm not surprised you're burning out so quickly!

Would you go from never running to running a marathon or 100k race? Hell no that would be dumb! You'd start with a 5k, and you'd train for that. You gotta work your way up to the big stuff. And there's nothing wrong with that.

Wouldn't it just be a good achievement to have things completed and have that satisfaction...? And build up to something bigger?

** I'm having this problem at the moment because my job hunt is going badly. Usually writing has been a stress relief for me, but now it feels like wasting time. So, I'm trying to see it as a reward, and stop troubling myself with feelings of duty to my readers. It's about looking at it differently to find that drive again I think.

*** This, the stress relief, the reward, is the only reason I have ever written anything. I feel a little annoyed that I haven't finished things, but it's like a half-done crossword, not breaking some reader covenant. I cannot abide the idea that you owe us anything. I don't recall money exchanging hands, contacts signed. If it's fun, do; if it becomes less so, don't---because I think it shows sometimes, don't you?

**** That's how I started and it was it's own reward, but the pressure gets to you, you know? I just today got a review saying "still waiting for espionage!" Even though I said it won't be coming till 2017 and after another major work. I think taking a step back, even though I would like to be writing again, will be good for me. A drive to write is nice but it's ok to not write now and then.

***** Indeed. In fact, it may be better to take a break. I pulled a half-finished story and stuck it in a drawer. At the moment, I'm printing off what I have to see if I like it enough to finish it.

Sometimes I just keep drabbles in my google drive to play with quietly, as well.

** Three things you can try:

1) Sometimes it is better not to look for motivation, but to just sit down and try writing. Do the mechanical things you would do to work on the story: sit down at the machine, open the word processor, do the other things you would do to get going, start writing just a little bit (a paragraph or two). Often motivation and momentum will come on its own after you work for a bit. (This is true on almost every sort of work in life, btw, even things like cleaning your kitchen.)

2) Maybe try writing shorter things. Really! It is nice to have finished things, and when they're shorter, you will find it takes less work to finish them, and then you get the satisfaction of being done.

3) Maybe try not starting to post a story until you're finished it or at least taken it through one draft. The desire to get it out to the world will sometimes then provide more of an itch which will get you to finish, and at the very least, then you won't get anyone upset that you've abandoned something.

*** My main problem is just I can't seem to stay on the damn story. I write something that seems interesting at the time, and then end up getting interested in something new and writing about that instead.

**** One advantage to not starting posting until you are done is you can explore a few story ideas without anyone watching over your shoulder until you find the one that you're the most interesting.

If it's just a question of not being able to stick to /anything/, well, you can just try to power through it. Maybe keep another word processor window open called "ideas", write down the idea quickly so you know you won't forget about them (and can get them off your mind for the moment), and then get back to the story you had already started and just make yourself continue for a little while. Often I find things resolve themselves if I just push myself a bit to finish the original task.

And again, if you stick to smaller stories at first, that might help you by giving yourself the confidence to know you /can/ finish something.

Good luck!

** I'm the kind of awful person who starts a project then realizes they just went two years without posting anything. There's a reason I don't write fanfiction (and it's not just the lack of skill!)

Most of my friends, though, they'll mentally vacation away from what they're trying to write. They'll read a different fandom, spend time on another hobby, something until they get that drive back.

*** While burnout is definitely a thing, sometimes when I get stuck/have writer's block/stop writing, it's because my brain has told me I've backed myself into a corner. The last thing I wrote might have veered off in a direction that my subconscious is telling me is not the way I want my story to go. Or maybe my characters' current actions don't line up with their pre-established choices and characterizations.

If you write linearly, reread up to the last few chapters and then try rewriting the last scene or scenes without looking at the ones you wrote before. See if the dialogue goes a different direction, or the characters moved to a different location, or changed their minds about something.

Of course, my advice doesn't really help if you've already published the work, which is the way most (maybe?) fanfiction authors tend to write. I did too when I first started, and that's why all of my previous multi-chapter fics are abandoned.

** I really like reading oneshots that skip over tons of things and only focus on certain AU differences in the story, like linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5579962]])

Maybe that would be more achievable at first? You can work your way up to long stories. Plus, some plot bunnies just aren't big enough to support long stories without getting boring to both the reader and you.

  It was Mrs. Figg who suspected first. She noticed many things, sitting on her side of her fence with her cats chasing butterflies and nuzzling her ankles, Mundungus and the other watchers dropping by for tea now and then. Mrs. Figg noticed that Petunia was a nosy bit of work with insecurities hanging from her every harsh angle. She noticed when Dudley learned the word MINE-- the whole neighborhood noticed that one. She noticed that Vernon glared at owls.She noticed that when Petunia gave Harry a truly horrendous haircut one year, it grew back in at a normal rate. Harry was uneven and weird-looking for ages, hiding under beanies when he could. When Mrs. Figg had Harry over for carefully miserable afternoons of babysitting, she noticed nothing moved that shouldn't. He didn't accidentally make flowers out of fallen leaves, or levitate anything during tantrums, or turn toys funny colors. Mrs. Figg called up her mother, interrupting the wizarding bridge game she was winning against the nursing home staff, and asked her how she had known, decades back, that her youngest daughter was a squib.

** At least for me, it's hard to get back to writing once I stop. That happened once, and the story was left on hiatus for close to a year. So, I generally tend to force myself to write at least 800 words per story per day.

** For fanfiction? I just don't write anymore until I start again. Sorry to all, but honestly: Screw the community. If I don't want to continue writing, no amount of "pls update" will get me to do it.

For my novel, if I get stuck writing, I review my plot, my characters, my chapter-plan,... I do a bit of worldbuilding, write some short stories about some aspect of my world. The worst you could do is to stop working with it all together. At least that is my experience.
