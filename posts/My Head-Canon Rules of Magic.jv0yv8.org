** This is less headcanon and your own world-building as many of these concepts contradict canon. Which is fine, and I think some of these ideas have merit, but it's incredibly misleading to call it a headcanon when that's usually used to refer to ideas about canon that are compliant with known information.

Also, please do not be afraid to break things up into smaller paragraphs.

I actually quite like the idea that Dumbledore and Voldemort are incredibly strong. I don't think it's unbelievable. They're intellectual savants, only in the wizarding world, intelligence correlates very well with magical ability. And some of your ideas are found in canon as well, such as the ones about apparition. Apparition is limited by distance, see Voldemort's trip to Malfoy Manor in DH.

*** Hmm, I'm sure I did put lots of paragraphs in there, I think it's lost the spacing when I posted. New reddittor + phone = poorly formatted posts

*** You can edit posts! Who knew. Put in a header upper that it was world building and added in those paragraphs I thought I had.

** Yes!!! This exactly what I think when I'm reading! I always compared Runes to codes, and when applied to wards they're just basically really cool firewalls. For me Arithmancy is probability in math. Arithmancy can be used in divination. Transfiguration is tricky, but I summarize it to being able to change something, but you have to focus on what you want it to be. For example, you turn a match into a needle. But it isn't really a needle, because an 11 year old wouldn't think of the specifics of a real needle. This is where Alchemy comes in. In order to truly transfigure something, you have to know it's mass, what are the components of it, how it reacts to different objects, etc. This is why it's dangerous for humans. My head canon is that magic is truly about intent (also plays into the whole dark and light war plot), how do you think supposed masters like Dumbledore and Voldemort are able to cast non- verbally and wandlessly? Also, dark magic is not actually evil. It's dark because it's hidden within families, certain groups, etc. Who's going to tell someone that they accidentally invented a spell that will put acid in your opponent's eyes? Not me. That's why they're dark.

*** Ahhh, alchemy! Forgot about that, ofc. Nice interpretation and interesting take on the dark magic, I certainly agree that dark magic isn't just evil though!

**** I've always viewed Alchemy like that since I read the first book. Seems kinda self- explanatory to me due to Dumbledore being known for Transfiguration and Flamel being known for Alchemy and both of them working on the Sorcerer's Stone.

** My Headcannon goes something like this:

Early humans were all magical however after the Toba erruption, Human gene pool shrinked so much, majority of the Humans lost magical ability due to inbreeding. This is not something exclusive to Humans and Happened before with Nundus/Cheetahs, Unicorns/Equuines Kneazles/Cats and such.

Magic has three "fields" for lack of a better term. This fields are the Mind, Body and the Soul. All magic oparates in these three fields. Most magics operate in all three or at least two at them at the same time. Some like the mind arts work solely in the Mind field while Horcrux ritual oparates in all three. Simple transfigurations and Charms oparate only in the mind and body field while spells such as Fidelius and Patronus oparate in mind and Soul fields. Human kinds most innate and original magical ability is the mind arts. Because of this, Humans can only use magics that operate on the mind field. For those that dont, they require outward help so things like potions, enchantments and such require ingredients and runes.
