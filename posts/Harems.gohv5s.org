Reading linkffn(11123742) and I feel this is my last attempt to understand this trope. Whenever I met harems before, it was just overflow of teenage hormones freely flowing over the author's keyboard and the main character seemed to spend most of his living time doing it with n>1 number of ladies. So, this story was the last attempt to find out whether there is something in the trope, because it is most gentle non-smut harem possible (basically Harmony disguised as a harem). And yet, I cannot stand it, and I haven't finished it. This whole thing is just too weird.

Will be there anybody admitting to like harem-based stories? Is there anything there interesting there aside from the increased number of explicit sexual encounters per chapter?

(I got NSFW label automatically, but I really don't think there is anything explicit here, is there?)

** There is no such things as Harems. There's only a perfectly wholesome if somewhat kinky relationship with a metamorphmagus, who likes to take different shapes.

It might be difficult to catch unto it, I know, since the authors usually go to masterful lengths to make it very subtle.

You can however spot it by looking at how the 'harem' members act, instead of how they look. Once you look closely at their behavior you will notice, that it's the same woman every time.

Oh sure, sometimes the personas do have differences, but if you look even closer you'll see it's just the usual basic -dere archetypes.

This is called roleplaying.

"But how, dear Triflez, could that possibly be?" I could hear you ask. "I have seen two or more harem members in the same scene."

To which I say this and only this.

Sure, I will admit to such thing.

But seriously, what kind of question is that? You formulated that as if people have problems admitting to something trivial and mild like that on the internet. And looking at the absolutely insane click/view counts harem themed fics get, I am probably not alone. I don't read them that often.

That said, I haven't found any harem stories I would recommend in a "Show me your favorite/best fics", they mostly spring from horny males that are writing for the fun of it, not because they are good writers. And that usually shows. But I mean, most harem fics are smut, and I usually don't expect high class prose when I am trawling Ao3 for some smut to read. Sure, it would be great to have well written smut, but it is very rare. Only one that instantly comes to mind now that I think about it is "It Could Only Happen to Harry" over on ffnet.

And the question you asked about there being anything interesting there, only you can answer that for yourself. If you don't like it by now, it sounds like you tried multiple times, just give up and avoid it. For example, I recently tried a fic with the mpreg trope again. But I had the same results as the last time I tried it, I really, really don't like it. So I simply decided to avoid that in the future.

*** You know, I can only recall one harem fic I've read that I would call outright smut, but then I haven't read very many harem fics..

Of course, my definition of harem seems to be different from some others. Someone said /n/>1 girlfriends but I'd say a harem has to be at least /n/>2. To me, 2 girlfriends is a ménage à trois, not a harem...

** the way I see it, harems primarily exist for the purpose of smut with multiple girls.

for a serious, plot driven story including a harem, I imagine you would either have to be understanding, or actually into polyamory yourself to not be put off by it.

it would also require an author who is understanding of it too, so that the story isn't just plot with random sex scene with harem girl #7 stuck in the middle of the chapter.

*** I feel like most people who are into legitimate polyamory would be likely to hate harems the most. Healthy polyamory looks nothing like a harem fic. Harem fics are just about walking & talking blow up dolls, with different hair colors and slight variations on their unrealistic bust sizes, being obsessed with Harry.

Yeah, but really, how many people in TRW do that? And that Vanishing Cabinet has almost 4k reviews ... and I am not a great expert on smut, but I think in terms of porn it is pretty bad story, because there is too much actual story and character buildings (actually, so far there is no smut at all, and I've finished somewhere in the middle).

**** okay, i guess i'm overestimating how pro-polyamory you have to be to enjoy it in a story. maybe it's just the case that if you find the idea of polyamory off-putting (like I do) then you're not going to be comfortable and enjoy it in a serious story.

** A well-written smut story is a joy to behold, but when you start needing a scorecard to keep track of precisely who is currently worshiping Harry's massive dick, well, that's not a well-written story, now is it?

Now, I don't personally believe that a voluntary Harem could exist. The interpersonal bullshit that every person generates makes relationships with two people chancy at best, (well, maybe three with an especially accepting group) moving to multiples where everyone needs a nametag to keep track of who is who seems extremely unlikely.

So, I decided to make fun of them.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5442672/1/The-Truth]])

I dialed up the Old Manipulative Dumbledore to 11, picked 4 girls (one from each house, to 'Unite the Houses') trying to make sure that they were not the usual suspects... Other than Susan Bones, mostly because I like what others have done with her and wanted to play with my own version of her, and decided to make Tom Riddle out to be Not the Badguy.

It was fun. It was, for me amusing, and everyone hated my ending.

Ah well, as the great sage Ricky Nelson taught us, "You see, ya can't please everyone, so ya got to please yourself". Words to live by.

*** The ending was ok, even tho the "ironic" "have the bad guy be killed by a muggle accident" was nothing new, even back then.

It was more the inconsistent characterization and countless plotholes that made me dislike the story. But I guess it was pretty early in your writing, almost 11 years ago now, and it has gotten better over time.

**** That wasn't the complaint I got. Dumbledore actually being Flamel and Tom being 'forced' to be a bad guy was what everyone bitched about.

And no one liked Tom's Teeshirt, which amused the hell out of me.

There are a lot of things I would do differently. For example, it wasn't until I had posted the 3rd chapter that I realized I'd left out the section about Harry being obliviated multiple times before he signed the marriage contracts.

I've left it, because I hate live stories being 'rewritten', mostly because they rarely improve the story and usually open more plot holes than the rewrite closes.

** I find the fic Harry Potter and The International Triwizard Tournament by Salient Casuality to be a well written, interesting, and original harem fic. 450k words long and still being updated. Has drama, suspense, a looming threat, and best of all a harem that doesn't fall into all of the harem troupes.

I would also really recommend it. I'd also recommend Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches- Revenge is Best Served Raw by LeadVonE as an outstanding fic even if you don't like harems or time travel. Nearing on 650k words and still being updated.

So there you go. Two harem fics I would recommend as some of the best Harry Potter fics out there.
