:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I am trying to find a story, but I am completely blanking out all except for one scene.

Harry is defeating Voldemort last soul piece that has been trapped in a gem. He invited Amelia Bones, an unspeakable, and some journalists to witness it. He uses some basic muggle chemistry (I believe something magnesium) to destroy the gem, and then same native american/indigenous people ritual to send Voldemort to his own version of hell.

Any help finding this fic would be greatly appreciated!


** Power of the Press, I think, by Bobmin? I vaguely recall that being the ending.
