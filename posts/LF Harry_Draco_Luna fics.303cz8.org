I enjoy reading both drarry and harry/Luna and have seen many polyamorous and harem fics. I have recently wondered about fics where harry/draco/Luna are all in a romantic relationship together but can't seem to find many fics with this grouping. Do you guys know of any harry/Draco/Luna fics? Well written fics that are finished or actively being worked on would be even better. What would they be called? EG drarry.


** Drurry

Lunaro

Huco

I'll be here all night.

Seriously though, most 'harem' fics I see are just called the initials of the people. HP/DM/LL would be my real guess.
