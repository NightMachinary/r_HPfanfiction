** While being one of the most cliche genre either, I don't think I either read a Lord! Harry fic really well written.

Most of them seem to follow the same pattern :

1. Inheritance scene : Harry is the Heir of 15 Nobles families, had a block on his magical core which also suppressed his special power like being a Metamorphmagus, and has 1916516516165 galleons in his vault plus 354 properties around the world.
2. Shopping scene : Harry cure his eyesight, buy a special trunk with a villa inside, and get a new pimp wand. He also buy a lot of pimp items who will litteraly never be mentioned again.
3. End of plot : Harry throw his titles around so Fudge is scared and Dumbledore forced to plot, but at this point you can see the plot is already dead and in a last attempt to keep the readers interested, Author turn to Harem and make Harry bang pretty much any female character who is not described as ugly in canon (plus some never mentionned, Hello Tracey Davies).

The only Lord fic I read which was interesting was a parody where Harry inherits a shitty swamp. But it's sadly unfinished and really short.

*** This one really gets me!!! Lord!Harry fics could be super interesting if people took the opportunity to examine how a Harry with more resources/political power could change the political climate and attitudes/alliances of some other families and stuff, but generally everyone just goes with crappy OP Harry.

*** Sunrise / Sunset over Briton by Bobmin seam to do a decent job of not falling into most of that.

** My Immortal

^{ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ Haha no. That premise was doomed from the start}

All jokes aside, I remember this fic where Albus (Harry's kid) was kidnapped by Voldemort (Who'd come back to life somehow) and the Death Eaters. It never got past chapter one, and I feel like that's partly down to me... The fic was absolutely riddled with typos. I gave the author some pointers on grammar, (And plenty of encouraging words, before you assume I out-and-out flamed them) and when I checked the fic the next day, IT WAS GONE

** Lily and James using Harry or his twins fame. They usually use it for stupid reasons when both of them would more than likely use it to further their ambitions or change the political landscape.
