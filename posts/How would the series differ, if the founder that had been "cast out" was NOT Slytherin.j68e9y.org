Especially, if the main reasoning was still based upon blood purity, to simplify things.

Picture this: instead of Salazar arguing that muggle-borns shouldn't be taught, Rowena argues that muggle-borns aren't "worthy" of magical knowledge.

Or, Godric looks down on muggle-borns (and muggles) as nothing more than subjects, at best, and slaves, at worst.

Or Helga, who thinks magical folk should stick together, wants nothing to do with muggle-borns.

Either way, one of the other three founders leaves and/or is banished. Said story goes down in the history books, while Salazar -- in this AU -- doesn't mind muggles and muggle-borns.

How would this change the events of the series? Better yet, what if Salazar was well-known to actually LIKE muggles and muggle-borns.


** In that case, Voldemort would be a Ravenclaw or an Hufflepuff or a Gryffindor and that house would have a bad reputation.

*** Isn't hufflepuff the house of hard work and loyalty ? Riddle is more of a power hungry nerd that value the loyalty (the right) people give him and that will take any short cuts (like work cleverly not hard).

He probably wasn't sorted into Slytherin for his hatred of muggles. More for his qualities and faults that were similar to the house spirit. He just ended up hating muggles and adopting the pure blood agenda when he grew learning about it (though, yeah, he already was a hateful child blabla).

So, yeah. Between his character and his family being the last blood relations to Slytherin, I don't see hatred of muggles being enough to make that much of a change.

(Though, Voldemort coming from a random house/not the hated one would be more of a surprise and less clich√©!

And if Hufflepuff was the one hating muggles, Zacharias could become something of a low level enemy too!)

**** The hat would see "the man fated to open up the Secret Chamber of Hufflepuff with the muggles born eating monster" and it would put him there, according the wishes of the founder.

** Well considering that Voldemort is still Slytherins' heir no matter which Founder was banished, he would either base his power base on some other Slytherin ideology or target the most prejudiced - and thus vulnerable in the way that their end goal is easy to predict - hause and forgone the adventage that is his bloodline.

Personally I think Tom Riddle would still end up as Slytherin, he was very attached to his ancestors' legacy, and wouldn't want to discard adventage being parselmouth gives him there. More so if most purebloods go to Slytherin, most money is available there to push through various politics and get power and lidership position in government. Maybe they would not be as overzealous, radical and easily manipulated as anti-muggleborn fanatics but good taste matters. Tom would get to power more traditional way, not via terrorism.

The muggle-prejudiced politic party would need to have some *serious* political adventage for Tom to decide he wants to put his future on path to become their leader.

It's more probable they would be his political opponents, or at least a problem he has to solve after becoming Minister for Magic.

Was he even aware he was a descendant of Slytherin at the time he was sorted?

**** Sorry if it wasn't clear I did not mean he went to Slytherin bc of some legacy he mysteriously knew about but that he would go to Slytherin. Period. And after learning of legacy it would reaffirm his delusions(?) of grandeur so ofc he was very attached to the idea that his birth makes him extra special.

It's correlation not causation lol

** I think it would change a bit what the bad guys are like

so like voldemort takes the slytherin positive qualities and twists them into something negative.

So him being a different house would twist those qualities into something negative.

Griffindor Voldemort I see as similar to slytherin voldemort but more confrontational in combat. His death eaters may continue to fight after he dissappears maybe some factions are still openly active when Harry goes to school.

Ravenclaws Voldemort more driven by knowledge than power I can see maybe the deathly hallows coming up earlier as a topic. Much more conversations about the nature of magic. Maybe unspeakables become a bigger deal

Huffepuff tho has me a bit stumped. Its kinda hard to twist acceptance hardwork and being fair.
