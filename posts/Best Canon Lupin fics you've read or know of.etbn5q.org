I'd love if you could share the best fanfic with Remus Lupin as one of the main characters you've read. Preferably Canon although I'm also open for Time travel stories as long as it's semi Canon. I'm especially interested in fics about him getting to know Tonks, marauders Era fics and fics from the time between 1981-1993 (what was he doing then?). I love his friendship with Sirius but I'm not much for wolfstar. Bonus points if the fics include Pottermore Canon!


** TheDivineComedian has written some wonderful stories, like this, which explains how he prepared for that boggart lesson:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11917125]])

And I have some self-recommendations if you don't mind. Here he is in December of 1981. I plan to do a whole Employee of the Month series about his years of loneliness, poverty, and poor health between the wars, but for some reason there's not much call for stories like that, so I got a bit discouraged from posting.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14842689/chapters/34356255]])

Here he meets Tonks. We don't know when Dumbledore restarted the Order, so there are various dates that would fit into canon. Here I have him ramping it back up in 1993.

Edited to add: now I realize this comment comes across as fishing for compliments. A humble, modest werewolf I ain't.

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

**** Aw shucks, you're embarrassing me.

If you don't mind an incomplete story, this one's sort of a prequel to Employee of the Month. I get creative with lycanthropy symptoms, which I justify by saying that Rowling didn't give us a lot to work with. I'm torn between just posting the ending and doing a massive overhaul first, since looking back, I see room for improvement.

** This is one of my absolute favorite stories, it's technically in the perspective of Hermione but she's sent back to the marauders era by Remus and he's a main character in the story. (It focuses on all the marauders but mostly Hermione and Remus with Sirius). I really like his character development in this story from his younger years. It also has Tonks in the later chapters :)

The author does a good job of fitting the plot into cannon and explaining how Hermione was able to avoid being recognized in her original timeline at Hogwarts in 1991.
