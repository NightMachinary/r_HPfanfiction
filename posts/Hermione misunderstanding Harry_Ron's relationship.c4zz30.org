I was reading a.. well pretty shitty H/Hr fic which had a one-liner where Hermione mistook Harry's statement to her as being about Ron.

And suddenly I'm thinking a comedy fic where Hermione epically misunderstands Harry/Ron's relationship and builds an imagine of them in a concealed, over-the-top homosexual love affair.

Clearly the fight over the goblet was just a lovers spat. Hermione agonizes over her feelings for Ron because she doesn't want to steal him away from Harry. She thinks their quidditch conversations are secretly code. Harry dating Ginny was clearly Ginny giving cover for her brother because otherwise Molly would have a fit. She is livid with Ron for abandoning Harry in his time of need during the Horocrux hunt.

Anytime it is commented that her two best friends are guys, she just smiles. She desires to be supportive of them in any way she can. Even gives a grand, yet somehow out of place, motivational speech at the proper time in their (imagined) relationship.

​

Ron/Harry being clueless of course, with them thinking Hermione's odd behavior is just because she's "nutters" and "its a girl thing".

I figure something like this already has to exist. Because it would be comedy gold.

I didn't know I wanted to read this before now.


** Hermione's eyes shot up in surprise at Ginny's unexpected revelation.

"Y-you're pregnant?" she stammered.

"Yep!" the redhead replied, with a smile of smug satisfaction that lit up the room. "Harry and I figured it's about time we had one. With the national season put on hold due to the World Cup this year, now's a good a time as any since I won't be missing any matches."

"Well congratulations, Ginny," replied Hermione. "You're really dedicated to your part."

Ginny gave her a puzzled look before letting out a giggle. "Harry and I are /married/, Hermione. It was a joint decision. We both always wanted a child and before the year is out, we'll have one."

Hermione couldn't really describe how impressive their dedication to hiding Harry's relationship with Ron was. Instead, she hugged Ginny extra tight, hoping her feelings would be better conveyed through her actions rather than her words. Ginny returned the hug, but after the first couple minutes she began to squirm. "Don't you need to get back to work?" she asked.

Hermione broke the hug and spoke, looking at Ginny directly in the eyes.

"I love you both and I want you to know that both of you are so /brave/. If you two need anything, anything at all, let me know." She spun around and with a crack, disapparated, leaving a very confused Ginny in her wake.

*** That would kind of defeat the point wouldn't it?

Could do a good bait and switch though. Say, Ron/Draco:

"What do you mean you and Harry are not together?"

"I'm telling you 'moine, we were never a couple"

"But what about the... when you..."

/Ron raises his eyebrows/

"So does that mean you are not Gay?"

"Oh no I am. Just not with Harry. I could never think of him like that"

"Oooiii! I can hear you you know!"

/shifty eye ron/ "Anyway, you know how I was hurting after the final battle when Bill died?"

/Hermione nods/

"Well, Draco was dealing with losing his father, and he had just helped us at the end after all, and one thing lead to another"

/Hermione BSOD/

Edit:

Hermione: Harry! Did you hear Ron? /Harry comes in with Ginny/ Harry: Oh I've known about this for a while. Have to say, I didn't think much of Draco in school, but you know, we share such good taste in significant others, we kind of get along now

*** Yep. Referenced in another thread just a bit ago. Made it four chapters before I had to throw up my hands. About the time Harry started demanding everyone call him by a title. And that was after a whole bunch of unnecessary flashbacks. I was trying to make it to the point in the fic referenced in the thread (Squirellmorte), but apparently that was way later.

​

It was almost painful to read. It was close enough to english that my brain was trying to force it to be coherent.

(Before anyone asks, No, I will not link it. You can go find the other thread if you really want to know)

**** I read that story a while back. It was a great idea - starting out from the extremely-unique landing choice Harry and Hermione's time travel - but horrible execution.

White Squirrel decided he "really wanted to do the idea justice" and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12999698/4/Scribble-Pad][wrote a four-chapter start to a better treatment]] in his /Scribble Pad/. But then, unfortunately, he didn't know how to continue it either

***** I find that to be the problem with most of robst's stories. He has wonderful ideas with plot points that start out very unique and eventually they get butchered into the same shitty story every time.

** why not make it an actual serious romance fic? seriously why the fuck is gay men being in love always some damn punchline? just some joke? there's plenty of movies like that out there already too, and it's demeaning and trivializing real guy's relationships (major one being that movie /i now pronounce you chuck and larry/)!

i mean shit, of course they can't really be gay, it's just a big misunderstanding haha! because funny to think about two guys in love!

it doesn't damn help shit that people want to reduce gay men to JOKES all the time like this, and then add in a good helping of fucking flamboyant stereotypes because SASSY GAY GUYS LOL! make it a real serious fic, give it as much weight and detail as you would a hetero romance or a lesbian romance!

*** The joke is not homosexuality itself, but Hermione's severe lack of understanding when it comes to the relationship between her two friends, just like how many people mistake her relationship with Harry as something beyond platonic.

*** Because.. this wouldn't be about them, it'd be about Hermione? It isn't like HP Fanfiction is lacking m/m romance or something o_o.

Misunderstanding a situation is classic comedy. Can easily be done on hetrosexual relationships as well, as long as the person has reason to think someone would hide their relationship.

However, with the trio, this would be the only way it would work:

Ron misunderstanding Harry/Hermione's relationship? You are looking at an angst fic, given the cannon issue with this.

Harry misunderstanding Ron/Hermione's relationship? Well, they are together in cannon so what would this even be.

Hermione misunderstanding Harry/Ron? Possibility for comedy.

but she is so open in supporting that she thinks any two guys that get along most be together

it would fit hermione as well, once she has her mind made up its rather tough to change
