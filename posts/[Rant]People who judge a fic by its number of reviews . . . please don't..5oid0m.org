** Yeah I quite often get comments and reviews saying "I can't believe this doesn't have more reviews!" But a lot of the reviews I get are quite long, in-depth, honest feedback. Getting a few reviews that have taken the time to really consider my fic means far more to me than dozens of "please update" ones.

** I tend to go by favorites and follows, rather than reviews.
