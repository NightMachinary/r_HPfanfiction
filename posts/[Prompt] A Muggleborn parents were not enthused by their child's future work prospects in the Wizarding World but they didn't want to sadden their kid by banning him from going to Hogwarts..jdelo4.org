Thankfully, they're savvy and well connected enough to navigate through their country's various government agencies and thus come across a few other Muggleborns who faced the dilemma of reintegration into Muggle society after years in the Wizarding World. After talking with them, they decide to form a Muggle world reorientation squad of sorts, which through the years becomes an actual secret agency of the Muggle government.

What prompted this: Encountering stories that have Muggleborns reintegrating into the Muggle world. However it always seemed to be an individual effort. I then wondered what if a support group was formed?

It's not that I'm saying that the Wizarding World's prospects are bad. After all, this is an untapped resource; I hope we get more stories involving Wizarding jobs someday. These could be overachieving parents who want their kid to be neurosurgeons or something, and want their child to have the best of both worlds. Heck, maybe their kid even ends up being a successful witch or wizard. But thanks to this parent's fears, a support group was formed that would help many others.


** I always figured something like this existed but the opposite; at one point, Ron mentions that his mother has a cousin who is an accountant. This is a throwaway line about squibs, but I wonder: How did he become an accountant? Where did he get the money for college? What ID did he show them?

The answer: The wizarding world's squibs have joined forces to create a secret society of accountants, lawyers, hackers, graphic designers, and the occasional soldier (in case the wizards get uppity), who all work tirelessly to support newborn pureblood squibs through their transition to muggledom.

** I'd be interested in exploring how reintegration would work with preserving the Statute of Secrecy.

** It's not quite the prompt, but linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) has mention of some of the secondary characters quietly integrating magic into mundane jobs. Eg a witch's Muggle father (with knowledge of magic) hires her boyfriend to work in his pub; once the customers have a few drinks in them, they don't notice glasses being collected and tables cleaned suspiciously quickly.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.
