Don't remember very well and it's probably quite bad as I read it a long time ago: A fic where Lily is alive and went into hiding with Harry. They enter the story at Grimmauld Place and he meets Ginny in the middle of the night. Harry and Ginny are either animagi (?) or some sort of animal and they're attracted to each other because of this


** I think you're looking for Different Lives. linkffn(7281791)

Harry and Ginny meet at Grimmauld and they're shapeshifters rather than animagi. I tried it, but I absolutely hated it.

*** It doesn't help that it's a complete rip-off of Return of the Marauders. But yeah, it isn't well written and there's way too much angst for my liking.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
