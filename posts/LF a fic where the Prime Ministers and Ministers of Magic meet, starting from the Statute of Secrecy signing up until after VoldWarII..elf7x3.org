:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Basically the title. It was a one-shot, written in snapshots as the two different Ministers met during different points in time, like 1692, 1914, 1945, etc, often with the MoM showing high-handedness and apathy in dealing with the PM. It also had the Prime Ministers recruit Muggles and Squibs to listen in on the meetings just in case the MoM Oblivates the PM and for records sake. They also kept folders, audio recordings, and other proof of the existence of magic, and had a protocol in case the wizards got out of hand.

I'm pretty sure it was on fanficauthors.net or some other site, not fanfiction.net, but I can't remember a phase specfic enough to quote and Google-Fu and the fic wasn't very popular. Any ideas?


** I'd be interested in this too
