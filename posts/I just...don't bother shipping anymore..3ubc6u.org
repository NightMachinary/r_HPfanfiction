I've read so many fics where square pegs are pounded into round holes (no pun intended...really...) I'm past the point of caring about the pairings of a story. I don't seek out romance, though I acknowledge that sexuality in fanfiction is a hot topic. What I'm really wondering is, are there are other people out there who just don't care about the pairing?

I'm more interested in a story with witty dialogue (so fucking rare) and a good plot (really fucking rare) and no tropes (or if they're there, they're being mocked/satirized) that I don't give a crap who ends up in bed together. I no longer care who hooks up with who, as long as i'm entertained.

Is your ship important to you? Why?

I judge stories on the following criteria:

1) Does the set up and characterization make sense for the story?

2) Spelling and narrative flow are enjoyable and relatively consistent.

3) Pairings are done well if they're in the story. Make me believe in them.

4) Don't have characters be OOC out of nowhere for no reason.

5) Make me feel something. Am I laughing? Teary? Gripping my legs with white fingered fury?

** I can't read stories that don't have a H/G pairing. It's pretty irrational, but in my head, Harry's still the same Harry as in canon, which means that he is with Ginny. Reading about Harry or Ginny being with someone else just feels wrong to me. I get sad that they're not together and that sucks all the fun out of the story.

Sadly, that does limit the amount of fics I can happily read, so I'm pretty burned out of HP fanfics at the moment. Luckily there's millions of other books to read out there instead.

** I used to only read D/Hr fics, my angsty-draco-in-leather-pants phase /shudders/. Then I kind of branched off to other ships both het and slash. I think I've only read <5 D/Hr fics over the past several years.

Now I just want good plot! I don't usually care about tropes, although some make me roll my eyes. If it's well written, I'm all for it, :) I don't care who ends up with who as long as the author doesn't dedicate half the story to ship building.

** Sure I read HP for ships. I just don't really try to limit myself to one. Ships are excellent for stories without much meaning or symbolism. Especially in fics that just have characters interact and build a relationship. More often than not, it requires extreme AU and character-in-name-only-ness.

But if you're question was: would I rage quit a fic because, say, a wild Drarry or a Dramione appears? Nah. I'll rage quit a fic for having an overly long word count with way too much exposition sooner.

Hi, there.

I never really cared about a ship. I tend to read more of certain ships since the surrounding tropes and cliches are my kind of stuff, but I never read because of pairing. Actually, if a story tells me the pairing up front in the summary, its already on my shitlist.

** I have some anti-pairings. I wont read Harry or Hermione paired with Snape or Draco or Voldemort. I also dislike Hermione/Ron though I'll read it if the story is otherwise good. Other than that I'll take what ever. I think Harry can be paired with just about anyone without him being too OOC, its just harder for with some characters. I think Hermione is best paired with someone outside the trio, though Harry/Hermione can work under the right circumstances.

Everything is a trope, you can't have a story without them. That doesn't mean its unoriginal.

** You might as well label this /The/ FanFiction Dilemma. All mature fans have to deal with it. The mechanism is extremely simple: the majority of fanfiction readers and writers are teens. Crafting good prose is /hard/. So the majority of works fall short, and the majority of fans just obsess with the ship, because those stories are easily digested and enjoyed, somewhat independent of writing quality.

If you're the type of person who just can't get into a piece of writing unless it's /good/, you're doomed to spend most of your time panning through dirt to find the gold, as it were.

*** True, but in that case, shipping's not the issue. Fandom is a community populated by amateurs - that's the reason it exists in the first place. Fanfiction's a hobby, a social opportunity, not an art for most fans. They don't care about improving. What's more amazing to me is that there /are/ fans who are incredibly talented, and they share their talent freely. I love that.

I'm very character-focused myself, and I'm addicted to certain varieties of shipfic, so I stick like a burr to writers who do it well. I also enjoy genfic, although military, world-conquering, badass Harry (or Draco or Neville) fantasies don't turn my crank, no matter how decent the writer's prose is. So, yeah, I don't bother with those, but I'm glad there are people writing Harry Napoleon and doing a good enough job of it to satisfy the battlefield fans. Fandom is best when it caters to all sorts of tastes.

Teenagers aren't the only awful writers, of course. (And not all teens are bad at it. Some are phenomenally gifted, but they're the exceptions.) Like you said, crafting good prose is hard - it means self-criticism and caring about the end results. Lots of adult fans don't want to put the work in, either. For most folks, fanfic is about squee and instant gratification.

The issue with shipfic is that it vastly outnumbers other kinds of fic, so gen readers have a smaller pool to draw from but the same percentage of awful to good. Which is rough. And without the inbuilt shipping drama, gen writers are forced to come up with a compelling plot that develops convincingly and keeps up the pace. The requirements for writing good genfic are higher, and fewer people have the skill or the staying power to manage it.

(Random off-topic mini-rant: it will always burn me that mainstream publishing rewarded bad writing with a mega-deal, and that the public reinforced their choice. I don't care if people read /Fifty Shades/, I care that it was rubbish fanfic that became a rubbish bestseller. We can all roll our eyes at barely literate teen writers, but E. L. James is an adult who writes as poorly as the teenage stereotype. Sigh. /old rant is old)

** Yes, I suppose pairings are important to me. Part of the reason is my ingrained stubbornness. The other is that every so often I find a fic that ticks all the right boxes and just leaves me feeling like a junkie that got his fix for the day.

I don't give a shit about cliches. (tropes is something different people!)

Why, you might ask? Because at one point something that is cliche was original and quite possibly amazing. I don't lose faith that good writing can revive it properly.

** I don't care much for shipping. I am far more fond of Missing Moments. To that end, "Faith and Understanding" is a very well-written "Missing Moments" fic of much of the series. Ginny Weasely meets Luna Lovegood and slowly the two girls become very close friends. This is one of my all-time favorite fanfictions across any fandom. Luna is written beautifully, insightful and kind and blunt and eccentric. Ginny's got a spark to her that you don't often see. This story is heartfelt and funny and real.

** I never understood the obsession with shipping. The books are about magic, not romance. They aren't soap operas. Most characters aren't very attractive imo. Yet there are more stories focused on relationships than on any other topic. It feels to me like fanfiction authors want to write erotic fiction, and simply use the characters of HP as puppets instead of creating their own characters. I get the mental image of a teenage girl playing with dolls of HP characters, making them kiss and have anatomically impossible sex.

** I usually don't care unless I'm reading a marauder story, which is mostly James and Lily. Other than that, I could care less about who ends up with who as long as it makes sense /in the story/. I don't mind tropes as long as they feel right for the story, otherwise its just an author liking an idea and throwing it into their story. If it's a lord-potter story where he inherits all these lands and responsibilities, make him be looked down upon from all the other, much older and much more experienced lords. Stuff like that, tropes are cool.

** Harem shipping I will almost always refuse to read because the storyline tends to be poor quality.

Otherwise, I'm pretty open to other ships as long as they don't detract from the actual plot of the story.

However, if I read a romance/shipping focused story it's probably for laughs because the sex scenes in fan fiction are usually quite over the top and ridiculous.

** My wish-it-were-canon pairing is Vikor/Hermione, and it's probably the only pairing I feel strongly about at all. That said, I read very, very little of it, partly because not much exists, and also because there are a ton of very interesting fics with other pairings or that are gen (I actually really enjoy gen fics). Also, there are a lot of pairings that are fun to read about in fanfiction even if they're inherently quite odd. Harry/Voldemort for example is great in linkao3(again and again by athey), but certainly not remotely reasonable in a canon sense.
