Every single fucking "manipulative" Harry fic hasn't had an actual manipulative Harry. It's basically just Harry being an asshole, telling off Dumbledore, and one shotting Voldemort. I'm looking for fics where Harry manipulates everyone around him, plans out for every eventuality, and defeats Voldemort by maneuvering him into a position where he can be beaten, instead of just walking up and dueling him.


** It's more a collection of snippets, and unfinished, and Harry is sort of an asshole, but "What would Slytherin Harry do" comes close to your request.

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

****** Being Slytherin doesn't automatically mean you're superhumanly clever or anything. It means that ambition and/or cunning are forefront in your traits. Draco was Slytherin, and look how well he did killing Dumbledore. It took 3 tries and an invasion, and he still nearly got himself killed, failed to kill Dumbledore himself, and Harry knew he was up to something the entire time.

Slytherin Harry isn't going to magically slip past everyone. He's still a kid, after all. But his solutions to problems won't be "charge in and hope for the best" so often, and that's what we see in What Would Slytherin Harry Do?

****** Why would a Slytherin Harry do this? Networking. Gaining influence and favors. Getting back at Umbridge and Draco and co. By saving the grades in Defence of his year, he improves his own standing by a lot. And he learns a lot about his fellow students, too. Just in case.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of Slytherin).

This is the author's take on wrong bwl story "done right". Harry is a natural legilimens and has used that to affect the people around him, usually in positive ways.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

Harry that is dark but not evil. He wins the friendship of the other characters by supporting them. Look to his takedown of Snape to see his manipulations in full power

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
