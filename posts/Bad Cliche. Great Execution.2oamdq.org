Whats a fic/author/premise that takes a normally annoying cliche (ping pong twinspeak, goody goody gobbos, Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryfindor, the Trunk of OMGWhy, etc) but pulls it off so well that it doesn't bother you like it usually does? And of course- why?

Not [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2o6mm8/take_a_trope_and_add_a_twist_to_it/][Does it Differently]] but plays it straight, and yet still manages to avoid the eye rolls and facepalms normally produced.


** Nuhuh pulls off the clich√©-ridden time-travel Indy-fic nicely long after the Indy-fic heyday in his story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4347702/1/Catharsis][Catharsis]]. 100k words. (I'd thought it was complete, but it's not listed as such.)

*** Is it just me, or is the writing not that good?

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833][Meaning Of One]] Takes the "soul bond" cliche and turns it up to 11, and then makes it work really well.

Why I like it? Well, I'm a sucker for soul bond fics anyway, but will readily admit that there are about 3 that aren't kill-myself-bad. The writing is good, the characters are completely and totally reasonable, and there's original conflict in the story.

The characters are definitely the defining trait of this fic and its sequal. While I read through it, every character felt three dimensional, and every single one felt like they could reasonably switch with their cannon-selves and work well. Molly Weasley /felt/ like she did from the books. The author just has a knack for characterization.

** Well, I've just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3022004/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freak-Parade][Harry Potter and the Freak Parade]] and it has quite a few cliches inside... But it's so strange that it imho doesn't really matter because it's easy to read and not too long. One of these cliches even is an important plotpoint somehow... ;)

(On the other hand, the fic basically parodies the cliches in itself, so...)

** In Fayr Warning's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2287647/1/Reign-of-Power][Reign of Power]] Harry is Lord of Potter, Black, Gryffindor, Morrigan and Heir of Slytherin but it didn't bother me (although this stuff usually does) because in this fic, all those titles were actually used to further the plot, they were a major part of the story and not just used to make Harry rich and seem more important.
