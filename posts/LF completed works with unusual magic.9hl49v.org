Hi everyone,

I'm looking for fics that have Harry using some unusual magic, I finished reading the incomplete story On Steel Wings (or something like that) and quite enjoyed the rituals, would love to read more works that use magic beyond the normal charms.

I don't mind pairings, could be any as long as its not slash.

Bonus points for long (100k+)

Thanks!

  Instead of attending Hogwarts, Harry Potter was taken as an apprentice by a druid who taught him a more archaic form of magic. Now fully trained in the mystic arts of water and wood, he comes out of isolation to rejoin magical society and wage guerrilla warfare against Voldemort through ritual magic and alliances with the fae creatures of ancient Britain.

*** OP asked for no slash. It says its Harry/Voldemort right in the summary. Sounds like interesting story idea though apart from the pairing.
