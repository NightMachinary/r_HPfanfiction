Canon ships preferred, but may as well just post your favourites for everyone else anyway :)


** Not really canon ships, but for fluff I can strongly recommend linkffn(Breakfast in New York by Rabaslab).

  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.

  Hermione thought she was the only person in the world who would spend Valentine's Day in a Graveyard, but she was wrong. He's there. Every single year, with his gloves, roses, and answers. Dramione Valentine's Day one-shot. Post-Hogwarts. EWE.
