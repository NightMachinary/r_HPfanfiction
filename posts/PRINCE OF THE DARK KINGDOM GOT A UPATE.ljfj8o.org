** To save other people some time---this is the same update that was mentioned a few weeks ago. No actual new content.

For those who weren't already aware, I'm posting the A/N below:

  The return of Prince of the Dark Kingdom...

  It's been a long hiatus, but I'm finally making my triumphant debut back into this world. I´m also excited to announce several upcoming projects for PotDK.

  I'm currently working on re-mastering the original fanfic and adapting the story into an original work. I´m also working on a PotDK Blog where I will post updates on the fanfic, the original adaptation, and exclusive sneak-peeks into a secret project I've been working on.

  Over the years, many of you reached out to me with great hopes for PotDK and now is the time to make your hopes a reality.

  The original story adaptation for this universe is going to be epic!

  I´ve got big plans for the PotDK universe...

  If you´re a writer, beta reader, artist, web designer, or have any other skills you'd like to contribute and are a fan of this series, there's loads of work to do.

  If you'd like to know more, or you want to submit an application to become a member of the creative team, send me a PM or email me at my Gmail account: POTDKproject.

  I look forward to hearing from you and reconnecting to new and old readers alike.

  Keep the Magic Coming.

** They aren't finishing the fic, they're filing the serial numbers off and asking for your support, financial and otherwise, while they do it. There's nothing in there about actually finishing the story.

*** They claim to have big plans for the universe, and not ones do they ask for financial sport.

**** You are correct that there is no current Patreon or what have you in the offing right now, sorry for trying to rain on your parade with my cynicism. That was totally not cool of me.
