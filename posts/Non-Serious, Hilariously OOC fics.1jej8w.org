I'm looking for some flat out laugh out loud, implausible, OOC fics. Death Eaters on a Beach Trip? [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4534995/1/The-Annual-Death-Eater-Beach-Trip][It's what I'm reading now.]]

** They're not freakishly OOC, more mildly so, but I suggest nonjon's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the World is Harry Potter]] and its two sequels. They are some of the funniest writing I've encountered in the fandom and I regard Bob the Dementor as one of the great literary characters of all time.

  PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

Of course there's also the classic [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]] by Sarah1281.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

A less well known story with a cast of OOC characters and laced with a much more subtle (a la Thomas Pynchon) brand of humor throughout is Adari's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4086213/1/Lost-Hope][Lost Hope]]. I'm not sure it's quite what you're after, but I thought I'd throw it out here.

  The plan was perfect. The execution was even better...but they all forgot to consult the Sorting Hat who had its own views. After all, what can you expect from hat which contains all four founders?

** When you said you were reading about Death Eaters on a beach, I immediately thought of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/899503/1/Once-Upon-a-Freakin-Time][this]] one. And [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4357627/1/Scorpius-Malfoy-and-the-Improbable-Plot][this]] fic is also insanely funny.
