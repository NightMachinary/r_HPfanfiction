:END:
I read this oneshot a long time ago and would love to be able to find it again.

Harry defeats Voldemort after the BoH like in Canon. He then becomes immortal (because of the prophecy's "neither can live while the other survives').\\
Don't remember this part well but Harry basically has a lot of introspection and depression and he ends up realising he is Voldemort and he goes back in time in order for him to finally be able to die because he's tired of living.\\
He becomes Voldemort like in Canon and all the while there's this inner monologue of him apologising to young Harry but saying it's necessary to make him stronger.\\
He duels his younger self at the BoH and dies. The ending line is the beginning's line - Young Harry wakes up/rises after the battle and finds himself immortal. It's basically ouroboros. I loved it so much it was so beautifully written and chilling. Please help me find it <3 Have a lovely day
