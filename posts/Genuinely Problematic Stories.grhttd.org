** Was about to write an angry comment here until I read your second paragraph lol. If you want problematic AND popular fics, I recommend Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches by LeadVonE, which has /reluctantly checks/ [Reviews: 8,619 - Favs: 16,581 - Follows: 19,742] on ffn.net. Safe to say it is one of the most popular recent fanfics, and it features a 12 year old Luna with a BDSM dungeon.

Another problematic fic is Backward With a Purpose by Deadwoodpecker. Reviews: 4,801 - Favs: 7,196 - Follows: 2,728 on ffn.net. It's about Harry, Ron, and Ginny going back in time to make things right. Ron grooms Hermione. Like, actually grooms her into a relationship. I read this a few years back and I remember a particular conversation that stood out to me:

#+begin_quote
  "I don't care how sad I am," Hermione whispered. "I'm still not sleeping in your room."

  "Not /yet/," Ron said with a hint of a smile.
#+end_quote

In chapter 27.

EDIT: could you please keep me updated with your video essay? I would be very happy to watch it, as I fully agree with you that this is a serious issue.

*** Somehow, 12-year-old Luna with a BDSM dungeon is less disturbing than

#+begin_quote
  "I don't care how sad I am," Hermione whispered. "I'm still not sleeping in your room."

  "Not yet," Ron said with a hint of a smile.

/That/ is a hell of a lot creepier to me. Luna can do all sorts of weird things and the idea doesn't particularly disturb me. Don't know if I'd say the same thing after reading it however.

** Not really a particular fanfic, but it is something that has always bothered me a little - Stories where old characters go back in time seeking their one true love when they are still kids. I mean, isn't it kind of grooming when an adult (sometimes even an elderly man/woman) disguise themselves as kids and use the information they collected of other kids to manipulate them into falling in love with them.

I'll be the first to admit that it isn't something that by itself makes me abandon a story (I like the whole time travel trope too much and have become very adept in skipping the ‘romance'), but it always makes me kind of uncomfortable.

*** Huh. I've read Darth Marr's stuff, but not /Bonds of Blood/. I didn't really notice heavy sexual themes in what I did read, but it might just because it's been so long that I just can't remember, and I didn't find the fanfics engaging enough to re-read.

For what it's worth, I find the concepts presented in Bonds of Blood far less disturbing than one of the fanfics mentioned in other thread about moments that got users to stop reading a fanfic(namely, one of them mentioned finding a fanfic where a Fem!Harry was running a child prostitution ring).

**** I don't know why all soul-bond authors are so drawn to young children having sex together: Harry Potter And The Bonds Of Time by Vance McGill seems to go in the similar direction as well (at least they moved the age of consent to 14).

***** One thing about stories though, unlike reality, when you're reading a story fanfic or reality, age literally is just a number. How many fanfics do you read where the supposed 12 year old actually acts like a 12 year old?

**** And the sad thing is that apart from the sex thing I found “Bonds of Blood” rather nice: the scene with werewolves is lovely, and the final battle combined with the presence of James Potter is rather good (and demolished Hogwarts), just if it happened couple of years later.

** Bear in mind that any fanfics involving pedophilia cannot be linked here and violate both Reddit's rules and this subreddit's rules specifically.

The only fanfic I can really remember involving that I'm not sure counts as pedophilia in the context of the story itself(whether or not it does outside the context of the story I suppose it does count as pedophilia, but within the story, they're pretty much all teenagers). I don't even remember the /name/ of the fanfic. What I can remember is that it was Harry/Hermione, Harry kept getting sexually assaulted by older female students, and Hermione kept asking him to demonstrate what they asked him to do.

****** Quoting a site that summarized the relevant laws:

Since 2002, Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition established that two overbroad provisions of the CPPA of 1996 was struck down by the US Supreme Court because they abridged "the freedom to engage in a substantial amount of lawful speech."

The Court found the CPPA to have no support in Ferber since the CPPA prohibits speech that records no crime and creates no victims by its production.

Furthermore, district court Judge James E. Gritzner ruled in United States v. Handley that two parts of the PROTECT Act of 2003 criminalizing "a visual depiction of any kind, including a drawing, cartoon, sculpture, or painting" was unconstitutional.

******* 1st.) Its a crime for someone to produce, obtain or promote material portraying a minor in pornography in most first world countries, and its regardless of whether that is fictional portrayal or not.18 U.S.C §2260. There's a REASON artists of lolita material have to explicitly state the characters portrayed in it are 18. Maybe you think it falls under a different classification because one is written format and one is visual, but they fall under the same clause. This is not a discussion, I am educated on the topic and in telling you that you are wrong.

2nd.) The fact that you're genuinely arguing that child porn is okay, and that it doesn't harm anybody, BIG fucking yikes.

******** Why are you quoting a law about/importing/ child porn if you're educated on the topic?

Here's the quote:

 

18 U.S. Code § 2260.Production of sexually explicit depictions of a minor for importation into the United States

U.S. Code

Notes

prev | next

(a)Use of Minor.---

A person who, outside the United States, employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any minor to engage in, or who has a minor assist any other person to engage in, or who transports any minor with the intent that the minor engage in any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct or for the purpose of transmitting a live visual depiction of such conduct, intending that the visual depiction will be imported or transmitted into the United States or into waters within 12 miles of the coast of the United States, shall be punished as provided in subsection (c).

(b)Use of Visual Depiction.---

A person who, outside the United States, knowingly receives, transports, ships, distributes, sells, or possesses with intent to transport, ship, sell, or distribute any visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct (if the production of the visual depiction involved the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct), intending that the visual depiction will be imported into the United States or into waters within a distance of 12 miles of the coast of the United States, shall be punished as provided in subsection (c).

Let's assume this applies for the sake of the argument.

A minor is a /person/ under 18. A fictional character is not a person under any circumstance.

Review your sources better.

********* If you look in that code, it even helpfully says when clarifying what "indistinguishable image" means:

This definition does not apply to depictions that are drawings, cartoons, sculptures, or paintings depicting minors or adults.

So, please. Actually read the relevant laws.

********* Fanfiction written anywhere in the world can be viewed in outside the United States - you literally quote the word 'transmitted' yourself. And even though that law states the 'visual' portrayal quite specifically, it does also include written and yes, portraying the minor is fictional or not, still counts. From a consumer point of view it is still a child in pornograph content, an act which in itself is illegal, regardless of if there's a /real/ child involved.

The bigger question is why are you so determined to defend literal child pornography? Its really not a good look and the ruthlessness on which you're trying is freaking me out. We can argue about the finer details of which laws are which, but it doesn't change the fact morally its still child porn and you are here defending and are saying "its harmless".

Stop being a nonce.
