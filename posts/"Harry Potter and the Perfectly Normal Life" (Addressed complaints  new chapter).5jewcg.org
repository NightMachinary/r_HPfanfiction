  What if Voldemort didn't exist? What if Harry Potter was the only title for Harry Potter? What if he had no scar? What if he had a sister? Are you tired of exciting books full of Harry going through dangerous tasks like fighting dragons, giant spiders, and the greatest dark wizard of all time numerous times? Of course you are! This is Harry Potter in the mundane!
