Hi all. I remember reading a oneshot about Lavender Brown years ago, and I loved it enough that it really stuck with me, but I cannot for the life of me find it. It's about Lavender and how she makes herself beautiful for Ron, and they are sleeping together while he's with Hermione, and then he proposes to Hermione in front of Lavender at the ministry I think. It's quite focussed on her using makeup and clothes to look as good as she possibly can. Ringing any bells for anyone? I'd love to read it again!
