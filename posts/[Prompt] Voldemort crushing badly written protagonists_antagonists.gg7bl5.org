You've read the fic, where a super-powered Harry, Hermione, Daphne, etc. take on Voldemort and for an inexplicable reason, beat him as school children at his own game. Or fics where a mysterious antagonist greater than Voldemort appears. All poorly written.

Write about a Voldemort that takes exception to these challengers.


** I usually just close the tab, but each to their own. What fic would qualify for you, if I might ask? Any examples?
