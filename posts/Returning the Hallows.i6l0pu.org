:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There is a fic I remember reading where Harry faces Death after being killed. Death is pissed that Harry holds dominion over her and voices her opinion only to have Harry offer to return them to her. He mentions that he doesn't like them for some reason. Reluctantly agreeing to his proposition, initially not believing that a human would part with such power, she offers to make him a wand. So at a click of her fingers they are standing in a infinite room filled with wand woods. He apparently selects one that is from the world tree (Yddrasil, I think). Same for the wand cores (don't remember what he selects).

For sentimental reasons, Harry requests to retain the cloak as it was his father's, and Death agrees.

All in all what Death notices that his selection of wand wood and core indicates his propensity towards the light and not the dark and that is why he was uncomfortable with the hallows.

This i remember as being a scene in the start of the fic. Any help in locating this would be appreciated!!


** There are dozens of fics that start like this..

The only one decent enough for me to remember the name of is the marvel crossover with millions of words.

** I think I remember that one. I'm having trouble coming up with the title right now, though. The only "Harry returns the Hallows" story I can find easily is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Aftermath by CJaMes12).
