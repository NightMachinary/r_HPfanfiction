As it says in the title. It can be any plot, characterization of any characters, world building, or whatever else that you really love.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual Et cetra. (Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing).

Can be on ANY site, anyone can be the main character, can have any warnings, Can be Marauders Era, Golden Trio, Next Gen or something else entirely. Can have any kind of plot.

Can be oneshots/drabbles/multichapters.

Would rather not have character bashing, if at all possible. That's the major thing that I do not like. I also don't like kid politics, because it can come off as preachy or cringe.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** This basically starts off at the same place as /Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/.

My favorite line?

It appears 16 chapters into [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11500936][/Long Live the Queen/ by offsides]]. It really needs to be read in context for the full impact.

It might not be something your into, though. I'm not entirely certain what you mean by, "kid politics."
