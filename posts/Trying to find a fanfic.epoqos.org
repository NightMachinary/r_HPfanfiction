:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I forgot the name of the fanfiction but the gist of it is that Harry Potter went to Durmstrang, met the grand daughter of Grindlewald, (AU BTW), kills Grindlewald who was a teacher there, Harry finds his secret room and steals everything in it, Harry then becomes powerful as hell and ends up as the emperor of the world. (I might have this slightly confused with another fanfic that I've also forgotten tbh)


** Any luck finding it?

*** Nah. Wish I could but I can't remember the name of it nor its actual description so I don't know what I'm looking for

  What to do when your parents are immortal and your best friend is a fireball throwing Veela? Henry has no idea. But when the Triwizard Tournament comes to Beauxbatons, the young Flamel has to survive both his former family and the trouble of his own fame. - on Hiatus, possibly to be rewritten someday... maybe

****** Thanks for the suggestion but I'm afraid I've already read that although it was a very good story despite it not being fully finished
