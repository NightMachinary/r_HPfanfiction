I dont know, if a ranking would fit, but i choose it, to seperate my requests.

1. At first i was thinking about, what would happen if a happily married Harry dreams about making love with Bellatrix (actually, his mind is traveling to a different Version of himself, who is married to Bella and have fun with her). These Dreams/Visions are haunting him, because he cant tell, what they are (is bellatrix haunting him from the afterlife or does he develope a really strange attraction for this dead Person?) and might even jeopardize his relationship with Ginny.

2. Now, i think about, what if Bellatrix survived the War and rehabilitates and gets attracted and fond to Harry (maybe keeping something about her old personality), she seeks out for him and they talk. Or if she pretended to be with Voldemort and actually wanted to get rid of him for good (this version i dont like as much, because it places her OoC).

3. Or what if Voldemort either never happened or on a different time. Harry meets Bellatrix during his Hogwarts days and gets attracted to her. However he is torn between Ginny and Bella. He loves both of them and is undecided for a long time. I leave it to the author, who he choose, but i would think about he marry Ginny, but with Bella being a sort of "Femme Fatale" who still loves him and tries to make him step other the forbidden Line. This would be stupid and tempting at the same time, but it would reflect bellas Character.

4. Or if Harry meets and falls for Ginny and Bella in School time (bella is here as young as she was during her Hogwarts), but as above cant decide for a long time. The progress would be the same as above, just with a younger Bellatrix. Possible affairs might happen. Also i leave it to the Author, if he let Ginny know, that Harry loves 2 Woman.

5. Im not rejected if there is Harry/Ginny/Bella fics, which would also be good, but they wouldnt have this "forbidden" Nature. Usually, im not for Affair fics, though.

It doesnt have to be "Bellatrix". It might be exaggerated, but it could be the same Woman/Girl as Bella (in description), but with a different name, altough i prefer it to be the Pureblood Witch

#+begin_quote
  An accident during potions classes forces Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass to work together for a detention. One thing leads to many others, and a sordid romance is born. How will Ginny react? Much less, the school population? Well... hopefully, they won't find out.

** Delenda Est was a Bella/Harry fic I really enjoyed. I'd like to read more, but haven't come across any that sound appealing yet!
