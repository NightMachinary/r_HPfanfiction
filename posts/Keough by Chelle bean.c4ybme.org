Forgive me if I've flaired/posted this incorrectly, Reddit confuses the hell out of me ðŸ˜‚

I am wondering if anyone has knowledge of this story by Chelley bean perhaps being posted on another site other than ffnet

I'm HAUNTED by this fic. I normally don't read docs that aren't complete, I somehow got on this one thinking it was, and it's poked at my brain for months. :-/


** Thanks! Unfortunately that only has the link I already have. I was just holding out hope that she had completed it somewhere ðŸ™ƒ
