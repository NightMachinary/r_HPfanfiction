In the world of HP fanfiction, a lot of the secondary characters have been fleshed out by fans to fill in the gaping chasm that is Harry's social life. Out of all of the secondary female characters (ie; Susan, Daphne, Padme..ect..) who do you think would have the best chance to involve themselves with the canon Harry and how? :) Would love to hear theories. :)


** Katie is only a year older than Harry and they spend a lot of time playing Quidditch together. I think if JK was going to write the series with more focus on characterization and Hogwarts life than Katie would certainly play a part.

Probably all of the Quidditch team really. Fred and George would be like his older brothers, telling him dirty stories and giving him bad advice. Angelina and Alicia would fit that same role probably.

Romilda would have a larger role in this narrative too, to more deeply explore the fangirl aspect. Someone who is willing to slip him love potions is significant, yet in canon is was only a plot device to get Ron to break up with Lavender.

Cho is a realistic love interest. There is a mutual attraction, a common love for quidditch, but it was doomed after Cedrics death. A canon more focused on relationships would tell the same story, but better.

Most importantly of all is Ginny. How their relationship developed should've been a core aspect of canon, even with the lack of romance in the books it should've got more focus. A powerful moment in canon was when they get on the train to Hogwarts and Harry says he forgot Ginny didn't hang around with them at Hogwarts. This should've been a large moment, but it wasn't. It was quickly forgotten until Harry had his ridiculous 'monster in the chest' moments.

So if I were retelling canon but with some focus on romance I'd do a Katie thing in 4th year, Harry misses spending time with her since they don't have quidditch. 5th year is the Cho incident. 6th year Romildas infatuation and his coming to terms with his feelings for Ginny.

*** What about Luna, too? I'm surprised people didn't mention her. She isn't starstrucked by Harry. She has a lack of tact; her "uncomfortable truths." And after Sirius died Harry "found that the terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly" after having a talk with Luna. The others y'all mentioned can be passed as OC's, so any situations with them and Harry can be manifested as realistic or true as you want.

Or Cedric, maybe. Or not since it would make that book more depressing.

Why does she seems like a child to you? Or is it the sexual aspect? Maybe both of them can be asexuals....?

****** Certainly the sexual aspect of it but not exclusively. Luna is whimsical eccentric in a way that feels childish to me. She is smart but has a childlike wonder and imagination.

I love Luna, she is one of my favorite characters and there are even a couple Harry/Luna fics I like, however on the whole the idea of a Luna ship is offputting.

Think of it in a real life context. You know someone who behaves in a childlike way, and then you put the moves on them. Its just creepy.

******* Well, to be fair here, she was 14 when she had this talk with Harry. People tend to be childish at that age.

I think, however, that the important part here is that Luna has a way to get through to Harry, which in itself is something quite unique in canon. Add to that a few years and the "ship may set sail".

It really is unfortunate that Luna never got the chance to get closer to Harry. Her role of depth was pretty much done after OotP. The next real chance would have been on Slughorns party, but yeah...

I agree that Luna is very child-like in canon. Its why I prefer fics that have her get together with Harry later in their Hogwarts years, or even as adults.

** For the how, just think back to your own school years and how you would end up interacting with new people:

- Taking a new class.

- A class you were already in is re-arranged so you're taking it with different people.

- After-school activities.

- Hanging out with mutual friends.

- Parties.

** Rowling isn't a great writer of romance and that's being kind. Rowling didn't write secondary characters that well and it isn't so easy to comment on based on those canon characters. Now if you are talking about fanfiction version of those secondary characters paired with someone from Canon then I would like to see him with someone from Slytherin just so that it can be a means to an end to break all the prejudices against Slytherin.

** The moment you write them as more than sideliners, every single one of the secondary characters becomes, basically, an OC. True, fanon has done much to create a sort of image for Susan, Daphne and others, but nobody could argue with you about a new characterization.

I'd say that you'd have to take quite a leap for any Slytherin love interest. Even if Daphne, Tracy or any other Slytherin finds Harry attractive, the sheer peer pressure would be a lot to overcome, on both sides, Slytherin and Gryffindor.

I think the best chances lie with Gryffindor girls. Parvati, Lavender, Katie, Romilda - because at this point, why not? That is simply because of the "accessibility", for a lack of a better word. The Gryffindor girls have easier access to Harry and have more information on his likes and dislikes to approach him accordingly, should they wish to do so.

Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw are neutral ground. I'd say those joining the DA would have the best chances.

** I feel as if everyone has reasonable chances. Most of these girls are all basically OC's so you can make their personality as perfect for Harry as you want. Some like Tracy Davis and Daphne Greengrass do not even have their looks described so as gorgeous as you want.

We treat characters a bit like animals to be honest. Grab two characters, force them to work on a project/go on a crazy adventure/soul bond thats the equivalent of locking them in a room together and suddenly they realise their perfect for each other.

I'm sure there's a scientific word for this phenomenon.

** I read a great thesis on why Ginny was the one for Harry in the end. It basically broke down Harry's needs into a few key factors.

I can't remember them exactly but it was something like this:

1. Harry wants some one who shares interests with him.

2. Harry wants someone who can make him laugh.

3. Harry desires to be part of a family.

You can see how Ginny ticks all these boxes.

As I've mentioned before, Harry Potter is more Plot Driven oriented than Character Driven. Most of the secondary characters don't get a chance to communicate a lot of their backstory, it's not important the the style of story.

For instance, Daphnie Greengrass is mentioned in passing in book 5. That is her ONLY appearance in canon. Tracey Davis never even gets a mention.

So in terms of female side characters who get any information we have Hermione, Ginny, Cho, Parvati, Katie, Fleur, Pansy and Marrietta.

Of those he only finds Ginny and Cho attractive.

** With canon Harry? Well, I'd go with somebody on the quidditch-team (Katie Bell might work, but Angelina and Alicia would work just as well - Sorry twins, but I don't think you play in Harry's league as he's famous, has money etc. etc.) or somebody from Slytherin (in order to show that the whole house isn't evil)

I mean Harry needs a supportive witch that shares his interests (basically: Quidditch) and that't it (I mean come on: Canon Harry does have only the one hobby, he doesn't have any side-interests etc....in a way he's quite one-dimensional and should have been fleshed out more!)

ps: No, not Ginny because basically: I don't like her much (trying to make Harry jealous? Come on the guy is DENSE, just kiss him and don't try to - pardon my french - to sleep your way through his dorm in order to make him jealous!) and I still think she'd remind him of his mother (both are redheads after all) and he hates his fame, so why would he bang his number 1 fangirl?

pps: Note: Ginny could have gone out with wizards from her own year or even the year below, but she only ever dated guys from Harry's year if I remember this right, so IMHO she wasn't really trying to move on!

Of all the girls at the School, only Cho, Ginny, Patil twins, and Yule Ball Hermione earned that designation.

** Zacharias Smith without any doubt. He's a Hufflepuff, which means that lovely house would have got more attention.

At the start (in order of phoenix), he has an undeniable chemistry with Harry. But we don't hear about him after that book, sadly.

** Not a specific character, but I think realistically, Harry would probably be more comfortable with a Muggleborn, because he was raised Muggle. Also, they wouldn't have grown up hearing about Harry Potter and so would probably treat him pretty normally.

One with at least some family for him to be adopted by - a sibling, a few aunts and uncles. And who wants a family of their own. Probably someone who enjoys Quidditch, even if they don't play. Someone who wants a quiet life, not tons of events and being mentioned in the paper.

I think canon Harry fits with only Ginny and maybe Katie but she's kinda like a different Ginny anyway as far as i can tell.
