Like, you know. The Sum of Our Parts is perfect.

But any long or short fics focused or started by Harry wanting to protect Teddy from the world. There was another fic I already read that Harry goes to the past and adopts Snape but I don't remember the name, which inspired me to want to read more fics like that.

It's called "Disorder of the Phoenix" and it's amazing.

** Rule 7: linkffn(Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19) kind of, in some way, probably matches your request.

God I hate this fic. I can't put my finger on it. I've tried reading it a few times, and I just don't get it.

*** I liked sum of our parts but it feels like a massive prologue that has all the interesting bits summed up in the epilogue.
