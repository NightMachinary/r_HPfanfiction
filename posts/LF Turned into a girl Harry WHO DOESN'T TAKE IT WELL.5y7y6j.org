What I'm talking about is in every fic I've read of this nature, Harry is turned into a girl and goes along with it as if nothing major just happened. In real life, this kind of thing would most likely lead to panic attacks, crying, sobbing, etc (Unless the gender swapped person in question was transgender, but I don't feel qualified to talk about that without unintentionally sounding like an ignorant jerk, sorry :[ ). So I'm looking for that. A fic in which Harry is gender swapped (Preferably around 3rd or 4th year, and maximum before Deathly Hallows begins) and reaaaaaalllyyy doesn't take it kindly.

If possible, I would prefer the fic to ignore cliches like SecretlyAJamesBondVillain!Dumbledore or HeadOfBlahBlahBlahHouse!Harry, and in this case I'd prefer either femslash (preferably with someone around their age, i.e Hermione or Luna, I guess.) or no romance at all. Preferably the latter, honestly.

Thanks for any replies!


** Before people start ragging on the femslash: imagine if on the inside you were the same person, but you swapped genders from male to female. Your sexual orientation would not change! You'd still fall for girls, unless your new feminine hormones started screwing you over, in which case you'd likely collapse into an asexual gender identity crisis. I'm really curious to see if there are any fics that do a decent job of exploring this.

** linkffn(11862560)

To Reach Without has a Harry who turns into a girl and just over approximately 30 chapters finds some sort of acceptance for it. I think its one of the few stories where Harry sex-swaps that doesn't swap his gender with it. So no immediate make-up and dresses binge-shopping trips.

My biggest criticism against it: While reasonably well written, the writing style isn't my cup of coffee to be honest. It often loops and repeats points already made. Eventually you got it that Harry is freaked out and get annoyed at the author for insisting on emphasizing it again and again.

But anyway, its a good bit of fanfiction that should meet your criteria.

edit: I forgot to mention that the author adds some House of Black stuff in it as well as some rather annoying OC's. Its a bit... off as it shifts a lot of focus away from Harry. He isn't the Head of House, mind you, "just" the appointed heir. But there are some scenes where its the main point of the plot, so yeah... May not be as close to your criteria as I thought it was.

*** I'd think that a transgender person might enjoy reading some of these stories that make light of the gender shift, since having this particular attribute shouldn't consign them to a life of angst nor should they be defined entirely by that aspect of their lives. As a reader, I'm often pleased when my hero handles something deftly when I would find it soul-crushing or insurmountable.

Comedy itself is often a case of taking the expected and throwing in a sudden shift from the predictable. 1, 2, 3, marbles. So if a situation that naturally should paralyze a person by taking away their sense of self and order is handled with a shrug and 'Meh. That guy's trying to kill me. I'll get some tampons later.' - well, I'd laugh and I hope others would, too.

***** Let's not generalize about 'such type of story'- we have several stories mentioned in this thread, so if we want to discuss what is or is not well done, we should use the available examples.

As I'm one of the writers mentioned, I can say for sure that I never intended to write /only/ comedy, ever, and that I do take the topics somewhat seriously and I'm guilty of all sorts of author-tract pontificating. I also poke fun at something in nearly every scene, certainly in every chapter. Comedy in story writing is a tool to help pacing; if everything is drama or angst or horror, the audience may be lost from catharsis oversaturation. Even in real life, no, /especially/ in real life, often the best way to shoulder a burden is to make fun of it.

That said, there's often a difference between the message intended and the message heard. If a writer treats a trans character as solely the comedy relief, the underlying message delivered is 'transgenders are to be laughed at'. Some authors (including many writing for television) miss that point and fall into the trap you described, of thinking they're progressive for including a transgender character but actually being offensive in how it was presented.

I've actually read your story (not the sequel though) and wouldn't classify it as comedy at all. Maybe my perception (you raise some good points about reception) of it is totally wrong, but it actually seemed pretty angsty in parts and I think you did a pretty great job of taking the subjects you raise seriously (though it's sometimes all over the place ;).

In any case, your story would be one of the few exceptions that I could think of in that genre (I've dropped most others after at most a few chapters though). I think you pretty directly addressed some of the issues raised in this thread about this gender stuff having a serious impact on a person, but it's been a while since I've read it.

** linkffn(To Reach Without by inwardtransience) kicks off with this level of freak-out, even though the cause was accidental magic guided by subconscious instinct. I haven't read the most recent chapters but Harry's new life as Melantha is heading towards staying fem-focused for intimate relationships.

I wrote but haven't posted a treatment of this sort of situation. Harry is dosed on Halloween of 6th year by someone and wakes up flipped. Some of my favorite lines:

#+begin_quote
  "Mis-- ehh Potter," Professor McGonagall said, "in the range of magical accidents I've seen at Hogwarts, I don't feel that becoming a witch constitutes a crisis... or is even cause for great sorrow. Being a witch has served me well my whole life."

  The look that Professor McGonagall wore gave Harry the sense that disagreeing with this opinion might earn him a trip to St. Mungo's... or Azkaban.
#+end_quote

A later scene when Dumbledore puts Harry under the Hat to be resorted:

#+begin_quote
  'I just want to continue being Harry, as I was,' Harry thought at the Hat.

  'Ah, but you can't,' the Hat replied. "The 16-year-old wizard named Harry Potter is gone, just as much as the twelve-year-old version. You are as different from the one as the other as are they. It's just happened much more quickly this time. Many changes are like that. They take effect suddenly. One minute you're a model student, the next you're smuggling dragons, or killing a Basilisk, or watching a friend die.'

  Even in his mind, Harry gulped at the reminder.

  'You aren't the same afterwards. The change can happen in an instant, but the adjustment takes time. Even if you were to change back to male in a month, this time, right now, is still a part of your life.'

Hermione is his foil and voice of reason in this, as usual.

**** Replies out of order:

Hermione had just finished talking about how to handle hormone surges and had been Harry's 'How to be a girl' guide, so she had gotten lock-stepped into advising him on what's 'normal'. In particular she was acting scandalized because Harry had just kissed her in thanks for all the help.

Why re-Sort him? It was a way to get Harry to face the situation

#+begin_quote
  "Headmaster, I've been talking with Hermione and we have a few ideas, but it really hangs on what you intend for me to do with this situation."

  "You want me to choose who you are? Harry, I'm flattered but I refuse. In fact, I am quite opposed to even making suggestions on the matter, lest you take my mention of it as an endorsement."

  "Um, sir, do you remember when you came to the Dursleys and I said, 'I just try to go with it'? That's hard to do without you leading the way."

  "I do remember that conversation. It's the reason why, this time, in this situation, I must not lead."

  "But sir, I really need help with this!"

  The headmaster looked at Harry for a minute, his expression growing disappointed. Finally, he mused, "Seeing as your identity is in question, I think perhaps you might need to be re-Sorted."

  "What? No, I'm absolutely a --"

  But Dumbledore was already in motion, deftly snatching the Sorting Hat from its stand on a bookshelf as he made the few strides necessary to navigate past his desk and next to Harry's chair. A moment later, Harry's vision was blocked by the battered leather hat.

  Harry sighed. 'Hello again.'

  'Potter; Harry James. Your reticence is understandable, but unlike a first year, you have a sense of what the Houses represent and how your personality might fit.'

  'I haven't changed.'

  'You have so! You just haven't adjusted to it yet. It boils down to this- how do you want to handle your new identity?'

  'Not sure I understand.'

  'Are you curious to learn about the differences? That's a Ravenclaw mind. Hoping to give up your fame and hide amongst the masses until you have a handle on things? The Hufflepuffs would help the most. Are you thinking about how this might be leveraged, to put your enemies off balance- a Slytherin way to handle things?'

  'I want to stay in Gryffindor.'

  'Then, might I suggest that you embrace the condition boldly. Make it your own. Let them fling their insults and criticisms, knowing that you can take a hit like that. After all, you've been enduring that sort of treatment all along.'

#+end_quote

The fic has its own lore and stuff, and changing one's sex is not unheard of there, though usually it does not involve what it did in Harry's case. As such, a resorting is something that can be done if one has to protect their identity in some way, as Harry seems to think he has, which is why Dumbledore made it happen.

#+begin_quote
  Also, why would Hermione ask if he still likes girls, unless she - for some weird reason - would assume his sexual preference was rewritten?
#+end_quote

Weird biases and preconceptions. Harry's situation involves at least some stuff related to transgenderness (I don't care if it's a word or not, adjective creation rules say it can be used), and for a long long time there were---and even now there are---a lot of preconceptions regarding transgender people. The whole “if you are a transgender girl and stop pretending to be a boy, you must now like boys or else you aren't truly trans” rubbish is one of those, and despite the existence in this fic of an easier way to change people's sex than is available to muggles there still can exist something that mirrors this particular preconception. It might be partially or even completely caused by Hermione being Muggleborn, but that's a “maybe” thing.

You could ask trans people, if you have access to any, how often they need to answer questions that are downright stupid and wouldn't have gotten asked had it not been for the asker being in a position of preconceptions and filtered perception. The answer you hear will likely be “too often”, and considering that the author does incorporate elements that mirror this ... condition, I'm sure that things like Hermione's comment are deliberate and meant to invoke this.

That said, I did, on occasions, hear people use language you absolutely wouldn't expect from them when asking questions rooted in preconceptions and biases, often it being simpler than you'd expect as if they switched from any kind of logic to ... something. It might or might not have happened in Hermione's case and I wouldn't be surprised any if it indeed is the case, but again you'd have to ask the author to know.
