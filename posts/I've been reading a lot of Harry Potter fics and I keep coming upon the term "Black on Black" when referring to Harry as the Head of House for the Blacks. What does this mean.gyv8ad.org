#+TITLE: I've been reading a lot of Harry Potter fics and I keep coming upon the term "Black on Black" when referring to Harry as the Head of House for the Blacks. What does this mean?

*correction: "Black /of/ Black"


** So far as I'm aware, it's just another way of referring to someone as the head of a family, or that they've reached the pinnacle of power or ability within that group.

*** Ah. I tried googling it an all I got was that it is a title for nobility.

**** Well, yeah, but I've also heard that form of address used to refer to people who are regarded as being at the top of their profession, like the "Baseball player of Baseball players," or maybe some object that has been designed with quality beyond others of similar make, like "Cadillac of Cadillacs," or "Sword of swords."

** Same meaning as King of Kings I suppose.

Or, if you're seeing it as â€œHarry Black of Black, it means Harry Black of the House of Black.

** There is also like the Longbottom of Longbottoms or the Potterer of Potters. I also saw The Black of Blackmoor in some fics. All different ways of saying this person is the Head of House.

** Another way of saying he's the Head of that House.

The Black of Blacks, The Longbottom of Longbottoms, The Potter of Potters.

Can also be used in conjunction with the ancestral seat if there's one. The Black of Blackmoor for example, though that's not canon at all, Blackmoor or Blackmoore is a real place though.
