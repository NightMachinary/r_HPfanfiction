Basically from a member of staff's viewpoint, with not so much focus on the kids except as part of the job. Any kind of sex is okay, but I would prefer it not to be what the whole story is about. Thanks for your help.


** Just a Random Tuesday... follows McGonagall but Snape does show up in it periodically.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

  Admit it, you've always been curious about what the professors were thinking while Harry, Ron, and Hermione got themselves into all kinds of shenanigans.

** If you're willing to settle for good/interesting/funny characterization of Hogwarts staff, littlewhitecat's Inquisitor Carrow series really captures Snape and Dumbledore charmingly, especially the many sections written from their POV.
