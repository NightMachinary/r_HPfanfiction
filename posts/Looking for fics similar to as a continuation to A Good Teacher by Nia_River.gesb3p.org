I'm looking for any completed fics that are similar or are continuations of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4065484][A Good Teacher by Nia_River]]

Anything nice and long and completed with as little romance as possible and no harems. Please for the love of Crookshanks, no harems. I am so tired of seeing those. Every other trope is fair game though.

  The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop.Harry found he couldn't blame them. Everything from the bespectacled emerald eyes to the messy black hair---the resemblance between them was uncanny!
