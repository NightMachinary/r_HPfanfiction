I'm looking for Sirius and Harry on the run, fighting death eaters, changing the timeline, or any fic that has them together most of the time and facing some kind of struggle/bad guy.

Please no Sirius-raised-Harry, 'Uncle Moony,' or other domestic-type fic.

I've already read A Black Comedy by nonjon, by the way.


** Take a look at “Oh God Not Again!” (linkffn(4536005)); for all its faults it's something that centres around Harry and Sirius as they do change things in some kind of way.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
