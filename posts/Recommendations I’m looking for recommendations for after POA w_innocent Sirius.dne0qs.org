Specifically Sirius gets proven innocent and Harry goes to live with him. Ideally everything else remains as close to canon as possible. Sirius/Remus would be a bonus and neither of them dying would be a double bonus. Not picky about point of view.


** The Bureaucratic Error is a WIP that mostly fits the bill. Features time-travelling Lupin trying to fix some of the stuff that went wrong. Not Sirius/Remus though, and through butterfly effect stuff, canon changes a bit, but not massively.

*** Omg, this was so good. Thanks for recommending it! I was crushed when I caught up to the latest chapter this afternoon. Sometimes I avoid WIPs so I don't have to wait to find out what happens next, lol
