Almost a month since I last posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3if2lm/hows_the_writing_going/][this thread]]. How's the writing been since then? Made progress? Started something new? Found inspiration? Dawdled around?

Like last time, I'll try to make sure everyone eventually gets a response.

Edit: Also made an [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3m58ro/offerswap_critique_thread/][offer/swap critique]] thread.


** I finally made [[http://fanfiction.net/u/7098030/][an account]] and published a few stories. I haven't made much progress on the +liger+ longer fic that I've been working on for the last few months.

I think that I made the first Teddy/Gabby fic; it's the first one that I've seen, at least. linkffn(11494570)

** Well, since The Phantom Pain came out, and being (ostensibly) an adult with a job, all my free time has flowed over to that. So I've been sitting pretty, not really getting much done writing-wise.

That is, until I spotted an [[/r/WritingPrompts]] thread a few days ago about crossing over HP and The Witcher. And lo and behold, I got the inspiration for a crossover between the two that takes place in the world of the Witcher, but about 200 years prior to the books to avoid confusing the two storylines. So, while most of the characters featured will be from the HP universe, you might still see familiar faces like Vesemir, Philippa Eilhart, etc. The fic itself will probably be written in the vein of the earlier Witcher novels, where the books where more a collection of short stories featuring Geralt rather than one long, cohesive plot-line. The first of these short stories will feature Harry and Ron (as witchers) working together to hunt a bruxa in a port town a day's ride from Cintra. The second will likely feature Hermione and Harry investigating a murder at the magical university in Ban Ard.

The next chapters for my other fics are slowly, glacially slow, really, but surely being completed.

***** How are you finding writing a video game crossover?

****** The thing with writing a crossover with The Witcher is that I can kind of cheat. The Witcher was originally a pretty good book series, and the games are kind of a soft sequel to those. The good thing about Sapkowski (the author of the books) is that he's a bit vague about his lore, unlike your Tolkiens or GRRMs, so you can write things that take place before the series without much interference with the lore. Some characters from the original Witcher series will make an appearance, but most of the main characters haven't been born yet, so there's no Geralt, or Yen, or Ciri to really influence the plot.

That being said, creating a competent plot for the HP characters to follow without getting caught in the fanservice of wanting to introduce as many Witcher characters, and seamlessly combining Potter lore with Witcher lore have been the hardest parts, for sure.

It's where you get rid of things that don't need to be there, so I deleted a whole section of this chapter, because it just wasn't needed and could be explained later through conversation.

I'm not bad at emotional scenes, but I usually overdo them the first time around - I can't judge what works and what's repetitive or ridiculous until I see it all written down. Which exasperates me no end, since it means drafting pages in the full knowledge that I'll end up throwing half of them out.

****** Well, I am not sure how good my fight scenes are. I don't care much about choreography and pacing - I generally focus on one character's POV, his or her actions and reactions and thoughts. In larger battles, that's often like the beginning of "Saving Private Ryan" - lots of chaos, panic, and running around while people are hurting and dying left and right, often lacking the big picture for most of the battle, sometimes with tunnel vision. I also tend to cut down on descriptions in such situations, to show that the character usually doesn't care just what color the rock he's diving behind is, just that it can serve as cover. It's easier for me to judge a character's reactions in such situation. Motivation is often as easy - kill or be killed, ultimately.

Emotional scenes need more work to get into all characters' heads.

It's impressionistic writing, but it still has to be sharp and the details well-chosen or else all that chaos will do is confuse the reader. Plus there are plot and character points you can sneak in while the action's exploding on all sides. So, still a juggling act, like most scene-crafting.

*** Do you have the ending planned out? I had written 60000 words on my story before I started properly planning out the story. It helped me strip back the passages that are unnecessary and create new ones that are much more meaningful.

I find that it helps working out what the purpose of a passage is before actually writing it. If it doesn't have one, delete it, or edit it so that it has one. Harry going into a Gringotts office and finding out he has a house? Has potential, but it's already been said and done before.

So I add a little twist: Harry's too small for the chair (his feet don't reach the ground) and he doesn't really understand what the goblin is talking about. That gives the passage a metaphor: namely that Harry gets thrown into situations that should only be for grown-ups, and that he needs to grow up fast because of this.

Ask yourself whether the passage is essential for moving the story forward and/or is essential for enriching the story. That should make it easier to delete anything redundant!

** I'm spending hours upon hours fleshing out the characters and the way they interact with each other rather than properly writing the story itself. I've got a good feeling about it, though. My story's going to be a kind of outcast-Harry story. Frankly, I'm a bit disappointed that "Down the Rabbit Hole" wasn't completed, as it had an excellent set-up; namely Harry being completely crucified in the papers and people suspecting him of being evil.

I've got a couple of nicely thought out OC's and a new secret society much like the Order of the Phoenix, which should make the political games more interesting.

I'm thinking of getting a Beta sooner or later, but for now I'm happy to pace around my house, making notes and thinking of how the story will work out.

My biggest problem with the story is working out how to use magic with the plot: make it too powerful and many of my plot points become illogical or redundant, make it too weak and it's boring. Especially the whole apparating business is a bitch to work with, since you can, in principal, apparate anywhere you want, all over the world. I've given it a serious nerf because of that.

*** Do you think you might be limiting yourself accidentally by your view of magic? For me, magic is a tool. The interesting thing is not what it can /theoretically/ do, but what the character /actually/ does with it. In slightly different words: it's not about power, but about how far you're willing to go. I've never been interested in those discussions that talk about magic as this quantifiable thing, because I feel like it puts too much story weight onto the magic itself when it should be about the character. In action flicks, the heroes show off their shiny gadgets from time to time, but ultimately it's their cleverness or sacrifice or some other element of their character that saves the world.

And while, in principle, you can do anything with magic by that measure, I don't think readers make that assumption without prompting.

**** Good point! Indeed, it's not only about the possibilities of magic, but also it's interaction with the characters. Problem is, though: remember Harry forgetting about the two-way mirror, which leads to Sirius' death? That pissed me off /so much/! That's a clear example of "the means is there, but the character doesn't make use of it". It works, but I don't want to use it every time Harry has a problem. I'm afraid the reader will become very frustrated by that after a while. That's why I resolve to limiting magic enough to create struggles in the plot.

On the topic of "what is magic?", I have been wrong in my wording, apologies. When I said 'power', I didn't mean just raw power, more 'a means of reaching what you want', a solution to problems.

I read something about magic being equally proportional to the writer's need of struggle in the plot and I quite like that idea, so that's what I'm going with.

I'm not a fan of magical cores, power levels and generally magic as an expendable fuel. That's limiting and, more importantly, terribly boring. It sucks all the mystery out of the magic and leaves nothing to the imagination.

I think magic should be something extraordinary, inexplicable and a means of enriching the story. I could write the same story I have in my head without any magic at all, but where would the fun be in that?

Problem is, I have one point where Harry is stuck in the middle of nowhere, and I don't want to make it easy for him and I don't want to use the old "the means is there but he doesn't use it" to solve this problem. That's where my problems with apparating and portkeys comes in play. You have to set clear boundaries in these cases so that the plot still makes sense, but that doesn't match with magic being inexplicable and mysterious. And /that's/ where my problem with magic lies.

  I think magic should be something extraordinary, inexplicable and a means of enriching the story.
#+end_quote

Totally this. I hope you find something that allows everything to work out how you want it to, because it sounds like you know what you need in theory. In a larger work, I'm more forgiving of small inconsistencies and contrivances, because nothing is perfect, least of all HP canon itself. If it's good enough--if the result of the contrivance makes up for the contrivance itself--I wouldn't care, if that eases any concerns.

A few ideas from the top of my head (probably very obvious but can't hurt? :D): Harry/apparitions are being tracked, there's a magical disturbance in the area--some sort of inhibitor or something that makes it erratic and dangerous, Harry doesn't feel like he can do a reliable apparition (head injury? visions?), wand is semi-broken (I assume you thought of the broken wand, but you need him to use other spells).

****** Thanks for the encouragement and the suggestions! I will use the "magic is being tracked" one most definitely.

I've got apparation sorted out now:

- You can't apparate while moving at a high speed (like when you're on a moving train). When you pop up at your destination, you will still travel as fast as you did when you disappeared. It would be equal to jumping off the train (very unhealthy, especially if you want to apparate somewhere indoors).
- all the country's borders all over the world are magical and prevent you from apparating or portkeying through it. I have grand plans with this one!
- You have to have a clear vision of where you apparate to, so you can't just pop up somewhere you've never been before.

However due to chance is pulled back into the world when he encounters a group of corrupt Aurors persuing a young muggle girl.

I hope so! It's my first piece I'm writing, unfortunately I've got loads of ideas I'm just not very good at the writing part.

** I'm still not sure if I'll ever publish it but the story I've been working on is taking form. I'm about 40k words in but unlike other stories I've started to write I actually know where this one is heading. I've gone back and started breaking it up into actual chapters instead of just one continuous flow so that's actually helped me work on the flow of the story.

It's a crossover where Harry and Ginny are removed from their world and placed in another so my biggest issue has been writing interlude chapters about what's happening in their universe and how their absence is effecting the canon timeline. Also trying to give Harry and Ginny a unique adventure in the new world without just rewriting that world with Harry and Ginny following that canon.

****** That's sounds pretty cool actually. My crossover is with the Warcraft universe so I'd probably need someone familiar with the games at least. The two scenes I'm currently having problems with are the ceremony involved in becoming a paladin and explaining a glossed over event in the games. I understand now why the event was glossed over because there's no logical reason why it should have worked. The other scene is just me trying to figure out if I should focus on the ceremony or the character development going on around the ceremony.

**** Its an AU in the Marauders' era. I'm kind of changing some characters personalities and stuff as well as changing the entire plotline of Voldemort. The plan is to have the marauders actually be the one to defeat him, not Harry. Voldemort, rather than an evil villain who is afraid of death and just wants ultimate power, my Voldemort is a religious fanatic who thinks he's a god come to earth. A little snippet from the opening:

"And these Wizards pointed and laughed at the Muggles as they killed each other while fighting a war started by a raving lunatic with a way with words, while they themselves will do the exact same thing. For there is a war coming, a war wrapped around the idea of a right to magic and how it affects the future. A war that will forever change the face of the Magical world. A war that will trigger a change in wizarding politics like none other before it. A war started by a raving lunatic with a way with words, who thinks himself a god come to earth. They just don't know it yet."

It sounds better in the full paragraph because there are parallels in it from previous sentences, but still. Rather than blood purity, his followers are simply the "worthy", so his followers are made up of people from all blood statuses.

*** It looks like you have a grasp of /what/ you want to happen in this story. Now it's about making it as interesting and believable as you can. Readers don't know the characters and story like you do, and the characters aren't developed much as things start to happen. Take some time to show us who they are and why we should care. Read out the dialogue and even act out your scene to make it believable. A story is more than explaining what happens. Hit emotional punches.

***** I'm not one to pick at a premise of a story. I disagree with a lot of fanon ideas, but I figure, I might not be the audience for it. It's up to the story to make the premise passable though, e.g if the characters are OOC, the story needs to set that up. Absurd premises usually aren't the problem, but rather absurd stories that don't convince me of the premise.
