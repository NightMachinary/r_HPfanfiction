**** No, but it is updated semi-frequently to frequently. Last update was Jan 1, I think.

There is a lot of filler chapters, so feel free to skip those.

  Who is Harry Potter? A son, a brother, a good guy? No. A nephew, a friend, a hero ? Somewhat. Destined for greatness? Yes. A prick? Oh, absolutely. (Updated less often than once per month. Read at own risk. Author already aware of the problems of first year(s). Questions in disclaimers and ANs of chapters 1-40 do not need to be answered anymore.)

** You might like this one, maybe? It's not finished yet, and it is also under revision currently, but I thought that it was really good! [[/spoiler][It has Draco rebelling against Voldemort by protecting the Minister of Magic, and the he even joins up with the Order and reveals many of the Death Eater's secrets.]] So I would say that it is certainly not your typical Malfoy story. ;)

  *CURRENTLY UNDER REVISION.* /Now Updated to Ch.14:/ When Lucius Malfoy is forced to make a difficult decision, he gives his only son up to the Order of the Phoenix in hopes that they will protect him from Voldemort. With nowhere else to go, Draco is stuck living at the Burrow with the Weasley's. But when a new witch from America moves in too, things start to get... /interesting./

*** This also goes with it. it's kind of like a prequel of sorts and it is really short, making for a quick/easy read. It sets up the events to come in the Novel really well, and gives you an overall feel for the story, I think. Figured I should include it, just in case... Hope you like it!! :)
