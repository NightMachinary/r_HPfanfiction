I was re-reading HP and got to the chapter where Dumbledore shows Harry the memory of delivering Tom's letter ('The Hidden Riddle' or something like that). Reading it, it's pretty clear that the caretakers are doing their best for the kids even in the face of minimal resources. They also seem to ride herd on the kids and keep them out of trouble. I realize we only get the Matron's word for this, but Tom seems to showcase clear psychopathic/sadistic behaviour from a young age. As her's is the only account we have (and is backed by things Tom Riddle says at various points) we have to accept it as reasonably credible. It's disconcerting when writers whitewash Tom's actions as 'acting out against his tormenters' or something. It takes a very dark person to plan and execute graphic murder of a fluffy rabbit, especially at such a young age.

HP has plenty of nonsensical points and plotholes, but honestly, Tom Riddle being an evil git is not one of them. He is clearly narcissistic, sadistic, and psychopathic with a god complex. Maybe being 'special' while surrounded by normal people could make him egotistical, but not to the level he actually is. We sometimes dump on Dumbledore for not 'helping' Tom, but there was reason to be wary of the kid.


** I've always thought it was nice and tom was just like you said, crazy. But my dad actually did grow up in an orphanage in the 30s/40s. And it was horrific. The stories he and my aunt would tell me gave my nightmares. Beaten with willow sticks. A lot Beaten with belts. A lot Sexual abuse. Electric shock treatment. Also cabbage soup. So much my dad wouldn't even look at a cabbage my entire life. And the foster homes they went to using them for free labor. My dad said sleeping with the horses was actually pretty nice. So yeah. That orphanage sounds way nicer. I also assumed Britain's orphanages were maybe nicer than the states and that's why they had beds and were fully clothed and apparently weren't used for free labor.

*** British orphans were also used for free labor. Among other programs there was the home boy/girl system where they were sent to Canada to work in farms, houses etc up until the 1930s. It's even mentioned in Anne of Green Gables. But I'm sorry to hear about what your father went through. Growing up as an orphan in The Depression would have been a harrowing experience

**** It is mentioned in Anne of Green Gables, which starts with the Cuthberts sending away for a boy orphan to help out at their farm. By accident they end up with Anne, and a mixture of her charm and the horrible treatment promised by the runner-up family to take her is what convinces Marilla Cuthbert to keep the girl. (Which, on the whole, works out great for everyone.)

It's a lovely novel (and series of novels) and now I'm considering Anne going to a wizard school. She would have /loved/ it.

Bellatrix is crazy no doubt, but Narcissa and Andromeda are fine. As are Regulus and Sirius.

Walburga, Sirius' mother is described as crazy. But, two points. One, she's noted as going downhill after her husband dies, her firstborn is sent to prison for life and her youngest disappears completely. This all happened fairly close together and wouldn't be good for anyone's mental state. Second, Sirius is by no means impartial when it comes to his mother. Being a hateful, racist bitch does not necessarily mean crazy. I think Sirius mentioned a few others when he showed Harry the family tree, but again, Sirius is hardly impartial.

Also, the Blacks are universally gorgeous. While beauty of course doesn't mean anything in regard to their mental faculties, it is a good indication of not being an inbred genetic mess.

** The whole situation is messy. When writers are trying to make a Tom that is more relatable, they whitewash his past and actions. It is the same way that people will exaggerate the abuse that Harry received or the fact that Ron turned on him during the Tournament -- a Tournament they both had interest in actually participating in... at least at the start.

Tom was a sociopath, whether by birth or his circumstance is a question that really cannot be answered. J.K says that he would have reined in a lot of his more sadistic habits had Merope survived. Sadly, I think he still would have done what he did, I think he would have been more careful and more determined... less risks. He would not have feared death quite as much due to being out of the bombings and in the safety of magic.

He looked at the fellow orphans like they were beneath him and that he was better than them. I guess, in some sense, he was right, which would have helped give him a groundwork for doing the things he did. Kids are cruel.

While the Matrons may not have starved him, or beaten him, food would be scarce, it would be a competition to be adopted, and the matrons could not be with each student. There was a reason as to why the orphanage system was abolished.

I mean, she used a love potion on Tom sr, that's not a good sign, even if we take into account wizards' attitudes towards such things.

*** I don't think whitewash is the right word there - maybe tangentially downplay? Because fanfiction is explicitly going to be changing the universe, not necessarily meant to fit exactly within canon. And if focusing on Tom, it's not always going to be the most interesting to have him be a psychopath from the start.

It's possible that fanon (or what people remember /feeling/ from reading the short passage in the books) influences our normal opinion of it, exaggerating little by little - but I do think it's a much more reasonable change than the Ron bashing ones (as a tangent to your point though, Harry didn't really have any interest in the Tournament other than a passing early daydream, and seemed to be one of the least interested ones in the school the last time I checked). Orphanages were not universally good - and if the author wants a more relatable Voldemort (which I think is a fine change to make from canon), that's a good place to start - a good explanation, for instance, of why he hated Muggles so much, and what might have prompted his control of his magic.

** Unpopular opinion: I actually enjoy fanfiction writers taking a dramatic spin to Harry or Tom's childhood. This of course is limited to the well written ones and not the extremely absurd. There are some that take it too far and have no character development to show for it. But I've found a good few who utilize the Dursleys or Wool's in a great way to almost justify the mentality of Harry or Tom.

I read one on Tom's childhood (and it was an AU so Harry was at Wool's with him) and the writer went into depth about how the children would steal Tom's belongings so he became very possessive and greedy and it was why he clung so heavily to Harry and was psychotically possessive of him. He was still a disturbed child that took his retaliation too far but I felt the writer was good at connecting the childhood to the growing attitude.

You aren't born evil but you can be born with mental health issues. Just because you're a sociopath doesn't mean you're going to go around murdering animals or people. I think it's definitely a Nature vs Nurture argument. Maybe Tom Riddle was undiagnosed socio or psychopath, but he wouldn't have reached such lengths without Wool's and World War II and even the Slytherin House.

Just kinda my take on it. I think any trope can be good if it's well written. I've read some stories that were insane, pure crack, but they were funny and well written and managed to bring you in even though it was completely unbelievable.

**** He knew of the procedures to get to shelter during the bombings. Even if nothing actually happened, he was still alive during the war which is scarring in its own way. He had to go back every summer and you can't say that there wasn't a fear of something happening each summer. Whether it was a bomb dropping or soldiers on the street or even the rationing of supplies. It's still a stressful time added onto being at an Orphanage filled with kids and adults who don't like him and when he's away from all that, he's at Hogwarts where he's being called mudblood and getting bullied by the pureblood Slytherins.

None of it excuses his actions but it certainly adds to it. And my only real point was that I enjoy certain fanfiction that put emphasis on a bad living condition and show character growth. I like for it to be better detailed and explain how he became so twisted. Whether because of the War or Wool's or Slytherin.

Really the war was barely even a part of my original argument.

** Personally, I chalk it up to WW2 + Grindelwald + Oprhanage + Fear of the Unknown. As evidenced in EVERY HP book: Kids are cruel.

I'm not faulting that Tom was evil. I'm saying the situation is what gave birth to it. At the orphanage he was treated like crap because of the accidental magic. Add in WW2. Orphanage treatment (if not the caregivers, the kids themselves). And then he comes to hogwarts. in SLYTHERIN. During Grindelwald's time. So pureblood idealogy beats him down.

I still say Dumbledore had the chance when he first picked up Tom to steer him in the right direction, but he didn't take it. Add in Dippet not letting him stay in the castle for the summer. And Dumbledore probably sticking his nose into every facet of Tom's life with his suspicions?

I'm not surprised Tom turned out that way. I am surprised that Harry didn't end up that way. His circumstances are eerily similar to Tom's after all.

***** I have to wonder how the fuck...pretty much everything relating to students living in the muggle world worked during WW2.

OK so most of the children in London were evacuated in 1939 but all the kids going to Hogwarts were supposed to get to King's Cross on September 1st for the following years. Because that wouldn't look suspicious.

Someone is evacuated at age 9 in 1939. In 1941 they get their Hogwarts letter while they're living with their host family - who then have to be told about magic. Four years later they're reunited with their real parents who they now have to tell about magic, leaving a random muggle family in the countryside in the know.

More amusingly, Operation Pied Piper went on during September 1st-4th 1939. So imagine a group of Hogwarts students getting caught up and ending up on the wrong train and being evacuated, while the pureblood ones are berated for their lack of gas masks. Or a group of muggle evacuees getting pushed through the barrier in the crush, following the other students on to the train and ending up at Hogwarts.

And more specifically to Tom. If everyone in Wool's Orphanage were evacuated in Operation Pied Piper, then the orphanage building would have been left empty or re-purposed. Since he wouldn't have been evacuated, instead going to Hogwarts, and therefore wouldn't have been billeted anywhere, when he returned from Hogwarts in July 1940 he would have had nowhere to go.

**** Not sure why you are being downvoted. The Blitz was in September 1940 and by the time Voldemort returned to London, Germany had shifted most of its air assets to the east because they were about to or already in the process of invading the Soviets. What remained in France were fighters, naval aviation and a token force.

*** Bullshit. The Blitz didn't begin until he was 13 and back in Hogwarts. Riddle was a sadistic psychopath before the world war even broke out. And By the time the V1s came flying, Voldemort had already killed four people, so that's not an explanation either.

This is exactly the kind of whitewashing OP complains about, just with the Luftwaffe as supposed culprit rather than the orphanage. Not to mention that children were evacuated to the countryside if at all possible.

** It seems like not only fanfic authors, but people in general want to find a reason why someone is evil, a reason that isn't related to a disorder. But people can have abnormal tendencies and comeing up with justifications for Tom's actions is a bit too much for me. There was a post recently about how HP characters are flawed, and Riddle was given as one of the examples whose backstory makes him somewhat human. I'm not sure about that, at least if we talk about understanding why he felt the need to take those kids to that cave or release a basilisk. The way Rowling wrote him in that orphanage, it just felt like she made him evil from the start. I suppose we can talk about the atachment disorder, but I don't know how much that would explain his actions.

  "Dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white; the whole place was shabby but spotlessly clean. Harry and the older Dumbledore followed.

  Before the front door had closed behind them, a skinny, harassed-looking woman came scurrying toward them. She had a sharp-featured face that appeared more anxious than unkind, and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked toward Dumbledore.

  "And take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Billy Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalley's oozing all over his sheets---chicken pox on top of everything else," she said to nobody in particular, and then her eyes fell upon Dumbledore and she stopped dead in her tracks, looking as astonished as if a giraffe had just crossed her threshold."
#+end_quote

The rest of the scene continues in that vein, giving the impression that times were hard but the caretakers took their responsibilities seriously. Nowhere does it indicate abuse, and the only comments the Matron makes are regarding Tom's behavior and how he conducts himself. She may not have received the level of education that social care workers receive nowadays, but she clearly picked up on his anti-social behavior.

**** Nowhere does it indicate that abuse didn't happen. Clean hallways and medicine for sick kids doesn't mean there was no abuse. Go find me the passages describing newborn care, discipline techniques, schooling, religious instruction, or anything else. The fact that they didn't demonstrate abuse in front of a visiting teacher doesn't mean it wasn't there.

I don't even necessarily believe the matron's description of Tom as antisocial. It was standard at the time to describe children in orphanages as inherently bad, since it was believed that they were generally the product of sin, so the stain of their birth doomed them to a life of criminality.

We know there was an awful lot of abuse in orphanages at the time, so the simplest, most historically accurate depiction of this orphanage in fanfiction would be to make it abusive too. If some fanfiction writer wants to portray this orphanage as unusually nurturing, that's fine, but it's bizarre to complain about the writers who portray it with historical accuracy.

  It's disconcerting when writers whitewash Tom's actions as 'acting out against his tormenters' or something.
#+end_quote

Why? If I want to say the sky is green in my story, I will. It's my story, I'm free to write it in any way I want. If I want to make Dumbles shove compulsion charmed lemon drops down every kid's throat I will, if I make a story where McGonagall turned into a rabbit instead of a cat I will. It's fanfiction. If in my story Tom was abused at Wool's Orphanage then that's how I decided to write the story. It doesn't have any reflection on canon, just like if I make Snape Draco's godfather. I agree partially that seeing a lot of people write about the same topic as if it were canon, annoys me slightly but only in the sense that I've seen it so often rather than other creative avenues that lead to another result.

There are sites that say Psychopathy is a mix between nature and nurture, and it's not immediately clear how much of one side vs the other. So, in my opinion, we can't immediately say whether his environment did or did not contribute to his problem.

Let's look at other canon stuff. Tom initially thinks Dumbledore is a doctor for a sanitorium, a mental institution. Why would a kid think that? They heard it from someone is usually the most likely scenario. If he didn't hear it from someone then he must have a reason to think that. Either way, it can be assumed Tom has heard the people around him think he's crazy.

In an interview, JK said Tom didn't love because his mother died, not from Amortentia nonsense, and said he would have turned out very differently if his mother was alive. Obviously Tom didn't get any motherly love from the matrons, or any other adult in the facility or he would have turned out differently. That tells me nurture was indeed the decider in his case.

Some people thought he was crazy, never received motherly love, obviously wasn't watched enough since the matron said in her own words she never caught him bullying the other kids. Sounds like a bad environment to me, regardless of if they were doing the best they can, their best wasn't enough.

**** Please, let us not forget a few facts.

First of all, Harry was loved for the most important moments of his life - the first years of it. Tom never got the chance to taste love except perhaps 10 seconds and never again.

Second, Harry should've become an obscurus, yet what people say is that thanks to his mother's sacrificial magic, his own knew it was loved long before Harry did - and the same magic probably comforted Harry silently. Tom didn't have anything like that.

Third, from 11 on, Harry got a lot of love in Gryffindor and could heal. Tom never had that, because he was a Slytherin where it's eat or be eaten, and was thought to be a muggleborn, or, as the Slytherin purebloods say, a "mudblood." Which meant he was probably bullied at first and even if he wasn't, Slytherin certainly didn't show him any love, because that's not how Slytherin/works./

Though I do agree that Tom's nature had a lot to do with what he became, mostly because the Gaunts were inbred to insanity and one generation of new blood could hardly salvage all of it, there were also many other factors that made Tom into Voldemort, and it is not all as black and white as your comment made it out to be.

**** Worse Life? How do you evaluate the degree of suffering for people? Not only was the discussion not "Who has it worse", but you shouldn't evaluate two people's lives on some tally system of good and bad things happening to them to see "Who had it worse"

We see the story from Harry's perspective, so you can't know what Tom thought. It's easy to think of Tom Riddle as an otherworldly monster, but as in the 6th book, Harry grows up and learns Tom Riddle's childhood. He's not some otherworldly monster, he's a human, he had a childhood, etc.

Edit: Adding on to this because I don't feel I gave a sufficient answer. Let's say Harry did have a worse life, so what? Harry and Tom are two different people because one person reacted a certain way to certain stimuli and environmental changes, doesn't mean another person would react in a similar manner. If your argument is Harry suffered but he didn't turn out a psychopath, we've already established it's a mix between nature and nurture and that according to JK Tom's turned out the way he did from his nurture. The fact Harry didn't has no bearing on Tom.

** I found the same thing rereading those chapters while working on a fic. Neither the matron nor Tom ever says or does anything to indicate mistreatment. On the other hand, killing of animals while still a child is a textbook red flag for a serial killer in the making, and who knows what he did to the two kids he took out to that seaside cave. Young Tom's demeanor isn't that of an abuse or bullying victim that's been lashing out at his tormentors; he's cold, aloof, and arrogant, someone that's already tasted power and special-ness and decided he wants more.

Now, I do agree with the fics that argue that Dumbledore's handling didn't exactly help matters. He showed someone obsessed with power and control that others could still exert power and control over him, which would only drive Tom to acquire more power as aggressively as possible.

Could Tom have turned out differently with a different upbringing? Maybe, but to at least some degree he seems to have just been wired wrong.
