But why would Dumbledore do that though? Does he want Hogwarts to take the Triwazrd Cup so badly?

***** Easy, Dumbledore won every award he could as a student, but he never had a chance to do the Triwizard Tournament, as it was discontinued over hundred years before he started school. So now the Tournament has been reintroduced, he sees his chance.

It would probably be a crackfic anyway, so both old Dumbledore doing the tournament or Dumbledore using polyjuice to impersonate a student would be possible.

****** GoF fanon - Harry is not magically bound to compete because he didn't write his name. He only becomes bound once he agrees to compete.

Therefore if Dumbledore took Polyjuice and actively decided to complete the tournament then it would fulfill the contract. Shit, I better get started on this goldmine plot bunny.

****** If it crackfic, you might as well just have him Time-Turner himself, and Polyjuice into a student, so that he can both compete and judge.

*********** Give it a shot! If you're lost on where to begin, start with Dumbledore in his office having a late-life crisis and coming up with this brilliant idea to help Harry get out of competing. Then show him systematically and nonchalantly ripping the Tasks and competitors apart. Figuratively.

** No, what would make more sense is that Voldemort has Crouch change the names to all the headmasters/headmistresses and they are all forced to compete, thus allowing Crouch to grab Harry and escape with Voldemort. Actually I really like this idea now someone needs to write it.

**** I know what you should do. Dumbledore pretends Harry's name came out as a 4th champion, then concocts a plan with Harry so that Dumbledore impersonates him to compete.

You can include the backlash Harry gets over the magic Dumbledore uses.
