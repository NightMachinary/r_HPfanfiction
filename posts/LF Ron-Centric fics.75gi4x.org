I'm sick of all the Ron-bashing going on in HP fanfiction, so I'd like to read some more stories with him as the main character. I've read a few Ron-centric stories which were really good, but haven't seen all that many recently...

So, anyone have any recs for me? Can be any kind of story, Doesn't have to be Ron/Hermione; doesn't have to be canon compliant (though I won't reject the fic if it is either of those things). Only thing I ask is that Ron is either the main character, or one of the main characters -- and that he's portrayed in a positive way.


** Ron's generally a good guy in my fics, and a hero in most. He's one of the two main characters in "The Dark Lord Never Died", where he is a spy for Dumbledore in a Wizarding Britain ruled by Lucius Malfoy.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
