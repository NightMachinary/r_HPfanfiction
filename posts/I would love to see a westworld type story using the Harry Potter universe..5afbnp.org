I've been watching the new HBO Show "Westworld", and thinking about how it could fit with Harry Potter fanfiction.

For example, the "Guests" could be Self-Insert type characters (fans of the Harry Potter book/movie series?), and the Harry Potter characters the "Hosts". So if the story is based in Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. The "Guests" arrive on the Hogwarts Express. Teenage "Guests" go to Hogwarts, and adults in Hogsmeade or something.


** That would be very interesting... Guests choosing to join Voldemort or Dumbledore, being able to live storylines like the Horcrux hunt as a quest... Some freaky fans getting kinda in love with hosts of their favourite characters... It could unravel in a fun way.

** It's not really what you're talking about, but you should check out The Hogwarts Fanfiction Academy by Meir Brin. Features self inserts interacting with canon characters, although in a far more insane way.
