I think the title says it all. Personally I mostly come across Veela, Vampire or Werewolve fics - but theres gotta be more out there I can google!?

I read the odd fic were Harry is something the author totally made up, mostly unpronouncable and easily forgotten ;) , which I think is cool as it lets the authors creativity out and flowing.

Though I hate the pseudo-names (I remember a novel series I read as a teen were there was a difference between vampire and vampyr and I was like "yeah ... the motherfu*king spelling ..." - I find that annoying.)

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

**** Hmm ... not nearly close enough.

Well, finished or not, and abandoned or not (and with Lord Mendasuit you can't be sure because this particular author has a tendency to jump with updates all over the place), what is is entertaining enough. I'd say more but I really don't want to spoil anything.

The game it gets crossed with is an 18+ game, though. But there are no on-screen 18+ elements in the fic, so eh, do try (the fic, not the game).

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

** Well I really liked linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1109346/chapters/2233131]]), simply because it is one of my fave authors out there

and then there is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5621051/1/Outcast-s-Alley]]) which was awesome but the sequel is abandoned i /think/ ... the AN is a bit confusing I am not sure. I'd love to find something similar.

Also maybe check linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/]]) out, though its not really a creature fic.

And also linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/762726]]).

Thats all I can think of right now.

EDIT: add linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3975367/chapters/8920222]]) i just read this and i love that they are creatures , mates , romantically involved but Harry is asexual!
