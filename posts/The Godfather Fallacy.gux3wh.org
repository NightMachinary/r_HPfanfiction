One of my biggest pet peeves in HP fanfiction is how a lot of the community seems to take the role of godfather way too far and serious (no pun intended). I think its really weird and makes no canonical sense to have Snape as Draco's godfather.

I also dislike how people act like being godfather is an infallible position and they have ultimate authority on a child's welfare and raising. Any thoughts or disagreements?


** Well, godparents are /usually/ expected to be the guardians of the godchild if the parents die, so it makes sense that people would write godparents acting as a parent in the character's life. But it doesn't really make sense if the godparent has all that power before actually becoming the guardian. Like, if the parents are alive and well, or if they are dead but the godparent hasn't claimed legal guardianship, then the godparent shouldn't really have any power or authority.

I would agree that Snape being Draco's godparent doesn't really jive with the way that they treat one another in canon, but it's not as... unlikely? unrealistic? as some of the other tropes I see tossed around frequently. I guess it comes down to personal taste; I personally have no issue with it.

You couldn't, the Dursley's abused Harry in the context of punishment(they mostly ignored him otherwise) and since Harry emerges physically and psychologically unharmed(he wasn't as healthy as he could be, but there were no actual problems), actually punishing the Dursley's is nearly impossible.

And dont say Harry being skinny means he's definitely malnourished, Harry was described as looking exactly like James who was also skinny despite being rich and spoiled.

Bullshit. Let me quote the law as it was in effect during the time they had Harry:

1. If any person who has attained the age of sixteen years and has the custody, charge, or care of any child or young person under that age, wilfully assaults, ill-treats, neglects, abandons, or exposes him, or causes or procures him to be assaulted, ill-treated, neglected, abandoned, or exposed, in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury to health (including injury to or loss of sight, or hearing, or limb, or organ of the body, and any mental derangement), that person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be liable--- (a)on conviction on indictment, to a fine . . . or in addition thereto, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding ten years;

2. For the purposes of this section--- (a)a parent or other person legally liable to maintain a child or young person, or the legal guardian of a child or young person, shall be deemed to have neglected him in a manner likely to cause injury to his health if he has failed to provide adequate food, clothing, medical aid or lodging for him (...)

The clothes Harry gets from them certainly fit the description. The cupboard - well it would count as inhumane treatment in any prison, nevermind putting a child there when two bedrooms were available.

And Petunia's swing with the frying pan is nothing short of attempted manslaughter (2-3 pounds of metal vs child's skull).

Also Harry's cupboard was pretty spacious considering that both Harry and Vernon fit inside it without any problem, the Dursleys are not gonna end up in prison over that.

Also ignoring that the frying pan wouldn't do shit against Harry(who can take bludgers to the head without dying), again In the UK you were allowed to beat you're child and it was up to the courts to decide if the used force was appropriate, that was only changed 2004, and Harry was physically unharmed, so they're not gonna end up in prison for this.

I know that list, and while the Dursleys are horrible human beings who morally certainly deserve prison, and everything they did is certainly abuse, its not the kind of child abuse you could guarantee prison for, the best case you could make for his near starvation at the beginning of chamber of secrets, but even that was clearly a result of Harry sharing the food meant for him with Hedwig, thats more animal cruelty than Child abuse. Certainly the law isn't clear enough to proclaim their attitude towards child abuse as more progressive than what we see of wizards.

Dumbledore is a flawed character. He made mistakes. And every single one of them was made worse because he thought he was the only one who could decide what to do. He refuses to seek the counsel of others, refuses to share information, and thinks he has the God-given right to make all the decisions.

****** Dumbledore doesn't control the Ministry - it was Crouch who wrongfully imprisoned Sirius without a trial.

#+begin_quote
  “Oh I know Crouch all right,” he said quietly. “He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban --- without a trial.” [...]

  And I wasn't the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects.
#+end_quote

How is any of this Dumbledore's fault? Espescially when the Potters have made it clear to Dumbledore that Sirius is their secret keeper. Even Remus, who was obviously very close to the Potters, thought Sirius was the secret keeper - how would Dumbledore know otherwise?

Throwing people into prison seems to be common practice in the ministry. If this was common practice, it's less surprising that nobody advocated a trial (or was unsuccessful in doing so); such an appeal is likely to be unsuccessful. And remember, Dumbledore has no reason to believe Sirius is innocent; indeed, he had suspected a spy in the Order for some time.

And here's how Sirius reacted to Peter's “murder”:

#+begin_quote
  “And Black standing there laughing, with what was left of Pettigrew in front of him... a heap of bloodstained robes and a few --- a few fragments ---”\\
  --- /Prisoner of Azkaban/, chapter 10 (/The Marauder's Map/)
#+end_quote

If (as is suggested), he did nothing to profess innocence, it's very quick and easy to send him to Azkaban, and save yourself the hassle of a show trial.

Of course the guardianship has to go to the Dursleys, they're the only relatives Harry has, and Sirius was (for all Dumbledore knew) imprisoned for betraying the Potters. Plus, staying with the Dursleys basically guarantees Harry's safety as he would be safe from Voldemort, who Dumbledore knows is alive. Why not another loving, wizarding family? See what happened to Dumbledore.

Dumbledore isn't perfect, he has his flaws obviously. But in this case, I don't think any of it is his fault

** I think part of it is that a lot of people may not have even heard of godparents before HP.

In PoA, Sirius tells Harry that he's his godfather, and that Harry's parents wanted him to be his guardian if anything happened to them. So it seems kind of natural to assume that maybe that's a common thing in wizarding culture.

No one I know has godparents in real life - it's not something I have any personal cultural reference for. I imagine a lot of other Americans from non-religious families are in the same boat as me.

Snape being Draco's godfather doesn't seem so far-fetched to me, since Narcissa went to him for the whole unbreakable vow thingy in HBP. Considering who the Malfoys were and what circles they were in choosing Snape, a powerful wizard who is also a Death Eater doesn't seem like a bad shout.

I had a godmother who was basically my mother and a godfather who takes very seriously the instruction of being my spiritual guide, even though I never showed any interest in believing in something.

A godparent's job in Christianity is, mainly, to teach the child the Christian faith. But it is also normal for the godparent and the parents of the child to come to an agreement that if something happens then the godparent will step in and adopt the child.

But in the wizarding would where Christianity has a history of killing of wizards and witches because of blasphemy and magic? I don't think teaching the kids the religion has the highest of priority, but it is highly likable that godparents can have adoptive rights and rights to make decisions over the child. Especially while thinking of Sirius Black. James Potter was the last Potter, Lily had a magic hating sister, why wouldn't they put the best friend of James as the first to get Harry if something happened to them? In war times non the less.

** To your first point, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever for Snape to be Draco's godfather. Lucius Malfoy is a pureblood bigot of the highest order, and Snape is a mere halfblood. It doesn't matter that they served the same master, there is absolutely nothing in canon to show that Lucius has any respect at all for Severus, and certainly no reason to make such an inferior person his heir's godfather. I think most people use it to excuse Snape's open favoritism for Draco, which is unnecessary as the fact that Draco is a Slytherin and son of a fellow Death Eater (taking his position of spy into account) is sufficient to explain it.

For your second point, in the old days being a godparent DID give you a lot of say in the raising of the child if something happened to the parents. In the absence of other immediate family members, you would simply take your godchild into your household. In the modern world there are other legal steps you have to take... the modern MUGGLE world, that is. Nothing says that the Wizarding world has any further requirement than being a godparent to show the parents' wishes on who would take over the care of their child.

I don't think that is clear. We only know of two godparents, Sirius to Harry and Harry to Teddy, and Harry didn't raise Teddy.

**** I don't think godparents are in the same category as saying "Jesus!" or even knowing various Bible stories. Becoming a godparent is very much a deliberate decision that has to be arranged and, as evidenced by this thread, it's clearly not consistently culturally ingrained. It's not "something you pick up" from living in a society but something one has to actively choose to participate in.

It /is/ possible that this was the case in 1970-1980s Britain (or even 1990s Britain when Rowling was initially writing) in the sense that having godparents was so normal and obvious everyone did it to fit in, but I'm sceptical of the idea. Mind you... I'm just trying to remember if Beck was going to be Bilborough's kid's godfather in Cracker. He was definitely giving the baby a present but what was the precise context of that?? Damn, I only rewatched that a few weeks ago too.
