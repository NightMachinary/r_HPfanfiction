Just thought you ought to know...

But really, I am a huge fan of their writing and I can't imagine this being any less of a gem than their other fics!


** I'm actually super proud of it. And I don't think anyone will read it.

I had more fun writing Sylvie than I've had on any fanfic I've ever worked on. And, like Austen, I'm pretty sure no one, aside from me, will enjoy her.

*** That was wonderful thank you! I was expecting it to be like the first chapter or two of something but that was a whole damn story.

**** People on here claim constantly that posting the entire thing when it's completed leads to more reviews.

They're wrong.

***** Who would think that? I would think that the people who comment tend to write once they finish reading. So if you post all at once the onus to write their opinion doesn't really hit until it is over.

***** Even if you don't have much reviews for your works, you're still one of the best alternate pairing Harry Potter fanfic writers I know, especially considering Fleur and Gabrielle are favourites of mine, and one of the few still active to boot.

Nice to see you on reddit by the way. I didn't know you were active here. I've been a fan since the days of Letters. I think it was something like 2012, back when I was still writing fanfic myself.

******* Some of them yeah. The rest are genuinely under-appreciated.

I'm still wondering wtf Ithaca was all about though. Care to drop a buddy a hint?

******** Ever wonder what happens if two people made Horcruxes out of the same object and then used that object to restore a body? Well, the Greek Sorceress Circe is a teensy bit annoyed that some English trollop named Riddle did just that.

********* Ahh so that's what Circe was about. The portal parts, the divinity parts, the unavoidable timey-wimey keystone parts, I understood fine. I just didn't get how Circe figured into this mess though the line she dropped in the first chapter did hint towards it, i just didn't see how.

*** I did like it a lot. I like Sylvie too, her flaws help make her more relatable. I like some of the parallels between this and 12 days.

I wish we had gotten a bit more of what happened to Harry. As a newer dad myself I feel a bit heartbroken that the story made me feel like he was so uninvolved. I can't imagine being so removed from my daughter's life in the future.

I enjoyed it a lot. I love your writing style. I cannot wait for new stories with your characters.

**** Yeah I can see that as a complaint. But I felt like Sylvie needed to be a bit more removed from Harry to make it really her story. I felt like I needed to intentionally limit Harry and Gabrielle to let Sylvie shine.

And sure, she's horrible. But she's also great.
