So what will you change?


** I'd switch the deaths of Sirius and Remus. I love Remus so it would break my heart to have him die so early, but Harry and Sirius have built quite a close emotional connection since the end of PoA and I'd have kept this character dynamic around until the end of the series.

  "With her...?"

  *"She can't change her appearance like she used to," explained Hermione.* *"I think her powers must have been affected by shock, or something."*

  *"I didn't know that could happen," said Harry.*

  "But she could do magic!" said Harry impatiently. "She could have got food and everything for herself by magic, couldn't she?"

  "Ah," said Dumbledore, "perhaps she could. But it is my belief---I am guessing again, but I am sure I am right --- that when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic. I do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer. *Of course, it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers; that can happen.* In any case, as you are about to see, Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life."

** I wouldn't really change much of the plot, since I doubt I could do much better. I also happen to like Canon(there are still a couple things that annoy me).

Mostly I would just add a little more foreshadowing for future plot points, like the Hallows or the significance of wand allegiances.

I'd also specify a couple things that were mentioned in the books, but were apparently not clear enough, like Time Turners being able to change the past, or the purpose of Occlumency being to magically protect the mind instead of just protecting against Legilimency. In general explanations why 'obvious solutions' dont work.

Remove things that didn't make sense with later introduced Plot points, like Dumbledore flying to the ministry instead of using apparition. And use terms that weren't even invented until later books like Squib.

Another thing would be to to get numbers a little bit better sorted out to be more consistent, so stuff like the value of money and the number of wizards in the story makes more sense, but also stuff like how old they were at certain moment and dates in general.

One bigger change I would make is having Harry and Ron show more talent at magic and use it more often, since Deathly Hallows shows them as very competent compared to other wizards, when they only looked a little above average before with Harry even seeming to struggle quite a bit in sixth year.

I'd like to say that I would change the romance in the books, but I actually like that there wasn't a very big focus of it, and dont really mind the pairings.

And by far the biggest change I would make is to the Epilogue, where I change the name of Albus Severus to Albus Rubeus or something like that. Also remove the mention of the Malfoys, because it didn't make any sense that Draco didn't end up in prison after the war.

#+end_quote

I think you could easily do this for the Deathly Hallows since two were at Hogwarts for most of the books, Ron for example knew about the fairytale and him making a remark or just telling it Harry when first seeing the invisibility cloak wouldn't be out of place. For Dumbledore you could just be subtle and a casual mention by him how he's not wielding his first wand would be enough.

Slipping by a mention of Beedle in general is even easier, since you don't even have to connect the Tale of the Three Brothers to it, just have Ron make a remark about Babbitty Rabbitty when interacting with Sirius and it would make sense.

And because of Chocolate frog Cards introducing old powerful wizards like the Perevells isn't a problem either.

** Harry would have some friends in other houses. Some good female friendships. Goblet of Fire is a fun read but doesn't make a lot of narrative sense. Harry realises there is a pattern with almost dying/his life being in danger when he gets informed there is a mass murderer after him, he starts taking magic a little more serious. He doesn't get on Voldemort/Dumbledore level, but he is good enough at the fighting aspect that luck can play a realistic role.

Order of the Phoenix Harry would be taking the occlumemcy training seriously. He informs adults when he sees Arthur getting attacked by Nagini. Adults don't head his warning because it wasnt Arthur's turn to guard the prophecy, turns out Arthur traded shifts with someone without informing Dumbledore. Arthur gets maimed (loses and arm/leg) for life. Ron gets to realise that this shit is serious and grows up a little. Harry was already mad at adults for having to solve all their problems and feels he can't trust them anymore. He never had trustworthy aduls in his life. He 'rebels' and thinks he can do a better job. Dumbledore Army starts. Harry stops blocking Voldemort and tries to see what's up to instead. He gets a few success out of it, but it bites him in the ass when Sirius dies. He tries to blame adults around him like but realises it's his fault.

*** I always liked the idea that they technically could, as in the spell would let them do that, but who they were wouldn't allow it. Both of them defied Voldemort personally three times and were pretty decently involved in the war. They were also both highly stubborn and brave, determined people. My interpretation of the characters would mean they wouldn't fort up and let everything else burn, they'd try do something, and that something was a trick. Flush out the spy with bait and try ambush whoever it was (I believe it's canon that the Order knew there was a spy, they just didn't know who) and they just got overconfident and fucked up.

*** I received two responses (well besides "plot reasons") to a similar question I posed about the Fidelius.

One response said that the Fidelius charm had been improved between 1981 and 1997 that now allowed the owner of the property to be the Secret keeper.

The second response postulated that Arthur and Bill didn't own the Burrow and Shell Cottage and that Aunt Muriel did which allowed Arthur and Bill to be their respective secret keepers.

Nothing in canon that even hints that these are true but at least they are a little better than just plot hole/plot reasons.

We know that people at the very least spend time to improve potions and potion ingredients. Ie snape and i think dumbledore wrote an essay about dragons blood.

And I think dumbledore did figure out how to send messages through a patronus.

Like maybe wand movements and incantations could be slightly changed for more complicated spells.

The second theory is pretty interesting. It kind of reminds me of vampire lore like getting uninvited from a house like in true blood.

***** I think the last part is due to canon where if the secret keeper of a fidelius charmed property dies then everyone who knew the secret becomes the secret keeper. Which means any of them can give away the secret. So maybe once you get into a multiple secret keeper arena the magic doesn't care if an owner is one of those multiples.

So you would think that one desired improvement would be the ability to transfer secret keepers. Eg you already removed the knowledge of the property from everyone else (which is why the power needed may be high if lots of people know the information you are trying to hide) and stored that knowledge in one person. Now you're just switching where the knowledge is kept.

If I remember correctly at no time in canon was the fidelius recast over Grimmauld Place with only Harry as the Secret keeper. So the "restriction" of ownership and fidelius holds.

Of course if I'm wrong (ie., fidelius recast with Harry as the secret keeper) it just means we've identified another plot hole.

Hermione in book 7 says that they are all Secret Keepers. And they think they accidently let in that death eater so they are not sure if they can go back after the ministry mission.

I would kill off more Weasley's because it isn't logical that only 1/9 of them died -- definitely kill Arthur and let Ron have a maturity moment with that, probably keep Fred dead and maybe kill George too, possibly kill Molly so that its poetic to leave the golden trio all orphaned at the end of the war (Hermione's parents count as orphaned). Let Neville, Ginny, Luna, and Hermione all battle Bellatrix and they kill her together because Bellatrix directly harmed them the most (let's assume Bellatrix is the one who killed Molly in my new universe).

** I would probably make it a little darker and remove the epilogue (the whole "all was well" crap makes me cringe even now, the same as "Albus Severus").

​

I think I would make some changes about the Unforgivable Curses; Crucio and Imperio are cool, but Avada Kedavra makes things weird. If such a spell existed, every death eater should use it, but in canon, they use a bunch of different spells. And it takes so much magic from, well, magic. I mean, the Battle of Hogwarts was great because we saw all those cool things wizards can do. Neville and Sprout used dangerous plants, McGonagall led a charge of desks to the battle, bewitched suits of armour fought death eaters, Hagrid's creatures joined the battle and many more. It was amazing, but if Avada Kedavra exists in the way it did in canon, then it all comes to shouting and waving a wand. I think I would make Avada Kedavra either so difficult no one could use it, or make it have some serious consequences so no one would want to use it.

​

As much as it hurts me, I would kill more Weasleys. It's a little unbelievable that only Fred died. I mean, Arthur and Percy worked at the Ministry when it was under Voldemort's control, and Ginny went to Hogwarts! I think I would kill at least 3 of them.

​

I would kill one of the Golden Trio. I've read somewhere that when JKR was depressed after her mother's death, she wanted to kill Ron, and I think HBP is a great moment to do this. So yeah, Harry would probably take too much time to find bezoar and Ron would die. It would give Harry a serious push to fight, and make it really sink that they are at war.

​

I like the scar they gave Hermione in the movies, so I would make it happen in the books too.

​

Instead of Sirius, I would kill Remus in OOTP. I loved them both, but I kind of don't see the point of Remus staying alive till the BOH except for giving him a child he would orphan in a matter of days, and I have no feelings about Teddy, so yeah. And it would hurt so much more if Sirius died in HBP or the beginning of DH or even during BOH.

​

I think I would like to add a little bit to JKR world-building; patch a few plotholes, explain a bit more in certain aspects, and include a little more about Lily and James. I always find it so weird that Harry never tried to find out more about his family. He was at Hogwarts, surrounded by people who knew Lily and James, but he doesn't really ask questions or search for things about them in school records, papers, books, whatever.

​

Also, I would remove the roaring monster in Harry's chest. I blame JKR's poor romance-writing skill for my dislike of Harry and Ginny together. So yeah, I would probably change the pairings too, though I would not make it as permanent as JKR. The ending should be open so the reader could fill the gaps with his vision of what happened next.

**** I disagree. Why would it be so lame? Ron is Harry's best friend, and his death would have the biggest impact on Harry. It would hurt Harry the most, and as much as I hate to say it, Ron wasn't /that/ needed during the search for Horcruxes. I don't think Ron and Harry would be successful without Hermione. She was the one who made plans and prepared for the hunt, so killing her would probably ruin the chances of destroying Voldemort. Harry knows Voldemort well, but it would be difficult to accomplish his task if Hermione didn't research Horcruxes or packed the essentials they would need.

He loved Hermione, but the voices made him hurt her, and Really hurt Harry. He knew they couldn't afford to keep him contained, so he'd kill himself, confirming that an AK can also destroy a Crux, while he's at it.

And then Harry and Hermione can have a little fling over the emotions involved, before realizing that they liked eachother better as friends, and deciding to never talk about that night, ever again.

** 1. Use the real-world calendar- 1st September isn't always Sunday. Or dump the use of weekdays as a reference- perhaps the wizarding world operates on moon cycles: "See you Sunday!" "What?" "She means second Gibbous descending."

2. Hermione isn't given the Time Turner by professorial fiat- she solves a long-standing mystery that leads her to it; her use of it wouldn't be approved (though it wouldn't need to be since /there is no reason any of the third year classes should conflict/); she leverages it until the end of the year, when making a change to past events (Sirius' soul being stolen) causes it to break- or maybe that's how they change things- usually the turn back is only for observation, but by Turning back and breaking it, they are given a second chance. There is still a Time room at the DoM, but the Unspeakables obviously don't have the key to making a traveling device like the one Hermione found.

3. Lily invented the Wolfsbane draught for Remus and published the formula anonymously at James' suggestion (and Sirius' protestations) -- because Lily was awesome, and that would be evidence of it.

4. The Goblet of Fire is the tournament trophy. It has unique divining properties valued by all three schools. Throughout the fourth book Harry has nightmares of the Cup, always feeling its presence threatening his future.

5. The Order of the Phoenix is heard to implement several operations of mixed outcome; they're there when Voldemort opens up Azkaban and are involved with tracking recruited Death Eaters based upon Harry's memories of the graveyard.

6. During Half-Blood Prince, Harry goes out of Hogwarts on day-trips with Order members, particularly Albus as he hunts for evidence of Riddle's method for immortality. Sometimes it's Harry's lonely upbringing which helps him identify with Riddle and find key clues; other times it just proves painfully educational

7. Redo the Battle of Seven Potters to not use ridiculous tactics and instead display Harry's talent for improvisation during battle; I would have set up a reason why returning to Privet drive was necessary. I would have had Moody, Tonks and Lupin show up at his door a week early of a sudden and have them shuffle Harry and the Dursleys out, creating a running battle where Harry is pursued on a broom. Vernon protests too long and gets murdered despite Petunia urging him to go along, then the surviving two Dursleys get disapparated to a safe place. All sorts of hijinks could ensue as Harry tries to find a quiet place to get a breath and escape to safety, knowing that any spell or attempt at apparation would be detected.

Hedwig would have died saving him from a killing curse as in the movie- because that's the right way to do it. Hedwig's death was the symbol of Harry's departure from childhood, but she deserved a better death than being treated like an action figure accessory.

Similarly, the end battle is a bit too much of a cartoonish showdown with bad dialogue between Harry and Voldemort.

In the realm of overall changes, I would have made certain Ron was more than comedic relief- he should have been a paragon of loyalty as he demonstrated in the early books. It would make the turn in book seven more of a surprise instead of 'Really? Again?' Also, he ought to make regular comments of 'Of course that's the way it works in magical society', particularly about things that aren't purely factual, like biases and tendencies and grooming habits. In particular, Ron should have been the cook during the last book, and his departure really a blow to Harry and Hermione's ability to endure the camping.

** Many changes:

- The Dursleys tried their best with Harry, but were overwhelmed with raising a magical child (imagine tantrums with accidental magic!). They did lose their temper a few times, but never abused Harry. This change will remove the overused "abusive childhood" trope that has become formulaic in children's literature. It will also make Dumbledore not into a negligent shithead in this case.
- Year 1 plot can remain mostly the same. But the detention in the Forbidden Forest makes no sense and should be deleted. Voldemort didn't flee for Albania after being stopped. He tried to seek out other followers.
- In Year 2, once the first attack on students happened, they figured out it was a Basilisk, and Dumbledore locked down the school accordingly. Lucius however would stir much bigger trouble here (such as trying to send Ginny to Azkaban).
- There will be NO time turners in my version of the story. They got Wormtail and exonerated Sirius, but Voldemort found Barty Jr, he broke free, and began impersonating his father. Harry moved into Grimmauld Place and began receiving training.
- Barty Jr ala Barty Sr hacked the Goblet and got Harry in. The whole Trio was accused by the school of cheating. Barty Jr recruited more Death Eaters (Carrows or Macnair or Avery). Only Harry turned up in the Graveyard and was subdued by multiple Death Eaters after a reasonable fight. Barty Jr, still present at Hogwarts, easily put Fudge under Imperius.
- Barty Jr, through imperiused Fudge, began populating Ministry with their minions. Actions against Dumbledore and Harry went on as in canon. Harry, however, was relatively well trained at this time quickly turned the table on Umbridge when she tried to pull the blood quill trick. Dumbledore then memory charmed Umbridge into believing she had won, but asked Harry to stay low this time.
- In the background, the Order was running a covert op for the control of the Ministry and losing. Voldemort however was fixated on getting the prophecy, against the advice by Barty and Lucius. Dumbledore decided to lure him into the Ministry using the prophecy (already replaced with a fake at this time) and expose him.
- DA was still formed. Hermione cursed contract with much more severe penalty than in canon, but told everyone upfront. This DA met much more frequently and was further guided by Dumbledore, Remus, and Sirius. When they were exposed, Dumbledore went rogue and kidnapped Umbridge.
- Voldemort pulled the same trick of torturing Sirius, which Harry saw through immediately. Sirius on the other hand suggested that this was their chance of luring Voldemort into the open and spring a huge reverse trap on Death Eaters. In the ensuing battle, Voldemort was exposed, several Death Eaters were killed, but they lost Arthur Weasley. The Weasleys became radicalized, especially Ron and Ginny. When Fudge was ousted as Minister, Barty Jr made him commit suicide. He continued to sabotage and infiltrate the Ministry from within.
- Dumbledore was mortally injured on the Horcrux Hunt. Throughout the entire Year 6, they were gearing up for the coming war. There would be lots of training, magical theory, logistic, political, and strategy scenes, interspersed with a few teenager drama and romance. It was the calm before the storm.

** Among obvious things (more diverse, avoiding clear anti-Semitic tropes, having Harry be less abused and making Dumbledore less manipulative), I'd want to build up a lot of supporting characters. Oliver Wood serves like an elder brother to Harry in my headcanon, since he takes Harry under his wing from the start of his first year. I'd want to see them stay in touch over the next few years (maybe Oliver convinces Harry to play professional quidditch instead of being an auror)

Honestly, more development for background characters in other houses, even giving firm numbers on HOW MANY Hogwarts students there are.

Also, re:Weasley family.... utilize Percy Weasley. Was he a sleeper agent in the Ministry who isolated his family to keep them out of harm's way? What was it like being a blood traitor from a prominent order family, trapped in ministry employment? I would AT LEAST have the trio interact with Percy during the ministry break in, show that he doesn't want to be there and he wants a way out. I think it would be brilliant if one of the trio managed to make contact with Percy during that day and gives him a dumbledores army coin and that's how he gets to the battle of Hogwarts. Also, just make Percy seem like less of an arse in the series --- he's a teenager who got into an argument with his father and stormed out!

For couples who end up together.... I keep most of the core ones. Keep the epilogue. Replace Lupin/Tonks with Charlie Weasley/Tonks (young couple, same age, orphan child who wouldn't have as close a connection to Harry but he'd still see a lot of suffering from it. Obviously, Bill raises Charlie's son). Percy Weasley is bi, put him with Oliver Wood.

I'd have to debate this a LOT but POSSIBLY kill Ron at battle of Hogwarts. In a parallel to first year, he sacrifices himself so Harry and hermione can keep going. In that scenario, hermione ends up with either Viktor Krum or George Weasley.

** Not much! I like canon for the most part. A few small things I would add in though:

I'd give Parvati and Lavender a redemption arc and not leave Hermione with no female friends apart from Ginny who she's forced together with. JKR quite obviously had a chip on her shoulder when writing about all kinds of girls - Lavender and Parvati are described disparagingly, but so is Pansy, and Millicent, and even Fleur - all for different reasons.

Harry has an interest in Lily's life too, not just James's, and broadly Harry's teachers go more out of their way to stick up for and look out for him - it's a little absurd in canon how people who were both mentors /and/ colleagues of his parents don't make even the slightest attempt to reach out to their long-lost kid when given the chance. Obv JKR probably avoided this in canon to preserve the twist of the Snape-Lily relationship, but that could have been avoided by skilfully plotting around having to reveal anything - for an in-verse example, Slughorn doesn't reveal anything about the friendship despite both Lily /and/ Harry being his prize students.

I wouldn't write out Mrs Figg after book 5, she would make sporadic appearances as comic relief.

I'd make sure a note was thrown in about Hagrid and Madame Maxime's future at some point instead of giving them an extended sideplot over two books and then dropping it out of the blue. And I might nix Grawp because that plot really didn't go anywhere and imo it wasn't really needed, given that giants didn't come to otherwise play any role.

Lupin and Tonks would be canonically queer even if they did end up together at the end. I both like and don't like the pairing so I might also adjust the ages or flesh out the relationship a bit to smooth over the parts I find offputting. (currently it has a vibe of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares][Pair the Spares]])

I'd like Hermione to introduce Neville to muggle medicine and leave it open-ended but with a note of hope that Frank and Alice were able to be helped back towards some of their previous capabilities and selfhood.

And generally on that note, I'd include muggles more positively, because canon as-is treads an uncomfortable line between being pro-muggle and muggleborn /vocally/, but not so much in practice. I don't think that was intentional on JKR's part and I think a more switched-on editor would have been able to catch that and drop in instances or examples of /why/ muggles and muggleborns should be included - or shouldn't - rather than broadly leaving it as blind prejudice because the bad guys are just bad.

E: and also, because I forgot at first - there should be more Weasleys! Ron sets them up as a /huge/ family in book 1, so where are all the cousins? There should be something like 15 or more Weasleys in the school at any one time if they're so prolific.

** - No expilliarmus. I would make my main character respect his uncle/godfather/parents enough to actually fight back against their murderer.

- no Deathly Hallows. It was a cheap deus ex machina that JKR was forced to invent once she realized she'd written 6.5 books about a powerful villain who can only be killed by a prophesized child, and that she'd done nothing the whole series to give the hero a chance at winning.

- i would have not had the main characters all marry into the same family. Weird.

- i would have explained horcruxes more. Almost no mechanics provided about this super important plot device.

- Either Dumbledore is the MC/protagonist, or Harry has some independence. Book 7 really kind of revealed Harry has almost no agency, and just followed Dumbledore's orders - even from the grave - like a particularly well-trained dog.

- i would have acknowledged love isn't a "chest monster", and it doesn't happen with people that ruin big nights in horribly public fashion (R/HR Yule Ball).

And that's just for starters. I genuinely love books 1-4, when Harry and co. are children. But JKR had no idea how to transition from "children's story" to "young adult fiction". Romance, action, believable plot resolution: all of these things were missing from the HP canon. That's the real reason the fanfic community is still going strong, a decade later.

If I make Headship more of a thing then I would have Hermione as Lady Potter and Luna as Lady Black.

*** Honestly, I'd cut the long term-ness of the pairings all together. Post war, there should necessarily be less focus on blood purity (because the assholes who were the biggest jerks about it are all a gibbering mess on the floor, or past the veil, according to your cannon), and have /maybe/ a couple of people pair up from the school. Real life is such that not everyone marries whom they were with in high school. You travel (especially as a wizard who can go freaking anywhere), you figure out what region works for you, you make friends, and eventually love happens. I think because the series was written as a children's book, they needed to pair everyone off and have a tidy ending.

**** You say that, but Hogwarts is the only school in Britain and Ireland - it's not like there are loads of suitable partners waiting who went to another school. While I can see many people getting together outside of school, like after working together or whatnot, from what we see it is something of a cultural norm for wizards to pair off young and stay that way.

The British and Irish wizarding world is in many ways a closed, small, community - I like to think of it as effectively a small town (relative to Muggle standards), but decentralised because magic means you don't need to be in close physical proximity.

It reminds me a lot of the situation historically in the real world in small and relatively isolated communities - people tend not to date very many people over the course of a lifetime, with relationships generally carrying on until/unless something very bad happens. My grandparents and most people they knew got married young, stayed married, and are now basically all dead in pairs. But to be fair they had a small, largely static, set of options.

My parents' generation was much less like that, and mine not at all - almost everyone I know within 5 years of 30 in either direction has had multiple 'serious' relationships and barely any of us have kids, have been married yet etc.

Tldr: I think some of it can be explained by cultural differences, since although the books are set parallel to the real world, wizards aren't muggles.

I do agree narratively it seems a bit too 'neat' the way it was done though.

** First things first, I'd keep the Dursleys' abuse but change Harry's emotional stability. He was way, /way/ too emotionally stable in the books.

I'd also make Snape not be such a bully because it would make no sense for him to treat the love of his life's son like such a dirtbag as well as other students. The man's supposed to have good self-control since he's a mastered Occlumens! I'd also keep him alive and actually make him the master of the Elder Wand (meaning that Snape would Disarm Draco /before/ he fires the Killing Curse). I also would make him mean at first, but then I'd make him slowly realize that Harry is more like his mother.

I would keep Remus alive, of course, but I'd make Sirius die a more heroic death in HBP or DH.

I like the canon pairings, so I woudn't change anything about that, but I also would make Harry be a little smarter when it came to dating. His relationship with Cho Chang was an absolute farce, and I don't like that Harry acted like such a doofus throughout the whole thing and how he unknowingly took advantage of Cho's grief for Cedric. Oh, and speaking of Cedric, I'd keep him alive. I wouldn't "kill the spare."

I'd make Hermione be more understanding when it came to answering questions in class, for she never really gave anyone else a chance to speak.

I'd make Ron be more loyal and not use him for comic relief. In the books, he's shown as a good strategist, so I'd keep it that way.

I would give more insight into what Snape actually has to do and what he has to endure when he spies for the Order because in the books, JKR purposely made Snape seem like a villain for the purpose of him being a red herring, and Harry hated him too much to even think about what Snape normally does. I'd also make Snape kill Dumbledore like in the books, but I would make Harry really /think/ about Snape's actions and intentions.

I'd actually give Snape a backstory and give Lily a backstory, because we don't know too much about their childhoods. I, personally, wish to know about Snape and Lily's respective home lives, and I'd make their stories known if I were to rewrite the books.

I'd give every single important character in the series more depth. For some reason, it seems like JKR /really/ put effort into making Snape complicated, but none of the other characters seem as complex as he is, and humans are normally complex creatures.

To summarize all this, I'd just make the books more realistic with the human interactions and feelings. I'd also make the series a little darker.

3.  that means, no manipulative Dumbles, or all-knowing, all-powerfull etc. just there having a role of a headmaster, nothing else. also the gargoyle doesn't have a password so any student can actually go to him if they need help. wth was Dumbledore's job anyway? what was he doing all day long?
4.  even if I wouldn't go with a rooster, and normal wizard. I would not make him a Harry mentor for sure. he will just be a regular headmaster, maybe powerful so Voldy still won't try to take down the school. he also wouldn't be the one to take Harry to the Dursleys. it will be the ministry, because... only known relatives. and they won't leave him at the doorstep. they would talk to them. Dumbles will also not be order leader.
5.  I don't think I would want a prophecy there either. just the concept of the chosen one is...
6.  quidditch is out and instead we have dueling. there can still be quidditch, just like gobstones and other clubs. hell, Harry can even still be a seeker, it's just not a super important part of the story and not the whole school attends the matches.
7.  agree about slytherin having other characters than bullies. and also other houses. the whole series was completely gryffindor. the only exception was Luna and she didn't have such a big role anyway. more interhouse friendships and other houses could visit themselves in different dormitories. or sit at their tables etc.
8.  JK wanted to make Dean/Seamus, so I would def. do that.
9.  more magical spells. not just shooting. this especially in the movies, but even books didn't have much. the only duel that was exciting was Dumbles/Voldy in fifth book. otherwise it was meh. why couldn't the kids learn to make a globe out of water in charms? and generally more magical element, other weird magicks, maybe other animals understanding talents, other than snakes.
10. No Hinny. I like Romione though, they would stay. but Ginny was like... a fan.
11. not killing Fred!!! omg! I have a twin, that seriously struck me way too much.
12. before the seventh book was out there was this theory that McGonnagal was a hidden death eater and it made so much sense. from her calling muggles stupid to not helping Harry... ever, caring about quidditch more than rules (Harry was 1st year), being angry at the trio when they just defended themselves against the troll, etc. I wonder if I can still find that site somewhere. it was a solid theory.
13. no epilogue. just make it end when the battle ends. or maybe having a chapter or two healing or rebuilding so that it truly ends with their 7th year ending.
14. being a hufflepuff, badgers are pretty lame in comparison to a snake, lion and eagle. ... so hufflepuff mascot is obviously a bear.
15. the children will actually learn stuff. all the books are either adventure or writing essays. way too little time given to classes. essays don't do much. they can also practice the charms in some classrooms when lessons are out. including having a potions room where they can brew. this was in a couple of fics, but I'm pretty sure that's only fanon and not canon. otherwise, Hermione would use that in the books. they could still brew polyjuice in bathroom, since that is illegal.
16. Harry will get a snake after all the parsletounge drama.
17. having Dursleys not so evil. I mean, they kept him in a cupboard. without food. it would be fine if they just liked Dudley more, but Harry was truly abused. just giving him a normal room from the start and maybe some presents too. way less than to Dudley still, maybe a book and colored pencils, that's not much.

** I would give as much more classes scenes as possible. More of Hogwarts exploration, more of friendship bonding, more of animals and another types of magic and how they are used to solve routine problems of the group.

I Would make harry's and hermione's friendship more solid too. i think its just too much focused on harry and ron on a lot of the time.

I would have shown more of how magic people interact with muggle people using the weasley father as the shining light of these moments.

I would finally give more motive for harry to be with ginny besides from "lol i just like her now, shes heroic and plays very well".

** I would have more queer characters since there is none, (Dumbledore does NOT count, that is not representation), as far as characters who I think could be queer I think Ginny would be a powerful bisexual and maybe McGonagall a lesbian (she would be the ultimate lesbian, she literally can turn into a cat). There are more but I'll stop listing, I would also include more POC. As far as major plot points, I would keep Siruis alive at least until the final book. I think there was so much room there for them (Sirius and Harry) to develop such a wonderful relationship. I would also include Slytherin's that are good so it isn't as easy to dismiss the entire house as evil but it doesn't really make sense to me for every single Slytherin to be evil. I would also show that Harry and Ron while not as academic as Hermione still both very good wizards, they were played out to be a bit stupid which doesn't make sense considering they go on to help save the wizarding world. One major thing though is I would make Neville more of a prominent character, to me at least he is such an important character to the plot. It was possible that he was the wizard in the prophecy but that was glossed over, I also think his character arc from going from being very scared to showing a lot of courage in the final book wasn't very good. I mean it made sense that he got to that point but it didn't show how he got to that point so much, like what were his major turning points. I suppose you could say the battle of the department of ministries and staying at Hogwarts on the 7th year but it wasn't articulated much.

*** Uh....

Given how small and isolated the British magical community is, and the rarity of muggleborns, I'd say that Hogwarts is extremely diverse. The UK isn't America (which is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world) - if 1/4 of Hogwarts had been BAME, it would have felt like absurd woke-ism.

Most social scientific research I've come across lists ~10% of the population as not being heterosexual. I agree that one old man is not much representation. However, see my above point, RE: small, insular community. I think a few throwaway lines about non-conforming sexual orientations being "unacceptable" to purebloods should have been included if there were not going to be any LGBT characters.

First, erase the hard plotholes. Time turners is ofc the first thing that comes to mind.

Then, erase the soft plotholes. Like holy f what kind of absolute dickhead does not check up on his dead friend's child? (Remus)

Then, erase the moral holes. The disgusting romanticizing abuse for example.

Has anyone here actually read canon as an adult? I did, and I wish I hadn't, canon is so bad. Like so, so bad.

I even stopped reading HP ff, because of it.

** I would make Horcrux's actually split the Soul in half each time. 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%... 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16... it would explain why Tom was so bat shit insane, if he only had 0.78125% or 1/128 of a soul, by the end.

No cucking wonder, he didn't look human.

And I'd make a majority the minimum amount of a Soul you can have, and still be sane. 50% is too little, 51% is more than enough. So, unless you take some extensive measures to re-merge with some of them, you'll always go off the deep end after making a single Crux.

X---x---x----

Secondly, I'd make the Hollows actually useful. The Wand should grant Living Magic to it's master that will defend and attack on it's own, and let them use the magic of their opponents as well as their own, and you should have to steal it to gain it's mastery, but it should encourage you to take unhealthy risks. The Stone should let you command the dead and control your own soul, as well as pull/push others between life and death at will, and it should need to be Found by accident on your part to be mastered, but it should depress you as you use it, in an “On the scale of Totality, I am nought but dust” kind of way. And the Cloak should make you Unkillable, so that Death Can Not Find You, as well as grant complete undetectability as a side effect, not just invisibility, and it should need to be Inherited to master, but soon after you pass it on you die, Death catches up to everyone eventually.

If you become the MoD, you should get Wandless Magic and the ability to call the Wand anywhere and use it to kill anything, a Phoenix Animagus Form and the ability to travel to the afterlife and back yourself making physical death only a mild annoyance, and the ability to be anyone (any age, any race, any sex, any species, speak any language, never forget anything) and the ability to grant a lesser death-aversion to others. As well, the physical Hollows would become shadows of themselves, projections of your magic; while the Real power would be a part of you.

Why did Harry survive the Killing Curse? His father was dead. He was the Cloaks Master. He Could Not Be Killed. How did be survive the Dursley's? The Basilisk? The Dragon? The Maze? He Could Not Be Killed! Not until he produced a legitimate Heir to inherit the Cloak. Tricks don't work. Rape, Slavery, Adoption, Abortion; you name it, it's been tried. The Potters have had the Cloak for close to a thousand years, they've tried Everything at one point or another to be rid of it, and there's a self-translating-book around here somewhere with all that they've learnt (ask the goblins, I'm sure they're holding a copy. You don't piss off the un-endable Bloodline, after all). You die soon after you pass it on, but you must legitimately pass it on first.

**** Nah, I like that the Potter Bloodline can't be extinguished. It would mean that Death had always intended to have a Master that didn't want to be so. If the Potters spent forever trying to get rid of the thing because you died as soon as you passed it on, then whoever finally brought them together would then be doomed to watch their family grow old and die without them. They could protect them from accidents, but not old age.

They could visit their family, yes, but if they couldn't forget anything then eventually they'd have thousands of ‘best friends' and ‘lovers' and life would become meaningless. But still, they would be forced to live it.

If the Bloodline could be extinguished, then it wouldn't be a descendant of that oh-so-clever youngest Peverell to be cursed in such a way, but with the bloodline dead the Cloak wouldn't be Inheritable any more, which would mean it'd need another way to gain Mastery, which would make a MoD vastly more likely in the long run. Death is ‘all of human history is an eye blink' kind of long minded, a slightly stronger Cloak per human life is meaningless, when they each don't even live 200 years. Each passing death bringing that eventual conclusion ever closer, but if only a Peverell (and so, a Potter) can be the MoD, and the Cloak designates the next possible choice, then Death can influence the Master. Death would always know the Only possibility for the MoD, and all the stupid humans fighting over it would be meaningless.
