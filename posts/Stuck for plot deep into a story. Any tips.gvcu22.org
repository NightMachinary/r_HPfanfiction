I'm around 96,000 (Dollars? Holler! - I'm so sorry, but at the same time, not!!!) words into my Ron & Hermione fic from Hermione's POV. In my story, Ron went off to help Harry hunt Horcruxes and Hermione stayed behind. The boys still left on Bill and Fleur's wedding day and it's now Hermione's birthday, so they've been gone for about 6 weeks. It's too dangerous for Hermione to try and contact Ron.

And I have to fill about 2 months, maybe 3 or 4 chapters at the pace I've been going up to now, before the plot I have in mind begins again. I want interesting filler, not Hermione sitting around brooding and missing Ron, but I have no inspiration. I should say they're a couple already in my story and have been for about 6 months.

I want to keep it as Hermione's POV, I don't want to jump to Ron. I thought of devising a way they could communicate without Ron and Harry being traced but my magical imagination isn't working right now! I don't really want to do flashbacks because I haven't up until this point and I don't like changing style half way through a story. I thought about having Hermione try and help Ginny and all her friends still at Hogwarts, or the Order members at home, but I don't have any ideas of how. Not least because she's a target herself and needs to stay hidden.

More broadly speaking, where do you guys look for inspiration when you're having trouble getting from A to B in a story? I don't like skipping forward huge chunks of time but I might have to!

Honestly, typing out this whole post has kick started by brain a bit, but I'd love to hear some tips from fellow writers.


** Hermione could help muggleborns throughout Britain escape. Time skips aren't always bad. See [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7469856/1/Hallowed]] for a good example of a time skip.

** My question is why do you have to detail out those months? If nothing of significance happens why not skip ahead to where the action picks up again. A short synopsis of what little has happened during the dull period and you get back to the plot.

*** Do you see Hermione staying put and not doing anything of importance for months while Harry and Ron brave danger?

**** This isn't my story...it is OP's. So that is a question for them. And that is why I say /if/ nothing of important happens to skip over it. Writers do it all the time. Example:

"The six weeks Ron and Harry were gone were the longest in her life. She tried to keep herself busy by researching horcrux locations and assisting with other muggleborn families on the run, but she felt so useless and alone. She'd gone a month and a half with no word from her boys before finally...mercifully...the wireless crackled to life and she heard the voice she'd missed so desperately.*

It is my opinion that a lot of writers tend to overthink things. If OP wants Hermione to feel alone and helpless for six weeks than convey that and move on. Don't spend chapters on 'filler' that you think isn't vital to the plot.

***** Yes and no. As I wrote in the other post on the thread, there needs to be a reason for them to be separated, and once that reason is determined, many of our questions will be answered.

Other than that, researching horcruxes and assisting other muggleborns on the run both entail going outside, which can lead to all sorts of interesting adventures.

** Maybe Hermione starts building an army worthy of Mordor? Or at least an arsenal of badass and ridiculous weaponry like a lightning-motorcycle-chainsaw-guitar.

Maybe do a bit of potion brewing.

Maybe she builds a small tactical nuke out of a smarties tube and the philosophers stone.

Maybe she milks a rainbow cow and acquires some high grade ice-cream out of it. Not useful but very yum-yum.

Maybe she gets kidnapped by Death Eaters. And gets rescued by the most unlikely person imaginable: John Cena. Tu du du duuuuu. Tu du du duuuuuuu

Maybe she meets vampire?

Maybe she gets transported to another world of magical beings called the t'chango who are currently having a crisis of a missing emotion bringing their world out of balance. This causes all kinds of strange phenomena to happen including a bitterness in people's hearts. Hermione saves the day in dramatic fashion by reigniting the flame of hundred and saving the prince from eternal slumber. She returns to her world just in time to meet Ron and Harry again. Now having learned many lessons from the t'chango peoples she kicks voldemorts ass. Not with violence, but with ice-cream.

Some say they can still here the screaming...

** My first question is /why/ would Hermione stay behind? Assuming even vaguely canon personalities and relationship dynamics, and short of Hermione being physically incapacitated, I just can't see why Harry and Ron would want to leave her behind or why Hermione would allow herself to be left behind---and she is better at magic than either of them, assuming canonish skill levels.

Answering this question will probably get you most of the way to the answer about what she could and couldn't do in the meantime.

One thing I'd personally love to see is Hermione getting her hands dirty to make Harry's and Ron's lives easier. She'd do things like sneaking into Hogwarts or the Ministry and assassinating known Death Eaters, Snatchers, and collaborators. She might not be great at combat, but she has a massive arsenal of magic and is good at planning, after all.

Some of it might even backfire. For example, once they can communicate again,

*Harry:* So then, we figured out that Umbridge had the Locket horcrux, but the Daily Prophet said that Umbridge had been accidentally kissed by a Dementor, so we've hit a dead end.

*Hermione:* ... Ah, well, sorry about that... I mean, sorry to hear that. I had nothing to do with it, of course. I've just been sitting here, brewing potions, missing the two of you.

** Use DA coins or broken mirror to communicate between them.
