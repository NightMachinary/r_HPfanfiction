There are a few wholesome Harry stories out there, but most of them are one shots. The longer stories I have read turn Harry into a massive dick that lords his titles over people while he challanges them to honor duels and dabbles into dark magic, because magic is magic.

I really want to see a genuinely kind and wholesome Harry. No bashing.


** Linkffn(13230340) if you haven't seen it, yet. Incomplete but updates pretty frequently. Not too much plot, just Harry being kind, Dumbledore being silly, and it's mostly the adults doing the important stuff while Harry navigates his life in an awkward shape.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  An attempt to go against a popular trope. What if, instead of becoming dark/grey and gaining more power that way, Harry had been a little more considerate? Begins with a small change in first year, and sticks close to the original, but sometimes small changes can add up to change the world.

*** Thanks for the recommendation, this was a great read. Felt like I was reading Harry Potter for the first time all over again. The author is great at making the teachers seem competent without taking away from the trio's story.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** Harry is genuinely a good kid in Harry's New Home by kbinnz linkffn(4437151). It's a Snape-adopts-Harry story. If you're hooked on canon Snape, the prequel Harry's First Detention linkffn(4307359) gives a reason for the change in attitude.

*** I haven't looked at these fics in a while, but doesn't Snape use corporal punishment on Harry in the second one? I personally can't stand that, like, who in their right mind thinks using such a method of discipline on a severely abused child is alright??
