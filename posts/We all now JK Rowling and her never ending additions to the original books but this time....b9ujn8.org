** She said all the way back in 2007 that Dumbledore and Grindelwald had a sexual relationship. I'm actually surprised that she waited 12 years before making this point more explicit. I'm not bothered by it at all.

Since FB is still an ongoing story, I shall refrain from judging it until I've seen at least the third movie. But I really like the portrayal of Grindelwald so far, as there's finally a villain I feel sympathy for. I greatly enjoyed the scene where he burnt those Ministry goons to ashes.

Now, my peeve with JKR is that she cooks up stuffs that are inconsistent. A Professor McGonagall in 1927? It adds nothing to the story and will contradict lots of existing facts if she turns out to be the same one in the Books.

She clearly must be, as the McGonagalls were the Muggle side of the family.

My personal explanation is that she was granted a Time-Turner back in the First Wizarding War when she worked as a spy for the Ministry, she made a mistake with it at some point, and her timeline has been just a little fuzzy around the ages ever since. Sometimes she's one age, sometimes she's another.

*** [[https://www.hypable.com/when-was-mcgonagall-born-age/][This article]] argues that McGongall's presence in CoG squares pretty well both with the books and later Pottermore info. I know not everyone was convinced by it, but it's an interesting read.

..................

ugh.

She said they had an intense relationship, and later added that there was a sexual component. That is a completely different thing. The quote got mangled into a clickbait headline. Face it, you got Skeetered.

She also said that she wasn't interested in exploring the sexual side, and wanted to focus on the emotions. So like, while you are correct about homosexual pairing often being overly sexualized, this is not the case here.

** That wasn't what she said you'll be happy to hear:

  I'm less interested in the sexual side -- though I believe there is a sexual dimension to this relationship -- than I am in the sense of the emotions they felt for each other, which ultimately is the most fascinating thing about all human relationships."
#+end_quote

The media twisted it for an exciting headline, the statement itself is nothing new as we knew the relationship was intense and it had a sexual dynamic to it.

Grindelwald is manipulative, but Grindelwald isn't so in the same way as Voldemort. He's not without love and it's implied that Grindelwald did have some affection for Dumbledore in the books:

#+begin_quote
  At last he said, “Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it.”

  Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose.

  “They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I hope that it is true. I would like to think he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends . . . to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow . . .”

  “. . . or maybe from breaking into your tomb?” suggested Harry, and Dumbledore dabbed his eyes.

** I agree with you in that I also don't really consider the FB movies canon - in fact I watched parts of the first one, and that's pretty much the extent of my knowledge of them.

But, I mean, you can be a shitty, morally bankrupt person and still care about your close friends and family. To insist that Grindelwald couldn't have had any genuine feelings for Dumbledore kind of flattens his character. In my mind - and again, I don't really know anything about the prequel movies - he and Dumbledore had an intense, sizzling, partially intellectual summer fling that crashed and burned spectacularly. Mostly because the thought amuses the crap out of me.

Speaking of crap, JK Rowling has come out with stuff that is way more worth getting upset about. The whole thing with Nagini, the implication that post-resurrection Voldemort had a penis and used it to make a baby, the whole thing with the toilets... Hell, I'm still kind of upset about the idea that Snape had any romantic feelings for Harry's mom - back in the day this was a popular crackpot theory that most of us dismissed because it had terrible implications and didn't fit thematically with where it seemed Snape's character arc was going. Ah, the good old days.

I'm not actually sure where I'm going with this. To each their own, I guess. Just be sure your reasons for disliking Grindelwald's relationship with Dumbledore are based on the narrative and not some sort of latent homophobia.

** JKR literally did not say they had an "incredibly intense sexual relationship." [[http://tryingtobealwaystrying.tumblr.com/post/182858309202/jk-rowling-on-grindeldore-weve-seen-snippets-of][This]] is what she actually said (skip to ~0.23 in the video):

#+begin_quote
  Their relationship was incredibly intense. It was passionate, and it was a love relationship. But as happens in any relationship, gay or straight or whatever label we want to put on it, one never knows really what the other person is feeling. You can't know, you can believe you know.

  So I'm less interested in the sexual side -- though I believe there is a sexual dimension to this relationship -- than I am in the sense of the emotions they felt for each other, which ultimately is the most fascinating thing about all human relationships.
#+end_quote

Furthermore, their relationship being mutual doesn't contradict anything in the books. In fact, there are a few suggestions in DH that Grindelwald /wasn't/ just manipulating Dumbledore. It is said that he showed remorse in his later years, and Harry suggests in "King's Cross" that Grindelwald lied in order to prevent Voldemort from breaking into his tomb. Additionally, Grindelwald tells Voldemort "There is so much you do not understand," which, given Dumbledore's later line, "If he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not, perhaps, have dared to touch your blood. . . . But then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all," I take to imply that Grindelwald does understand love.

Also, I don't understand your complaint of "And now her addition is canon?" Because, well, yes. She's the author. What she writes is canon, even if you don't like it; that's what the word means.

Eh....

I take it more to mean that Girndelwald tells him that there is a lot more about the Hollows and the Elder Wand in particular than Voldemort could possibly manage to comprehend, instead of Grindelwald knowing about the Horcruxes and the protection of 'love' that is on Voldemort's target.

** Madame Rowling has a history of not quite being able to portray minorities without being as subtle as an anvil with a truckful of explosives tied to it. It's like she doesn't think a subtle portrayal will do. You can see it in her decision to stand behind the idea of a black Hermione, and you can see it here.

And I will leave it at that. She can write good stuff, she just isn't very good at writing characters who are in some way defined by being a minority of some kind.

She never said Hermione was black, she just said that Hermione doesn't need to be white - or am I wrong? ([[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/678888094339366914][example 1]], [[https://www.cnet.com/news/j-k-rowling-on-reaction-to-a-black-hermione-idiots-were-going-to-idiot/][example 2]])

  "But I decided not to get too agitated about it and simply state quite firmly that Hermione can be a black woman with my absolute blessing and enthusiasm."
#+end_quote

*can be*

Rowling's "Black Hermione" comments were in the face of idiots screaming "Hermione can't be portrayed by a black woman in CC because Hermione is white". Her answer is simply: "Hermione doesn't need to be white to be Hermione, and the actress fits wonderfully."

I don't see how that's hard to get or outrageous.

Where did I write that she said she was black? I only wrote that she stood behind the idea of a black Hermione (meaning that she supported the decision), not that she decided that she is black.

** I never really thought about the sexual aspect of their relations, but the idea of gay Dumbledore never bothered me (I have no troubles to think he "loved" Grindelwald). As for Grindelwald himself, I don't really know since we lack information, I believe he felt at least a feeling of kinship with Dumbledore, 2 young men extremely talented who wish to change the world, but was that a really close friendship, a platonic relation of full sexual love? I don't know.

​

And while I do think both felt something for the other, something who made them reticent to fight each other, I think they both had a "Greater Good" mentality. I don't know if the next FB will have their confrontation, or even if it's canon, but in my headcanon they waited as much as possible before fighting each other, but once inside the arena they went full power for the kill.

** I think it's important to distinguish book-canon from movie&play-canon. Even though they're telling much the same stories, it's sort of like comparing Marvel Cinematic Universe stuff to the content in the comic books. One is a source of (licensed) inspiration for the other. In some ways, the Fantastic Beasts movies are a different canon from the original 7, much like Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight movies don't exist in the same world as Tim Burton's Batman.

JKR's tweets are author commentary on the current productions more than the original material, except where the statements might enrich both.
