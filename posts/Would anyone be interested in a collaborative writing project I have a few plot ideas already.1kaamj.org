** For what it is worth, the blood wards were tied specifically to Lily, not James, so that part wouldn't work. Doesn't seem like an important aspect of your story though.

*** You are right it was Lily's sacrifice that created the bloodwards. another interesting point is made in 'The best revenge', in that fic is theoirzedd that harry doesn't really need to go back to the dursleys to recharge the blood protection but is put there by dumbledore (and forced to go back each summer) because Harry's closest realitives are the black sisters (Bella, Andromea and Narcisa) and as Dumbledore isn't actually Harry's Guardian, Harry could as well en with the Malfoys which is of course not optimal.
