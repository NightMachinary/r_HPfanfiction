I've been looking everywhere and can't find this fic. I can't remember where it was written but I'd be so grateful if anyone could find it for me.

It's set after the war and Harry disappears. Hermione and Ron become friends with Draco and years later they go on holiday to Africa to climb some mountain where they find that the person they've hired to guide them up the mountain is Harry. He reconciles with them during the trip and I think starts a relationship with Draco. I think at some point Harry also lives on a coffee farm but I'm not sure.

Please let me know if you know what this fic is, I'd be so grateful!!


** I so wish I could remember the name of this fic, it was either ao3 or ffn and it was def complete, probably over 100k words, but I can't for the life of me remember what it was called

*** Yeah was definitely definitely complete and quite long. I've tried searching key words and topics but I can't seem to find it which is a shame because I'd love to reread it. Thanks for trying though, let me know if the name ever comes to you!
