I can't remember the name but it was a Harry and daphne fic and she isn't interested initially because she pretty much dedicated her every waking moment to find a way to cure Astoria. That's all I remember and I hope this is enough for someone to find it

  The bloody war has ended at Harry's sixth-year. Though hailed a hero, he's ready for one last year at Hogwarts. One year of a normal life before becoming an Auror. While there, a simple agreement manages to challenge his identity as a hero, while still providing the normalcy he craves. Haphne AU. Post-War 7th year.

*** Is that the one where he nonchalantly splits his soul to remove the curse from Daphne (who he has known for all of 6 months at that point)? And then the soul splitting is casually forgotten and he goes back to normal?
