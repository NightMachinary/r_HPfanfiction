Or when Harry joins Voldemort at the end of first year?


** Well there always is this linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13435224/chapters/30791520]]) but Harry/Holly doesn't really join him at the end of first year, she definitely help him tho.

It's a nice read but it's also been dead since 2018.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. When Harry must face the Dark Lord once more, it is without the aid of magic beyond his ken; only his wits can save him from his fate.Cross-posted from FFnet.

**** His personality is still pretty much the same as in the early chapters, though of course a few years of development make him more intelligent/rational; about the same level of mental development that you would expect for a typical 11 year old. He does tend to be pragmatic in ways that most adults in the fic would consider odd for a kid. All in all, the horcrux doesn't noticeably affect his personality, but Harry tends to follow some odd paths of moral reasoning as a result of the extreme way that Petri raised him and not having any reliable mentors to look to for good advice.

****** I feel you. I was hesitant about that when I first started reading the fic as well. Fortunately this one seems to avert all of the typical dark!Harry tropes.
