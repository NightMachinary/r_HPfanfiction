I'm looking for fics that have a Harry getting mistreated/ignored/unfavoured over his siblings and instead of Dumbledore being the instigator of such treatment, Dumbledore is appalled or disappointed at the treatment.


** Deprived - linkffn(7402590) - I haven't really read far because I quickly found this is not my cup of tea, but I do remember Albus being appalled by Harry's treatment.

  On that fateful day, two Potters were born. One was destined to be the Boy-Who-Lived. The other was forgotten by the Wizarding World. Now, as the Triwizard Tournament nears, a strange boy is contracted to defend a beautiful girl.

*** I second this. Despite being abandoned and not even a third of the way done it has over 10k favs and deserves everyone. Sure there is angst. Sure there are tropes. But what sets it apart is not only well written scenes but doing something unique. Harry as a freelance bounty hunter is something I've never read before and he makes the OP main character still likeable. Well worth a read imo.

  Spinoff to 'HP: The Lone Traveller'. The story of Harry James Potter, the brother of the supposed BoyWhoLived, and his friends... My take on the old 'Harry the brother of the BWL' & 'Harry the Slytherin' plotline.

**** It does, but I think it would be funny if James and Lily treated Harry so badly over his brother that Dumbledore wanted to get Harry out of there ASAP.
