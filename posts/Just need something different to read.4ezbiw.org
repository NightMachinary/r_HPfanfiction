** linkffn(4563439) - Ectomancer by RustyRed. Intruiging, fascinating, well-written, and utterly different from every story that's come before it. If you haven't read this before, do it now.

linkffn(9911469) - Lily Potter and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The Carnivorous Muffin. A pondering tale about a little girl otherwise known as Death. The author has a captivating style.

linkffn(7779108) - The Master of Death by Ryuugi Shi. A Harry Potter/Dresden Files crossover with possibly the best opening to any story I've ever read. You should be able to follow it fine even if you don't know anything about Dresden Files.

  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.

#+begin_quote
  In one world, an old man's life ends. In another, a foolish wizard performs a ritual and calls upon the Master of Death. And in both, there is a sound-a sound like an oncoming train. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

*** Yeaaah, Lily-Sisyphus is about as different as you're going to get. It's pretty much the fanfiction equivalent of Joseph Heller's Catch 22.

** Linkffn(the strangers at drakehough). Honestly more of a novel of manners with a good mystery subplot than anything else. Very different from most fics. Edit: damn, harry/Ginny, I didn't even think about that part of your request here because it's such a different fic. I also liked ectomancer, but things started to get really weird before it got abandoned.
