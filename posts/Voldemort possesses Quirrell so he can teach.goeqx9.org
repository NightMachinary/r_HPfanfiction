Voldemort is able to fully posses Quirrell (without the stutter act, or turban) so he can finally get his dream job, abandoning his pursuit of world domination. ‘Quirrell' is praised for finally breaking the curse on the position

*** I actually read this when i was younger and started hating all of the characters that were bashed because i thought this was CANON. i thought this story was canon because i was trying to find a way to read the real harry potter books. I don't know how the heck it happened but i guess 6 year old me was an idiot. I hate this fic now because i actually like the Weasleys and i think the Ginny gave Harry a love potion theory is some BS to pair Harry off with someone else. I also remember J.K Rowling saying something about Harry and Ginny being soulmates or something like that.

**** You're fine to like Harry/Ginny. Just a lot of HP fans find the relationship very odd in the books, because it wasn't built up naturally, and sort of comes out of nowhere. Sure, he rescues her in /Chamber of Secrets/, but despite being her figurative, "Knight in Shining Armour," he never really displays any feelings of affection beyond what he displays for any of the other members of the Weasley family.

The only person Harry is shown to have a crush on before the point where he suddenly becomes jealous of Dean Thomas in /Halfblood Prince/ is Cho Chang, and that crush was established way back in /Prisoner of Azkaban/, and reinforced in /Goblet of Fire/, and is finally shattered in /Order of the Phoenix/.

With Ginny, he rescues her in /Chamber of Secrets/, she's virtually a non-entity in /Prisoner of Azkaban/ and /Goblet of Fire/, not being involved in the plot at all, beyond her having to turn down Harry's last minute invitation because she's already got a date for the Yule Ball, and then in /Order of the Phoenix/, they don't really interact at all until the middle of story when she chews out Harry for thinking he had to cut himself off to protect everyone else.

Then all of a sudden in /Halfblood Prince/, he's suddenly extremely jealous of her boyfriend.

Add to that the throw-away line(back in /Prisoner of Azkaban/, chapter 5) that Molly Weasley had to use a love potion to initially draw Arthur's attention, and you have a recipe that adds up to a lot of fans finding Harry's suddenly spiking affection for Ginny to be suspicious.

I have no idea whether or not that was Rowling's intent, but I rather doubt it. In the end, I think poor writing on Rowling's part resulted in this rather than any authorial intent.

****** So basically the points that everyone goes to for this; Harry has always liked Ginny(despite there being no real evidence for this in the books), they have a connection due to shared experiences with Voldemort, and love potions only last 24 hours(give or take, depending on the weight of the imbiber and the attractiveness of the giver).

Like I said, I don't believe Ginny gave him love potions. I just think it was poor writing on Rowling's part, and perhaps even not what she planned initially.

Like I mentioned in my original comment, look how long Harry's crush on Cho Chang was built up before it all came to a head in /Order of the Phoenix/. And compare that to mentions of Harry's feelings when addressing Ginny in any way.

******* But when the insufferable character pops up all the time, and broadcasts insufferability constantly--then it most certainly is.

I know others have different opinions, but I see it like this: Fanfiction is like cheese.

A fic like Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived by The Santi--is almost universally liked. Id call it a cheddar, most people like it, some dont, but they are in a minority.

The Denarian Renegade by Shezza is like a parmesan. Its got some moldy (Read: cringy) parts, but like all hard cheeses, the unwanted part can be excised for an end product thats just as good.

HPMOR is like a camembert. Its a soft cheese, and plenty of people like it--but its also got mold. Unlike The Denarian Renegade, this mold is a consistency that makes itself known throughout, repeatedly telling you its there, in the form of Harry's idiosyncrasies and behavior--he is the main character after all.

But, like any cheese lover knows, once any part of a soft cheese gets moldy--the entire thing is unuseable. The mold gets its roots into every crevice of a soft cheese, even if its not visible, the impact is still there. This is remarkably similar to how I see HPMOR. The annoyance pervades the fanfiction, and to me, ruins it as a whole.

TL;DR The pervasive annoyance of Harry in this fic ruins the entire thing.

******** Eh, I can see how some people find him annoying, but I honestly didn't. It felt like a very surreal lark around a universe only tangentially similar to the canon one. The Harry of HPMOR was fun. Definitely a nerd, definitely had a complex of one kind or another, but still fun to read about. I probably got too caught up in the misadventures of the Sunshine Regiment to get annoyed at Harry.

******** I would point out that camembert is *made* of mold. ctrl + v from google: "A layer of *mold* growing on the outside --- the “bloomy rind” --- is what gives *Camembert* its distinctive texture and flavor. The digestive enzymes in the *mold* break down the cheese curd, creating a creamy soft cheese inside an aromatic fungal rind."

So while i enjoyed your analogy, i'd argue that its up to personal taste whether you like the mold in HPMOR or not. I admit i dropped it, but mostly because after Quirrell left the stage, i lost interest. the fic is however popular for a reason.

*** Yes and no. He didn't actually give up on world domination, but he genuinely did want to teach. "Voldemort" was supposed to be a disposable identity, to practise being a dark lord, so that he could then create a much more fearsome version, publicly defeat said fake dark lord in his light identity, and gain popular support like Dumbledore has. But wizarding society turned out to be so fragile that "Voldemort" was wildly successful, and less boring/frustrating than his other roles, so he just rolled with it.
