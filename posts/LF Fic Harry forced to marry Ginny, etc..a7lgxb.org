** I distinctly remember a fic where Harry tries to take (I think) Albus to his family vault and Albus is rejected, because he's not a Potter. I can't recall which fic it was though, I'll edit this later if I do. Maybe someone else knows it. It's at the tip of my tongue...

In any case, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5508237/1/Caveat-Inimici]]), which is one of my favourites, definitely fits your request.

There's also a drabble by Rorschachs Blot: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8979274/1/Love-is-a-Many-Splendored-thing]])

In linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5398634/1/Before-You-Say-I-Do]]) Hermione successfully ruins Harry&Ginnys wedding.

In linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/951061/chapters/1859733]]) Harry, Ron and Hermione have a 3-way relationship behind Ginny's back.

A vicious Ginny basher is Keira Marcos. I recall "Ginny is a Bad Wheezy" and "Vengeful Measures", where I think Harry divorces Ginny or something. Those fics might be hosted on Dreamwidth. In her main fic "HP and the Soulmate Bond" they aren't even close to married, but if you're in the mood for some serious and unrepentant Ginny bashing that fic is chock-full of that.

  When Harry fails to come home after his usual camping trip, his wife, Ginny, goes looking for answers. She soon discovers that some things transcend marriage vows, sibling ties, and even children.

  Hermione is a sister to Harry, a mother to Rose and Hugo, a wife to Ron...and a Legilimens and Unspeakable. She is also very, very angry. A look at a Hermione who developed the instincts she evidenced with Marietta and Umbridge. AU, but canon-compliant.

  Hermione picks the absolute worst time to tell Harry how she feels about him. Naturally, chaos ensues.

** Sorry, I can't really help. Since I /like/ Harry/Ginny, I haven't read much in this vein.

Although there is a memorable marriage contract scene in HPMoR chapter 26...
