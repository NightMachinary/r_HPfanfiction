Hello,

I remember this fic where Harry is a dragon (animagus) and grows up in a dragon reserve, he later goes to war with his dragons and the dwarves against the goblins. Later he goes to Durmstrang as a pupil.

Sadly I can't find it, but maybe I'm just too dumb for google.

Thanks Mac_cy

  Harry Potter's Magic reacts to being so cold on the durlseys doorstep.  interesting effects. This entire story (yes, entire) has been Beta'd by Slicerness.  Let's give the man a big round of applause folks! i'll try to get somerthing up within the next two weeks... now if you will excuse me i need to go die somewhere in a corner.  Rowing training hurts... a lot!
