Discuss your opinion on Drarry (Draco/Harry)! What do you like about this ship? What do you dislike? What is your favorite fic? Do you think their relationship would "work"? Why do you think it would/would not.


** It wouldn't work because they hate each other and they have diametrically opposing ideals and morals.

It only works if everyone is ooc and the story is pretty AU.

** I never liked Drarry...probably because I find Malfoy a petty bully and rather uninteresting (until the 6th book but even then...meh). He never held my attention and was never a favorite of mine, so I never care to read about Drarry...or anything involving Malfoy for that matter.

And I really cannot stand how (90%) of fan-fictions eliminate (or excuse) his personality and make him this erotic, powerful sex god who has everyone falling at his feet with his suddenly spectacular looks and newly acquired "brains". It's like they rewrite him to fulfill their own wishful thinking. In the majority of the fanfictions, his actual personality is hardly there.

** well, if you think pottermore has integrity, it's impossible automatically bc jkr said they'd never be friends (and such). she's also said while he's improved, not to expect him to be a really good guy, he'd hate to be in harry's debt and the nod was more of a 'nobody is letting me forget that you saved my life so there'. it just wouldn't work

** I'm wary of Drarry. I'm not super opposed to it, but I find much of it lacking, because it tends to romanticize Draco a lot. Fics will make excuses for his bad behavior and cast him as some sort of suave sex god. No. He's an arrogant, whiny, spoiled teenager. Being a drama queen is one of his more endearing traits. I actually like Draco a lot as a character, but that's part of why I object to the tendency of making him into something he very much is not.

To me, the ship is nonsensical during Hogwarts years unless it's AU enough for either Harry or Draco to have had radically different childhoods. I'm not nearly so opposed to it when they're much older, because they've both had plenty of time to change.

It is absolutely terrible!

  What do you like about this ship?
#+end_quote

Nothing

#+begin_quote
  What do you dislike?
#+end_quote

Everything (except that they don't ave an age difference, which is the only thing it does better than Snape/Harry)

#+begin_quote
  What is your favorite fic?
#+end_quote

I never read any of them but it would have to be a crackfic that pokes fun at this ridiculous idea.

#+begin_quote
  Do you think their relationship would "work"? Why do you think it would/would not.
#+end_quote

No. never. Absolutely 100% not! Aside from the fact that neither of them is gay, they are diametrically opposed. They have completely opposite morals, actively hate each other and have way too much history to ever work out.

** No. In every single way no. First of all, neither of them is gay. But lets ignore that since, hey, its fanfiction, nobody cares.

Both have completely opposite morals and ideals. Either one is the others antithesis.

I really don't know what to write beyond that point. Rowling designed Draco, in my opinion, to be a completely inverted Harry Potter. That goes so far that even his hair color is on the opposite end of the spectrum.

So, to draw a line here: If one or both of them are OOC, then maybe. If both are supposed to be canon-compliant (ignoring their sexualities), then a big, fat *no*.

** It has absolutely no way to work outside the minds of delusional 12 year old girls. I don't even have to give a reason why - it's the shippers that have to present a reason why those two characters that absolutely despise each other and each other's values would ever want to pair up.

** I dislike it, but I can tolerate it. But in canon, it doesn't work, simple as. I also dislike the whole "Draco in Leather Pants" trope that goes hand in hand with Harry/Draco (the /Draco Trilogy/ by Cassandra Claire gave way to this trope).

** No way, within school. Harry, already indoctrinated into the Gryffindor way of thinking by Hagrid and Ron, has no reason to think Draco is anything other than a bullying racist (regardless of the reasons behind that behavior). Guess who else is a bullying racist? Dudley, who Harry has every reason to think is the epitome of childhood evil.

Meanwhile, you have Draco, who has no idea why Harry dislikes him so much, was trained from a young age to worship the Dark Lord who Harry unintentionally defeated, and hates Gryffindor on principle. With all that going on, Draco is trying as hard as possible to be Lucius, who is pretty much the perfect opposite of Harry in every way.

Maybe after they graduate, if we're going EWE, but that's pretty much AU. But otherwise, at least one character has to be OOC, or a significant AU has to be taking place.
