Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore is an exceptionally useful plot device in Harry Potter fanfiction. He's a guide, a source of safety, or an antagonist, depending on the story. I was hoping to delve into something that really fleshes out his character and relationships a bit more - probably something from his youth, when he was not the all-powerful, and either wise or evil mastermind we usually see him as in fanfiction.

I don't feel particularly picky about this, I only ask for high quality writing (showing, not telling... that sort of thing. Oh, and a plot that forces our main character to overcome something or other). I was thinking something like one of these, but I am open to other possibilities too:

- The story of Albus and Gellert in Godric's Hollow.
- A time travel story where a character (Harry or other) travels back in time and befriends Albus (or more than befriends... honestly, I don't see too many Albus love stories).

Thank you in advance! Whenever I come across these request posts I am nearly always blown away by the excellent recommendations that subscribers to this particular subreddit give, so I'm really excited to see what we come up with!

​

Update: Wow! I was right to be optimistic. This subreddit is amazing (definitely my favorite on all of reddit... and I even subscribe to [[/r/Awwducational][r/Awwducational]]). I just binge read Weeping Angel, recommended by [[/u/Talosbronze][u/Talosbronze]] and it absolutely perfectly matched my request. I can't wait to make my way through the rest of these. Thanks everybody!


** The world trip fic and the Phoenix Insurgent flesh him out better than most fics. Unfortunately, I searched far and wide and made several posts on various forums regarding young Dumbledore and I found nothing of value other than exactly what we're told in DH. I would believe that for most authors it would be quite intimidating to write a child prodigy so that's why we don't get many young Dumbledore fics and mostly crap young Riddle fics.

*** That makes a lot of sense actually. It's interesting too that we see so many attempts at Harry is a prodigy stories (usually not so well written), and plenty of prodigy Riddle stories, but not too many stories of the canonically most prodigious wizard, even though it feels like there is some real potential there. Maybe there's just not enough open to interpretation in Dumbledore's story?

Thank you for the recs!

**** Well the attempts at making Harry a prodigy usually turn him into clones of RDJ's Tony Stark but without his charming arrogance (instead in most cases Harry is annoying from a social stand point at best or completely antisocial at worst). Young Riddle is always portrayed as a Draco Malfoy on steroids despite him saying that in his school years he hid his true nature and acted polite, modest and nice. And most fics don't showcase his magical talents or only mention them briefly in a sentence or two... yet he is always this bully that controls the students with an iron fist.

** I have three possibles for you--two WIPs and a completed fic.

WIP 1: /Weeping Angel./ I don't get the title of this fic at all, but I'm following the story with some interest. Harry time travels back to 1896 or so. He and Dumbledore are both fifth years. Dumbledore is a prodigy, and his great aspirations are already in play. It's marked Albus/Harry, along with Gellert/Albus and Harry & Tom Riddle/Voldemort (so no relationship there, I expect.) No romantic relationships are in play yet. I like what I've read so far not so much because of Albus (though I'm sure there will be more) but because of the OCs especially. Professor Mesmer is fascinating, as is the squib magician stuck in Victorian London with whom Harry develops a growing quasi-familial relationship. I have hopes for this one. linkao3(15439710)

WIP 2: /Kairos Amid the Ruins/. This is Harry/Orion Black, time travel and Alternate Universe. I really mean alternate universe, for reasons which become apparent immediately. Albus is interesting in this fic. Here he is Minister for Magic and has subdued Gellert, to whom he is both husband and kinda-jailer. I hope that there is even more about Albus soon, since this interpretation is one I've not seen before. I don't love Harry in this fic (but I don't hate him), and Orion Black is, to me, oddly mundane. Severus, on the other hand, is rather interesting, as are the in-universe Potters. linkao3(20886212)

The best Albus and Harry friendship that I've read is the one in /The Second String/, which recently completed. It's not the main point of the fic by any means, but I loved this aspect of it. Harry time travels just before fifth year to the 1970s and ends up living with Aberforth. His relationship with Albus is nuanced and very well done. The first half has him adopting Aberforth's negative views of Albus, which isn't helped by Albus' role as general and his view of Harry as essentially a nobody. I worried it would veer into bashing, but it totally didn't. Instead, as the war heats up and Harry starts having to make compromises of his own, Harry starts understanding Albus more and more, and from there the two develop a real, if often complicated, friendship. I liked this one especially because Harry and Albus are figured as equals; there isn't the paternal or mentor element here much at all. linkao3(15465966)

*** Thank you for the recs and the explanations! Weeping Angel does sound really interesting and I'm excited to give that a try. And I think I never finished The Second String, but I don't remember why exactly - I remember getting to a scene where there was a pirate who kissed Harry on his birthday, or Christmas or something, but I don't remember anything beyond that lol. You've definitely renewed my interest though!

*** I cannot thank you enough for your recommendation of Weeping Angel. I just binge read that thing and it was EXACTLY what I was looking for. And the characterizations were absolutely top tier.

I was so worried when I first started it because there are these tiny grammatical problems spread throughout the story, things like using "casted" and other improper past tense things, or repeated words in a sentence. But I was absolutely wrong to worry. This author is clearly a master of the craft. The characters, as you rightly mentioned are the standout elements, but the author also does really, really well with foreshadowing, and writing in tiny details that get exploited and payed off later. It was a fabulous read and I am so glad to have found it. (This subreddit really delivers, thank you for being a part of that!)

  The fiasco at the Department of Mysteries had many consequences. One accident with a time-turner sent Harry to a faraway past. But who can really he rely on in this farce of home? And should he really trust Albus Dumbledore to have his best interests at heart?Harry was going to go back to his time. Back to 1996. He was going to go back to the Department of Mysteries. He was going to save his friends, and everybody in his time whose existence is being threatened.But how? At what price?And what will be left of him in the end?

  Harry's attempt to time travel and fix the past went badly awry. Time shattered, and the various pieces of the universe clung to each other as best they could. Harry finds himself in 1961, with Albus Dumbledore the Minister for Magic, Gellert Grindelwald his loving husband, Voldemort newly defeated...and Severus Snape being proclaimed the Boy-Who-Lived.

** I have some high quality Albus/Gellert recs. No time travel though :(

*Short fics*

*[[https://eldritcher.livejournal.com/2433.html][Himnusz]]* by eldritcher (2011)

*Summary*: Before there were wars and wands, before Ariana and Nurmengard, there were two boys who loved lemon-drops.

Gellert is deeply patriotic in this fic. The Hungarian national anthem is used beautifully to show the two great loves of Gellert's life: Albus and his motherland. This fic tells a lot of story without actually telling a lot of story.

#+begin_quote
  “I was born by the riverside, you know,” I told him softly. “My father often told me the tale of Moses, of a babe found by the river who grew up to be a leader. My mother named me after her Magyar grandfather who was slain in a skirmish with the Habsburgs.”

  “Gellert - the spear, the weapon of your people,” Albus murmured. “She named you aptly. You will be powerful.”
#+end_quote

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11137833][Hair of the Dog That Bit You]]* by occamybites (2017)

*Summary*: "Gellert should have turned and walked away. It had been ten years. Gellert was the fifth most wanted man in Europe and rising, and Albus was a schoolteacher. All promises were already broken. There was no going back."

Gellert runs into Albus in Vienna. Albus wants to have sex one last time to get Gellert out of his mind. Tragic. I keep saying that a lot in this post but that's because this pairing is tragic.

#+begin_quote
  He and Albus had discussed Sacrifice. They had always known there would be sacrifices. They had mostly imagined that they would be other people's sacrifices.
#+end_quote

*Medium length fics. 5K to 20K words*

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7101118][Thirty-five Owls]]* by letterblade (2008)

*Summary*: Being a correspondence between Albus P.W.B. Dumbledore, Grand Sorcerer, Supreme Mugwump, etc., and the prisoner Gellert Grindelwald, of some decades in length.

This is the very first Grindeldore fic I read! It is funny, romantic and tragic. This is a great intro to Grindeldore fic if you are new to the pairing! /The/ Grindeldore fic for a lot of folks, rightfully so!

#+begin_quote
  But I am nothing to you anymore but an ear. Writing ancient lovers tearful letters in your Christmas sherry again, Albus? Back & forth we go, back & forth.
#+end_quote

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/235547][The Prisoner's Remorse]]* by Miss M (2011)

*Summary*: After Sirius Black's betrayal, Professor Dumbledore finds work for Remus Lupin as a prison guard in Nurmengard, where there are quite a few things to be learned.

I love Remus in this fic! He's younger than we usually see in fics. More innocent and less jaded. Gellert and Albus are very much obsessed with each other. Neither of them are easy characters here to sympathize with but they are very much human in their relationship. Remus is caught in the middle. It's also got a Wolfstar theme. The reason why Albus sends Remus to Nurmengard is because he thinks Remus understands what it is like to obsess over somebody like Gellert.

Tragic...but Wolfstar is always tragic. Grindeldore is usually tragic. So the combination is double the feels and double the angst.

#+begin_quote
  "How is that old vanquisher of mine, Albus Dumbledore? I expect he played quite a part in this struggle?"

  "Quite." Remus felt strangely self-conscious, as if there were something almost inappropriate in discussing Dumbledore with this man. "He's very much admired."

  "Of course," Grindelwald said. "Of course. But then again, he's always been most admirable."
#+end_quote

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30478755][The Sultan and Scheherazade are one]]* by eldritcher (2021)

*Summary*: Albus Dumbledore is irresistible. This is merely the first of Gellert Grindelwald's problems.

This is probably my favorite Albus. He's a contradiction of being shy and bold. Gellert is head over heels for him. Lots of discussions about anarchy and socialism. Reading poetry to each other. Lots of world events seen through Gellert's eyes - World wars, Spanish Flu. The second part of the fic is set in Nurmengard. Gellert gets only one visitor. It's not Albus. There's tragedy of course, because this is Grindeldore after all! A sweeping and brilliant story told without a lot of words. This one is brand new and got me on a binge read through my Grindeldore favorites.

#+begin_quote
  "Trothed under a yew," he said solemnly.

  "Romantic," I tried to say in dismissal, but my insouciance fell flat before his earnestness.

  We crowned each other, under his whore mother's roof, with berries from his sister's favorite yew.
#+end_quote

*Long fics. 50K+ words*

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7213144][Let Perpetual Light]]* by tehtarik (2016)

*Summary*: In the village of Godric's Hollow, the Dumbledore family is falling apart. Kendra Dumbledore is dead under mysterious circumstances, and Albus is the unwilling guardian to his wayward brother Aberforth, and Ariana, their mad sister in the attic. But everything changes with the arrival of Gellert Grindelwald, violently charming juvenile delinquent with an obsession for the fabled Deathly Hallows.

This is a longfic. Since completed longfics for this pairing are pretty hard to come by, it's a treat whenever we get one. It's set around Ariana Dumbledore's life being the driving force in Albus's and Gellert's lives. The characterizations here aren't the ones I am used to seeing for Albus and Gellert but the author makes it work great. It's well written and definitely recommended!

#+begin_quote
  Albus remains in the churchyard, beside Ariana's grave, long after the last guest (Bathilda) leaves. A number of the other attendees had milled around in a rather infuriating fashion, pretending to examine the names and inscriptions on the ranks of headstones. He rather suspected that Aberforth's public outburst had stirred up some excitement among them, and they lingered, scavenging for gossip. Ariana is in the earth now, still unacknowledged by life.
