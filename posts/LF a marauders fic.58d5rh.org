When I was first introduced to fanfiction maybe 10 or so years ago I read this fic where James, Remus, Sirius and Peter transfigured their dorm into really crazy things. The only thing I can remember from this was that Remus had a cloud bed. I don't know if anyone knows the fic I'm talking about , but if you know of anything that is similar please let me know!
