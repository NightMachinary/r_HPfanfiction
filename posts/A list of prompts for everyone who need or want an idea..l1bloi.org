Hello! For the past two months, I have been collecting various prompts ideas and had it written down whenever one came up to my mind. I decided today to make a list of them and post it here. My reasons for doing so is in the hope that one writer (or potential one) will see a prompt that interest them and write a story about them because I personally don't see myself bringing to fruition all of them. They are also posted for people who are just curious to read them.

There will be two lists which I will post as comments (because not enough place in the post itself). The first list will be of prompts for multi-chapters stories (40k+) while the second will be for short stories or one-shots.

And so, let's begin:


** *One-shots/Drabbles Prompts:*

​

#1 - Professor McGonagall celebrate the graduation of the Marauders.

​

#2 - Dumbledore see Harry and Ginny kiss and completely panic as he realise that he never got to tell them that Ginny is actually James and Lily Potter's secret daughter who was adopted by the Weasleys after their death.

​

#3 - Dobby want the Great Harry Potter Sir, Dobby's new master, to be safe but the Great Harry Potter Sir will never be safe as long as Voldemort is running around. Dobby find and destroy all the Horcruxes before somehow killing Voldemort and it takes him only a few days.

​

#4 - (Fem!Harry, Warning: Rape) - During Care of Magical Creatures, the class is surprised when Fem!Harry can't approach the Unicorns as easily as the other girls. They are even more shocked when it is revealed that Unicorns are more trusting of virgin girls which results in Fem!Harry breaking down and running back to the castle. Hermione manage to find her best friend and finds out the truth: In their second year, Lockhart raped her in her detention at the beginning of the year before attempting to obliviate her. Luckily, it failed but Harry wasn't about to tell anyone that. Traumatised by the whole ordeal, Harry tried to deal with it by forgetting about it and somewhat managed (although never completely, obviously) until it all came crashing down in the CoMC class.

​

#5 - There really was a 11AM train at King's Cross Station on September the First and when Harry ask where the 11AM train is, Harry is redirected to a train toward Ireland and miss the Hogwarts Express as a result. The Hogwarts staff quickly realise what happened when Harry fails to show up for the sorting and find him the next day. When he is brought back to Hogwarts, Harry make friend with the only other Gryffindor who doesn't seems to have other friends yet : Hermione Granger.

​

#6 - Harry knows that Acromentulas just can't petrify anyone so when Riddle's diary show him that Hagrid's pet Aragog is the monster behind the attacks, Harry get suspicious and decide not to risk it and bring the diary to Dumbledore.

​

#7 - The Champions discover the clue about the second task minutes after completing the first because one of them opened the egg during Bagman's speach and another recognised it as mermish. Completely ignoring Bagman and the other officials, the Champions conjure a water tank before listening to the clue together. They rapidely get to the conclusion that they would have to save an hostage from the bottom of the lake and they show just how much they disapprove of the idea.

#8 - Minister Cornelius Fudge go undercover as a first year student during Dolores Umbrige's reign of terror and he realise just how fucked up the school is with Umbrige at its head. He might not like having Dumbledore as Headmaster but even he can see how worse Umbrige is making things as she is unknowingly turning people against the Ministry. Fudge proceed to sack Umbridge, remove the educational decrees and make Professor McGonnagal the new Headmistress.

​

#9 - The adventures of Arthur Weasley exploring the Wizarding World with his guides Harry Potter and Hermione Granger, his future children-in-laws.

​

#10 - (Harry/Hermione) - Harry is shocked during Remus Lupin's boggart lesson when his boggart doesn't turn into a dementor like he expected but into a petrified Hermione.

​

#11 - A short story where Harry peacefully passes away in the Great Hall while everyone else is celebrating the death and defeat of Voldemort. (Just after the canonical Battle of Hogwarts, can be for various reasons just as general exhaustion or the remnant of the horcrux or whatever). His friends don't realise it until minutes later when one of them try to get Harry's attention and realise that he is unresponsive. The celebration quickly turn into mourning as his friends, the winners of the Battle of Hogwarts and the general population of the Wizarding World also go through the death of their saviour.

​

#12 - (Hermione/Ginny) - Hermione thinks she likes Harry. Ginny thinks she likes Harry. When the two start competing for Harry's affection, they realise that they actually have feelings toward the other and get together... leaving a very confused Harry and Ron behind who wanted to ask Ginny and Hermione out respectively.

** *The first list is a list of prompts where I think would result in a multi-chapters story (at least 40k long) if it was brought to fruition.*

#1 - (James/Lily) - Lily Evans is a prat toward James Potter during their seventh year. She is the only one in the school (apart from Snape obviously) who hasn't realised yet that James has grown up and is far from the bully that he was in their fifth year. James hasn't even asked Lily out since the end of their fifth year and hasn't bothered her either since then. However, Lily missed that point and continued to treat him as if he was going out of his way to annoy her. One day, while James and Lily are on Head Boy/Girl duties, Lily say one thing too many to James which results in him snapping back and give his truthful opinion on her (Something like he love(d) her but is so tired of dealing with her dislike/hatred of him that he's completely giving up on his love to her and doesn't want to talk to her ever again.) The next day, James decide to give back his badge to McGonagall so that he doesn't have to deal with Lily anymore. With Remus as the new Head Boy, Lily quickly realise that she kinda miss James and feel horrible for the way she treated him, even when he was patient toward her. Lily has to find a way to reconnect with James (who is going out of his way to avoid her) and learn how to feel with her strange feelings toward him. (She likes him, maybe even loves him but she doesn't understand her feelings which could be the reason why she treated James like crap. Or it can be something else, whatever.)

​

#2 - (Harry/Hermione) - Just before his name his called for his turn in the First Task of the 1994-1995 Triwizard Tournament, Harry admit his feelings for Hermione (who sneeked in the champions' tent). In return, Hermione also tell him about her feelings toward him and the two kiss. However, Harry doesn't want to go risk his life for a stupid tournament and Hermione whole-hearthly agree that the magical world really is stupid if they don't seem to have a problem with a 14-year-old boy competing in a deadly competition. Together, just when Harry's name is about to be called (and Harry prefering his live over his magic), Harry and Hermione decide to run away from Hogwarts, both having enough with their lives being endangered. The officials and the spectators are shocked when Harry never enter the arena to face his dragon.

​

#3 - Lily Potter survived Voldemort's attack on her family but get stuck in her Animagus form of a white, Snowy Owl. In the process, Lily get separated from Harry and has no idea where her son is. (She doesn't doubt that Harry somehow ended up at her sister but has no idea where she lives as she, her husband and her son moved to a new home shortly after the Potters went into hiding.) After a few years, Lily finally gives up and resign herself to never see her son again and spend the rest of her life as an owl. In 1991, Lily somehow end up in the Magical Menagerie when Rubeus Hagrid and eleven-years-old Harry enter the shop. Lily manage to get bought by Hagrid as a gift for Harry. Harry names his new Snowy Owl Hedwig. When Harry and Lily/Hedwig are at Hogwarts, Lily manage to give a message to Harry telling him that she is human but stuck in her form. With the help of Professor McGonagall, Hedwig is finally unlocked of her transformation and both are shocked when she turns into Lily Potter.

​

#4 - Tom Riddle Sr might have abandonned the wife who drugged him with love potions but he never planned to abandon his unborn son. A few months after Merope Gaunt-Riddle ran away, Tom find his son Tom Riddle Jr in an orphanage and adopt him. Tom Riddle Sr was already aware of magic before meeting Merope because of his cousins and decide to call one of them to verify if his son is magical. Tom's cousin, Fleamont Potter shows up and check if Tom Jr is magical which he confirms. Realising that his son would be entranched in the magical world, Tom raise him with the help of the Potter family. (Tom Riddle Jr never become a Dark Lord as he knows love thanks to his father and cousins.)

​

#5 - (Harry/Hermione) - Harry already felt like it wasn't a good idea to associate with him but had always tried to ignore that feeling. After witnessing Sirius' death at the Department of Mysteries, Harry feel like he is a burden and a danger to everyone remotely close to him. The final nail in the coffin comes when Dumbledore tells him of the prophecy. Seeing it as confirmation that he is too dangerous to live with, Harry decide to run away to train, alone, while fighting Death Eaters. Of course, he couldn't do so without first leaving a letter for Hermione, admiting to her about how he had fallen in love with her but never did a move because he feared that she would be in danger. Pissed off at Harry (but mostly because she wants to be with him for every step of the way), Hermione decide to track him and find him at any cost. When they do, the couple train to fight Voldemort.

**** #13 - (Harry/Ginny) - Harry and Ginny become friends in Ginny's first year but Harry is worried when Ginny become more and more withdrawn from everyone. Fortunately, Harry find Tom Riddle's diary in Ginny's belongings and put the clues together and find the truth about the Chamber of Secrets and the Heir of Slytherin and that just before Ginny is kidnapped by Tom. Harry manage to save Ginny and get the diary to McGonagall where it is promptly destroyed by Dumbledore. The whole ordeal brings the two friends closer and they both start dating the next year.

​

#14 - The summer between the trio's sixth year and before the Horcrux Hunt, the Order of the Pheonix are attacked by Death Eaters and more than half of the Order members are killed. The survivors regroup and decide to form a new, grayer faction that won't hesitate to do what is necessary to put down the Death Eaters and end the war as fast as possible, including killing if necessary. The new organisation (which has it's own name, logo and uniform) is entrusted by the trio with the secrets of the Horcruxes and together, they seek the objects out while fighting Death Eaters.

​

#15 - After Harry is locked in his room (after Dobby's intervention the summer between Year 1 and Year 2), Harry decide to use magic to escape and run away from Privet Drive because he realise that better be expelled but in good health than starved to death and attend Hogwarts later (if he made it through). The Ministry goes in a frenzy when they make it to Privet Drive to interogate Harry about the use of his magic and not only learns about his living condition at the Dursleys but that he ran away, leaving no trace behind. Meanwhile, Harry somehow end up at the Grangers (or the Weasleys but Grangers are more likely since he know how to travel in the muggle world) where he tell them the truth and request their help.

​

#16 - Something inspired by fanfictions where Lily Evans and the Marauders read the Harry Potter books but, instead, it is Harry and Ginny who read a book about their future child. They do not like what they see and decide to change the future so that their child could live an happy life. (and have siblings)

​

#17 - A fourteen years old Harry somehow travel back in time to 1980. With no way back, Harry decide to meet his younger parents and attempt to both help and save them from their fate. In the process, his parents "adopt" him and Harry become a older brother to his younger counterpart.
