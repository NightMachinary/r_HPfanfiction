When Voldemort attacks, he vanishes as in the typical WBWL story. However everyone believes that Dudley is the Chosen One and lost his powers when Voldemort's lost his. Now Dumbledore and the whole Hogwarts staff try to figure out away to help him defeat Voldemort without magical powers.


** I really like this idea. It would mean getting to do WBWL without an OC.

** Could even be a result of a better thought out marketing move by Dumbledore rather than him just being either idiot or evil. Like, he doesn't want to put a target on Harry's back; even if he stops to think about favoritism at all he /definitely/ won't think J&L would show it to their muggle nephew instead of their own son; it is petty much the best way of taking a piss at Voldemort, like, not only did he get killed by a baby, but said baby who will be forever his nemesis as far as the public is concerned /doesn't even have magic at all/ can't think of something more humiliating for Tommy; if the public thinks their savior is a squib/muggle then maybe they will give more thought to making their lives easier; even if he for some reason /considers/ some form of favoritism of the Potter's to the child they won't be able to share most of their lives with he sure as hell won't consider it turning to abuse (which if the story is at all well-written it won't, hell, the neglect rarely even makes sense normally and the abuse is generally downright dumb and obviously done just for plot-convenience) and will think the benefits for everyone (even Harry himself) plus his being in Hogwarts for most of his life will surely off-set any potential collateral damage this particular plot may cause, and this is if he doesn't decide to just tell the Potters straightway about the plan to sidestep the issue completely.

  Lily remembered her sister, how there had been a time she was curious and delighted about magic, before it slowly sank in that she could look and not touch.The last thing Petunia had said to Lily before she died was a chilly goodbye, ending a holiday dinner where they'd had a shrieking row in the entryway. Petunia had said 'freak' and Lily had hissed 'better than this, better than this being my whole fucking world, Tune, do you even see yourself, are you happy--'And now here was Dudley Vernon Dursley fussing himself to sleep as Lily walked the halls of the Godric's Hollow house. His tiny soft hands with their tiny soft fingernails curled under her chin, the same way Harry's always had.She passed James, who was gently bouncing his way up the hall the opposite way. "I think he's asleep," James mouthed over Harry's tousled head. His hair was the same mess, his head bent down as he peered at his sleeping son.Lily stopped where she stood, her nephew heavy on her chest, her husband smiling, her sister buried. "James," she said. "How are we going to do this?"

** "A different Halloween" has Voldemort defeated by Dudley/Petunia and him being adopted by the Potters.

It's a Robst fic though. That's a deal breaker for some.

*** For me too. Not because I don't hate him but he's the kind of author who writes the same story over and over again guised under a different premises. And if you read Harry Crow, you read all his stories pretty much.

I went Googling for "Robst" thinking it was a ship or some new terminology to do with a character being a robot, lol. Did not expect it to be the name of an author! Why do some people not like his fics?
