Okay, so Harry Potter has one of THE largest amount of crossover fics out there (somewhere in the top five, methinks). The problem is that HP magic is generally rather hard to port over into another setting. Other settings have magical systems that are defined to more narrow applications or come with harder limitations than the HP system does. Either there's a finite pool of magical essence to draw from (mana being the most common) or the requirements for making a spell work are heavier than point wand, incant, wave around and shoot or they're even more vaguely defined than the HP magic system itself is.

This is the discussion: how do you merge these two systems? Do you try to? Do you bother, even? Do you have examples of well-merged magical systems and if you do, how do they go about it?

Example: I focus on the role the wand plays on the HP side of things by explaining that it acts like an interface. Given that it's from a magical creature, the wand retains the connection to magic the magical creature itself enoyed and, as a result, allows the student using it to enjoy that self-same connection via an instinctive interface primed to support the wizard or witch as his/her own connection to magic grows. What is not known is that that connection fades over time, with the wizard or witch's own connection to magic eventually supplementing the wand's own magical connection rather than the other way around. While the wizard/witch may not feel a difference to how they access magic or that they're growing any more powerful than beforehand, they are actually getting closer and closer to magic as time passes by, which helps explain why the most powerful wizards out there also happen to be the oddest/oldest ones too.

How this relates to crossover magical systems is simple-both the wand and the wand's user adapt to the modified magical system upon exposure. Though limited at the beginning, over time it will become possible for the wizard/witch to adapt the new magical system to their own connection with magic and gain the benefits said magic brings to the table whilst somewhat minimising the drawbacks the magical system carries. Say you have a crossover with the Dresden-verse, which probably counts as pretty closely related to the HP system. At the start, Neither Potter nor Dresden could actually practice the kind of magic the other wizard can wield. But, give Potter some basic training in applying his 'will' to the situation and give Dresden a wand that fits him? Whole different story. Soon, both Harries will be able to learn the basic spells each other's systems are capable of, with the drawbacks going from being a major pain to a minor inconvenience (confundo and obliviate, for example, are big no-nos in the Dresden-verse).

I find that that approach can solve a lot of compatibility issues between the two settings... and provides a nice little side-story too.

What approaches do you guys use?


** The main approach I use is to not overthink it. Usually it can be done quite simply if you simply adapt, rather than try and force it together.

Wen you overthink it, you end up with bad things like "true wizards" in the Denarian trilogy, which is one of my favorites, but the blending of the 2 systems was atrocious. Or, it ends up like Awaken Sleeper, where Harry dreams of all these magical things, wakes up and learns that it wasn't, only to find out like 5 minutes later that magic is actually real, just not the way he dreamed it.

** Your idea of HP magic reminds me of an idea I had a while back that had the magic system for HP basically work the same way as Ork technology from Warhammer 40k (it's all scrap basically, but it works because they all believe it does).

In truth, everyone on the planet generates a low-level psychic field, even the muggles, but it's too low-power for it to do anything. Witches and wizards generate a stronger field, and that power is partially split. Part of it goes into their own spellcasting, and part of it follows their subconscious. What this means is that people who have confidence, a drive to succeed and believe in themselves can generally cast magic easier because more of their own personal field is focused inwards on their own spellcasting. As other witches and wizards with less drive for success see these people growing stronger, casting more easily, more effortlessly and at a higher level, the small, subconscious part of their fields go into the target of their admiration's power, making them ever-so-slightly stronger. This works with negative connotations as well.

And this is how powerhouses like Dumbledore and Voldemort arise to be stonkingly more powerful than anyone else in the series. They are believed to be strong, powerful wizards by the populace, so their subconscious belief makes it true. Powerful feats of magic such as wandless casting are believed to be the sole domain of strong spellcasters, so the more someone believes in them, the more of these feats they can replicate.

Dumbledore setting up as the Headmaster of Hogwarts was a masterstroke: it's why he declines the Minister of Magic position. He can make every single magical child in Britain believe in his power: not even the sheer amount of fear and horror Voldemort inspires can overcome Dumbledore's power, so that's why Dumbledore is still stronger. On the other hand, Voldemort had a genius idea of his own: the Death Eater mask and robes as a standard for his followers. People don't fear Avery, Lestrange, etc, most might not have even known the names until after the first wizarding war ended. However, everyone knew of and feared the black-robed men and women in the night, their silver masks glinting green from the onslaught of death they spewed from their wands. Voldemort's followers would have become much more powerful, but only when they were in their Death Eater regalia (and thus acting on his explicit instructions). Naturally, he lets them believe their increase in strength is from the Dark Mark (and thus his own power) to make him stronger off their belief.

This magic system does have a few holes in it. I can't think of a way to explain muggleborn, save as a cop-out-y answer of muggles whose psychic field was just strong enough to manifest magic of its own. Accidental magic would also be a problem, but one that could be solved by saying that working magic and spellcasting requires at a bare minimum internal belief to work. External belief is merely a bonus and can't prop someone up on its own. Because the subconscious field works to bring into reality what you believe (not necessarily make someone stronger), it can also stifle a magical person's own power (for example, if their parents didn't believe in them) and then you get squibs from high-pressure, high-society pureblood families, or from people who have too little self-worth to believe they are capable of anything. As a side note, this system would mean that wands, crystal balls and every magical aide are merely there as a crutch for people's magic: they believe they help, that they need a wand to use magic, and so they /do/. The system unfortunately doesn't satisfactorily explain extremely powerful yet (mostly) forgotten magical artifacts such as the Mirror of Erised, the Resurrection Stone or Gryffindor's Sword.

On the munchkinry side, this system can be easily exploited by anyone with a severe lack of morals. Simply kidnap, breed and raise a population of magical people, keep them brainwashed and indoctrinated from birth, using House Elves that will only feed them if they worship the Great Undying God Voldemort before each meal. Set this up in a magically expanded and warded space somewhere it won't be found/missed (in a desert in Africa or something) and you've got yourself a massive power farm that will keep you strong no matter what.

Come to think of it, that's what a Horcrux could be: the imprisoned soul of the person you murdered to create it, brainwashed into believing with all their (remaining being) for all eternity that you are immortal and cannot be killed.

Maybe I should write something about this one day.

** The issue with harry Potter isnt that its strong, but that its strong with little to do to balance that strength. The best magical system ive came across has been from Mistborn. That system works on a checks and balances system with exceptions to nearly every rule out there but even those must have conditions.

Harry potter its point, intent, done. The only system close to that is super powers from marvel and DC, both of which i havent found a crossover that is terrible due to story. (grammar is another thing).

Now if i must cross over, i utilize the disadvantages of hp magic. Distance is a factor. After 100 yards no curse does more than a nose bleed unless you are really good with a wand. 300 yards? No dice period. This gives a spgere of influence that most other magic systems don't have, and it can be considered a weakness.

Another idea is buffing other magics. For example, inheritance's magical systems only weakness is the direct tie between magic and life energy. (and knowledge) however, if you make a character an anomaly or find a way around this, much like how paloni did it in-universe, you have a compariable system. Say, intend, done.

** Magical resistance is one option, and so are having the occasional godlike entities to balance things out.

You'll also notice that magical combat in Harry Potter is limited, almost exclusively, to face-to-face magical combat. An excellent balancing act is to crossover with a magical system that doesn't need your opponent to look you in the eyes to kill you. In the Dresden Files, given enough time and preparation, there is very little to limit what a wizard can accomplish beyond the fetters of his own belief in what he can do. In the very first book of the series, someone manages to kill people by ripping the hearts out of their chest while an entire city or more away. Another wizard pulls a satellite down from orbit in order to kill some people that pissed him off. There isn't a lot Harry Potter wizards can do to stop that, apart from maaaybe holing up under a Fidelius and a lot of wards and hoping a turbocharged blood curse won't find you and kill your entire family. If your opponent is smart, (s)he won't give you enough warning to do that. And really, that situation doesn't change much in the 'Files; those wizards can kick ass from halfway around the planet, but most of them suffer from considerable disadvantages in direct combat, which is where HP wizards would shine. Each system has their own strength.

I think Steelbadger has done the best power-balancing act by simply /taking away Harry's wand/ when he ends up in Middle-Earth.
