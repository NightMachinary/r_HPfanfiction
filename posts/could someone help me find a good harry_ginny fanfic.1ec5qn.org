preferably by someone British as the change in words is something i have started to find deeply annoying as it didn't have to put up with it in the books.

** The first fanfic I ever read was "The Hogs Head", a Harry/Ginny after DH fic, canon compliant. It was a really good first choice, and lead to my ff author penname (even though I'm more of a Harmonian now)

You can find it on fanfiction.net or siye.co.uk
