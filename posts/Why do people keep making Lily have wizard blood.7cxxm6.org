Seriously, what is up with this? She's supposed to be a muggleborn. That's it. Why the hell do people keep making her secretly the descendant of Salazar Slytherin, or Morgana le Fay, or a wizarding family that had sex with demons.

This is usually done just to give Harry some more powers, going against the whole “blood doesn't equal power” deal the books have. And if you absolutely /must/ give Harry powers based on his birthright, why not just keep it to James' side? Or make some kind of right of conquest from vanquishing Voldemort?

I've noticed a similar thing with Hermione, where she's secretly a LeStrange and drops her old boring muggle family like hot potatoes once she finds out.

Now, if the rest of story followed the “blood matters” perspective, it would be understandable. But a lot of these stories still preach the “blood /doesn't/ matter” moral, despite contributing one of the most important muggleborn's success to her wizarding blood (and again, giving Harry some swanky new powers thanks to his even stronger lineage).

Unrelated, but I'm also getting tired of seeing Lily be some crazy bitch who threatens to take off James' balls for teaching Harry pranks and everyone thinks she's scarier than Voldemort. Having the nice lady be a demon when angry is an overplayed trope.


** Because JKR said in one of her interviews that "Muggle-born witches and wizards usually have an ancestor (possibly very distant) who was a witch or wizard."

The emphasis is on /usually/.

Fanfic writers could obviously work with the word 'distant'.

*** If squibs are kept in the breeding pool and reproduce with muggles, basically everyone probably has a wizard ancestor. Just 2 or 3 squibs from the time of Hogwarts founding would probably have as descendent half the UK population.\\
And among pure-bloods, probably everyone is descended from Slytherin, the Peverells, and Hufflepuff.

**** If the ability to do magic is a recessive Mendelian trait (maybe a genetic marker for the favor of a god or some ancient machine), then having magical ancestors would be necessary, but not sufficient, to make you a muggleborn. You would actually need to have both copies of the magic allele percolated down through the generations.

MM = witch or wizard

mm = muggle

Mm = squib/potential parent of muggleborns

Squibs are created by mutations in children of witch/wizard couples.

The wizarding population is much smaller than you would expect given reasonable rates of love potion/Imperius rape, but that can probably be fixed by making it a multiple-locus genetic marker where you have to have the correct gene at all loci. (So M1M2M3 gives you magic, anything else doesn't.) That would pretty much require it to be a marker for the favor of a god or ancient machine. If it were polygenic in the natural way, magical power would be variable and heritable, i.e., pureblood supremacists would be right (at least on the facts, if not on the ethics).

***** If the ability to use magic is genetic, your analysis is right. But is it?\\
No "science" of magic is ever seen in canon: what we see is somewhat more akin to medieval alchemy (a bunch of experimental "rules" mixed with symbolism). You still need an explanation for why so many children of magical are magical, but I'm sure one could find several without using genetics.\\
The scientific mindset we use when observing and giving sense to the world is recent: it does not appear before the 17th and 18th century; it is quite hard to think outside of one's conception of the world, and very few fanfics do it in a convincing way (Untitled tome is the best one of those I think), but as one of the main point of HP is that one is not defined by one's ancestry but by one's acts, trying to give a genetic explanation to access to magical powers goes against this idea.

** In canon Lily had two things going for her. She was the paragon of the power of love, capable of besting the "last enemy Death" and she was muggleborn - born from a different culture, thrown into a new great world. We could imagine that she has seen the same things and felt the same feelings as Harry when he came into this new adventure.

Taking her muggleborn status away from her diminishes the character, in my opinion. Same with Hermione. Their characters gain something from the fact that they are the underdog in a society traveling towards pureblood supremacy. The facts of their birth alone add a sense of urgency to their actions in their wars. "If we don't win, I'm dead either way". That they are both powerful witches is just the topping on the cake, proving to the reader and their world that blood truly does not matter.

I think the reason why authors write them into being purebloods is that they feel like thats their only way to get them into the magical high-society. Which is, of course, not true. The only high-society event we know of is Slughorn's Party - which, yes, is primarily populated by purebloods but in no way closed off to muggleborns. As long as they bring something to the table, they're in.

I feel like this trope originated (or at least got a massive boost) by anime.

I personally like to think that Lily was damn dangerous if she wanted to be. Highly intelligent and knowledgeable is almost synonymous with being a powerful witch in the HP world. But I can get behind the annoyance of the character that blows up every time James is being silly with Harry. I'd rather think that she was the more quite of the two parents, sitting back with a fond smile on her face.

** In addition to JKR's own statements, with any plausible population dynamics, any wizard from the time of the Founders or earlier should be an ancestor to everyone in Europe, muggle /and/ magical--even with the separation between the worlds--even if it's Salazar Slytherin.

The real problem is when the bloodline actually /matters/. The Slytherin line carefully cultivated its Parselmouth trait, but that ought to come from generations of effort, not magically from just being a descendant of Salazar. "Family Magic" and anything similar is tangible evidence that blood /does/ matter that crops up far to often in stories with an ostensible message that blood doesn't matter.

As for why, well, we know that a lot of fanfic writers just want Harry to be more powerful and apparently don't think about it too deeply.

** Bloodline powers are a trope, and there's at least one example in canon. It would be a lot more awesome if they found out how to create their own bloodline powers.

It's wish fulfillment to give someone access to wealth and prestige that comes from an old pureblood family.

It's a pretty good cartoon with some different characters and even morals as well. I suggest checking it out when you have the time. (But up to you of course).

** I think it stems from the fact that if we were to follow canon, Harry got power from Voldemort through his Horcrux, but apparently the only thing he got was Parseltongue.

This seems rather useless so instead of having him get one thing from something that's supposedly the darkest thing in existence, people find reasons for Harry to have powers (Parseltongue, Elementalist etc) from his bloodline.

If someone came out and said “yeah, in my fic there's actually some basis to the blood purity nonsense” then I'd be chill with it as long as it doesn't just turn into Pureblood wanking. It's fanfiction, it's meant to explore different ideas. I think it'd actually be interesting to see a fic that explores this in depth.

Outliers aside, I don't think changing their often distant heritage for whatever plot device the author wants somehow lessens their achievements any. We don't think less of Hermione when Slughorn suggests she might be related to Dagworth-Granger.

***** Thats probably because it's a word connected with an idea. To be "pure". If you're pure, there are others who are not, otherwise you would not make this distinction. Those others are also defined. Half-bloods and muggleborns. And by the meaning of the word "pure" alone, those who are are better than those who are not.

In real life I would also think of someone as a Nazi if he describes himself as a "pureblooded aryan". The word "pureblood" itself is proof towards the fact that something is seriously wrong among wizarding cultures.

Which is why I like, for example "wizardborn" as a word that I sometimes read in post-war fics. Its a word with no inherent indication of the person's worth, but still descriptive.

******* Just that the price-tag on purebreeds is suddenly multiplying, further enforcing the belief that the pure-breeded one is, maybe not the better dog in a sense that he fetches sticks better, but the one that gives you as owner more status - its the higher worth symbol of status.

Saying that the word "pure" doesn't weigh the worth of an object is simply ignoring its use and meaning in the English language.

Pure gold is worth more as a brick than unrefined gold.

Pure soil lets plants grow better and has no toxins in it.

Pure steel is the superior material with which to craft tools and weapons.

The purity of your soul lets you go to heaven, while impurities let you go to hell.

This water is pure - describing water that will hydrate you, and will not make you sick.

"This is pure fun!" - Describing something that only provokes feelings of happiness and entertainment.

And then, "He is pure-blooded" - Describing the wizard that is untainted by any heritage from muggles.

As much as you may want to deny it, but "pureblood" is a discriminatory term, simply because of it's use of the word "pure" to describe the heritage (blood) of someone.

Now I think we all don't need to pretend to not know how the reaction of that person would be. Definitely not positive.

I mean are we really pretending that the adjective "pure" to describe blood - or just the general existence of a person - has in any age and region on this planet be used for anything else but to determine who is the "pure and better" race and who isn't? Are you /that/ ignorant?

And don't get me wrong. I get that it can be a word in wizarding society that is just ingrained in their speech patterns, with no true weight for many. Yet, it is undeniably so that the word in and of itself is a description for the wizards without impurities in their blood.

And mate, if you try to tell me that me telling you that by your birth alone you are impure would not be considered an insult by you, then I know you're just lying to make your argument.
