A fic in which the entire character of Dumbledore is supplanted by Palpatine.

Thus the scheming fanon actually makes sense, which is one upside, but more importantly, it can be packed with so many prequel memes.

Palpatine meets Harry in front of the Mirror of Erised - is it possible to learn this power?

Harry doing anything darkish - Remus probably: YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE

Draco during the duelling club: It's over, Potter, I have the high ground!

Etc. Etc.


** Harry and Dumbledore sat watching the Quidditch game above them. the cheers of the Slytherins and Hufflepuffs drowning out the worry Harry secretly held for Sirius. He had been having nightmares recently of Sirius dying during the War against Voldemort and they hadn't been stopping.

Shaking off the worry and unable to focus on the game he looked to his right at Dumbledore. The man was smiling and watching the game with glee, but that smile dropped when he felt Harry's eyes on him.

"I know the Order has asked you to Spy on me Harry..."

Harry's eyes widened a fraction but he didn't deny it. He had no idea why the Order of the Phoenix had ordered him to spy on his Mentor, but he was surprised that Dumbledore knew.

Dumbledore shifted in his seat "Tell me, Harry, Have you ever heard the Tragedy of Gellert Grindelwald the Wise?"

"No..." Harry answered

"I thought not," Dumbledore chuckled "It's not a tale the Order would tell you..."

*** “Gellert Grindelwield was a Dark Lord Of Ancient Mystical Arts, so powerful and so wise, he could use his powers to influence the Magical Currents to create life.”

The game surged on, as a Hufflepuff Chaser rushed ahead in a burst of speed, dodging a bludger. Harry was watching the match, but also paying attention to the words of his mentor.

Turning to the older man, he asked,”Well... what happened to him?”

Dumbledore ‘s eyes twinkled. “Well, he saught to show his discoveries to the world... his best friend was the one he showed his newfound abilities to first. And that night, his friend slipped into his room and slit his throat. “ Dumbledore paused as the game was coming to an end.

“Ironic is it not? He could save others from death, but not himself.”

** They marched.

None daring to stop the movement of their procession when it was Alastor Moody likoing ahead of them all, both eyes focussed only on the path ahead of them.

The office of newly minted Minister of Magic: Shiev Palpatine.

The door slid open with a hiss, the man's gaze rising up from the leaf of parchment between his fingers to take note of them. Minute surprise falling away to unveil that mild smile only a politician could muster,

"Auror Moody! I trust Lestrange has been dealt with. I must say you're here sooner than I expected."

Alastor lead the way, flicking his wand into his grasp from his pocket which encouraged the rest of his quintet to do the same as he spoke,

"In the name of the Ministry of Magic, you are under arrest."

Gone was any semblance of pleasantry from Palpatine,

"Are you threatening me, Auror." He spat his title back at Mad-Eye with venom. Vitriol and hatred twisting old mans features into a mask most foul, unperturbed, Mad-Eye continued,

"The Wizagmot will decide your fate."

"I AM the Wizagmot."

"Not yet."

A calm fell over the Ministers office, the building tension having reached it's apex as the red robed man rose to his feet.

He flexed his wrist and a long, pale wand fell into his grip from within his sleeves,

"It's treason then..." Slow, cold,

MOTION. He was across the desk, wand a blur before anyone could blink.

They'd been prepared for a struggle, to have to bring him down by force. Hell, they'd even determined he wouldn't go down easy. But in a second, spears of light proceeded Palpatine instantly closing the distance between he and the members of the Order. Hestia Jones and Emmaline Vance falling prey to the onslaught as they failed to react in time.

Having barely touched the ground before Palpatine swung about to cleave Kingslet Shacklebolt from shoulder to hip and finish off Daedalus Diggle with a curse that tunnelled a hole through his skull.

In seconds, Moody was alone, his own walking stick forgotten as his own wand flashed. The duel of his life awaiting him as Palpatine returned fire.
