Do you know any fics where Harry:

- never gets a Hogwarts letter or for some other reason just never gets into the wizarding world/knows he is a wizard until he is an adult and someone stumbles upon him per chance in the muggle world

- goes completely muggle after Deathly Hallows and breaks all contacts to the wizarding world

It would be appreciated if the focus of the story is on Harry making his way in the muggle world and if it is not slash.

So any of you got something like this? This premise is somehow hard to find, but I think it really has potential!


** In Grey Space, Hogwarts doesn't start until fourteen, so it covers Harry living as a Muggle, unaware of the wizarding world entirely, for his first few years at Stonewall High. It's sad, but I highly recommend it. linkao3(grey space by noaacat)

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  AU. Harry didn't go to Hogwarts, he went to Stonewall Secondary. His main goal in life was to leave the Dursleys' and go to college, until Remus Lupin finds him on his seventeenth birthday and his life changes all at once. See Ch 1 AN for more info.

** Life skills outside the curriculum by Endrina sounds like what you are after - Harry runs away from the Dursleys and survives growing up homeless in London. Does contain Drarry ultimately (sorry), but I never ship Drarry and still enjoyed it. Linkao3(7693897)

Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run starts off in a similar way but is less about Harry navigating the Muggle world and more about an almost adult Harry finally being told he has magic and learning how to use it. Also Drarry(!) but imo it's still worth a read. Linkao3(16653022)

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhk√§se.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
