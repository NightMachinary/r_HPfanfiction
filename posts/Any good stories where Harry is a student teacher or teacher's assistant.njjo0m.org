I just want to read some stories where Harry is grading homework, assigning detentions, or doing rounds while still being a student.

Recently I have read Taking control by fake a smile

Any other good ones?

*** That Remuneration for Instructional Services series is amazing. And if it went longer it would be exactly the kind of fic I was looking for. The rest aren't up my alley, but thanks for having them all together.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
