Hello y'all,

Are there any fics which explore the universe of Stranger Things, but at Hogwarts?

Or for the matter horror stories that involve Hogwarts?

Thanks.


** Not aware of any Stranger Things crossovers, but you may enjoy

linkffn(That Which Holds The Image) - A Doctor Who crossover where the Weeping Angels start showing up in Hogwarts. Never watched any of DW, but I found it compelling and nerve-wracking

linkffn(Evil Be Thou My Good) - A Hellraiser crossover, but you don't need to have seen the movies. Suffice it to say that Harry accidentally summons some very bad people as a child in Number Four Privet Drive and this comes back to help him later when Voldemort returns

*** Check out "Blink" from the third season of DW. Completely standalone and provides a lot of backstory for the angels.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

  Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.

** linkffn(Forbidden by Savageland) is the closest thing I can think of. It's got some incredible world building.

  Ten years after Harry Potter defeated Voldemort, the Wizarding World seems safe: until two Hogwarts students disappear without a trace in the Forbidden Forest. Strangely linked to this incident is Severus Snape, who died in the Shrieking Shack. Or did he? When Hermione Granger is pulled into the investigation, she discovers the unimaginably dangerous truth. Complete.

** I'm commenting mostly because I want to bookmark this thread, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10561940][The Lost Children]] is a horror oneshot that involves Hogwarts.
