I thought I'd bump one of my favorite HPFF stories. I normally try to read stories that stick to canon and explain years after the Battle of Hogwarts, so this AU was really different for me but Cocobolo shows a lot of creativity in building her own universe. It's like nothing I've read before.

It is quite short, considering it goes through about 8 years.
