Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather not have: Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, if there's no Weasley bashing I'll allow it though.

Can be on ANY Site

No OP Harry, no Harem Harry, no Lord Potter-Black-Malfoy. Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful is fine, but I don't want him to be insanely smart, or insanely powerful.

Anyone can be the main character.

Would rather it be completed, but if not, it's fine.


** linkffn(9860311), one of the best time travel stories i've read so far. Harry does get back, but they have to get back to their own time the long way.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
