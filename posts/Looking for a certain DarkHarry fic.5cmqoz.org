The name of this one escapes me. It's a Dark!Harry fic where he finds out Moody is really Crouch, meets and helps Voldy, that kind of stuff. What makes it different from the others is that he writes to this dude named Joseph Leeds, who's an American academic and parselmouth who completely fucked up Grindelwald's forces via the Bombing of Dresden after Grindelwald killed one of his family members. Hermione and her parents are also on bad terms in this story.

Anyone remember the name of the fic? I can't remember very much from it other than the Joseph Leeds part.
