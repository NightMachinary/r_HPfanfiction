I remember them making Hermione do harder and harder, but always innocent heists, like stealing a quill from Snape's desk during class, or something from Dumbledore's office. Does anyone remember this one? It wasn't the main focus of the fic, but just a bit of added fun.


** Linkffn(Lady Thief) possibly?

Edit: Nvm no it's not.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

**** No problem. Been a while since I read Wand, but I just found myself really enjoying that simple interaction between Hermione and SI so it clicked when you mentioned it.

That being said, it wasn't a sex thing.

  (Dumbledore Bashing! Lunar Harmony!) Based on, but not an answer to DZ2's "What's Yours is Mine" challenge. The Shadow-Walkers, magical thieves of extraordinary power, have long been thought extinct. But Harry, Hermione and Luna not only have those powers, but intend to use them to take everyone from Dumbledore to Voldemort to the cleaners...and make a little profit along the way.
