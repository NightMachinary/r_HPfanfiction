I remember there was a site someone told me the bot itself is using, I think. I used to use it, but I forgot what it was. Hope someone could help.


** I use ficsave.xyz

*** That's the one, thank you.

Weird it's not advertised more on the side-bar, pretty useful resource. The only alternative is awkwardly taking some post over to spam the bot with your messages.

I use command-line fanficfare, but there is an addon for calibre too.
