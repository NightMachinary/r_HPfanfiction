I'm looking for some (preferably long) fics that follow our friends from right after the final battle and continue into their adult lives. Extra points for a realistic portrayal of what the trio will go through mentally, etc., not just ones where every thing is all peachy the next day

  Over fifty people died at the Battle of Hogwarts. There are dozens of stories of loss, betrayal, heroism and sacrifice. These are some of those stories.

** Melindaleo's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11317075/1/These-Cuts-I-Have][These Cuts I Have]] and its continuation, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12787674/1/Some-Cuts-Leave-Scars][Some Cuts Leave Scars]], are reliably fantastic reads! linkffn(11317075), linkffn(12787674)

(I also want to recommend a great non-canon post-war fic called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/282139/1/After-the-End][After the End]] linkffn(282139), written and finished before The Order of the Phoenix came out. It follows Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, /and/ Sirius and Remus after Voldemort is defeated, and despite having been written before the last three books, the characters feel familiar and the repercussions realistic.)

  The war has been won, yet the aftershocks continue. The scattered survivors are left to pick up the pieces and find ways to move on. Join the various members of the extended Weasley family as they struggle to rebuild and cope with the consequences. And of course there are still Death Eaters left to find.

This fic is the best one I've found that deals with post-war societal trauma.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15275916][there will come a time, you'll see]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/aloneintherain/pseuds/aloneintherain][aloneintherain]]) is sort of this? It's definitely this sort of fic.

** Rebuilding by Colubrina (not sure how to link it on mobile) it's a dramione, but I love the way it shows multiple characters dealing with trauma from the war.

  In the morning after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry felt tired. In the morning after the morning after, he was downright exhausted. The war may be over, but there are still battles to be fought.
