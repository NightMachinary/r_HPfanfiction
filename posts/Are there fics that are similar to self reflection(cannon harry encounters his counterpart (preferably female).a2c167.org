** Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived

one by SilverAegis ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11525673/1/Harry-Potter-the-Girl-Who-Lived]]) and another one by Agnostics Puppet ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4040192/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Lived]])

** I think that is the only one that does it like that.

There are a couple where Harry encounters his opposite (Through the mirror, Harry encounters an Evil!Slytherin!Female!Ruthless Harry).

Most of the rest are fix-it fics (involving a older Harry, Male or female, 'saving/guiding' a younger Harry).

**** The best of them is probably Harry Potter and the Girl who Lived. 19 Year old Harry gets thrown across universes into a 4th year Girl!Harry Universe. linkffn(4040192)

For the opposite, you have Adult Female Harry coming back to save canon Harry. I don't recall exactly which fic it was, but there was a plot twist involving a magical book. Turns out Female Harry was Ink from a magical book, like Tom Riddles Journal

The 'opposite Harriet is opposite' I think was Equal and Opposite. I don't recall it being overly great.

***** For the first one you mentioned the comments seem to be pretty negative. Is there any prominent writing or setting issue in the story, in your opinion?

****** Honestly none of these made my favorite list, even though I think the pairing has a ton of potential :(.

Haven't read it recently, sorry :(. It wasn't good enough to reread, but I finished it and recall it was palatable.
