The shade of Tom Riddle eagerly awaited the response to this stunning revelation. Potter would be stunned, shocked, terrified -

‚ÄúHuh. Well that's convenient.‚Äù

...

What.

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù

‚ÄúEr, I mean,‚Äù Harry began sheepishly, ‚ÄúYou're already trying to kill me, or the older version of you is, so it's not like I'm getting a new arch nemesis.‚Äù

Tom felt his eye begin to twitch.

‚ÄúPlus, it's really convenient for you that your name is an anagram for ‚ÄòI am Lord Voldemort.' Imagine if you're name was spelled with a ‚ÄòTh' or you had a regular middle name, like uh... ‚ÄòJohn'. What would you call yourself then?‚Äù Harry queried, as Tom felt his rage building. Could a not-quite-solid-soul-fragment have an aneurism?

‚ÄúOh! My French isn't great, but wouldn't ‚ÄòVoldemort' translate roughly to ‚Äòflight of death'? Very fitting, if you ask me. Almost like you had your made up name before you had your original name.‚Äù

Pinching the bridge of his nose to stave off his impending migraine (How was that even possible? Did his brain have blood before the rest of him did or was it just one of those ‚Äòit's magic' moments?) Tom wearily hissed to the basilisk, ‚ÄúPlease come and kill this idiot before he can continue to assault the fourth wall.‚Äù

  Voler in French means flying as in "flying a plane", not flying as in "running away"

  You can also fly out of room ("She flew through the door" / "Elle vole vers la porte"), and you can use it informally as stealing, like you can "lift" something from a store in English.
#+end_quote

Sorry, I'm a stickler for this. Replace it with "theft from death" if you want, tho.

Edit: some explanation I came up with on discord:

Vol de mort can be translated with "flight from/of death" but there are 2 ways to read that: flight = üõ©Ô∏è and flight = üèÉ.

Voler specifically refers to üõ©Ô∏è.\\
People /wrongly/ think it's üèÉ.

**** You could consider Voldemort as Death, sure, but then you would be meaning "death flying from death" in your example. So I wouldn't say it means flying away from death. Voldemort can be roughly translated to either Flying Death or Theft of Death.

Though Theft of Death would mean he's stealing death, which doesn't make much sense to me. It doesn't mean he's stealing /from/ death, or that he's stealing life like he does with Horcruxes, but that he's taking death for himself. And I'm not sure what that would mean.

***** Taking ownership over his own death, at a guess. Like, with the Horcruxes, he decides when he dies because he can't be killed until they're gone. So, he's taking his death from himself more specifically, but in a general sense he's taking the concept of death for himself in that he's making it his own.

***** Keep in mind, with the 'Theft of Death' wording, that you're taking liberties either way. After all, it's being made into a name! So little grammatical mistakes are fine-ish, I think - so stealing from death or stealing death itself are both fine interpretations in my book.

**** So, "flying away" carries more connotations of "Flee" than physical flight. "Voldemort" could be translated as the latter - as in, Death physically flying around. 'De' translates as 'of', and not 'from', in your example. Instead, it refers to death itself.

Alternatively, you can look at it as 'Theft' - it wouldn't be quite grammatically correct, but "Theft from Death" is a meaning you can take from it, and you need to make some concessions when making a good name!

Another angle might be more poetic - a flight of birds would translate the same way (using vol), so you can picture death in the form of a bunch of flying objects/birds darkening the sky and approaching...

(Flight, as in to run away from or flee, would be 'Fuite" as a noun or "Fuir" as a verb)

*** Vol in French does match with Flight in a few ways - both mean flight (with wings), both can mean the distance covered by a flying person/object, and both can mean a group of similar flying objects/things (eg, a flock of geese = a flight of geese = un vol d'oies). Vol in French also means theft, like you say, though I would disagree with it being informal like 'lift/lifting' - my family would use it interchangeably/in the same context as theft in english.

Flight, as in to flee, would be 'Fuite' in french.

I think that 'Flight of Death' would be a fine-ish translation for Voldemort, as would 'Theft from Death' or 'Flying Death'. 'Flight *from* Death', however, would not be a good one.

Personally if I had to pick them, I'd pick "Flight of Death" for the obvious one (that the English newspapers/public would be likely to pick up on) and "Theft from Death" as the alternate/hidden one. The dual meanings are strangely fitting - I doubt that Rowling actually considered that in naming Voldemort, despite her knowledge of french. "Death's Flight" is one I'd be partial to as well, as I find it more poetic - but it'd likely unfortunately send the wrong impression

**** Yeah, but it's still "Flight of death" as in flying, not as in fleeing - which is what the OP indicated.

I'm not a native French speaker, so regarding theft I was trusting my dictionary - which might very well be wrong.

***** Oh, definitely - it's physical, vertical flight. I'd just think of fleeing from something as 'flight /from/' instead of 'flight /of/', but that might just be me. Though 'Flight of' could mean that whatever it is is fleeing, but there's not really a better word for physical flight in english that I can think of.

***** That is also still mildly appropriate. Combined stereotypes of Wizarding ignorance of Muggles and Britain's ignorance of France. I like the idea of the Purebloods finding out their boss is named after a Muggle Doodad and getting miffed in that "Did you hear..?" - "I know! Such a travesty. It's never the ones you expect it from, is it?" - "Tsk. Dark Lord today, DJ in Ibiza tomorrow. No respect for traditions." etc etc sort of way before promptly never mentioning it to Voldie for fear of Death or Crucio.

*** I am french and ‚Äú vol de mort ‚Äú mean literally : ‚Äú robbery of death‚Äù like if you stole someone death.

In this sentence : ‚Äúvol de mort‚Äù it cannot mean running away at all like in any way possible.

It could be flying but not from death. It would be like a flight of deaths, like a a lot of dead people flying in the sky like birds. But to be exactly correct it would be written : ‚Äúvol de morts‚Äù

But im stinking with the robbery thing it is what make the most sense when you read it in correct french.

Hope i help.

The condescension here is in your assumption that you're talking to someone who /doesn't/ understand that - when it's quite clear that [[/u/vlaaivlaai]] does understand the component parts of Voldemort (Vol de mort), as their first comment in the chain literally shows. Your 'correction' comes across as smug and completely off topic, since you've basically made it up that they got an easy thing wrong.

Your next comment, the one chastising them towards civility, is also quite smug. You continue to discuss the 'Voler' part of it, which is again completely irrelevant, as vlaaivlaai has demonstrated an understanding of it multiple times. You then have the 'Watch your tongue' comment which comes across as /ridiculously/ condescending when written like that.

** Having the name Voldemort translate to "flight of death" where the 'flight' means literal flying actually makes some sense, given that Voldemort is one of only 2 wizards shown to be capable of unassisted flight, and given that his chosen symbol is a skull hovering in the sky. HE is death, flying toward his victims.

Even if I admit it's much more plausible that either JK is a poor translator or that Voldemort himself is shit at French and intended it to be 'flight FROM death' in the sense of 'lol my horcruxes will save me'.

Flight of Death (as in, plane-related flying) refers to him being under the Blitz and terrified of the flying-planes of death and his subsequent fear of it, which was the beginning of his journey towards Dark Lord-dom and his motivations toward the horcrux making. It's his symbolic promise to become that which he feared (Death raining down upon you while you can't fight back) and excel beyond it (his Horcruxes).
