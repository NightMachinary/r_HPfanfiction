Harry Potter canon has some very good foreshadowing (horcruxes in CoS and OotP, vanishing cabinet and cursed necklace in CoS, H/G hints since PS, wormwood + apshodel question by Snape, etc).

Is there any fanfiction that has those kind of moments, some kind of seemingly unimportant line that only make sense when you read it again?


** /HPMoR/ is famously overcrowded with crazy amounts of foreshadowing that make a second reading quite an experience.

**** Lmao, reading that fic made me get annoyed at the author, rather than annoyed at Harry. I tried reading it and there was no Harry in it at all. My brain just couldn't acknowledge "Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres" as Harry.

***** Well, that was the point. When “Harry” finally sees his name on the Marauder's Map, it isn't Harry.

***** I'm personally on the "love it" side of the love it / hate it split that HPMoR has, but now I think it helped that for me It was seperated by 5 years before and 2 after from anything else Harry Potter.

**** In that case, don't force yourself. It's just one of these love-it-or-hate-it things where some people just can't get into it no matter their resolve, while other people are instantly sucked in, and there's no workaround.

** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter]]) Has an excellent mystery plot with fantastic foreshadowing. Unfortunately it's hard to say why the foreshadowing is good without spoiling it.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?
