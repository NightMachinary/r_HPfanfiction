Basically, what fics are there that you've read that weren't very good, but that did one or two things so well that you bumped it up a letter grade it probably didn't deserve? For me the main one is Passageways by jerrway69. It's depiction of a manipulative, antagonist Dumbledore is the best I've ever seen (in later chapters that is) but the rest...not so much.

**** The second person view was a very nice brain stretch. Want to know a not-nice brain stretch? I once attempted to read a published(!) book called Seatrain where the author replaced every "and" with an ampersand (&). Reading it was comparable to hitting very well defined speed bump at 30 mph (50kph for you brits), repeatedly, every other sentence.

** linkffn(In Atlantean Caves) is a lot like NMB's By the Divining Light (which I will not link, because it is actually a great fic). By that, I mean that it gives me a sense of fantasy and wonder that you don't see often in fanfiction--most of the time, magic feels so boring and utilitarian.

It also has poor, tell-over-show writing, pointless romance and drama, and (most glaringly) is abandoned.

** linkffn(By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept) is so unique and offbeat that I can completely forgive it for having Petunia as a main character, being a Severitus fic, and running about a gazillion words long without any sign of slowing down.

Edited to add: and the writing isn't bad, not in the least. I quite like it, in fact. It's the premise that seems terrible but amazingly isn't.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** I would say, iirc, linkffn(An Aunt's Love).

Otherwise mediocre fic that gets a boost because it legitimately (so far as I can tell, at least) deals with the fact that Harry would need a dedicated therapist to deal with some of the shit he's seen, and does so in a non-stereotypical manner.

** There is one fic that has stuck with me for three years. In terms of grammar and spelling, it's fantastic. But it's a nightmare in terms of content--the biggest issue is an untagged-and-unwarned-for rape scene (technically coerced consent, but one character is very obviously manipulating the situation in his favour in a very creepy way). A second chapter was added more recently, and like the first, it's at best pure porn.

But the themes, oh man the themes. I'm really sad the author didn't elaborate on them, because there's some REALLY fascinating potential there. And it turned me on to an aspect of the pairing that I had previously been unaware of, and which is sadly still REALLY rare--I don't think I've ever read another fic that arranges them in a similar way, or not a decently explicit one at least.

Such wasted potential.
