I'm looking for something where they land in a new world and they both very much still want to kill each other. I just think it'd be cool to see "the wolves being let into the coop" so to speak. Without Voldemort or his war having happened before how does everyone react to a stupidly powerful dark lord just showing up one day out of the blue along with another powerful wizard who's constantly trying to bring him down?


** u/thrawnca:
#+begin_quote
  stupidly powerful dark lord

I actually think it might be more interesting if the people in this new world can meaningfully fight the two of them, so they're not just an interesting backdrop to the ongoing fight but active participants.

** Man, I read one of these types of fics. One where it was a war hardened Harry fighting a similarly war hardened Bellatrix. Shit was cash, if it would've been Voldemort, even better.

*** Do you remember it's name? If not do you remember any of the keywords I could look for to find it?
