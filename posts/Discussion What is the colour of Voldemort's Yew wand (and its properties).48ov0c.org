** No matter what color the wood is, it's most likely stained or dyed and likely patinated.

*** A lot of people like to shit on custom wands, but I like to believe that there is a service out there that allows people to customize the appearance of their wand, such as runes, different handles, putting it in a cane, etc. Sort of like a /Pimp Your Wand/ kit or something.

**** Customizing a wand? Fine. Custom supercore wands that just make ollivander's wand look like a moped versus a top fuel dragster? Your story sucks because riddle would have a super pimped out wand too.

****** I referenced that in my latest story:

Excerpt: (lead instead of graphite is on purpose, he was born when pencils WERE lead cored.)

Harry thanked Mrs. Barq for his lunch and walked her back to the door then settled at the small table as his grandfather appeared. "I forgot to explain the measurements thing yesterday." Harry nodded.

"Magic is very difficult to quantify. We can really only do so by the ease at which one magical person can do something compared to another. Albus is very good at magic, therefore people assume he's stronger than others.

"But I've seen magicals who struggle to do even the simplest charms cast a difficult charm like the patronus. A spell to create a corporeal feeling of pure happiness to drive away minor demons. So trying to measure magic is perhaps impossible."

"Then why did Mr. Ollivander try?"

"He's not really trying to quantify magic, he's attempting to create a chart of characteristics of magicals to make matching students faster. You took quite a long time AND damaged the shop some. Now imagine having to do so with fifty to a hundred new students each summer?"

Harry nodded. "What about making wands? Can people make their own?"

"Anything can be a focus BUT there are a dozen really good magical woods and pairing them with magical cores helps focus your magic. In fact, muggle pencils? A fine makeshift focus if you replace the core of lead with occamy silver bonded charcoal. I used one like that in the forties for a couple years because I was too busy to go to Diagon Alley to get a properly attuned wand. My first wife was rather annoyed. She found it unbecoming of our station in life." He chuckled at the remembrance and was lost in thought for a few moments. "You would have liked her. She so wanted children but died from dragon-pox. She was always somewhat sickly."

** You're correct. Voldemort's wand was distinctly chosen by J.K. Rowling for the films, according to prop director Pierre Bohanna, and "it was meant to look like a bone".

As wand wood comes from magical trees, my guess would be that most wands (if not all of them) are carved from the living sapwood. Otherwise, "dead" wood may not carry the magic that is sought after when making a magic wand in the Potter universe.

I also wouldn't say Voldemort's wand is "unyielding". I would assign him the "hard" flexibility, simply because can (and has) changed his mind on certain things. For example, the 16-year-old Riddle from the Diary changed his mind about "killing Mudbloods".

As for the brown-colored wand, Voldemort used Lucius's wand, which is made of elm. I have a custom elm wand, and it's brown-colored. I wouldn't really think much of Voldemort using a brown-colored wand, but I would prefer his yew wand to be made from the living sapwood, as it makes more sense.

****** He did change his mind after his resurrection ritual. Originally he'd planned to immediately go out with it with his new reign of terror, but after what happened he changed his mind and decided to lay low and start the whole “cloak and dagger and a bit of hallucination on the side” thing.

It's not much, but I think it does count as him changing his mind, even if he would have had to be a cretin not to change it.
