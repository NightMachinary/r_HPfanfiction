Hey guys,

me again (well, after a while), this time I'd like you to give me your best vengeful, withdrawn, ambitious and spiteful (normal in a sense that no person - sorry, but it just isn't realistic - turns out like Harry after being treated so badly by the Dursleys for his whole life!) Harry! Basically what you'd expect if you put a child in an abusive household! (hitting people with frying pans, setting dogs on them and letting them get beaten up is abuse, sorry but I'll never get why many in the fandom think Harry was not abused...so what if Vernon didn't use a belt on him or beat him with other objects that leave scars, that's just more horrific abuse, but Harry's situation was far from normal, hell his aunt not feeding him probably stunted his growth etc.!)

What I mean by that is:

I want a Harry who does stuff out of spite/vengeance like say, when learning that he and Petunia have to consider Privet-Drive home, declaring (and of course believing) that Privet-Drive is NOT his home (and not caring if the Dursleys get killed - they treated him like shit, so why should he care?), so that the blood-protection is basically useless (the wards fall!)

I want a Harry who is more like Tom Riddle (calculating - but not sadistic, interested in magic (a studious Harry is always a plus...din't like him in canon because he's such a slacker and no I don't think that made him more relatable (then again: I read the books when I was fucking 18 and not a child anymore myself!)), playing the house politics, manipulating people if he thinks he can get away with it, being kind of cruel (or harsh) when he thinks he needs to protect himself (or others he considers friends!), not above being cruel (and using threats), being ambitious, looking into all forms of magic (so taboos and laws forbidding stuff aren't actually a reason for him to avoid certain magics!) etc....to make it clear: I don't want a future dark lord...unless he has other reasons than his abuse at the Dursleys (say he sees the wizard world in need of a wake-up-call and no other option to drag them kicking and screaming into the modern age!)), which is more likely than JK's fantasy of an abused child willingly dying for a world that has more or less done nothing but hurt him (remember those nice badges "Harry Stinks"? The press campaign by the ministry against him? The "Heir of Slytherin"-Stuff? Umbridge (sure she went after others, but Harry probably had it the worst!)? Not to mention Snape (who was out of control and nobody was even trying to reign him in!) and Malfoy (both bullies!)...there's also the fact that Dumbledore should NOT have the right to decide where the child goes (if there is no will CPS should step in, not a single person just taking the law into his own hands!) and Dumbledore KNOWING that he was condemning Harry to "dark and difficult years" (!))

Bonus points if either Draco Malfoy winds up Harry's friend or (if he's like in canon) is shown to be quite pathetic (IMHO he is...yeah I'll earn a lot of dislikes probably, I've just "bashed" two characters a lot of fans like :D)...

Additionally: I'd like Harry in either Slytherin or Ravenclaw (not mandatory)

What I don't want are the following things:

- no main character slash
- no Harry/Ginny (Harry/Hermione is ok - as long as she gets "cured" of her love and total faith in authority and books (without turning into a totally submissive walking encyclopedia!))

So, here you go - go wild guys and THANK YOU IN ADVANCE :)

#+end_quote

Umm... She set fire to a professor when she was 11 years old. What exactly are you talking about? I'd say she has a perfectly reasonable amount of faith in authority. She recognises, unlike Harry, that experienced adults are more likely to know how to run things than teenagers. At the same time, if she sees evidence that an adult is doing something wrong (be it Umbridge or Snape or whoever), she has no qualms opposing that authority. I mean she led the Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and High Inquisitor of Hogwarts to a brutal beating (and possibly raping) by centaurs.

*** Yeah, and as for the books, she and Harry have a Muggle background, and Ron isn't exactly the most studious or reliable informant. He does give a lot of useful info, but there's stuff he's not gonna know because he's only 11(...)17. Of course she's gonna rely heavily on books. Apart from a perfectly natural crush on Lockhart affecting her judgement, generally she's able to pick up when books are wrong, but when you're thrown into an entirely new world you know nothing about, of course you're gonna rely on books a lot. If you don't rely on books, you end up late to class because you didn't know about the moving staircases, you blow up cauldrons because you didn't know the simple act of turning the flame down stopped that, you don't know how to unlock a door, or lock it, or produce water, or how to respond to any magical creature you encounter.

*** Yes, to save a friend (so she disregarded the rules for something higher, but she never simply overlooked them to have a bit of fun or because they are inconvenient! Most students disregard the rules if they can get away with it (and IMHO that's ok as long as you aren't hurting anybody - I mean look at a rule like curfew! If you disregard it and don't get enough sleep you are only hurting yourself!) and if doing so is convenient (or more or less expected, like say there's a rule against smoking and you still do it because it's "cool" - note: No, I am not encouraging smoking, hell I myself have smoked one cigarette in my life and that was on my 18th birthday!))

Yeah opposing authority that has done something wrong - she doesn't question people as a matter of principal, no she kind of waits till they do something she thinks is wrong (hell, she doesn't even oppose Dumbledore despite him leaving Harry with the Dursleys, him sending Harry back there every year and she doesn't even fight him on imposing a mail-embargo on Harry! Also: She always corrects Harry when he calls Snape simply Snape instead of "Professor Snape", despite the fact that this guys "teaching" is sub-par and he otherwise isn't somebody who should be around students either! So not really a professor IMHO!)

Same for her books - everything that's in a book must be right, that's kind of her stance and for someone as supposedly smart as she is those are kind of very dumb stances!

**** A Hermione that breaks rules for shits and giggles would be way out of character. Canon-Hermione doesn't break rules if she doesn't need to, but she doesn't let rules stop her, either.

Also, a child who grew up in a stable, loving household and didn't make any bad experiences with authority figures so far won't suddenly start questioning them on principle. Hermione's a character that looks at what's there, while Harry just goes with his gut feelings. So Harry might mistrust another character based on a hunch, while Hermione needs a reason. And while she puts a lot of trust in her teachers in the first books, this changes as the series goes on.

***** Not "for shits and giggles" but disregarding a useless and frankly simply inconvenient rule (like say curfew) isn't "for shits and giggles" especially if you are engrosed in a book and simply want to finish the chapter or something :) (or if writing an essay and you don't want to stop)

Hm...I grew up in a stable loving household and I do (and did!) question authority (even before I was bullied in secondary school...sure that intensified it to the level that authority figures now need to earn my trust instead of having it and loosing it if they make some sort of blunder!)

Yeah, she needs a reason - my ass! Sorry, but she let herself be blinded by Lockhart (not saying a crush can't do that, but eventually even that should fade with his shoddy "teaching" and his crappy books and his vanity etc.) and she defends Snape by insisting Harry call him "Professor Snape" (a title which he IMHO hasn't earned, his teaching is subpar and he isn't even a rolemodel outside the classroom!)

****** The only time I can remember her actually trying to enforce curfew is when Harry and Ron try to sneak out for their duel with Malfoy. First years who don't know the castle well sneaking out to a duel that's most likely a trap is just a stupid idea in the first place. Hermione also shows that she's concerned with the consequences of rule breaking (losing house points and social standing, being expelled), not really with the rules themselves.

Also, you not seeing any point in a curfew doesn't mean that it's a pointless rule. In Harry Potter, it mostly exists for plot reasons, but aside from that there are reasons for many boarding schools having curfews and needlessly inconveniencing students isn't one of them. In Hogwarts, they're only not allowed to leave their house, but nothing's stopping them from staying up in the common room, so I don't see why reading a book or writing an essay would be a reason to break it.

It's great for you that you started questioning authority at an early age, but I'm not sure why Hermione not questioning and doubting everyone from the beginning means that she's a blind follower of books and authority throughout the whole story. She grows up, just as Ron and Harry do. In the second book, she's still pretty naïve and easily blinded, by the fifth or so book, she's lost a lot of that naivety.

No matter what they think of Snape, he's still in a position of authority over Harry, Ron and Hermione. Not calling him "Professor" is a great way to get unnecessary point reductions and detentions that can't be disputed easily. To me, reminding Harry and Ron to call him "Professor" always seemed an almost automatic response, similarly to reprimanding them if they used swear words, not a reflection of some deep seated belief that he's a great person.

I think you are confusing canon Hermione with fanon Hermione in some bash fics.

On the other hand, you should like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942), featuring a very dark and edgy Harry. Hermione gradual descent into darkness is IMO quite well written. Body count in this fic is extremely high.

You may have already read it, because it's often recommended here. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005), has quite a bit of revenge bash in early chapters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545), has a time-traveling Harry killing them ALL.
