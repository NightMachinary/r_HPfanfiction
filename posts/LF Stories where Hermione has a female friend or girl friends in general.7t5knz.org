Not opposed to an all-female golden trio, but prefer stories where Hermione is best friends with someone else, be that Luna, Ginny, or a female OC. I'd like something well-written, I'm not too picky otherwise.

Edit: I don't mind if Hermione and the girl end up dating later on in the story, but I'd like it to focus more on their friendship at first.


** Hermione had a great friendship with Luna in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877).

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

*** I'd really prefer the fic to focus on female friendship. If it becomes romance later that's fine as long as there's a strong, realistic foundation built first. Not really a fan of H/Hr in general but if it's well-written and there's no Ron bashing I'll give it a shot.

#+begin_quote
  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Iris Potter doesn't do normal, and her fourth year at Hogwarts is evidence enough. Five unique tasks. Eventual Animagus, morally ambiguous, and reasonably powerful fem!Harry. No bashing.

** In linkffn(Darkness Ascendant) Hermione will be pulled into a more girly friendship with OFC because Sophie will, while caring about schooling, in the summer she wants to have fun too.

Edit: oh, also Licorice will befriend Hermione. She's a year behind but meets harry before he begins school but doesn't inow he's harry potter until just before she begins school.

I think there's a bit in the story where Hermione and Sophie take part in a first year tea party with stuffed animals but I can't remember if that was just a drabble for the notes as I brainstormed the story or in the linkffn(an anthology on broken pottery) version which means it'll potentially end up in the standalone version but Sophie didn't exist in that early version.
