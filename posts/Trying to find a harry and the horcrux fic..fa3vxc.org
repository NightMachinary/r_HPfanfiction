I can't remember the premise exactly, but I know Harry's personality changes to be more like Voldemort, or tom is in control, he absorbs the horcrux, something like that. In one scene, he is cutting his breakfast in perfect squares or something, then dumbledoor recommends trying a different shape. In the last chapter I read (it was an incomplete story at the time so I dont know if it's been updated at all yet) dumbledoor calls Harry to his office and doesn't give him the password. Harry asks for entrance, at which point the gargoyle restrains him and brings him to the office to face a much colder Dumbledoor looking at him saying "hello Tom" or something like that. I've been trying to find this fix for ages and I just can't find it. Can anyone help?

*** No, not that one. That's one of the ones I've already attempted. Thank you though.
