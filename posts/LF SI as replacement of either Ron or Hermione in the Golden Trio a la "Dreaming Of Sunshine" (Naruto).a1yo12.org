I've been reading Dreaming of Sunshine, a Naruto fanfic told in first-person where the main character is Shikamaru Nara's sister and basically takes the place of Sakura in Team 7. Wondering if there is a similar fic in the hp universe. :)


** Closest thing I've read is this:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12571519/1/A-Curse-of-Prophecy]]

Where the SI becomes a best friend to the trio and pals around with them but doesn't actually replace one. It's one of the better-written SI's, as these things go, and it's complete.

** Not quite what you asked for but sort of similar

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff][What's Her Name in Hufflepuff]]

The SI becomes friends with Hermione early on, and as a result Hermione doesn't become friends with Ron and Harry. So she doesn't really replace Hermione, but does change the golden trio dynamic.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Self-Insert Gen/Friendship

  I suddenly felt lightheaded as the full realization of my situation overcame me. My mind had somehow been put in the body of Ronald Bilius Weasly, a fictional character in a fictional universe. And that universe just so happened to be the Harry Potter verse. Shit.
