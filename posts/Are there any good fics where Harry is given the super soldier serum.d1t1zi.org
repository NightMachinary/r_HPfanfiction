I thought it would be a cool premise, if Harry was given the super soldier serum that is supposed to make you the peak form your genes can give you; I wonder what it would do to a wizard. Along with peak health would it improve his magic? If it improved magic would it improve power or control? Would he become more powerful but have to relearn control? Or would it give him amazing versatility with how he used magic? For example could he cast incendio and instead of a fireball, could he have a stream of fire?

A cool story could be that Harry never went to Hogwarts and instead either ran away or got abandoned in America (I know it's a trope but I'm sure someone with a better imagination could come up with something better :P) and joins the army, who are looking for a candidate for another super soldier. Maybe they found a single batch of the serum stored away by Erskine or Tony finds some his dad kept etc. Harry's magic could be repressed or is all being used to keep him alive or something.

So, Harry is given the serum and becomes a super soldier, eventually Steve will be found and maybe he could mentor Harry. Harry could have been forced into a coma after taking the serum because his magic overloaded or something so he wakes up in a unfamiliar body and luckily Steve is there to help him through it. Would love to see something like this made.


** This would be so cool to read :)
