Any good fics where they are at least decent human beings? I mean, I've seen all kinds of redemption fics but decently written Dursleys are rare. And judging by one Dudley centric fic where he grew into decent bloke that worked with ethic that "blood is thicker" and whatever freak Harry is he's family, Dursley fics can be amazing.


** No Petunia in this one, but Vernon's not so bad. He's trying to do right by Harry, anyway. It's called "Proud" linkffn(11456392).

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home. AU. COMPLETE with epilogue!

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  This is a story of the life of Harry Potter. From his disappearance with his friendly relatives to Dumbledore chasing after him around the world, while Voldemort and muggle secret services loom in the background. Technology, Prophecies... one word: power.

** Vernon's bad here, but Petunia is good., Just about every character has issues (or a subscription), and the OCs and takes on canon characters is a treat.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
