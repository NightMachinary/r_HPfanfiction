"What do you /mean/ 'just a basilisk', it's a massive fuck-you snake!"

Bonus points for our crotchety old Divination teacher being, actually, pretty accurate, because on average there's at least one kid in her class about to do something death-defying.


** Cedric Diggory is Hufflepuff's golden boy detective. Every year, he's been responsible for something tangential to the plot but influential in some utterly contrived way. He was the one who discovered the Defense professor before Quirrell was porking a seventh year in a Broom closet. Then, during the whole Chamber of Secrets Debacle, he discovered a ritual to make ghosts chatty and used that in his completely unrelated quest to get the Weasley twins to stop bullying Hufflepuffs.

Viktor Krum has to deal with constant Durmstrang assassination attempts. Why? Because Quidditch is shame upon a good pureblood family. Every year he's had to deal with increasingly convoluted plots. His first years were cursed Quidditch supplies, but now that he's an adult it's cursed paperwork and fan letters.

Fleur Delacour is an adventurer in vaguely-imperialistic adventures that take her to far-off exotic places such as Egypt, the MIddle East, and America, where she has to deal with horrific magical creatures like Sphinxes, Manticores, and Americans.

** Now that just puts a whole new twist on why the entire school is jealous and calling him a cheat. Its not because he's Harry Potter and special, its because they didn't think about tricking the goblet the way they think he did.

*** Nah, it's because he was the /only/ one who was chosen for a mysterious fourth school. They were expecting /at least/ fifteen champions, and for one or two of the fake schools to turn out to be real remnants of civilizations lost to ancient time-traveling experiments only now returning to the present.
