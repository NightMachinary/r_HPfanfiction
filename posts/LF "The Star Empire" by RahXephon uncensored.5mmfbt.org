I loved this story when I read it, and was super sad when it was taken down. Although it has been reposted, I find myself pining for the uncensored version (Wink wink). That being said, if anyone has it stashed somewhere, I would greatly appreciate if it was sent to me. :)


** I'm pretty sure I got a .txt copy. Shoot me a PM mentioning the fic title and author with your email for a copy.

I've never read it, but a quick skim found this:

[[/s][Hover mouse over to see excerpt]]

*Expanded Summary*: Personal tragedies after Voldemort's defeat has warped Harry Potter's personality. With the Wizarding World brought to the brink of annihilation, a reviled Harry Potter was imprisoned and exiled into space. Many centuries later out near Jupiter's orbit, he wakes up to a solar system devoid of magic, but infested with crime, piracy and corruption. He adjusts to this violent era like a fish to water, using his magic to build up a hidden powerbase and an army of followers. However, no matter how discrete the last wizard is in using his powers, other powerful factions eventually gain knowledge of his talents. Just because there are no more wizards doesn't mean you're invincible. And stirring behind all of mankind's extensive endeavors in its own solar system is a presence that is more profound than anything humanity has ever faced before. Dark!Harry, far future AU, many OCs, technology, no pairing, no slash, no yuri.

** I so wish this story was still going! It's one of my favorites. I just love the blend of tech and magic.

If I recall correctly he basically gave up cause idiots kept reporting him and his work kept getting pulled. I wish people like that would just fuck off and go read something else instead of whining to FF.net like babies.

Maybe we could convince him to move it over to AO3 and resurrect it.
