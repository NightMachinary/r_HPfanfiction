with sidepair i mean that Harry is with an other Partner as the Mainpair, but he gets closer or attracted to Narcissa in the progress of the Fic. Maybe her persona would change to a kinder one, optional: only in harrys presence or only for harry.

Alternatively use of sidepair: well, they hang around and deal with each other, but arent really a "Pair". They might become friends or known comrads, but there isnt something as Love between them. However, they might find the other one attractive. So nightly activities just for fun, rather than love is ok and welcomed.

I would accept affair fics aswell, whether harry has an affair or narcissa or both. Maybe Lucius is aware of it, but tolerates or is fine with it, for whatever reason.

The fic can be canon compliant, after the war or AU.


** Shockingly enough, I actually know a fic that meets your criteria.

House of Healing Souls has Harry in a relationship with Narcissa, though the author has said that it will eventually be a Haphne.
