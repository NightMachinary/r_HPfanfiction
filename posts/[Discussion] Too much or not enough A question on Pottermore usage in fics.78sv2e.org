I considered lobbing this question on the regular HP forum, but I enjoy this community's ability to break down these kind of topics. Simply put I've been getting familiar with Rowling's writings on the wizarding world and its schools on Pottermore; Ilvermorny being the key example.

Now, I'm not averse to using what she has provided and honestly I do enjoy what she has written, and as such plan to include at the very least snippets about Ilvermorny, MACUSA etc. in my fic I'm writing where appropriate. Do you guys point blank refuse? Do you prefer to create your own schools and such?


** In my own writing, I'll certainly use Pottermore as a resource, but I reserve the right to reject what I don't feel fits my writing. In my own stories, I've created the school Harry teaches at and I pretty much ignore the MACUSA and Ilvermorny, mostly because I started writing before either of these were a thing and it would be way too much trouble to try and integrate them now.

I feel more bound by original canon than Pottermore, but even then I'll make changes. For example, I have Ginny's Patronus as a hummingbird rather than a horse because I'd pretty much forgot what it was! I'd say use it as a guide and inspiration, but don't feel bound to it or let it limit your creativity. It's your story--do what you want!

** I typically avoid using any Pottermore. A lot of it really comes off as fanservice, or even just bad fanfiction itself. So when you try and come up with a new wand for ever single character featured in the story and go to great lengths to match up personalities or whatever, it really just comes off as too gimmicky. Plus, I've already seen stories completely derail themselves trying to incorporate Pottermore stuff into their otherwise normal story, and that's not what I wish for my own fics.

*** I think some of the stuff on Pottermore relating to some characters is useful. The entry on McGonagall is pretty interesting. She's half-blood and was married at one point and that's information that can be incorporated to enhance a story. I've also used the Pottermore Patronus info. But yeah, some of it can be distracting.

*** Meh, when I come up with an OC and I have the time I certainly think about their wands, helps me a bit in creating a character for them. I don't necessarily mention it though, and definitely don't explain it everytime.

** Yes but indirectly. I reference wikis which reference Pottermore. I assume most readers won't be able to tell the difference if you use it or not.

As long as no one blatantly ignores canon I'm cool.

** Too much. It encourages creative laziness and some fics are just elaborate and way too verbose novelizations of Pottermore facts with very few original ideas implanted into them.

** I've never used Pottermore though I do use the wiki if I need background material. I may or may not be too old to write fanfiction but I'm pretty sure I am too old for Pottermore. But frankly I wish it didn't exist at all.

I started writing fanfiction because I thought Rowling had finished with Harry Potter and moved on. And lo and behold she hasn't. She keeps adding bits here and there and I'm sure plenty of it contradicts my own immovable headcanon. But by now I'd rather not know anymore.

** Probably one of the few people on this sub reddit that really enjoys the majority of Pottermore. During the writing of the books, JK said many times that she had really created a lot more story, etc. for the characters than would ever make it into the book. In my opinion, she's had a lot of this planned out since the beginning. Obviously, there are plotholes, and sometimes the stories are '?' inducing, but I don't mind all the added canon info.

I don't have a preference when it comes to stories using canon or not in general, or whether they use the Pottermore canon either.

I /do/ tend to dislike anything that has to do with the USA. I'm not a fan of stories that go abroad or use OCs in general and 99% of HP (not Fantastic Beast FF, which I don't read) that uses American characters who go to Ilvermorny are just OCs and I can't stand it. I don't mind the occasional stranger from Beauxbatons or Durmstrang because they have some connection to the HP canon. No one from America would. So this is really just a FF preference than a Pottermore one, anyway.

The basic facts from Pottermore, I love. Like McGonnagal-centred fics, which elude to her background story. I think it's a great tool for FF writers to use if they so wish, and I don't particularly mind either way.

That's my two cents anyway!

** I pick and choose stuff from Pottermore, in the same way that I pick and choose from other HP-related resources. I plan to include Bem, for example, as I want to make Hogwarts slightly bigger in my AU.

(Bem is the black guy who first appears in PoA with all the best lines in the film, then is clearly recognised for his intelligence because he is moved from Gryffindor to Ravenclaw in a later film.)

** I /wish/ Rowling didn't publish some of this information, but unlike certain people here I'm not the type to ignore canon just because I don't like it all that much. I'll do my best to be Pottermore-consistent in my fics, though only a few Pottermore ideas strike me as worthy /premises/. All this being said, if the story's good, I won't refuse to read a Pottermore-ignoring (or even Cursed-Child-ignoring or Epilogue-ignoring) fic.
