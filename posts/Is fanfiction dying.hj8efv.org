Is it just me or are updates and new fictions are becoming few and far. Or are people not posting due to blm?


** It speaks to how massive Harry Potter fic was at its peak that this question is asked when 250 fics have been posted/updated in the HP category on FF.N in the last 24 hours. Most fandoms don't get that in a year.

*** That's true. Even a shitty story and average writing garnered 100+ Reviews .

**** Oh yes some of my earliest stories have several hundred reviews. As my writing got more mature and intelligent, reviews really went down.

** I think that is partially a somewhat subjective experience - I mean I doubt you're following /all/ WIPs currently active in HP? - and partially a symptom of our times. There's a lot going on in the world currently, and for a very extended period of time by this point. At the beginning current events would've turned some people off writing while having others turn to it more, which ultimately evened out, but I can see that after months of various, ongoing stressors more and more people grow exhausted and have less energy to write.

And, of course, as somebody else pointed out, also a general trend. Personally I don't think HP fandom in general will die out proper for a very, very long time; I think there will be a general level of activity for decades to come. That level will just be less than it was when the books were still being published, or the films were still coming out, and perhaps even less than now. (Though of course who knows what's to come; I can definitely see HP turning into a MCU or Star Trek or Star Wars type situation, with new material being provided continuously, which of course will always lure in more activity.)

** Well, yes and no

The HP community was one of the first to really come together on the internet and grew to pretty much be the biggest, no contest. But it has been many years since the books came out, a lot of other media has come since, capturing the eye of aspiring fic writers.

For a lot of us, this meant staying with fanfiction but moving on to projects like Game of Thrones or the Marvel universe to use them as stepping stones for our own ideas, just as we did with Rowling's work.

For others, it meant moving on to other creative spheres. I pray that the creators we've known from the HP fanfic communities keep creating, but for most people it's time to move on in one form or another.

I'm personally on the lookout for more fanfics related to video games. Some of them are absolute /gold/ for crossovers!

Yes there will be less HP fanfics, but that's completely natural. No, I don't believe there will be less fanfiction in general in the future (not that you said that, I'm the one saying it)

Most importantly I think there will come a time for us to look back at the many stories we've told on these fora and begin to see them as inspiration and stepping stones for future creations. That feeling you have is a symptom of this time drawing closer

*** You are absolutely right. Hp fanfiction has been a getaway from work and life in general, my little slice of heaven. People are moving on from it, it's natural and that makes me a little sad. Here's hoping the next fantastic beasts movie will breath fresh air into the Fandom (though I think the whole thing is a bit convoluted, my opinion)

I think it really did. Hell, even Cursed Child got people so up in arms that it has probably seen more re-writes by rabid fans than the people working on it.

People might be slowly moving on, but the love for what we have is still strong and whenever some of those old fics update or Rowling gets on her twitter, we can't help but jump up and participate in the discussion.

** I started my first HP fanfic in 2020. I agree the fandom is slowing down, but I think it is in large part because many of the common tropes have been done so well that it is hard to think up new plotlines.

**** I have a lot of short little 'teaser' ideas, but struggle to develop them into unique and interesting storylines. Like, i have a half dozen 1-2 page "setups" but don't know how to advance them.

Kudos to you and your creativity!!

***** Oh no that definitely happens. I tend to write out about 5-6k words and if I see that it's going somewhere I'll write a vague outline, concretising it as the story develops. I usually loose motivation to edit past the 60k mark and forget to upload chapters once I've kind of moved on to the next story. So that's definitely bad. But I guess outlines are your friend !

** At this point, even if no one ever wrote another HP fanfic - and they do, all the time - there would already be enough of them that you could spend your life reading them and not finish them all. So, I wouldn't worry too much.

But I'm not noticing things being too quiet, anyway. Of the HP stories on my follow list, one updated today and 11 others updated in June.
