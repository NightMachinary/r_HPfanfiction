** Because the information about it being blocked by occlumency and stuff was just JK Rowling covering her ass in post interviews? As far as canon books alone are concerned, I'm sure there was never any implication that it could even be resisted. And nobody was ever shown to either. In OOTP Dumbledore tells Harry that Snape gave Umbridge FAKE Veritaserum to stop Harry from spilling the truth about everything. Which further implies that canon books say you just flat out CAN'T resist it; you have to just not take it at all to stay safe!

That's why I always write it like that, because I don't really care about all the post interview retcons and stuff. I just do the books and sometimes the movies.

Just like the canon books say regular Time Turners CAN change the past, it's not just timeloops and deterministic stuff.

Does Canon say this? We are shown that it is a closed loop in POA. I've always seen it as a closed loop at least. Harry saved himself so Harry had to go back to save himself and always did.

PoA implies that closed loops are /legal/ loophole for using time-turners as that's the only way Hermione was time-traveling. Hermione's warning is not needed if they could only operate under a closed-loop.

*** Alternatively, it was never used in court in canon either - even in the trials that we saw.It also explains why Voldemort didn't use it on his followers.The 2006 interview is a confirmation of these facts in my mind, rather than a rewrite of canon (it also explains why it worked on Crouch Jr, and why it wouldn't have helped Sirius' case at all)

This fact *was* implied by the events of canon, and outright confirmed by the author before she actually finished writing the books - thus it was canon for at least the 7th book in the series.

Also, what you said, at most, proves that Harry specifically can't resist Veritaserum, which is perfectly in line with the fact that he can't use Occulemancy.

This isn't really an ass-covering, it's a clarification at worst.

I don't mean to be rude, but it sounds like you really didn't put a lot of thought/research into this.

I do not think that this is the case though - what she provided was a clarification that stands in line with the events as described in the book rather than a retcon of existing events. Besides, the interview was given before the 7th book was written, meaning that it is canon as of the 7th book at the very latest.

***** It was implied in the books though - It wasn't used during any trial, and dumbledore stated that slughorn would be able to resist the potion long enough to take an antidote. Unless they believe that not using Veritaserum in canon is a plot hole, I don't see this argument holding much water.

It was also never confirmed to be irresistable in canon, either - making it a headcanon at most. Maybe even worse than that, seeing as there wasn't ever even such an implication, making the nature of Veritersium as irresisteble even more absurd.

I still believe that it is incredibly silly to refuse to infer anything from canon material unless it is specifically stated, and to ignore sometbing that we know to be canon as of book 7 at the latest, but I will accept your answer.

** I mean, firstly occlumency is apparently rare as heck and so comes off as kind of 'we don't bother with this useful thing because it doesn't work for one in a million people'. It's a fair limitation, but not one that can really be overly influential without coming off a bit silly.

The unreliability aspect is far more interesting to me, and doesn't mean that it can't still be irresistible. Think about it. It makes you uncontrollably, unavoidably, unresistingly tell the truth... as you see it. Plenty of people believe things that aren't true, or use faulty reasoning to reach true conclusions. You can also deceive while telling the truth pretty easily.

Example for the first thing: Death Eater gets interrogated and asked if he's done anything wrong or broken any rules. He believes that killing Muggles is right and justified and the only rule he follows is Voldemort's, so he answers that he's done nothing wrong and broken no rule.

Example for the second: Someone asks me what my name is. I tell them they can call me Harry Potter. My name isn't Harry Potter, but they can call me that quite easily if they want to, so I'm not lying in the slightest. What I said is completely and utterly true.

Hell, that could also come in for the first guy in a 'tell us everything' sort of a way. Questioning is really hard, to the point that people have to be specifically trained on how to do it reliably. You'd have to get incredibly specific on what laws and whose laws the Death Eater might've broken. Have you broken any of the Ministry's laws? Which ministry? Being a Death Eater probably isn't illegal in Magical Tibet. Hell, if they asked if he followed Voldemort and the Death Eater knew the Dark Lord's real name was Tom Riddle, he could easily say no and be completely honest - the guy he follows is called Tom Riddle, after all.

So, yeah. Unfailingly telling the truth isn't that much of a limitation, if you get creative with it.

*** Occlumency isn't *that* rare.\\
Draco Malfoy could do it, and he isn't at all some sort of a magical prodigy - at most, I think that you could argue that the training is esoteric, but even so, there are 10 confirmed users in canon, so it can't be that.

Besides, if there's a group of people who can reliably use it then it is untrustworthy as a method of interrogation.

Also, regarding what you said about working around the truth - it isn't really here or there.\\
Sure, the truth is subjective etc, and that's a limitation, but that's only one limitation, and not really the one being discussed.\\
For example, Wonder Woman's Lasso of Truth is confirmed to be irresistible, so the only way to work around it is to either be a reality warper or to do what you said.

Not so much with Veritaserum, in my mind.

**** My comment was more a discussion point than a direct answer, I admit - you have a fair point there. My apologies.

Ten out of seven or eight hundred characters in the book series alone plus however many are in the Fantastic Beasts movies. So not that large of a group. And I did say it was a fair limitation, just a slightly silly-sounding one to many minds.

There aren't really many absolute things to argue in Harry Potter. There's not a lot of Word of God on a lot of mechanical or systemic things about how stuff actually works, and Rowling doesn't often stick to the rules she sets (writing in favour of absolute adherence to her plots) anyway, so I'm sure someone could find exceptions to everything she says about her magic 'system' in the books. Thus canon fact arguments tend to be pretty much people arguing over their perceptions of canon, each with something to support their perception, but neither with the necessary authorial authority to state something is absolute and true.

For example, we do know that everyone in the series who talks about Occlumency says it's an obscure and rare magic and quite difficult. We also know that Draco Malfoy can somehow do it. Some people could point to his general incompetency and wonder how he managed that, others could point to him summoning a Snake in his second year and say he's pretty good at magic. I tend to favour the 'Malfoy being an idiot' conclusion (with the Snake as one of the aforementioned 'exceptions to the rule') and since everyone else who can use Occlumency seems at least semi-competent, I personally prefer the rule to the exception - though YMMV and I wouldn't disagree with your choice.

Equally, I'm sure there's support to Veritaserum being subject to truth-bending and not being subject to truth-bending and you can go with whatever best pleases you and makes sense to you. I'm not someone who cares about things being overly canon compliant, so I don't know enough about canon to find that support myself, but if the fandom arguments I've seen in my ten months here have been any indication it almost definitely exists.

And well, that's partly why that pattern of veritaserum being unresistable and perfect exists. Someone with a certain mindset and life experience read the books or fanfics, came to their conclusion that got them to think of Veritaserum as flawless truth serum, liked it and kept it, then wrote it into a story. Same way anyone comes to any conclusion. Our lives create our logic, which we filter experiences and inputs through to come to conclusions on things. Admittedly that logic doesn't necessarily have to be logical, nor the conclusions accurate and understandable to others, but that's the basic idea.

In your mind truth bending doesn't work, in mine it does, in the minds of the people writing those stories Veritaserum works as an unfailing truth serum, in yours it doesn't.

Either that or they just needed it to work that way for their story to work and since this is fanfiction, they changed it so it did. Not everyone thinks fanfiction should follow things stated in canon. Or perhaps they wrote the story before the post-book interview confirmations occurred and just saw it as another 'why the fuck did they chain up a confirmed animagus instead of stunning him' type plothole and felt they were 'fixing' things. There's probably no main reason, just a set of them that made sense to the people writing those stories.

TL:DR - Either they didn't know Veritaserum has limits, they needed it to not have limits for their story, read the books and interpreted veritaserum that way, or they thought that those limits didn't matter or didn't make sense and changed them.

***** There are 10 *confirmed* users out of far less than 800-900 people like you said, there are probably more that simply were not shown as such.

Besides, if the difference between success and failure of your method is the skill of the user, the kind of skill that anyone can get, it sucks. Plain and simple.

If you have something that supports the absolute power of Veritaserum then bring it up, by all means.\\
Until then, the facts of the matter are otherwise.

There is no evidence to support the power of Veritaserum as being absolute, and plenty to state otherwise - including a statement from the author that is at least canon-compliant as of book 7 (since it was given prior to it)

What you are saying is that Veritaserum being irresistible is headcanon, which is my very argument - I view writers who employ it as such as lazy and unimaginative.\\
Changing a facet of canon for the sole purpose of "skipping" over difficult problems and bringing an absolute solution to the table is just plain bad writing, full stop.\\
I further believe that such things are indicative of overall poor writing, rather than this being a detached issue.

Truth bending is a confirmed weakness of Veritaserum and is irrelevant to the discussion at hand.

Why? If the skill is esoteric, and a significant portion of the people we know had the skill also had others to teach them, what makes you think that anyone could achieve it? For all we know, Occlumency always requires another person to teach it properly. What makes you think that there are more Occlumens, or that anyone can get the Occlumency skill?

#+begin_quote
  the facts of the matter are otherwise
#+end_quote

The facts of the matter /as you see them/. That was the whole point of this answer (after the initial comment, anyway) - to tell you why other people might see things otherwise. Whether you agree with their logic or not is irrelevant, since the question was why would they see things otherwise, not why you should.

All that 'bad/lazy writing' stuff is also simply your view on things. You might be right, you might be wrong, but the people who think different things don't share that view. They might in fact view your adherence to canon as unimaginative - since you're just copying someone else's idea completely - and feel perfectly justified by whatever logic they have behind that in doing so. Again, whether you believe they're justified in doing what they do is irrelevant, since the question you asked was why they do what they do, not why you should do the same.

People do things for reasons they feel justify those things, but those reasons only have to make sense to the person doing the thing, not anyone else. You do what makes sense to you, they do what makes sense to them.

And since this is a work of fiction written by someone specific who isn't any of us, all of our answers are just our own interpretations of the facts we have, unless they're explicitly stated to be a certain way by Word of God and matched by canon. Everything we read is interpreted by us through filters of our past experiences and viewpoints and then we come to conclusions based on the results, that's just how human beings think. There's a reason we objectively measure stuff in science experiments and don't just eyeball it. What one person sees as important, another person might not, what one person sees as true, another person won't, and so on. But even then, some people will still take things in other directions for the reasons I've previously stated. Hell, there's probably some people who still won't care either, since being canon compliant isn't as important to them as the story they want to tell.

Equally, I have no need to bring up any evidence that they're right, because that's also irrelevant to the point I'm making. I'm not saying either side is right, only trying to answer your question as to why the other side exists.

******* Why do you mean why? We know of at least 10 people, and there is no reason to assume that they are the only ones. After all, the vast majority of wizards in the series have not shown us the full scope of their magic simply because there was no need for it to be brought up. Keep in mind that the Patronus charm is a highly advanced spell, but there are plenty of users in canon, simply because it was needed so often. Besides, this does not take away from my point as a whole - it's the very same reason that polygraphs are unreliable.

The facts of the matter are as I stated them - the interpretations may be different. Authors can choose to stick to canon as they please, but the idea itself is a universal headcanon of many authors, as can be seen in this very thread and the animosity of it all. At the most, you can claim that this is a trope - In which case I will claim that it's a lazy trope, meant to take away from conflict and bring in an easy solution, and aside from that serves no other purpose. That's what I was talking about, really.

******** Why is there no reason to assume that they are the only ones? After all, it's literally stated explicitly that occlumency is a obscure, rare, and difficult skill and most of the people we know who have it have someone close who could've taught them. Same with the Patronus - it's literally stated directly that most Wizards can't do it. Hell, the Weasley's sell shield hats because most Wizards can't cast one. So, what reasoning is there to ascribe the talent to more people than the apparent intellectual 'creme de la creme' of wizarding society like Dumbledore or the highly motivated people with access to a trainer like Draco?

If you're ignoring that in favour of your interpretation, are you not doing precisely what you're accusing these people of who write that Veritaserum is unbeatable?

And okay, good to know. If that's what you're talking about with this post, it might be advisable to change your original post summary. It comes off far more like you're wondering why other people think what they do than just wanting to state your opinion for others to discuss.

********* Because the vast majority of wizards have not shown their magical potential? I mean, Bellatrix was mentioned in passing to be capable of doing it, but never /shown/, as was Slughorn - Who's to say that there aren't more? Do you know what each character in canon is fully capable of? You don't, because a lot of their skills were simply irrelevant to the story at the time of their appearance.

The patronus charm is /rare/ and /difficult/ spell but we know of many who can do it despite that, why is that? It's because of how common dementors are in the story, making it a necessity, as well as dumbledore's messaging system.

Another example would be Animagi - there are 7 registered animagi in the UK, of which we only know one, and at least 4 more who aren't. Seeing as how we know of 11 animagi, there are probably more who simply were not shown.

Besides, you are entirely missing the point - if it is a /skill/ that can be /learned/ then it is no good as evidence. For example, in real life, a person can be trained to lie to a polygraph, thus making polygraphs worthless in court. It's the same principle.

** As far as I know, an antidote exists for it, but I don't think the stories mention that it can be blocked with occlumency. But that's only revealed in HBP. Everything up untill that point never gave us the impression that it could be blocked. Crouch Jr. was accused of being a lunatic instead of having an antidote or occlumency shields. No mention of any method to block it before HBP.

That being said, even if it was never mentioned in the book, if I was writing a story, I wouldn't write it as unbeatable or easy to come by, for several reasons. First of all, like you said, it facilitates for lazy writing. But more importantly, it highlights several plotholes in canon, just like a lot of the tacked-in ideas of Rowling do. Plotholes which make the ministry and/or dumbledore seem highly incompetent.

So here are my ideas on how to make veritasium and it's use mesh better with canon plotholes. Some thoughts I have, if I plan to use veritaserum in my story.

1. We know veritaserum is regulated, snape mentioned it. So it's definitely not something your MC should just be able to buy.
2. Make it insanely expensive, on the order of several months of salary for the average wizard.
3. Maybe it's insanely difficult to brew. Snape mentioned that it took several months to brew.
4. Make it have some adverse effect on the one consuming it. maybe incapacitation for a month. Liver damage. whatever. We know the pepper up potion makes smoke or steam billow out of your ears, it's not farfetched that veritaserum would have some adverse effects. It's not too hard to assume that you wouldn't make something like this mandatory for trials.
5. We know memories can be faked, ol' Sluggy did that.
6. You could obliviate some part of your memories, so you'll tell a skewed story.
7. Veritaserum makes you tell the truth, but you could easily tell the truth, but very slanted. Give out technical truths and withhold some information.

So, TLDR; make veritasium hard to come by, and don't treat a confession under it as conclusive proof. Treat it like how grainy camera footage colaborates with a witness' account. Supplementary evidence.

** In my opinion, the reason veritaserum isn't used in court (in canon) is because of Death Eaters who escaped prison and don't want to be asked embarrassing questions like "did you willingly joined Voldemort?" or just "Were imperiused then?" so some political big shots like Malfoy made it unusable against everyone in court, them included.

I don't know about occlumency being effective against veritaserum, but I remember Crouch Jr being able to resist imperius of his father and yet totally unable to resist veritaserum, so that may count for something.

From what I remember of her interview, Rowling argument about why the potion is not reliable was more "Wizards can use magic to not truly drink the potion (transfiguring it into water, sealing it in the throat . . .) so it's not that reliable.

Anyways, I always found the "Sirius should prove his innocence by requesting to drink Veritaserum" a bit dumb. Even if we admit that the potion can't be resisted, "telling the truth" is not really a proof of innocence in a world where Mind Control and Memory Wiping exist.
