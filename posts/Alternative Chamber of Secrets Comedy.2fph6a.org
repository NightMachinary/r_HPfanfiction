I had an idea, but my inability to A: Write Multi-Chaptered stories and B: Write anything remotely hilarious stops me from writing this myself.

Main Idea: Dark Lord Gilderoy.

Plot: In Flourish and Blotts, Gilderoy Lockhart somehow gets his hands on Tom Riddle's Diary - but Riddle soon learns that although getting into Lockhart's mind is easy, actually doing anything with it is going to take a lot more work.

Scene Idea: Riddle takes Lockhart to Myrtle's Bathroom to open the Chamber of Secrets, but Lockhart keeps getting distracted by his reflection.
