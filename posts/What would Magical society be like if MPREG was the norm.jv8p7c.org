We all seen stories that include MPREG trope (male pregnancy, without need for women in conception and rearing of the child). There are literally tens of thousands of such stories. Reasons vary. Some are just fluff and wanting to give gay couples chance to have kids magically. Others are more nuanced and sometimes delve into deeper gender identity issues.

I personally dislike this trope and ignore such stories, but it has got me thinking what would magical society be like, if MPREG was THE norm? What if Wizarding world was like [[https://orville.fandom.com/wiki/Moclan][Moclan]] society from The Orville?

From Harry's POV:

- when visiting Diagon Alley the first time, he notices that there are no girls or women anywhere.
- he notices there are no girls at Hogwarts. At all!
- he quickly finds out that Wizarding World is /extremely/ misogynistic.
- he is confused when people mention James Potter as his father, whereas he's always thought that Leo, Petunia's brother was his dad.
- learns that Ron has two dads. /Strange/, he thinks at first, but later learns that so does he, Draco Malfoy, Neville and pretty much everyone else.
- Seamus, who has magical Father, but a Muggle mother, is constantly bullied and teased for being a /vagina baby/.
- he learns that babies in the magical world are conceived by two males and raised in magical cocoons, children born are /always/ male.
- he learns that on rare occasion a Muggleborn girl is born, The Ministry detects that and uses magic to "fix" the gender when the child is still a baby.
- he is shocked that kids who grew up in magical world - like Ron, Neville, Draco - have never met or even seen a girl or a woman in their life. They think them be some sort of Muggle ... "thing".
- Wizards who date Muggle Women are not only blood traitors, but also outcasts and usually exiled from Wizarding Community when discovered.
- he finds out that his dad Leo, was born a girl named Lily.
- he later learn that his best friend Hermes, was also born a girl named Hermione.
- he finds out that some who are gender changed have gender identity issues later in life.

Sorry in advance - this is nothing against wonderful girls and women - but merely a though exercise and a what-if. What if MPREG trope is taken to extreme and think how that would change / affect Wizarding society.

*Possible story plot based on the premise:* Harry, as he grows older, finds out he is straight. An anathema in the Wizarding world. Meanwhile his friend Hermes, struggles with gender identify, and they both discover that Hermes was born a girl. They both confess their issues to one another, as this is something they feel can't be discussed with any other friends. At first they start using polyjuice potion to experiment. Later on they search for a way to break the Magic that turned Hermione into a boy. When found out, both are declared outcasts, but considering that Hermes is one of the brightest wizards(witch) of their generation, and Harry is the BWL, it sure makes a lot of noise for repressed minorities...
