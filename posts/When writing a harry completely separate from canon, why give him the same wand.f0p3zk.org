I dont know why it bothers me, but the whole thing with a completely different character having the same connection with a wand as cannon had, when the "wand chooses the wizard" doesnt make any sense to me. I've only read one fic that explains instead of just disregarding the whole thing, and that explained that the wand wasnt actually suited to him, but to the soul fragment in his scar.


** There's a trope that the wand didn't really pick Harry, it picked the horcrux.

Remove horcrux early enough, completely different wand at 11.

You don't even need helpful goblins or deus ex machina either. Have the Dursleys go on winter vacation and leave Harry behind with the heat off. Harry's heartrate slows enough to where the horcrux thinks he's dead and exorcises itself, setting off Ministry sensors. They show up, omgwtfbbw.jpg! Is that Harry flipping Potter!!!1one? Then either Sirius investigation, he goes with Madam Bones for a Susan pairing, Andromeda for maybe Honks, etc.

*** Sounds like a recipe for disaster. I have read alot of stuff that goes along those lines. The story usually has alot of issues as the plot progresses, most of the time it's due to either an over accelerated romantic sub plot taking over; or lack of general conflict.

** Playing devil's advocate - the wand may not have chosen him for "it's harry", but "it's destiny". There's too many coincidences between the wands to be pure chance, after all. Same phoenix' feathers (from fawkes, dumbledore's familiar, a man who is hated and respected by the relevant other wizard), a wood that perfectly describes said wizard, the brother-wand connection, foreshadowing their destiny-connection, etc etc.

However, I do like it more when nuHarry is chosen by a more fitting wand. Say, a Harry who is raised by a member of the RAF getting a more rigid, light and non-frivulously carved wand, which fits the new personality more than ol' Holly, or a gentle, hufflepuff Harry being chosen by a unicorn-hair wand. I also like it when the wand's quirks are described with relevance to the personality of their wizard, for example I once read a fic in which Neville gets a wand that holds two damaged unicorn hairs woven together into a strand that's stronger than a single, healthy one would have been. Wandlore is heavily influenced by symbolism, after all.

I think the worst offender though is when a DaRk!hArRy gets the holly wand, which is pretty much described as a wand that needs a good person to wield. Also, wand components that just sound cool, like basilisk parts, or human blood or something like that. If you really want to do exotic wand materials, you need to give some thought to what they mean, and what sort of person is required to wield them.

Not really. It's described as a wand suited for protective spells as mythology says the tree repels evil, so she made him really good at protective spells. It's also suited for angry people on dangerous, spiritual quests. Ignoring the character who had this wand wood, I don't see why it wouldn't work for a dark, angry wizard/witch on a damgerous quest.

** I have a headcanon that Voldemort himself cannot be matched well with any wand other than his own or its brother. This perhaps carries over to Harry through the Horcrux, which is why Draco's wand, while loyal to its new master, does not feel the same.

** I usually keep the feather to keep the connection to Voldy, but use different wood to suit the needs.

The wand just spontaneously combust and they have to use new wood.

** If he's still the Boy Who Lived why not? Holly also fits with his birthday.

I didn't know so many authors kept that small piece of canon in their fics. There was a time when all that was needed for Harry to get a new wand was Sirius' death.

** I never had a problem with it. I like to think of wands as just tools. In my head, the elder wand is the only wand that has powers beyond any other wands.

So what bothers me is Harry going to Olivanders and the guy brings this legendary wand that may have belonged to Merlin himself.

I wish Harry would go an a really dangerous adventure and end up finding a wand that's powerful instead of it being handed to him the first time he goes into the magical world.

*** If a wand is going to be made abnormally powerful, I'd like to see a reason/process for it personally. Like Harry learning and carving runes into it to let him use certain spells easier, or delving a bit more into wand specializations (eg - if elm is good at charms, why is that? How big an effect does it have? Are there ways to more hyper-specialize it?)

Other magical focuses or techniques with strengths/weaknesses compared to wands would be intriguing, too - staves being an obvious one, but perhaps wizarding royalty might have used scepters, or perhaps focus more on amulets/specialized focuses, like the old egyptian scarab amulets/seals, or rituals, etc. Anything more than just lazily giving him a super wand, really - no matter the background to it!

** Honestly I prefer original wands in those fics it just shows that maybe there is a little bit of cannon Harry in there and serves a touchstone between the two to sort of show that you can change, but you are often still the same person underneath(also destiny and shit). Also people usually handle his new wand with no subtlety and just cram in some Thestral hair obsidian from mount Vesuvius dagger-wand that cuts the wielders palm everytime he uses it and turns their hair an edgy color the more powerful it gets as it feeds off of his life force, But maybe that is just me

** The wand is a perfect opportunity in a fic to either reinforce who Harry is - or to distance him from the Canon version. As long as it's important to the story, change the wand all you like. But if it's never going to be important again, the Holly wand is fine.

I had a story once where the Phoenix feather wand in Harry's wand incinerated when Harry died during the attack at godrics hollow. Later, after he is resurrected, ollivander rebuilds the wand for harry's partner. There, the use of that specific wand reinforced the connection between the two of them, and so using the Holly wand served the story. If it didn't matter, I would't have bothered.

*** Wand lore in canon is one of the iffier parts of it, too - it feels very selective. I can imagine most people deciding to leave it out entirely, minus the real big points if sticking close to the canon storyline.

And you are right, too - it would be right in character for Ollivander to be adding mystical elements to how the wands get chosen. I imagine that there'd be some more 'mass produced' wand manufacturers that he'd look down upon, too.
