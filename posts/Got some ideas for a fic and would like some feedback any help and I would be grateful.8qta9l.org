So I'll start out by saying it's an AU, Harry-Centric, Time-Travel to just before the Grindelward War started, Powerful!harry through training and not OP,Will have some cliches like Ron bashing (Just don't like him). I have an idea for the lord Of house cliche that's different( I think I don't think any fic I've read has it but if I'm wrong please tell me)

- Clans which is families established before the Roman Invasion

- Houses are families established after the Roman invasion.

- The head of a Clan is called Chieftain so for examples ‘Chieftain Potter'

- the head of a house will be called ‘Head Granger'. -Only a house with Noble Status can be a Lord (Chieftain is ranked as above a Lord so Noble Clan will still go by chieftain) -. The Noble Status was only given to the Houses and Clans that were gathered by Merlin and King Arthur as advisors to the magical population(Houses and Clans gathered were most powerful at the time)

- Clans will have Family Animals and magic.

- Chieftains will have to be picked by gaining the approval the family animal that resides on their land and then approved by the family magic.

- Family Magic will play a big part and only Clans will be able to have then and I'll figure out a proper story behind why and how they have the magics.

- Families will haves abilities like Clan Slytherin with Parseltongue, Peverall with MageSight.( These Abilities will only be found in these Bloodlines, though they can't be varied to any other)

My Clan,House Standing: 1 - Ancient and Noble Clan 2 - Ancient Clan/Noble Clan/Ancient and Noble House 3 - Clan/Ancient House/Nobles House 4 - Houses

There will not be any Clan or house that will be overpowered. A house might have politically and magically strength but not be the wealthiest and so on and so forth, I won't arrange were they can do whatever they want. I will make it corrupt as shit.

For the Wizengamot I will make it more then just neutral,dark and Light side that usually is, it will be Dark Extremists, Dark, Neutral, Grey, Light, Light Extremists. Might add more but that's all I can think of atm. - The Setup of The Wizengamot will be all Houses and Clans with Noble status (which will be 30). - All Ancient Clans and Clans will have seats.( plan to make only a couple of clans and ancient clans) - All Department Heads at the ministry - 50 elected seats that last for 5 years - 5 ICW Representives

So let's get onto what I have for the plot so far. So it will be the DOM battle but when Sirius falls through the veil harry follows( easiest way I can think of to explain the time travel, I know it's lazy but I don't give a fuck). He Mets Death describes being a Peverell descendent but doesn't go much into the hallows besides a hint, then tells him he can go to hogwarts but in a different time( which will be before grindelward war ) then BOOM he is in another time, gets inheritance for peveralls ( actually do something that isn't the cliche goblins have everything) then he goes to hogwarts as a sixth year Ravenclaw ( my own house on pottemore main reason) get close to a girl that's considered dark probably Walburga black ( I think it will be jokes if harry gets with her changes everything up remember though AU as duck) changes her views a bit but she still keeps some to the core. Have some troubles with minor dark wizard that's nothing compared to grindelward or Voldemort though, Have a major rivalry with Tom riddle, (Myrtle still dies) major school dueling tournament in 7th year then graduate, go to Wizengamot sessions, train with specialist in diffents types of magic (animagus, Defense, charms ) for mastery, join grindelward war( Dumbledore will still duel and win against him) but harry will play a major part in it as well. Then become the master death in a way that I'll figure out, the come up to the Voldemort era that will play a big part.

That's the basic plot of the story , I won't start writing till I have the basic plot figured out and ready to go into it but would like some feed back on it.

Inspirations come from Stepping Back, Harry Potter and the Return of heritage, haryy potter and the family grimorie and much more but I can't remember their names.


** Why do you /have/ to bash Ron? Really why? :( Writers are supposed to be like unbiased and stuff! Just because you don't /like/ a character doesn't mean you should be totally immature and irritating by starting to /bash them!/ Just don't do that. Just leave it out. It will make lots of people enjoy your story for what it is, instead of getting annoyed or exasperated whenever the bashing happens and that ending up overshadowing any other feelings about the story. :( Seriously how hard is it to just /not do that?/ I don't even understand why anyone feels compelled to do that.

**** Because bashing, or also the opposite, favoring a character is something bad to do! :( I see people comment about it all the time in reviews and yes stuff. Even about actual books like game of thrones and lord of the rings. People always go "that character got way more screen time than the main one," and like "they should have been dead but the author just couldn't let them go." So yes it's bad to do in either direction. It overtakes the actual storytelling I think if it goes too extreme.

*** I probably wouldn't have bashed him since he would be on the story for like a paragraph or so but ron is lazy,immature, prejudice and jealous, something that doesn't fit in with the harry I'm writing so yes I will keep him out it. But it won't matter since it might be just a flashback to him ruining the friendship over a act of jealousy in 4th year, and in my story Harry actually gets motivated to train after the death of Cedric and a childish character such as Ron just doesn't fit in, so I wouldn't actually call what I'm doing bashing. It was more of an example of cliche but don't thinking about actually doing it

**** Um...what are you actually referring to? The worst act of prejudice I remember from Ron is that he backs away from Lupin after the latter's revealed as a werewolf.

And the worst he does in 4th year is give Harry the silent treatment for 3 weeks (Really, I checked. Heck, Harry's more obnoxious to Ron during that time than vice-versa).

He's not really lazy and un-academic either, he got the same OWLs Harry did, and he's pretty adept as a Keeper in Quidditch once he gets his nerves under control.

Also, keep in mind he's brave enough to a) go after Voldemort in his first year, b) go after a basilisk in his second year, c) back up Harry in the Ministry in his fifth year, and d) stick with Harry for the entirety of his not-seventh year (excluding one snit triggered by a horcrux's negative influence, and immediately after being removed from said horcrux he starts trying to get back to Harry/Hermione non-stop).

--------------

If I may suggest; don't bash Ron, use him as a mouthpiece instead. The Weasley-Prewitt family might be poor, but they're kind and competent; dragon handlers, curse-breakers, Ministry masterminds, brilliant entrepreneurs, Auror (even if retired), and Quidditch player/sports correspondent. And apparently, they're all quite fecund.

You could use that; have the pureblooded Weasley/Prewitt clan demonstrate what kind of bloodline abilities they have, their family animal and family magic. Let Ron do the explaining about what the Clans are, and what kind of inheritance Harry could potentially have.

** Okay, first, a lot of this sounds like Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw.

Secondly, this sounds a lot like you're more interested in setting up a world and exploring magic with a powerful Harry than plot oriented.

Thirdly, you sound like you may still be in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6pkhj2/the_three_stages_of_fanfiction_evolution_your/][Stage 2]].

*** I don't think I'm in stage 2, my dislike of Ron isn't from the bashing's in fanfic, it's from the books so I will push for Ron and Harry to have a falling out but not write Ron as a death eater or stealing his money or other dumb shit people write him like. Like I don't mind if Ron and Harry are still friends in any docs I read, but i still dislike him. Plus I hate evil manipulative Dumbledore ( I admit that I like ones that show he has flaws and has made mistakes but is still light not some manipulative bastard) aswell I hate the whole molly and Ginny love potion stealing money cliche, I still like them. It only ron a dislike from the canon books so I don't think I'm stuck at stage 2

  Will have some cliches like Ron bashing
#+end_quote

Your story sucks before it is even written.

Now, that was harsh, but hear me out: Bashing is shit writing. Period. It robs a character of its depth and portrays them as 2-dimensional caricatures. No other character besides the protagonist is as important as the characters antagonistic towards the protagonist. Sidekicks, mentors, side-characters - all of them are less important than the antagonists. So if you want to write Ron as having broken the bonds of friendship with Harry */make it interesting/*. Ron must have a reason, feelings, desires and hope to gain from breaking with Harry. So portray him like that.

To end this part of my comment I repeat: Bashing is shit writing.

#+begin_quote
  I think I don't think any fic I've read has it but if I'm wrong please tell me
#+end_quote

Entirely depends on how you're gonna write it, to be honest. Its by no means a revolutionary idea, but it doesn't have to be if its well executed. The family magic thing is one of the oldest tropes I know, and can easily be overdone. Honestly, I truly think your fic would be better off if you scratch that and just focus on politics and the aristocracy you formulated. Kill your darlings, and all that.

#+begin_quote
  Dark Extremists, Dark, Neutral, Grey, Light, Light Extremists
#+end_quote

I always disliked these names. First off: Nobody calls himself an extremist. Nobody. If you are an extremist you do not believe your own views to be extreme, you believe them to be /right/. Maybe you just meant that as "these are the parties alignments, names follow", but in case you didn't, please consider to think about something like my own make-up of the Wizengamot ([[https://imgur.com/lrWDrHg][link to imgur]]).

I just find it unbelievable that anybody would identify by "being dark". If you look around you, not a single political group that could be considered non-extremist identifies with "known evils". Everybody tells anybody else that they have moral high ground. Nobody goes ahead and just tells everybody /by name/ that they're the bad guys.

#+begin_quote
  Have a major rivalry with Tom riddle
#+end_quote

Why not get rid of him then and there? If Myrtle dies, Harry /knows/ what happened. Why not deliver the greatest Dark Lord to ever be to the authorities for being literally the only one capable of controlling a basilisk? Or /at least/ tell Dumbledore so the professor can dial his suspicions about Riddle up to a hundred and start to keep an eye on him much sooner.

#+begin_quote
  Walburga Black
#+end_quote

Could be fun if you manage to get her character to be interesting.

Plotwise I think you should lean more towards diverging from canon. As I read it now, Harry seems to have almost 0 impact on the world and that, in one word, sucks. The protagonists actions need to have weight. If everything he does just ends up dissolving into canon, you may as well not write the fic at all. When you make Harry powerful, make him use that power. Let him deal with Voldemort soon(er). Let him be the one to face Grindelwald before the man lets the world dissolve in war. Make Harry's impact on the world a big splash.

*** Well first off I only used the ron bashing as an example of cliches that are generally found, wasn't actually going to do it. I'm not a big fan of bashing either.

For the house and Clan idea, I was only referring to the Clan idea for not seeing it in any other fics (should have probably said that in the first place). The main reason I want to put something like this into the fic is because I love history, I like seeing the role and main achievement that the family have had in the Wizarding world I found it interesting what the author can come up with.( That what I like about passageways is the reputation and infamy that is related to the eveningshades).

For the family magic, I wasn't sure if I wasnt even sure about doing without directly ripping off someone else's work so it was 50/50 if I was going to include it. Main reason I was thinking about doing was to explain how harry would be head of the peverall Clan while the potters couldn't, were potters over the centuries were head of the Clan but it can't be passed down to an heir the family Magic's would have a choice for who is the head and if there is a direct family that has been head of the Clan for 5 generations then it allows the headship to pass down to heirs but once the direct Clan dies or the family magic absolutely refuses to pick an heir as the head then the branch families can then try forge headship(I'm not sure yet just came up with it now but will change once I start to worldbuild seruously)

For the Wizengamot titles they wouldn't refer to themselves as that but the other would refer to their group as such but I liked your set up of the Wizengamot so if you allow me, I would like to use it.

For the Tom riddle rivalry, I came up with this as I wrote it so I came up with this whole fic basis in looks 30mins to an hour so I was just adding shit without really thinking about it, but I'd probably work out a whole bunch of the world building and what I wanted to do with the rivalry and go into the nature vs nurture thing, I probably make Harry save Myrtle now that I think about it and then lead to a duel between Tom and Harry which forces Tom to flee the castle then build into him joining Grindelwald as apprentice or some shit.

With the Walburga pairing I thought it would be jokes as and could work out, she will still be a blood supremacist but as I was planning to make the blacks an ancient and noble house and peveralls an ancient and Noble Clan (which Harry will be head of) so he is a higher standing so she won't outright dismiss him but it will be a slow build to taking down her prejudices, I would still make her intolerant of muggles, indifferent to muggleborns and halfbloods but nowhere near as bad as she was as a portrait.

Plot wise I probably did the worse summary basis 😂😂, at the time I was just focused worldbuilding but I guess for the Tom v Harry I would make it a competitive rivalry for the dueling tournament that will be in the first year that Harry arrives(since Tom hasn't actually did anything that requires killing him otherwise it would be murder in cold blood since he actually hasn't done anything yet), then it will get into a main rivalry once Tom starts releasing the basilisk, Harry confronts Tom in the COS and they end up in the duel and harry gets the upper hand and Tom releases the basilisk to flee since he has been heavily injured by harry. Then it will go into the seventh year after which will be mainly just training, Walburga and harry romance( which I probably can't write for shit but will still try) and once he is of age; the Wizengamot sessions(but only show important trials, bills, alliances and elections). After seventh year a montage of training in mastery's around the world deiscovering different types of magic and then becoming a battlemage. Then will going into the grindelward wars were harry will play a big part in being the leader of his on regiment and pushing his way through the army of Grindelwald, maybe have a duel with Grindelwald which is close but Grindelwald gets the upper hand and curses harry that forces into the long recovery which he meets walburga again while he is make in Britain and they reconcile and then he proposes and they set up a marriage contract between them and then when he rejoins his regiment, Dumbledore has joined and his the head of his own regiment then join together to siege the final base of Grindelwald fuels and battle happens. Dumbledore wins, both harry and Dumbledore get order of Merlin's for there victory in war. Then goes into a montage of harry and Walburga marriage and children then leads up to the time he has a child that is in the same year as James and goes into the Voldemort war (will be more destructive then last time, I'll research ancient mythologies and go info associating them as actual creatures people in the magical world). This is where harry will come into his own and make a big impact in the war that leads to Harry beating Voldemort in a duel.

I'll do the specific plot after I finish the world building,

I'll probably make the gods of the several pantheons to be actually wizards with there own type of magic that explains why the muggles correlate a god with a certain ability such as Zeus and he will be a lightning elemental.

For the the world tour for 2 years , probably spend more time outside the European Continent, he will spend maybe a month in the major countries such as Italy,france Germany, Russia learning they Magic's but I'd imagine the would be similar with some differences. Then he will go to Asia ( figure out there Magic's when I'm World building) then Africa mainly Egypt, then Australia which he will learn from the small group of aboriginals, then the island countries around Oceania, then the americas and lastly Middle East.

Also I'll probably go into actual God's and goddesses, such as the lady of the lake, the rainbow serpent will be one that can only be communicated to by the aboriginals only, go into it more after researched it more but like I said I million time before all be done once I properly start worldbuilding and shit like that

Hopefully this is a better basis and I would also like to thank you for the feedback has helped me a lot,

**** As I said: Its all about execution. Clans and Houses may as well be the same thing as it stands now. Its up to you to make it interesting. Family magic, his rivalry,... all up to you.

One thing that I still think is an issue: You pack */way too many/* ideas into your fic. Way too many.

You gotta choose. Do you want this to focus on the Clans and Houses - the british political landscape, do you want it focused on Harry becoming this incredible mage, do you want it focused on the wars, on Tom Riddle / Voldemort, on his world trip... on what?

You described 5 fics (6 if you count his relationship with Walburga) that you plan to pack into one. One definite outcome of that is that none of the stories told will be good. 100% guaranteed. Many have tried, the vast majority has failed.

Kill Kill Kill your darlings. Reduce it down to one, conscise idea. Because chances are you aren't capable of writing half a million words to credit every single one of these plotlines with enough time. Try writing a 50 to 100k fic with just one (maximum 2) of these plotlines. Believe me, the feeling of finishing 1 idea, is better than failing at writing all 5 of them.

** Don't bash or be overly nice to characters. It destroys the best of stories.

Don't put to much emphasis on the clans and houses. You are writing a story on kids, kids don't care. So if you put a lot of time into that it makes the kids seem like adults. If you want to put emphasis on this do it when they are older.

Don't do the time travel thing. It makes a good plot seem ridiculous most of the time (especially because Harry up until he moves trough the Veil has never heard of any of those clans or houses). The plot becomes a lot better as an AU born in that time and with a different politcal spectrum.

Family magic CAN be fun (in the Heritage series as a very minor plot detail for instance) but is mostly just a boring cliche (but if you want to put it in? Fits more with an AU world than in a time travel story).

Harry a Ravenclaw sure but make him into one.

Tom Riddle rival only works in an AU because with the knowledge of the future he will just make him pay for the Chamber thing and gone is Tom Riddle.

The story has a lot of potential!
