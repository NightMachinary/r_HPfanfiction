You know, characters that you've noticed writers just have trouble capturing like they're portrayed in canon and it comes off as cringy.

Personally, I have the most trouble with Luna. I've read the books again, watched the movies to try and see if that would help but it's hard to write her properly so I usually just avoid writing her at all

What about you guys?


** Luna is mine too. I adore her when written well. I'd love to write something with her, but everytime I try, it just ends up wooden.

*** 100% agree. No contest.

I feel like the worst is when the whimsical is way overdone.

** Hagrid. I would prefer if they just changed a couple of words in his speech, instead of every one of them. more often than not, I can't understand what he is saying in fics.

agree with Luna. she is mostly written as a seer, someone who knows all your secrets etc. I mean, it would be cool if fics made her a legilimens (like Queenie), but unless the fic makes her that, why is she knowing all about you just by looking at you?

** Yep. Luna is very difficult to write.

She's in Ravenclaw but also a conspiracy nut and believes in completely nonsensical things.

*** Oh, but isn't it when people go beyond those three things that they mess the character up?

** I think I would have a hard time writing Hagrid dialogue-wise. I don't want to butcher the way he speaks and I'm worried I would just f it up and it wouldn't be readable.

*** That's so me

I definitely butchered up his dialogue in an earlier HP fic I wrote. I tried to say close to the books but I kinda guessed at what words to change

** It's honestly hard to write /any/ character because we are not professionals, and it's way too simple to just go and write a caricature of a character based on other fanfiction we read.

This might be an unpopular opinion, but I see a lot of badly written Sirius Black - all the Marauders in general, actually. It seems most people like to write them as a caricature of themselves without any real depth and honestly, it really detracts from the story. Which is a pity, the plot may be interesting but if the characters are haphazardly characterised it's a hard read.

*** Good answer and I must say, I agree. It's harder to write the characters with bigger roles in general because you're never going to have the same effort/time to plan them out as the original author did.

It's why Random-Slytherin-B is such a great character in fics, but Albus Dumbledore gets bashed to all hell.

** Fleur.

Most writers oscillate between a haughty princess and woe-is-me, I have no friends Fleur.

** From what I can see authors tend to struggle with Hagrid, Severus, Luna, and Albus (Dumbledore).
