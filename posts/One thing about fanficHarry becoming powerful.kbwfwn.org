This might very well be just my personal pet peeve, but every time I read a fic where Harry becomes (extremely) powerful in a rather short period of time - usually by using rituals, runes and/or inheritance powers - there is always that one little question in the back of my mind:

/"Why didn't anyone else do it first?"/

I mean, yes, the Magical World is small, and most of its inhabitants seemingly have no ambition to become great witches and wizards, but still: it must have its share of intelligent, driven, and ambitious people - the kind of people who would very much like to have this kind of power. So... where are they, and why does it often seem like Harry Potter is the only one who even tries?

Take Runes as an example. Let's say that they are indeed as useful as many fics suggest, and that it's possible to drastically increase one's own magical power by applying them in a certain way. Now remember that Runes aren't exactly obscure - they are taught at Hogwarts as an elective, which suggests that there are at least a few people who specialize in them (as in "have a lifetime of studying Runes"). So... why don't these people actually use them to massively boost their magical power - and why doesn't someone like Dumbledore or Voldemort do the same?

Same with rituals and other forgotten magic - actually, the Ministry has an entire Department dedicated to studying that sort of thing. OK, you could claim that the Ministry has outlawed them, for whatever reason - but why don't the Death Eaters, who couldn't care less about the Ministry's laws, make good use of them?

Same with getting rich by bringing Muggle ideas to Magical World and vice versa (there must have been plenty of Muggle-raised wizards who have tried this); same with becoming powerful by inheritance (remember how many Sacred 28 families joined Voldemort? Hell, if you're giving Harry a bloodline limit, at least do the same for other families as well).

Now, I'm not against Harry becoming powerful per se, and I think there can be many good reasons why Harry is able to come up with something no one else thinks of; but I also think it would make for a better fic if the author actually came up with such a reason.


** To be fair, the worldbuilding in canon is full of stuff like this.

What's the deal with the communication mirrors being a unique marauder original when it's the best long distance communication method we see in the series?

Why is the room of requirement a secret to most students until Marietta exposes it to Umbridge? The house elves all know all about it, and considering Dumbledore and the twins stumbled upon it, it seems crazy no one has ever stumbled upon it twice in different configurations and got curious.

Shouldn't there be a long history of muggleborns wanting to free house elves for Hermione to look up? Slavery was made illegal in muggle England in 1833. No way is Hermione the first muggleborn to become aware of house elves with a strong aversion to slavery.

Snap invented muffliato, so in the history of wizard kind, he's the first person to care about having a private conversation?

  Slavery was made illegal in muggle England in 1833.
#+end_quote

Slavery was first made illegal in England sometime in the 1200s. There were periodic legal cases affirming this up until 1772, when the Somerset case firmly established that slavery was not recognised in England, and that would never change without an act of parliament. The 1833 act made it illegal everywhere else Britain controlled, eg. the Caribbean etc.

It was the 1400s, as part of the defence to a charge of assault, the defendant claiming he was entitled to beat his slave (bought in Russia, if memory serves). Held that slavery was not known to the common law, and as soon as you brought a slave into the jurisdiction he or she was free.

The Room of Requirement being secret? That doesn't mean no one has ever discovered it, just that those who found it graduated and didn't pass it on to younger students.

Why was Hermione the first to campaign for house elf rights? Who says she was? A few muggleborn students starting a campaign isn't going to make history books.

Muffliato isn't the only spell to have a private conversation, just one among many.

********* There are a few explanations in my opinion:

1. Students usually only discover the room of hidden things, which is mountains of mostly useless junk.

2. Parents would probably only tell their older children about the room, because let's face it, an amphitheater sized room piled high with broken random artifacts is potentially VERY dangerous.

3. The house elves only tell people they like about the room, or people who seriously need it.

4. It's entirely possible the room didn't exist for the full 1,000+ years, or that it was in a different location, or that the elves didn't always know about it, etc.

5. Just like Dumbledore, people who accidentally discover the room think it is a single-purpose room, like a bathroom magically appearing. They'd write it off as the castle just being like "here's that room you needed," but attempts to replicate the feat are unsuccessful because it's kind of in a random spot in a giant castle that's always shifting and moving.

Hogwarts is also likely full of many many weird and obscure secret magical things that we never see in canon because Harry just never stumbles upon them, like how the Prefects have their own swanky bathroom.

*** The Marauders didn't invent the mirrors, Sirius and James just happened to have some. In any case, the mirrors are strictly two way. How would you feel if you needed a different phone for every single one of your contacts? Plus you have to be physically near your pile of mirrors to answer calls. There's no missed call or voicemail service. It's not very convenient. The Floo network connects to pretty much all wizarding houses, and doubles as a form of transportation. Of course people are going to choose that.

How many Muggleborns are going to own house elves? They're expensive. The ones at Hogwarts are well-treated and very happy with serving. They react strongly against any suggestion that they be freed or paid. Hermione's campaign was really founded on how Dobby was treated. For someone who has joined this world at the age of 11 to set up a campaign against it requires a very rare combination of personality traits and knowledge. And for that campaign to be successful enough that anyone would know about it is obviously rarer still.

The thing with muffliato is that it disguises conversations from listeners. Other existing spells can make your conversation silent to others, but that lets people know you're using a silencing spell and therefore doing something secretive. Muffliato creates a noise like muffled voices, but which can't be understood.

In that case, I'd probably sacrifice a room to hang a big, magical crystal ball and stick a bunch of mirrors on the walls. I'd call the room, and have the ball react to verbal directions and route the call to the correct output mirror (not unlike a central hub in early telephone).

And that is assuming the adressing component is static, not variable, and that the enchantment itself is too complex to meddle with. The usage doesn't imply that is the case however: the mirror input is a given name/nickname, which did not stay unchanged as mirrors changed hands. An example can be the mirror passing from James to harry, or from Previous User A to Sirius (Eve if the configuration was Padfoot-Prongs, it's unlikely that there were more of either. Sirius would need to either know how to change the call names, or be the one to set them in the first place after creating the things from scratch - and thus have the know-how).

The food just seemed to appear out of nowhere, so the Muggle-borns probably just wrote it off as another magic thing. If it weren't for Dobby, Winky, and several trips to the kitchens, we may not have even known that house elves existed. Hermione herself only found out after the events of the world cup.

"Connecting the dots" is an ability most people (both Wizards and Muggles) sorely lack. Plus, if I were a student and had knowledge of that room, the /last/ thing I'd do is tell anyone about it. In a closed off environment such as Hogwarts, every generally-unknown secret escape spot is knowledge worth gold... as evidenced by the number of secret tunnels and passageways. As far as canon goes, the only ones who know about them are the Marauders, the Weasley twins and the Trio (plus, after book 3, at least Dumbledore).

Regarding Umbitch - no one except her dumbass Slytherin goons liked her that much to tell her even a tiny whisper.

Voldemort gains access to Grimmauld Place and learns some other important things, such as the fact that his horcruxes are no longer secret or safe. Harry and the good guys pay dearly for it - perhaps Voldemort personally raids the house and kills several people, including Sirius. The horcurxes are moved.

But said evidence also creates another problem, in that it supports the idea that said power-ups would be temporary.

I am, of course, talking about Harry being a Parselmouth. After the fragment was destroyed, he lost the ability permanently.

It could create an interesting idea for a story though. Especially if you were to play around with the idea that Harry were to /know/ it was temporary. The entire "Do I do what is right and sacrifice this power or allow the possibility of Voldemort returning just to maintain this feeling of power and superiority" moral dilemma can be really interesting if written correctly.

That is also true. But it seems like while many fanfic authors do engage in worldbuilding, only Harry (along with his friends/subordinates/padawans/harem) is permitted to actually /use/ all the new cool magic, while the rest of the Magical world is "stuck" in JKR's world.

The thing is in JKR's world there aren't intelligent and ambitious witches and wizards. Ambitious wizards and witches go to Slytherin aka the magical version of Hitler Youth.

Longer response deals with for every cool or powerful thing there is like 100+ ways for that thing to become OP. Felix Felicis, also called "*Liquid Luck*" in a world where time turners, detection spells, and etc are a thing. You also don't really see much weaponized liquid luck besides Harry using it to get nebulous information out of Slughorn.

Since wizards can teleport in like 3-4 different ways ie phonix flash, floo, apparition, portkey etc. In addition to having a history of flying craft ie ships, rugs, boomsticks etc. They should be able to colonize space since basically 1300s. More so because they have stuff like bubble headcharms. Wards to live at the bottom of the sea etc.

Quasi-sentient Artifacts from hats to swords to accomplish a wide range of tasks. That pretty much spells out they could have complete automation of most manufacturing.

It gets odder because in a society where everyone can do magic at least up to 8th year in their schooling system. What does it mean to be poor when you can expand space, buy enchanted objects for farming, enchant objects to do things for you. Reparo and similar spells setup no reason to have broken down or shotty items.

We don't know the full extent of why and how both gained their power. The Elder Wand is said to be unbeatable in a duel - yet Dumbledore managed to best Grindelwald.

For me, it makes perfect sense that all three /did/ have some secret.

#+begin_quote
  Same with rituals and other forgotten magic - actually, the Ministry has an entire Department dedicated to studying that sort of thing. OK, you could claim that the Ministry has outlawed them, for whatever reason - but why don't the Death Eaters, who couldn't care less about the Ministry's laws, make good use of them?
#+end_quote

For forgotten magic: The Ministry does know about it, but ... the department staff ain't called Unspeakables for no reason. The knowledge about it is also most likely restricted or removed from the Hogwarts libraries, so you'd need someone willing to act as a guinea pig.

Regarding rituals: assuming a ritual requires some sort of personal sacrifice by the performer (like the blood ward at Voldy's cave)... not many who want to be powerful want to risk themselves.

Getting rich by bringing wizard ideas to the Muggle world risks hitting the Statute of Secrecy. Vice versa requires enough creativity to bypass Magic side effects that many don't possess it - there's a reason wizards have old-style cameras, no phones, and no Internet.

** I had once read years ago a reason I found interesting. And based a bit on cannon, if you will.

If Harry is the first one using the method to become super-powerful (I think it was runes?), it's because he is the first one in a really really long time, like since Merlin, to present those qualities :

- Have enough "core" power, or base power to handle it. (Harry is pretty powerful to begin with. The Patronus at 13 is a big deal in canon, and showed that Harry is already more powerful than most wizards).

- The curiosity to wonder and look for a way to get more power. You know not just believe that things are as they are, and there's nothing to do about it.

- No ambition to use it for himself, but only to help others ( not unlike the philospher's stone).

- A need for it.

So the knowledge to become more powerful was in a book in the Hogwarts library. This magical book wouldn't appear to any one unless they had all those qualities. (Like the Sword of Gryffindor only appeared to True Gryffindor when they need it).

So, Voldemort wouldn't be able to get it, since he would uses it for Himself., and I don't think he would need it. Dumbledore would need it, to fight Grindelwald or Voldemort, but it's likely that he wouldn't be able to see it, since he believed he would like it too much.

As for the others, they either didn't enough power to begin with, too much ambition for themselves, wouldn't need the power since it was peace time, or maybe not as desperate as Harry felt, or just never wondered if it was even possible

** Generally, I think that a good rule of thumb when invoking magic or some magical law to solve a problem, or when introducing new magic, one should ask several questions:

1. Keeping in mind that canon characters know more about magic than you do (even if you might know some factoids that they don't), why didn't the characters do that thing under similar circumstances in canon?
2. How would society be different if others could do what the protagonists are about to do? Is it (whether in canon or in your fic)?
3. Would the antagonists be in the position to anticipate it, and what countermeasures would they take?
4. If others can't do it and/or can't anticipate it, why not?

One should not proceed with the plan until one has found satisfactory answers to all of these questions.

** Power enhancing has always bothered me because it's both something that you would have expected to be among the very first thing wizards developed, and also constantly refined and reinvented along their history. Yet in canon this concept doesn't exist at all, and in fanon, Harry is the only one that seems to find it, or care about it. I'll list a few Magical things which I would personally expect to be commonplace, yet in both canon and fanon, are either shockingly absent or very obscure.

1. *Magical enhancement, aka 'Transwizardism'*

My headcanon is that inroads into this have been made. It defies logic and suspension of disbelief too much to realistically claim nobody researched this. So why isn't it something everyone goes through? Well, in regards to boosting magical prowess, it's more straightforward: either have it that nobody ever managed to properly quantify what makes a someone magical, or what it actually is, or what in the body makes magic possible, and such they can't boost their own magic, because they don't know what it is to begin with. Or secondly, they did, and such rituals do exist, but their effect is absolutely minimal, and trying to stack up more rituals is a guaranteed death. Make it that yeah, everybody enhances their magic at some point in their lives, but at the same time, they could live their whole lives without realistically noticing the boost, because it's that small.

Physical enhancements is where it gets more iffy. I straight up refuse to believe that they can't alter their bodies anyway they wish. Soooo... where is the edgy student that shows up to class with claws and fangs? Or why isn't everyone stunningly beautiful? Why would Hermione's teeth and hair be a problem for more than 5 minutes in the Wizarding world? Or Harry's sight? Or his hair? Or more importantly, why is no one boosting their memory as to have perfect recall, like some authors suggest mastering Occlumency does?

Honestly, I don't really have good headcanons for that. One really shoddy one would be that it's a cultural thing. That because they can literally bend reality to their every whim, it made them place much more value and prestige on what's actually natural? It's why they don't simply conjure any piece of clothing or non-gold jewelry too, even if they have the skill, it would be seen as shameful. It's not a headcanon I'm really satisfied with, but irl we have much crazier traditions and customs than this, so I suppose it is realistic.

Another point would be that wizards are naturally far more resilient than Muggles, so again, there simply isn't a need to turn their bodies into tanks. As for boosting their brain capacity.... I... really don't know. Surely, there is a Muggleborn that took an interest in anatomy and understand the brain well enough to develop a spell or potion that boosts it.

And as far as why isn't everyone more beautiful than Greek gods? I simply can't find any realistic work around for that, my headcanon is that they are. They can alter their appearance in every conceivable way, and they do it routinely.

1. *Personal defenses*

In a society in which you can be turned into a slave more obedient than a house-elf with very simple and routine spells and potions, I again, straight up refuse to believe there isn't a huge supply and demand for protections. Talismans that protect against Imperius (sure, someone as powerful as Voldie or Dumbledore wouldn't be stopped by them), shops that enchant your silverware to flair up if the food they get in contact with has potions in it, wards that monitor life sign and even heal/prevent minor illnesses, clothes that have defensive spells weaved into them (I refuse to believe the twins were the first in history that did it), jewelry that may slightly boost your Occlumency.

I can't find any good excuse for these not existing.

1. *House-elf liberation*

This will probably draw controversy, but my headcanon for why no outraged witch or wizard successfully outlawed their slavery anywhere in the world is that House-elves simply aren't really alive. Just like we irl are designing increasingly complex machines to do stuff for us, wizards managed to bio-engineer a race of servants to do stuff for them. They don't want to be free not because of Stockholm syndrome. They don't want to be free because their brains are literally designed in such a way that they cant even understand the concept, much less want it.

They're just machines. Dobby is the only one we see actually wanting to be free, and it's more because of a bug in the system, not because he is a real person.

The significantly more popular fanon trope of wizard-elf bond is also an interesting concept.

​

1. *Getting rich simply by stealing and/or exploiting the Muggle world*

This is a weird one too. From the get go, in the canon Potterverse, and any fanon world which doesnt deviate much, if at all, from the canon one, this would absolutely happen, and in rampart ways. There is nothing stopping a wizard from Apparating in Fort Knox and stealing all the gold. They probably don't go to such wild extents so the SoS isn't broken, but theoretically, nothing would stop them. Or Apparating in Jeff Bezos' house, stealing all his bank info (straight from his head) and then emptying his accounts. Or going into a Muggle museum at night, casting a Geminio on a piece you really life, and leave the Muggles with a fake.

The only realistic way of preventing this is if local govs and the ICW are made hyper-competent. They work much deeply and closely with Muggles and ward of military and governmental offices against rogue wizards. Goblins are bound by laws to report any large/suspicious sum being added into an account. Wizard govs have whole departments scouring Muggle media for any strange news that appears to be the work of magic. Gringotts and wizards are banned from investing in the Muggle world, because of how they can exploit it.

This would prevent any sort of large scale exploit and theft, and even with this absurdly competent gov, if you are careful and work on smaller scale, you could still get away with it and become filthy rich by robbing the Muggles.

1. *Replicating Muggle tech with magic*

This is odd, in the sense that even though I expect it to happen, I also don't think it would be on the scale many expect it. Medical field? They can already cure anything short of death. What muggle med or tech could possibly benefit them? Transportation? Already instant, anywhere around the globe. Household appliances? All done via magic already, plus they have their little bio-robots on hand. Movies? With magic, theatre is already more vast and impressive than all the hollywood blockbusters put together. AI? The Sorting Hat is already there, so we know they already know how to do it. Also, the Ford Anglia looks to have some minimal AI. And Ginny isn't surprised by the Diary talking back, so stuff like that exist.

TV and phones are what I think they could replicate and it would add a net benefit to their society. Other than that, can't think of much else.

​

Just my thoughts.

** I agree. Nothing wrong with a super!Harry, but it shouldn't be /easy/. I'm working on a fic where HP gets some good luck, runs with it, then buckles down and /bleeds/ for the power and skills he needs. (My headcannon is that Harry is more of a 'learning by doing' guy and less booksmart.) After the initial good luck, I've got him learning to fight in the RoR 5th year, getting his ass kicked as learns more in hours than he did under lockheart.

** This, like a lot of problems with canon, comes down to the franchise starting out as books for children.

They mature over time, and like in the movies, the third one does great job of transitioning into a more mature story-telling. However, a lot of concepts have already been introduced by that time, and they just don't work through a more mature lens. You have to suspend your disbelief to a bigger or lesser extend to have them work for you as a reader.

** Yeah I'm going to be addressing/have addressed that in my story. Basically the average witch or wizard just simply has zero use for higher end spells. The ones powerful enough to make runes and enchantments (my chosen "power" for Harry) work actually /do/ learn them. They're Cursebreakers like Bill. That or they go into something that I have to come up with :')

Of course the process is quite difficult and most people learn them in Apprenticeships unless they have an easy skip for that method, ala the Hogwarts Library which is full of way more stuff than just Years 1-7.

** There can be many reasons to not do the rituals, like maybe not being able to be used again by the same family for the next 3 generations as they leave a mark on your magic. Or doing it before a certain time can have long term effects like insanity or impaired judgement. The world we know of is the school days and not the more nitty gritty of the magical world.

Its like people who grew up in the magical world know what it can provide but dont believe that the benefits are more than the drawbacks.

SImilar with runes, maybe they give a huge boost but you require a certain amount of power to maintain them as your body changes and runes can get distorted having really bad effects. So people who are not really desperate dont opt for them.

To become an entrepreneur, you need the knowledge, passion and the resources. Generally its the resources i.e. money that is lacking. In this case, people who grew up in the magical world generally dont have the knowledge, people coming in from the non magical world dont have the resources to invest and set up a shop and very rarely does anyone have a passion for stuff like this.

** There is one fanfic that is kind of short and I cant remember it off the top of my head. However, Harry ended up realizing that Runes themselves did not have power but that you could use regular words. I forgot how it was explained. However, it was explained later, that there was a council of magic users who had found unique ways to join magic. If you discover unique magic you are invited to the council and the council has an oath keeping them from moving against each other. The council also did the best to keep each other alive because part of the oath made it so that if the creator of the new magic died you could not use it. I always thought it was an interesting and somewhat believable way to get around the "why have people not tried it before".

** In a lot of these kinds of fic, he finds whatever method he uses for power in the Chamber of Secrets - so only himself and Voldemort would have access to it, the rest would have to figure all that cruft out themselves.

The Knockturn Alley stuff usually boils down to "wands without the Trace on them and people who don't ask questions when a kid asks for something illegal". Death Eaters usually have access to all that stuff too, or they just don't need it.

Also, canon/extended canon isn't exactly innocent of this - there's a lot of things that should be way more common in usage than they are, a few other things that should be illegal-as-hell but apparently aren't, and still others that I haven't a clue how people got away with it.

Examples: The Twins have had the Marauder's Map since their first year, so how exactly is it that they never saw Peter Pettigrew on there (given all they'd have to do was /check on their brothers/)? How is the Come and Go Room not more common knowledge than it is, given the ever-eager-to-please house elves all know about it?

** I know you didn't ask for recommendations but the Story linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) does solve this exact problem in a pretty nice way of incredible circumstances giving harry an ability that he is likely to be the only one to ever have had.

Another Fanfic that resolves this problem in a way that makes it more believable is linkffn(The Life He Leads by WardenInTheNorth) where harry is interested in a very obscure kind of magic that everyone CAN learn but that fell out of favor because of how hard it is to learn and because other magics can help you fix your problems just as well without being as hard to master and even control. Here it is not that harry creates the magic but "rediscovers" what has been done in the past. rediscovers in parentheses because powerful and old people like dumbledore might and DO know of it already but don't invest time in mastering it.

That's actually another thing I often see in HP fanfiction - the idea that Magical Britain is that very backwards place and the rest of the Magical world is much better (and they're not above rubbing it in the Brits' face given the opportunity).

I mean, it's possible, but it's also possible that other countries have their share of problems as well.

#+begin_quote

Weirdly enough, I often encounter stories where neither Voldemort nor Dumbledore uses the same source of power as Harry - even if it would be logical for them to do so.

In any case, Harry is often depicted as becoming more powerful than +you can possibly imagine+ one or both of them, which doesn't really make sense if they also used a similar method - on top of having decades of experience that Harry does not.

**** That's exactly why I enjoyed greatly an ongoing fic centered around Diary-Riddle escaping in CoS and discovering that his other self became batshit crazy, but insanely strong, and wants to stop him to get his original plan back on tracks, and recovering his soul in the process.

He is as strong as he was when he made his frist horcrux and uses many dark and obscure ritual to greatly enhance himself.... But he isn't the only one, and other wizards around the world can and did find similar or even stronger and more unknown means to do the same, which helps making things realistic and interesting.

Ah yes it was this one : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/The-Imposter-Complex]]

***** In that case, it's not even about Harry using some secret methods to gain power, but about him having the sheer raw potential to rival Dumbledore's and Voldemort's decades of studies and real-world experience (not to mention that both /started out/ as teen geniuses and only got more powerful afterwards).

You could as well just proclaim that Harry is the second coming of Merlin, and leave it at that.
