One day, six year Harry Potter is walking through the library. He pulls out a Cat in the Hat book, but behind it he sees a thick book with golden writing. He pulls it out, and it reads ‚ÄúStandard Book of Spells, Grade 7‚Äù. He decides to sneak it home.

When he reads through the book, he notices that some of the ‚Äúspells‚Äù look a lot like the ‚Äúfreak‚Äù things he does. Harry decides that if he is a Wizard, he needs a magic wand.

He goes outside and picks a twig from the nearby Holly tree. While he is thinking of what to use as a core for his magic, he cuts himself on the twig. The blood hits the stick, causing it to change.

*** I'd argue most aren't. I‚Äòd say around 90% of the stories I've come across where Harry discovers magic early involves the same tired tropes before being abandoned and well before anything interesting actually happens.

** If Harry is (apparently) self-taught pre-Hogwarts, people are going to think he's a complete prodigy, especially if he somehow accidentally made his own wand (I'd hazard a guess that a wand using his own blood would have an unusually strong connection/loyalty to him, but be less good for precision work than a professionally-made wand). Self-learning high-level magic pre-Hogwarts is Riddle-level shit, and even Riddle, as far as we know, never figured out making his own wand. Of course Harry will have a leg up with the spell book he found (kind of like how he got ahead in Potions using the Half-Blood Prince's notes), but its still going to freak people out/impress them, and make even more people think he must be some super wizard who beat Voldemort as a baby through raw power. While Dumbledore may suspect that his prodigious ability is a sign of Voldemort's soul/memories affecting him. Of course, it could be argued that this Harry's self-taught magic illustrates a natural inclination to create and learn, while Riddle's showed a predilection to sadism and control.

** One of my earliest (if not my first) harry potter fanfics had a premise relatively similar to this (he found a tome of seriously messed-up blood magic rather than anything innocent and somehow learns it well). It's overly edgy garbage and I can't even look at it now without wanting to claw my own eyes out, but yeah...

I'll link to it if anyone asks (or you can search my username on FFN), but I'd rather leave it buried and gone.

*** So, i just finished the fic and honestly? I was pleasantly suprised. I dont know if that was because my expectations were that low or because its 03:45, but it is certainly nothing to claw your own eyes out over. Especially because it was your first. You held my attention for those 25k words and I still want to know more. It may not be the action packed masterpiece that "The Arcanist: Unspeakable mysteries" had been so far, but I want more, and, to me, that is the most important!

**** That's nice of you to say. And, yeah, I've gotten decent reviews on it, but for some reason I seem to hate my own writing in general and hate this piece specifically a ton. IDK why, but as soon as I finish editing something, I can't stand reading it again.

#+begin_quote
  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
