Basically looking for a Harry potter fic where Harry is Merlin, but its not done terribly. Like, I don't want some 10 year old instantly becoming some wise little shit that can do whatever he wants because he is so unbelievably powerful.

Maybe Harry gains power over time, or doesn't have the knowledge Merlin has, ect ect.

Over 70k+ words please!


** I had an idea for a harry inherits merlin's stave in the future and he begins to live backwards, influencing events, changing his future, until he arrives at merlin's time where he begins to live forwards, changing even more things. I decided against it because it became another fix-it fic.

I hope there are some good stories out there.

** It's not what you're looking for, but you seemed disappointed by the lack of responses, so here's a story that's involving Merlin and the world of Harry Potter.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8016336/1/Only-A-Boy][Only A Boy]] by Riddell Lee is a story where Merlin is the protagonist.

It's a crossover between HP and the BBC show Merlin, in which Merlin is reborn and Harry Potter doesn't exist.

The word count is over 270k at this point, and the last update was about two weeks ago, if you're into that kind of thing.

I kind of liked it, from what I can remember of it. I'll have to reread it again at some point, whenever it gets finished.

** That... is a good idea I haven't seen done well. I'll make sure to come back to it once my schedule is more clear.

** The Long Journey Home fits this description. Although Harry is female and takes on the role of a mythical witch instead.

Quite well written.
