Been looking for a certain Severus fanfic all day and cant remember the name of it.\\
Somethings I remember about it though is:\\
-Sev is in the park during summer and a girl appears in front of him badly injured and she looks like lily he helps save her and then she goes on to live with him.

-Shes a different type of witch but strong and teaches Sev her type of magic later on.

-She stops a death eater raid that's trying to steal Rufus little sister and they couldn't penetrate her magical shield.

-Her and Sev saves lily and her friends from a werewolf raid at lily's house

-She sinks Voldy and his followers into a cavern under them when he tries to get her to join and then is called the dark lady or something afterwards

-Alice joins them and she has claw like weapons

-Around 40 to 50 chapters I think

Sorry for such bad descriptions but those are the main things I remember of the story as its been a long time since I read it so if you can find it for me <3


** Did you ever find this? Because I've read this before and I'm sure I can track it down. You know what, I'll do that and then come back.
