In which Harry has been re doing his life multiple times, each time he dies, without remembering why.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** Oh, I think I was just reading that one too. I think he said he was cursed so he keeps being reborn but he isn't sure what he should do differently. I'll try and remember it
