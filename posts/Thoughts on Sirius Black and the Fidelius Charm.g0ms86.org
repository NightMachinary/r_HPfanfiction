This may have been suggested before, but I haven't seen it. These are just my thoughts on why Sirius decided to switch Secret Keepers when by the very nature of the spell, he could not have been forced to betray them.

The Fidelius Charm is used to conceal a secret inside of a human soul. The secret cannot be coerced from the secret keeper in any way. Mind reading, torture, coercion, mind control will all fail to extract the secret. The secret keeper must willingly share the secret. Upon the death of the secret keeper, each soul that had the secret shared with them then become secret keepers themselves, capable of sharing the secret.

When the Potter family goes into hiding, they know that Voldemort is trying to find them and because of the prophecy. They know that there is a spy in the Order of the Phoenix. They suspect that it may be Remus Lupin, because as a werewolf, he could stand to benefit a lot from a regime change that favored "dark creatures" more.

The Potter's home is placed under the Fidelius charm, but Sirius Black decides he would be too obvious, and convinces them to switch in Peter Pettigrew, who no one would suspect.

Theory:

Sirius Black planned to use himself as bait to find the spy. Have Peter write the location of the house on several pieces of paper, then have Sirius distribute the address to everyone in the order, claiming to be the secret keeper. The spy would then know that the only way to be able to tell Voldemort the location would be to kill the secret keeper. Sirius could go from member to member, giving them a seemingly clear opportunity to kill him (perhaps leaving his wand on a table but carrying a concealed spare), and then when one tried to kill him, they would know who the spy was. The only people who would know the plan, and who he was visiting on any given night, were the Potters and the real secret keeper.

Everyone in the order believed Sirius Black was the secret keeper, and the one to betray them. Possibly even among the death eaters, no one but Voldemort knew who his spy was. So when the Potters were dead and Peter gone, no one would have any reason to doubt the first most logical explanation that Sirius was responsible.

Let me know what you think. I would also be interested in reading any stories with a similar premise explored. Occassionally, without a deeper explanation that admittedly doesn't have a place in a narrative from Harry's point of view, the adults around him sometimes seem to act very irrationally. I like stories where context makes their choices make sense.


** Bigger question is why wasn't James or Lily the secret keeper? Since Bill was the SK for the Shell Cottage which he and Fleur were hiding in during the last book. Which didn't stop Dobby from transporting everyone there, without Dobby having been told the info by the SK.

For that matter, didn't Dumbledore cast the Fidelius Charm for the Potters or is that Fanon? Seems like he'd need to know who the SK was as part of casting the charm.

** It depends on what being forced means. Does it cover offering to give up the secret in exchange for an end to torture? Because in all honesty Sirius would not want there to be even a sliver of chance that the Potters could be put in danger. He would not want there to be even a remote possibility for him to break under prolonged torture and give up the information. That is why he had the extra security of everyone knowing him to be the secret keeper and then making Peter the actual one so that no matter the torture he goes through James, Lily and Harry would remain safe.

**** Additional note, once Sirius was killed, they would know he wasn't the secret keeper, which would then leave them to find the real one. Peter would definitely not be expected to stand up to any amount of torture. It is possible that was all there was to it, but it would make more sense to me if there was an intention to actively use the misinformation, rather than just have it as an extra passive layer of protection.

**** I don't think it makes any sense to say that the secret can't be tortured out of someone. Torture isn't mind control; it's theoretically possible to be tortured and yet say nothing. Speaking under the threat of torture is still a voluntary choice.

If the Fidelius charm stops the Secret Keeper from speaking if there is any suggestion of pressure being put on them, then it would also be impossible for them to, let's say, allow someone into the secret despite having concerns about them, because of a dire need.

For that matter, when Hermione Apparated a Death Eater to Grimmauld Place, she was definitely under duress, trying to escape a life-threatening situation, and she didn't even intend to bring him there. If the secret can only be given away entirely voluntarily, then that ought to have been impossible.

The "can't torture it out of them" statement doesn't hold up.

***** This doesn't seem like a counter argument to me. It's author Fiat (and a reasonable one) that direct duress cannot be used as a means for someone /else/ to get the secret out of the Keeper. However, the Number 12 apparition incidence is explainable by the fact that Hermione did the act of her own volition without realizing she was giving it away. It was that Imperiused guy doing something to force it out of them. It didn't have to do with speaking or communication, so AFAIK there's nothing in the charm's description that prevents that.

****** Actually, double checking the sequence of events, it's even more clear to me that no one voluntarily gave Yaxley the secret. Harry seized Ron and Hermione and Apparated them there, /not even realising/ that Yaxley had grabbed onto Hermione. Hermione then forced Yaxley to let go of her and took the three of them away again.

There was clearly no voluntary nor unforced disclosure here. Yet Hermione considered it enough that they had brought Yaxley inside the secret area, despite Harry, who initiated the action, not even knowing Yaxley was there.

If the charm can intelligently examine the whole situation and determine whether disclosure was voluntary, then that definitely shouldn't have qualified. And if not, if it just responds to the direct actions of the Secret Keeper, then torture will work.

The charm doesn't stop you from Apparating people (after all, you could technically use Apparition against an enemy who wants the secret), it simply won't let you tell communicate a secret by mistake or under direct duress.

The difference between than and torturing it out is the intent on the caster's part to get it from the Keeper, not the actions the Keeper takes.

** A tangential point: based on how the Fidelius Charm is supposed to work, had the Potters not switched Secret Keepers from Sirius to Pettigrew, the end result might've been much more dire.

We know that upon the Secret Keeper's death, every person who knew the secret in question, also becomes the Secret Keeper. We also know that Pettigrew had turned traitor at least a year before the Potters died, according to Sirius' comments. The only people who knew the Secret Keeper had been switched were James, Lily, Sirius and Pettigrew.

Imagine then, that Sirius remains Secret Keeper. Sirius knew where Pettigrew was hiding in canon; the reverse is easily possible. All Pettigrew has to do then, is to lead Voldemort to Sirius. If Sirius fails to escape or alert the Potters of the betrayal, and Voldemort kills him, then everyone who knew the secret becomes Secret Keeper, *including Pettigrew*. The Potters still die, but Pettigrew remains free and Sirius is dead, so no one knows the truth.

Of course, the most important question is why James or Lily weren't the Secret Keeper themselves. Bill was Secret Keeper of Shell Cottage while he was living there, same with Arthur at Muriel's place.

*** Concerning the question about the Secret Keeper, I will use the Doylish explanation of "Rowling had not thought about it yet", still have to find a good Watsonian one though (Maybe Arthur is the Secret Keeper of Shell Cotage and Bill the one for Muriel's place? But in this case, why didn't the Potter do the same with them keeping the secret of say Sirius' place and Sirius protecting their house?).

As for you scenario, I like it, but I want to add that, as long as Peter would not be "part" of the attack, his could probably keep his cover even if Sirius managed to escape. In canon, the Order knew that Voldemort knew about the Fidelius (this is a mouthfull), thew switched the Secret Keeper because they expected Sirius to be attacked. So, as long as the Betrayal is not too obvious (something like Peter asking Sirius to meet him in a secluded place, only to find an ambush), Peter could probably say "I was in hiding like Sirius and James" and people would believe him.\\
Hell, you could probably even have a scene where Sirius manage to escape the ambush, go to Peter's place (wanting to stay clear of the Potter's just in case), only to be attacked by him from behind and killed the moment he lower his guard. People in fanfics often forget that Peter, while less talented than James or Sirius, was still talented and a true part of their group (not some kind of fan following them everydays). The reason why he was chosen as the Secret Keeper is because he was considered the 2nd best candidate after "the almost adopted brother of James" and was above any suspicion (which is pretty impressive after 1 year of spying).

As for why James or Lily weren't the keeper, I think it's obvious from canon (not explicitly stated, but we're all intelligent people who can put two and two together) that the secret keeper cannot reside inside the secret, or be part of it.

** I don't think it's very difficult. The issue isn't about Sirius being tortured into giving the secret (which cannot happen to the Secret Keeper), but a general threat that someone else will be killed could very well work. The whole premise of Pettigrew betraying the Potter's is he feared for his life, and so gave up the secret to save himself.

So the threat needn't be direct nor directed at Sirius himself, it could have been, say, the possibility of a threat against someone else Sirius held dear that might have a slim chance of getting him to give the secret to save them. Andromeda was his favorite cousin and married a Muggleborn, so she seems like a prime candidate for who could have come to Sirius's mind. It's difficult to suggest that Sirius could have let his cousin, a good person who was not for Voldemort's ideal world, die to save his best friend and his family. It's not a scenario I think almost anyone could consider an easy choice.

** The part where the Secret Keeper literally cannot share the Secret unwillingly, that's retcon by Rowling. Like every other bit of retcon she's done, she's just made a mess of things. Without that bit of retcon, it would make sense to switch from Sirius.

Other than that, the only reason is plot.

James or Lily could have been Secret Keepers themselves, like Bill is for Shell Cottage. I mean, if Sirius was meant to be bait for the Death Eaters, James/Lily could still have been the real one. There's no reason to switch to Peter.

If it could have been tortured out, that would have been the stated belief by everyone in the first place instead of "Voldemort got the secret, therefore Sirius was an evil deceiver" like what happened in canon. In fact, the first time the charm is named, Flitwic literally says the secret cannot be forced out:

"An immensely complex spell involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find --- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper /chooses/ to divulge it."

** I have a less charitable view of the whole "Peter as secret keeper" thing. To me it is obvious in the books that James and Sirius are as thick as thieves and each other's best friends.

So Sirius getting murdered bc he is the Secret Keeper would destroy James emotionally. Being little assholes and arrogant little sods they decide to use Peter, bc 1) nobody would ever suspect him and 2) it would be safer for both Sirius and James that way. In essence, they decide to throw Peter to the wolves bc he is expendable. If they treated him like that through all of school, I totally understand why Peter might betray them; aside from being a shitty little coward afraid for his own life.

**** Yeah, but if Sirius got caught, he could deny being the Secret Keeper.

There is also the underlying layer of Sirius' heritage as a Black. Pretty much all of the other members of his family were Death Eaters, including Regulus. I bet quite a few people in the order suspected Sirius of being the spy. Not James, but Dumbledore might have.

Plus there is lots of things that we don't know. Maybe there is some sort of magic to figure out whether somebody is a Secret Keeper or not. If Sirius was not and got caught by say, Regulus, maybe his chances of survival were greater?

I agree with you though that there are a lot of "what ifs?" and that the switching secret keepers makes less sense the longer you think about it.
