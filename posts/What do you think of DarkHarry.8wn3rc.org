** It depends. If we are talking about "I will purge the Death Eaters by any means necessary, I don't care what some corrupt ministry declares as /DaRk MaGiC/", I am all for it. You don't win a war with nonlethal weapons, especially if you try to eliminate an ideology. And if he happens to take down the corrupt government along the way, you will not hear me complain either. I mean, the Ministry ran their own Muggleborn Holocaust, so not punishing everyone involved is actually the wrong thing to do.

But if "Dark Harry" means that he is now an edge load who just bangs /chicks/ (who are actually his sex slaves) and kills anyone who looks at him in a funny way by using an obscure curse that indoctrinates children to kill their parents, then I am out.

Tl;dr: Dark? Hell Yeah! Evil? Fuck NO!

** My takes on dark!Harry:

1. ⁠Dark Harry doesn't have to use dark magic. Dark magic is a mean he might choose to gain tactical advantages, such as Avada Kedavra bypassing the shield charm. But there are other times when its use could mean strategic disadvantages, such as negative PR and loss of public support. I want to see dark Harry weighing his options and be smart about it.

2. ⁠Dark Harry should have a worthwhile goal, a goal readers can sympathize with. Dark Harry having a kick murdering people around is just another glorified serial killer and stupid. Dark Harry imitating or joining Voldemort is boring and uncreative. There are quite a few characters in our history who butchered millions, but are still respected and revered by people today, among them Genghis Khan, Caesar and Augustus, and Napoleon. You might want to know what they did right. Also, Chairman Mao had an uncanny ability to turn the general populace into his willing henchmen.

3. ⁠Killing is all but mandatory for dark Harry. In fact, war is about killing people, as general George Patton so 'wisely' put it: "The objective of war is not to die for your country (cause), but make the other bastards die for their country (cause)!" Don't go into overly complicated moral justifications for killing people, unless it's an in-story plot to convince formerly moralistic person like Hermione. "I want to win this war, because failure is not an option!" is enough.

4. ⁠It's expected that a dark Harry would resort to torture to extract intelligence, to carry out revenge, and/or to satisfy his sadistic urges. In canon, Voldemort often used Cruciatus to soften up his victims before hitting them with Legilimency or Imperius. That was exactly the same approach Harry did in “The Sum of Their Parts” after Veritaserum proved ineffective against the Lestrange brothers. Or he didn't even need to get his own hands dirty, but allowed his subordinates to run organizations that were engaged in systemic torture, murder, kidnapping, extortion, and sabotage, as in “Emperor”.

5. ⁠Dark Harry doesn't mean he should act arrogant, rude, and a total jerk to others. Too many fics seem to be written by edgy people who fail to understand that politeness and subtlety will get someone a lot farther.

Hermione is a dark witch, she's just not an evil dark witch. She personifies some of the negative aspects of Gryffindor house. She's brave to a fault and willing to go to extreme lengths to see her cause completed. Even if that means doing things that might be morally wrong.

**** It's all about presentation and motivation. She set a teacher on fire to stop them from supposedly killing someone else. She mindwiped her own parents so Voldemort wouldn't find and kill them. She disfigured "traitors" for secrecy reasons. Taking the life of someone is far different than any of these things. Are those things acceptable because of these motivations and presentation? In the books, yes, because that is how it is presented. In real life? It really depends, it's all arguable. People seem to forget that people are rarely completely good nor completely evil, and they might not view themselves as one or the other. There are many a persons who know what they are doing is wrong, but either do not care or they think the reason is justified. Taking a life is extremely difficult and affects someone deeply.

That doesn't actually mean much. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler][Heinrich Himmler]] was supposed to be a great family man and loving father, but it didn't prevent him from becoming one of the biggest monsters in human history. Thousands others in SS, Gestapo, and Einsatzgruppen followed the same pattern.

Lots of people fail to understand that actions, choices, and intentions are what really mattered. Just because a war criminal has a few redeeming qualities, it doesn't mean that person should escape justice!

Hermione, as avid learner, should be very very familiar with WW2 history.

************** *Heinrich Himmler*

Heinrich Luitpold Himmler (German: [ˈhaɪnʁɪç ˈluːɪtˌpɔlt ˈhɪmlɐ] ( listen); 7 October 1900 -- 23 May 1945) was Reichsführer of the Schutzstaffel (Protection Squadron; SS), and a leading member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) of Germany. Himmler was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and one of the people most directly responsible for the Holocaust.

As a member of a reserve battalion during World War I, Himmler did not see active service. He studied agronomy in university, and joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and the SS in 1925.

************** Oh, I know that they shouldn't escape justice. But, my point through all of this is that I do not believe Hermione has the ability to just kill whoever gets in her way. I'm sure she can kill -- that she can get herself to that point. But she has to prepare herself, and I really don't see her just killing whatever enemy is in her path. Incapacitating? Sure. Killing? No.

******* With all respect, I don't think you understand her position. Hermione was in a position where she was almost killed by Death Eaters - one who escaped Azkaban - at the end of fifth year, and saw someone close to her - Sirius - get killed by another escaped Death Eater. Later, she saw Ron almost die, saw others almost die, all due to Death Eaters.

That's more than enough to make her kill Death Eaters. Others might still not be strong enough to kill such scum, but Hermione? She would do it. She would do it because it's logical and needed to protect others, and all other means have failed.

You can't have a Dark!Harry without some kind of ambition or desire pushing him to do more than he did in canon. It also opens up a lot of pragmatic paths that might otherwise be closed to Normally Morally Harry. So despite usually being done badly, I think it's a good thing for the fandom.
