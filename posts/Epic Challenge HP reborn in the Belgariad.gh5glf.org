Epic because the Belgariad is freaking /long/. How Harry dies is up to you, as is what variant of the HP-verse he's from, but as his consciousness is waning he hears a dry voice say something to the effect of "I need you" or "you'll do" before he wakes up on the floor of Faldor's Farm (for some reason he doesn't remember or witness Garion's parents' deaths, so his first clues that something is up would be the same as those a reader of the series would see). Should be nice and cynical about prophecies, and give the dry voice quite a hard time. Perhaps give it a name as a sign of disrespect (I've long thought that if I got inserted into Garion I'd call it Logos but that doesn't feel right for one fed up with destiny, so maybe Shanghai?)?

Bonus points if you want to make other characters get reincarnated as well, albeit they shouldn't remember anything unless or until Harry/Garion says something that reminds them of their past lives. Suggestions for who could be who (I'll try to avoid spoilers as much as possible for anyone who hasn't read the series but thinks they might do so either to write this or for context to read it if it's written, but I can't quite cover them all; if you can't figure out why Ce'Nedra's suggestion might be a spoiler by the time she shows up in the story sorry but I just can't comprehend how you've maintained your trope innocence to that degree when I saw it 100,000 miles away back when I first read the series back in like 9th grade or thereabouts nearly 20 years ago lol):

Hermione ► Aunt Pol

Neville ► Durnik

Sirius ► Old Wolf

Ginny ► Ce'Nedra

Gred and Forge ► Beltira and Belkira

Ron ► Lelldorin

Lupin ► Barak

Snape ► Silk

Moody ► Beldin

Dumbledore ► Aldur

Draco ► 'Zakath

Arthur and Molly Weasley ► King Fulrach and Queen Layla of Sendaria

Feel free to sprinkle in more (perhaps a fanfic trope variant of Daphne* as Queen Porenn?), albeit I suspect that there could easily be quite a few who would never actually remember as it just wouldn't come up (especially as reincarnation doesn't quite seem like a thing to broadcast to all and sundry, especially if you wanted to let people underestimate you).

*EDIT: realized after the fact that if one went the multi-reincarnation route it might be better to put Queen Porenn as Narcissa (instead of Daphne; maybe if you want Daphne, she can be Taiba? Might make for an interesting choice for Relg to boot), with King Rhodar as Lucius, given a certain revelation about Silk and Porenn from Cherek that I'd somehow not thought of when originally posting.


** Now I have to dig around my old computer for my digital copies of both series.

*** Awesome!

Also, I added an edit cause I realized after the fact that I'd forgotten something that made my offhand suggestion for Daphne for the possible multi-reincarnation route have a certain potential for discomfort, and I think I realized a much better potential option for both her and Porenn.
