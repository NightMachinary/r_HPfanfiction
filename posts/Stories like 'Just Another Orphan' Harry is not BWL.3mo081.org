Shitty childhood with Dursleys, except maybe worse because he isn't the BWL. No Figg watching over him, no special treatment at school. Slytherin is a plus.

I read one a story like this one, but I can't remember the name. Harry lived in Knockturn at a hotel.


** Ooh. I hope you find something. I'd like to read it myself.

** The story with Knockturn might be linkffn(Malachite Gift by Lazov) and its sequels. There is also linkffn(Ravenous by Edelrost) and Traitor's Son by Sesc which you can read on DLP's WbA section (though the site isn't very friendly in that regard right now).

  Dark times lie ahead for the Wizarding world. Blood will be shed as Harry Potter sets sail in his perilous quest for revenge - by any means necessary. Non-BWL, no canon rehash, dark undertones.

The site currently has a restrictive policy where you have to register and post a certain amount of times before you can enter the WbA, unfortunately.

****** The reason for the post restrictions is that we've been having issues with plagiarists taking stories from WbA and trying to pass them off as their own. This is an attempt to help reduce that and may or may not be temporary.

You have to remember that WbA is for the writers, not readers. It's a place to post your work in order to have it critiqued by other writers and readers with good standards so that you can then improve it and post the final draft elsewhere. From this point of view, why would writers who post their stories for critique have an obligation to let people read it who will never leave any feedback?

I understand it may seem a little frustrating to be suddenly denied access, but I guarantee it's far worse to be an author who finds his unfinished work stolen. You also only have to post five times, which is far from unreasonable, and then can lurk to your heart's extent.

******* Yeah I know the reason for it, and I can understand wanting to stop the plagiarism. My thing is that it is very easy to get access, so how is it going to stop anything.
