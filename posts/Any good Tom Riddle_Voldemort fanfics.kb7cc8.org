Heyo.

I'd love to hear about some good Tom Riddle fanfics (during his school years, or just sane in the future, or whatever as long as it's not very very crazy Voldemort).

Just something with him somewhere in the focus.

I do prefer fics on the longer side so that would be appreciated as well!\\
Can be any ship, or no ship at all, everything's fine in that direction.

Also don't care much about platform (Ao3, FF, you name it)

If I missed a recent post asking about the same thing, then I do apologize!

Looking forward to any answers :)


** 1)That Glorious Strength Lomonaaeren Summary: Instead of becoming Voldemort, Tom Riddle established a school of ‚Äúsecondary importance‚Äù for Muggleborns, half-bloods, and Squibs. Since the school frees Hogwarts to continue drifting more towards the purebloods' whims and wishes, they haven't raised any large fuss. Besides, everyone knows that half-bloods and Muggleborns don't have any real power. Just look at Riddle, who had ambitions that outpaced his magical strength. They don't see the revolution coalescing under the surface.

2) Boy Who Lived ¬ª Not even the birth of her son could compel Merope to continue living after her husband's abandonment, but the green-eyed stranger sitting by her deathbed, cradling her squalling babe, proves to be an unexpected savior. Time Travel. Rare Pair: HarryxMerope

This story begins Merope and Harry-centric, but migrates toward Tom and Harry as the story progresses. Don't expect an angelic, lovely Tom; just because he has parents doesn't mean that he isn't prone to screwing up or having serious emotional issues. People will die. ... Eventually.

3) A Small Grey Stone At Fred's funeral, a small child gives the grieving Molly a grey stone. Soon after, Molly discovers that she is pregnant. But there is something very strange about the youngest Weasley child... Happy (belated!) Halloween! Harry Potter, T, English, Horror & Family, words: 2k+, favs: 345, follows: 97, Nov 5, 2013, Molly W., Voldemort

4) Atom Trails The wings of a thousand butterfly effects cut her until she bleeds Fantastic Tom Riddle characterization

Tried to keep all the stories gen because I don't know if you like het/slash romance etc...

**** Ok then I would like to recommend these fics too because although they might contain more romantic elements they are nonetheless a good rendition of Tom's character.

1) Hail and Snow by Runic Healer In the dreary old orphanage of Wool's, Tom is alone and will always be. Two-shot, pre-slash TMR/HP. Harry Potter, K+, English, Hurt/Comfort (underrated story) ‚ÄúAnd when Voldemort possesses the boy, and Harry remembers love, Tom cries, because for that one moment, he pretends it is for him, and it is okay.‚Äù

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7827259/1/]]

2) Remembrance by Ancalyme Voldemort remembers. Set in the distant, indefinite future veeery slight HPLV (underrated one shot. It resonated with me for a very long time) Voldemort reflects on the life he lead

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2078101/1/Remembrance]]

3) October ¬ª It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, Tom/Lily and Tom/Harry, not threesome The beginning of the story starts like this:

‚ÄúTom Riddle first met Death on the train to Hogwarts, although he did not know it at the time.‚Äù Words: 209k+,

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October]]

4) When Harry Met Tom ¬ª When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

I like this story because you see the gradual shift of Tom disassociating himself from the persona he calls Voldemort.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12793151/1/When-Harry-Met-Tom]]

5)üíïüíï The most romantic heart warming yet still in character story

To Kill You With a Kiss Summary: After Dumbledore's death, Harry searches for answers in the Pensieve. But something goes wrong. Trapped inside a memory, Harry finds himself back at Hogwarts in 1945 where he meets an 18 year old Tom Riddle teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6655266/1/To-Kill-You-With-A-Kiss]]

6) Little Prince on B612 Run_of_the_mill

Summary:

In the back of Knockturn Alley, there is a small Apothecary where Tom meets a mysterious young man who draws him a tiny sheep in a crate with three little holes. Tom takes it home.

Does this mean Tom is no longer a dull, drab, adult?

A/N: This isn't a retelling of the Little Prince. It's simply the story of two people who read and loved the Little Prince and allowed themselves to be influenced by it.

** /Last Lord of the Sun/ by Lomonaaeren linkao3(11486688) - Dumbledore finds a mal-adjusted kid in Wool's Orphanage and decides to try helping the kid instead of setting his things on fire.

/A Mentor's Burden/ by Naidhe linkao3(18394745) - if Dumbledore is powerful and he sets other people's things on fire, then if Tom wants to be powerful he should _____?

/If Them's The Rules/ by MayMarlow linkao3(284278) - Harry decides to raise Tom right. I really like this one because it doesn't downplay the fact that Tom's mentally disturbed but still shows him as capable of moral behavior. Off the top of my head, there's a scene from Tom's POV where he wonders what would happen if he poked out Harry's eye with a stick, but resists the impulse because he doesn't want Harry to stop giving him a home. A messed up kid who nonetheless learns to make good decisions.

/In the Bleak Midwinter/ by TheLoud linkao3(15430560) - Hermione time travels to bring newborn Tom to his father's family. Tom Sr. decides that his son deserves the best and sets out to transition the Riddle family from Muggle nobility to Wizarding nobility - yes, even though he's a Muggle.

/Anonymous Letters/ by JayGwen23 linkao3(18707485) - Harry gets letters from his soul mate! Which is great, until he realizes that the spell is sending the letters across time as well as space.

/You Asked If I Were Happy/ by local_doom_void linkao3(22008067) - Tom decides that all that dark lord hoopla was too much trouble. Let "Voldemort" stay dead, Tom's going back to his original dream of teaching DADA. How hard can it be to avoid 12yo Harry Potter?

  When Albus Dumbledore visits Wool's Orphanage and sees the terror and rage in Tom Riddle, he decides he cannot leave the boy without a mentor. On the one hand, he may never make a Light wizard of him; on the other hand, he will keep him from going down the path of the Dark.

  Young Tom Riddle watches Dumbledore set his wardrobe on fire and thinks it's the coolest thing ever. From that point on, Tom only wishes to become a man as great as his Professor. Dumbledore really, really doesn't know how to deal with the little psycho kid following him around. Series of short drabbles and snippets into the life of Tom Riddle, star pupil, future Transfigurations master, and president of the Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore Fan Club (the APWBDFC, for short).

** My heart is a fist of barbed wire linkao3(18224369) starts in the orphanage, where Tom is not the only magical child. There's a sequel in progress, which may not have been necessary, but Barbed Wire is a must-read.

I'll second [[/u/RookRider][u/RookRider]]'s recommendation of In The Bleak Midwinter, which hasn't updated in almost a year.

Ouroboros linkao3(24476011) is a Voldemort raises himself fic which is also quite good. Recently updated.

There Is Nothing To Fear linkao3(15449145) is a Gryffindor Voldemort. Well-written and updates fairly frequently.

Twelve Dark Moons linkffn(3037156) is Voldemort/Luna, and focuses on the latter. Contains sexual violence.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** Surrogate by 17734 is the be-all, end-all Voldemort fic in my opinion. Canon, follows the events of mainly the last book but with flashbacks. It's Bellamort; I think Voldemort is more interesting in a story without Harry as the main focus.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

** My favorite is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2948785/1/][Carpe Diem]]. It is Hermione/Tom and one of the best fanfiction I have ever read. Definitely recommend!
