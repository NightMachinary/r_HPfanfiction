Meanwhile, Daphne Greengrass is faced with an unusual solution that involves the Boy-Who-Lived, but could be more trouble than it's worth. And in the end, there is always a price to be paid for everything. HP/DG Contract, 6-7th year

*** Has this been finished? I started reading it about a year ago but the writing was so unnecessarily complicated and the story itself dragged so much that i never completed it.

*** This is a good story but could have been great if the author had a beta reader who was prepared to tell him to cut out about 50% of the words. Or more. So much introspection and dancing around. Character development is always important but here we get the characters developed and they keep doing the same things in the same amount of detail. I seem to recall one scheme taking around five long chapters to develop then end in a scene the author actually said wasn't very good.
