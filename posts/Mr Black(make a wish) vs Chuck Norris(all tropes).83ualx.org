I thought this would be a fun little thing. Mr Blacks abilities are everything mentioned in the story including what everyone believes. All Chuck Norris tropes are his abilities.

Starts in england.

Thanks,

Warryn.


** The problem is that Chuck Norris already had an... Accident, so this, sadly, can't happen.

*** No what would happen is Mr. Black and Chuck Norris would pass each other on the street, tip their hats to each other, and continue on as all the Nazi's, murderers and rapists died in a 500 mile radius.

*** It can still happen. This is trope Chuck Norris, not regular Chuck Norris.

Thanks,
