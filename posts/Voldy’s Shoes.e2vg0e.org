Voldy : “wormtail! I'd like to go for a walk around little hangleton, fetch me my shoes wormtail!”

Wormtail: “my, my lord... you don't have any shoes”

Voldy: “why must you be so useless wormtail!? You didn't ever stop to think that when I returned to my body I'd need a few things. I told you I'm a size 9 and a half!”

Wormtail: “p-p-please my lord, forgive me. I merely thought you were referring to your wand length when you told me that. I-I-I'll...”

Voldy: “Wand length! How could you be so stupid and worthless? I'll show you wand length, Arvada Kedavra!”

*Voldy bends down and takes wormtails shoes off his feet and puts them on himself

Voldy: “yes now that feels right. Damn Tom, back at it again with the white vans.”
