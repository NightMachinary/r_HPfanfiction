I getting tired of reading any Protagonist related too the main trio. Do you have any recommendations.


** Well this is confusing, expect S-I or OCs aren't all of JKR's character related to the main Trio at some point into her story?

Or are you seeking fiction where character like Blaise, Theodore, Cedric (this 3 are just here for the example)would be main character?
