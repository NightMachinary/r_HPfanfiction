Justin time for the marauders to start a year at Hogwarts it took a few years for the teenagers to really become interested in the fad right around the time they started getting girlfriends and making.

​

new friends sending a friend a manager of yourself about the size a miniature of yourself about the size of a pocket watch with a golden frame and cover on it just for them to pop it open wondering why you sent them a time piece just to have havePortrait of yourself start swearing at them over the breakfast table many a young wizard was grounded for a week or more over summer vacation when the portraits started circulating. There are only so many times someone can hear by Merlin's hairy ball sack over their morning coffee before instinctively acting as a parent and confiscating a painting and grounding their child for no reason and not asking for an explanation it was an instinct for some before others figured out what was going on and left lifting the punishment laughed and lifted the punishment

​

The miniature enchanted talking portrait that was fully sentient became quite popular when James was in his seventh year so naturally he decided to commemorate Lily finally agreeing to go out with him by having a painting commission from one of the raven claw seven years years seventh years but not just him and his girlfriend finally he had a small painting about the size of a standard pocket watch fully in chanted the fee was exorbitant that was charged But he paid it gladly James Potter set for a painting with his girlfriend on a Sunday a magical photograph was taken so that the raven claw artist could refer back to it and then they provided their blood and adults of their magic to keep the painting going for centuries and the following Monday James roped in serious and Remus Peter was mysteriously ill that day so he wasn't in the portrait but dutifully the three marauder sat playing a game of Mago poker in the fan at Mago poker but he paid it gladly James Potter set for a painting with his girlfriend on a Sunday a magical photograph was taken so that the raven claw artist could refer back to it and then they provided their blood and a dose of their magic to keep the painting going for centuries and the following Monday James roped in serious and Remus Peter was mysteriously ill that day so he wasn't in the portrait but dutifully the three marauder sat playing a game of Muggle poker in the fan at Mago pokerIn the manner of a rather iconic painting of dogs in the same position serious found it fascinating so to humor him they sat in a similar position actually playing the game while a photograph was taken and then the painting started by the raven claw again the four boys provided drops of blood loss of their hair and a healthy dose of magic before adding a few more charms similar to that of the map allowing the paintings to be fully sentient with all of their personality in tact James and Lily had done the same thing after James had told her about the map.

​

What James didn't anticipate was the time it would take to fully with the enchantments nearly 2 years after that before he got his watch in the mail from Rupert the Ravenclaw who had fled to France after graduation he was a half blood and nervous about well Voldemort honestly and James couldn't blame him it was just in time for Lilly to tell him they were going to have a baby and instead of carrying the watch with him James put it inside Harry's favorite teddy bear some thing he helped the boy would still have if things didn't work out as he hoped James James and James enchanted the casing of the portrait miniature that it was to glowworm and start speaking

​

Eventually at Junior whenever harry needed comfort should the worst happen it was another 15 months before they went into hiding and another seven before the worst imaginable happened Henry lost his parents and somehow the teddy bear made it into the hands of Hagrid and was delivered with hairy in the basket wrap In the blanket to privet Drive the bear was remarkably clean for the ordeal it had accompanied its owner through and petunia didn't toss it it was the one remnant Harry had of his parents James his magic had grown a little week after not being renewed he had other things going on like keeping his child alive so it was faint and nearly a decade before the portrait finally started speaking to Harry Potter through the bear scared the boy like nothingElse ever had at about 3 AM on a Wednesday after he had been locked in his cupboard without dinner for accidentally turning his teachers hair blue during class

​

An hour or two later eventually it petunia brought him a plate they were angry when magic happened but they weren't going to withhold the boys meal that would get people talking and they were concerned about the neighbors opinion if a teacher heard hairy stomach growling that would cause questions to be raised so she fed him out of obligation and to avoid scandal thankfully the portrait remained silent inside the bear until reluctantly when it started speaking again hairy tore it open his letter arrived the next Morning in the post and uncle Vernon destroyed it but Harry had some thing or someone to talk to about it his father well the 18-year-old version of his father who happily informed him that was his Hogwarts letter and hairy learned about magic talking to a miniature painting the size of a pocket watch his father his mother and his father's two best friends Remus and serious that was how Harry Potter learned about magic in the cupboard under the stairs whispering quietly to a painting he kept in his right hand hand When he was dragged to the island a few weeks later after the owls never stopped coming he knew what was going to happen and well he couldn't help but grin he was a wizard his father had told him and he wasn't going crazy when he showed the pocket watch to Hagrid the game keeper grand and told him about the talking portraits at Hogwarts and that was quite normal the game keepers even had a conversation with his father and his friends Though he was strangely stony towards the teenage serious serious and after about a beer or two before he took her shopping he got an explanation how are you got a lot of information that day Henry got a lot of information that day specifically the fact he had a godfather that was in prison for trying to help a dark Lord kill him kill him.

​

He couldn't help it he told the painting about it and well there was a great deal of debate among the four of the inhabitants in the watch for nearly 3 hours before they settled on the opinion there was no way pad foot would do that and hairy listen to stories about them running with werewolves Remus and the fact they were friends brothers and would never betray one another it was a strange bit of knowledge and then his father started telling him about Quidditch And Lily started teaching him the basics of potions after he do to fully read off his first year book list and then she asked where his starter books were and he shrugged that made him stop for a moment and ask Hagrid what a starter book was the game keeper dutifully took him back even if the man was a little intoxicated at this point to flourish and blossom where the Muggle born starter books were the things that explained everything from Magical customs such as what a pure blood and a Muggle born where exactly what the ministry of magic was the basic rules and regulations associated with being an underage wizard and the basic principles students needed to know about wand movement potion ingredients and things like the flu Netwerk they were helpful pieces of literature and Harry read them cover to cover three times over before memorizing them and asking any questions he had of the small portrait most of which they could answer though they had no idea exactly why New Zealand was so explosive
