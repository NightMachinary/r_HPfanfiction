I've started writing a story about Sirius in the five days surrounding the death of Lily and James. It starts with him in Azkaban on the brink of complete madness, thinking James is there.

I'm just really stuck for a title. Any suggestions?

EDIT: Thanks for everyone's suggestions! They were all very good but I decided on The Unwelcome Friend, suggested by [[/u/wordhammer]]. The prologue of the story is now up if anyone wants to read it: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11610295/1/The-Unwelcome-Friend]]


** - A cold, empty laugh\\
- Guilty of Murder by Trust\\
- The Unwelcome Friend\\
- Last Days til Madness
- (The Competition for) Sirius' Worst Memory
