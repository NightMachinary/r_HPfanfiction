I'm looking for a story I read a while ago, where Harry and company start a secret organization and create secret identities for themselves (so like Harry had a disguise as a man with a gray goatee I believe). They set up a large network of informants using fake names so Hagrid was one of the first and his name was little john I think. Any help would be great I'd love to find it again.
