Loathe to pollute the post with television references but would you like the idea of a miniseries set during the Marauders era or between the Marauders leaving Hogwarts and Harry's first year?

I really think it could be great without necessarily hitting too many 'gritty reboot' tropes. I would do anything to see Snape in his years of bitterness and split between the Death Eaters and the Order.

Thoughts?

** Do you mean a TV show miniseries, or a written story miniseries style? If TV, then definitely yes! but it needs to be well done.

If written then the question I guess is: What are you envisioning with 'miniseries'? Are you thinking like exploring different characters development, switching POVs? So having a chapter featuring Snape, one about the marauders, maybe one from Voldemort's perspective, and then kinda jumping between the story lines/POVs of each character as you tell broader story of the First War. I think that could be really really good.

Otherwise just an exploration of Snape's and Mauraders Choices post Hogwarts would interesting. Something which really examines the motives and conflict behind Snape and Pettigrew's choices. Preferably going more complex than simply Snape is bullied and feels alone so he joins death eaters and then all the sudden once he hears the the prophecy he wants to save lily so he goes to the 'light side'.
