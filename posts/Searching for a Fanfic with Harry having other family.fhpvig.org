I'm searching for a Harry Potter Fanfic where he finds out that he isn't the only Potter alive, that he is the Heir to the Potter Family and visits his other family members, which are shocked to find out that Harry didn't know anything about them or the Lordship and so on. They activate a time bubble and he turns his hearing around. If I remember correctly, then people think of him as Charlus Potter, who was called the dragon or sth similar >.<


** Found it, it's called "The Power of the Potters"
