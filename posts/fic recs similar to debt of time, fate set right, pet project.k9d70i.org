basically when hermione goes back in time to the marauders era and is paired with a marauder or Severus. I like suuuper long fics, the longer the better. Intricate plot, characterization, etc. would prefer smut but if the storyline is incredible, ig it's not a requirement.

** I have a bunch of these. Not quite Debt of Time quality but some are quite good:

Iacta Alea Est: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11491209/chapters/25775856]]

Time Mutable Immutable: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17960324/chapters/42418760]]

Hero of the Story: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24720655/chapters/59754481]]

And Shayalonnie who wrote Debt of Tine has a couple more in the same vein. Not sure if you've read Storm of Yesterday [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8850352/chapters/20295151]] or the WIP A Bit of Sky. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8851603/chapters/20298481]]

That's all I can think of for now but I probably have more. I had a big HG time travel stories phase.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12021318/1/]] very similar premise to debt of time, not as long by half but it's a good one
