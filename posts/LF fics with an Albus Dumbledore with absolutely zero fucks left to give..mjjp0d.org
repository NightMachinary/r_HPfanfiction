Because he's over a century old, seen the rise and fall of at least two major dark wizards, had his dream of guiding whole generations of eager schoolchildren in their learning ground into dust at the reality of just how lazy all those snot-nosed little shits are, and is one letter begging for dick-holding levels of guidance from Fudge away from packing it all in and moving to the Bahamas.


** Hmm, I've never personally read it but I see this fic recommended a lot where Albus tells the Ministry to fuck off and then he fucks off around the world with Harry. It's called Albus's World Trip or something.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** In [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1344133][The Scrambled Sorting Saga]], Dumbledore just wants everyone to do their own jobs without hand-holding so he can have free time to do what he loves: using his connection to the school wards to appear next to rule-breakers and mess with them.

#+begin_quote
  Penelope Clearwater walked briskly through the halls of Hogwarts, dragging her boyfriend-in-denial behind her (because no matter how much Percy argued about professionalism, their continued trysts definitely implied a relationship between the two). Her current destination was a broom closet on the fifth floor that was (in)famous for holding silencing and notice-me-not charms better than other closets. It was the perfect place for snogging and other activities popular among amorous couples.

  “Really, Penelope,” Percy argued, “we're prefects. We have a duty to set a higher standard for the other students to follow. Engaging in such activities is inappropriate.”

  “If you'd rather go back to studying for your O.W.L.s, then I won't stop you.” Penelope released his hand and walked around the corner to where the broom closet lay. As soon as she turned the corner, she heard the sound of Percy following after her.

  Ha. Score one for Penelope.

  Penelope opened the closet's door, and nearly fell over backwards when doing so led to her being face-to-face with the headmaster.

  “Hello, Miss Clearwater.” He said in his usual bemused and grandfatherly tone. “And Mister Weasley as well! How are you two doing on this fine Christmas day?”

  “We're, um, fine.” She stammered. “What are you doing in the closet, sir?”

  Dumbledore's eyes twinkled as he replied. “Coming out of the closet is often an ordeal, Miss Clearwater, especially to someone as visible in the public eye as myself. It also invites a lot of scrutiny into affairs that one may prefer to keep quiet.”

  Penelope got the impression that she was missing something. “Are you going to come out of the closet, sir?” She asked.

  “Why, who's to say I haven't already, dear girl? Just because you don't know about something doesn't mean that it's not a matter of public record. I find that when one neither hides the truth, nor advertises it, the public tends to be most willing to overlook it.”

  She was definitely missing something. “You're very clearly still inside the closet, sir.”

  “Oh, the broom closet!” He exclaimed. “Not the metaphorical closet! Yes, it's amazing how one can find oneself in the most unlikely of places. Though, sometimes, being in the most unlikely of places is exactly what you may need, even if you don't know it.”

  All right, then. “I'll... I'll keep that in mind, sir.”

  His eyes twinkled again. “See that you do, Miss Clearwater. Now, my presence is required elsewhere, so I shall wish the two of you a splendid afternoon, then be on my way. Farewell!”

  As Penelope watched the headmaster's retreating form, she called out to Percy. “Well that was a mood killer.”

  A few comedic one shots of a gangster-esque Dumbledore dealing with Harry's bullshit.

** Depends really, a good portion of HP fanfiction involves dumbledor with absolutely no fucks to give beyond cliche "fur dah grater gud" and "snape is nut aboosiv, you just stoopid". Nowadays, it's hard to find a non cloche ridden HP fanfic.

*** Well I'd like to avoid cliches like that, maybe even with Dumbledore going so far as to say "Of course Snape's an abusive little turd. He got shat on by life and now that he has the tiniest scrap of power over others he's going to turn around and shit on anyone and everyone he can get away with. The only reason he gets away with behaviour like that is because fuckwits like Lucius Malfoy didn't have the balls to admit how much of a bigoted shitstain they are to the public, and we need them and their slimly little sprogs to think that Snape is still one of theirs should Voldemort ever make a return. I at least respect Bellatrix Lestrange for not trying to beg off her loathsome behaviour by claiming to be under the Imperius, she owned it."
