In which Dumbledore is keeping Harry under control through countless tracking charms and wards that sap his power, so Hermione does some sort of ritual in her home that very very painfully removes them all. When Dumbledore realizes Harry slipped he sends the order to search for him, but Harry manages to convince Tonks and Lupin (the ones who actually find him) not to tell Dumbledore where he is. I hope that's enough to get results.
