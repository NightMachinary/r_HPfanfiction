:END:
I'm looking for a rated M fanfiction where Lily survives the attack at Godric's hollow while James and Harry do not. She's given to Snape and when she realizes she's pregnant with James' baby, she sleeps with Snape to make him think the baby is his. Some things I remember from the fanfiction are:

1. Her duelling with Bellatrix to prove her worth once Voldemort finds out she's pregnant
2. Darian is her baby's name (not 100% sure)
3. Snape wants to get her pregnant later on in the story
4. Sirius and Dumbledore suggest she sleeps with Sirius to make sure she doesn't have to give birth to a child who's "dark". But she refuses.
5. She gives birth to a girl named Darla (not 100% sure)
6. Not 100% sure about this either but I think there's a time gap in the story because she ends up being knocked out for a couple of years.
7. Snape eventually ends up turning on Voldemort
