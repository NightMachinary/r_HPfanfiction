Just read enveloped in darkness by brigade. And it was great! Do y'all know of other well written stories with a similar plot? Also, please something without slash!


** There's Prince of the Dark Kingdom, in which Voldie actually wins the war back in '81. Theres a bunch of politics and awesome world building and blurring of good and evil. It's pretty long, and whether thats good or not depends on the person I guess. It's not exactly Harry joins Voldemort, but theres a great interaction between them, and a very good character development for Voldie: he's not just "evil dark wizard", he's "evil dark wizard and also all these other things because". Very fun read.

I've read lots of really dark Harry stories and this one will always be my favorite. Circumstances make Harry really dark and evil... yet at the same time he's human you can't help but feel sorry for him.

Harry has a snake familiar named Lutain, and though I usually hate OCs, Lutain was so well done it feels odd to read the original HP without him.

He gets adopted by Voldemort because he reminded him of himself... and Harry in this story is pretty much just like Tom Riddle.

It raises interesting questions about nature vs. nurture.

The best part about it is that it's finished and wraps up pretty well. Something rare in long fanfictions.

**** The writer was super young at the beginning ... actually 12 years old I think, but everyone was shocked when the writer revealed that. The begining is super forced and the author admits that it's the biggest plot hole in the story, but the writing does impove a lot.

I was actually 14 when first reading it, so I guess I'm a little nostalgic about this story, but it's still the most enjoyable evil Harry story I've ever read.

He doesn't actually feel sympathetic to Voldemort, but joins the Death Eaters anyway.

** I enjoyed these two stories, both without slash:

Friend or Foe by Niger Aquila (you should read the prequel Learn from History first, but it's not a long story) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2044600/1/Friend-or-Foe]]

The Darkness Within by clen3k [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2372109/11/The-Darkness-Within]]

** None of these are slash, I hate slash with a passion. Most of these aren't great stories, but they're ok. The stories aren't exactly what you're asking for, but they're all interesting reads.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2538955/1/Time-to-Spare][Time To Spare]]- The only decent story I've read with Harry and Draco. They get sent back in time and Harry winds up infiltrating the Death Eaters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite][Fate's Favourite]]- Worth reading just for Tom and Harry's weird relationship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186430/1/Thunderstorm][Thunderstorm]]- Ok, not quite what you're asking for, but how could I resist reccing a story that has Harry/femVol. fighting Voldemort and is actually good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land][Stranger In An Unholy Land]]- A classic, but I don't think it's aged all that well.

**** There are some stories that when you first read them, you think they're great, but when you go back to them a couple of years later, they don't seem that good.

This could be because your tastes as a reader have changed or that the story is riddled with cliches. An example is 'the shopping scene'. I'm sure you've read stories where Harry goes shopping and gets an expandable trunk and a bunch of other items. It's been in so many stories it's become boring.

Stranger in an unholy land probably has a lot of these cliches because it probably started some of them and other people borrowed from it. But going back to it now after reading so many stories, it doesn't seem to stand out. So many stories borrowed from it that it's become ordinary. It hasn't 'aged' well.

I know that sounds kind of confusing, but it's the best way I can explain it.

***** No, I follow what you are saying. Most of the aspects that made stranger unique and novel, are now common place.
