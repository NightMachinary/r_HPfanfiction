Let's say, for the sake of argument, that muggles do actually know about magicals, because magicals are so behind on tech, and the producers of various TV networks realize just showing footage of magicals doing magical stuff makes for great ratings, so they've secretly planted cameras everywhere, and most magicals don't even notice it.

To take it further, sometime in the future, after the events of /Deathly Hallows/, muggles decide to create reality competition shows that only feature magicals, and magicals have to sign a non-disclosure agreement to never inform the obliviators in order to participate for the chance of real fame and money.


** This is the true story...of seven witches & wizards...picked to live in a house...and have their lives taped...to find out what happens...when people stop being polite...and start getting real.../The Real World: Post-Hogwarts./

Starring: Cormac McLaggen, Romilda Vane, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Luna Lovegood, Gregory Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson

ETA: that's only six, who else would make for good reality TV, idk, if Lavender Brown survived I would def pick her lmao

Can you imagine the drama? Can you imagine the ratings?

*** And you know this is totally going to spin off into /The Challenge: Magical & Muggles/, a series where every person from /The Real World: Post-Hogwarts/ gets paired with somebody from the regular /The Challenge/ or /Road Rules/ cast.

I'm already imaging Abram Boise being paired with Luna Lovegood and the amount of insanity that would entail, or Justin Finch-Fletchley having to deal with Veronica Portillo and just how that dynamic would play out.

*** I'd add Terry Boot, Blaise Zabini, or Marietta Edgecombe tbh. The former two because Cormac needs another stuckup bastard to fight with and Edgecombe because the post-betrayal tensions would be interesting.

**** Ahhh I forgot about Marietta hahaha! I feel bad leaving Luna in this shitshow so we'll swap Edgecombe out for her. I also think Zabini would bring more quality drama so I substitute him for Goyle

** What if it's like that episode of Stargate SG-1, where they make a TV show about what the Stargate Program, to add a layer of skepticism if leaks happened, rumors, speculation, etc.
