I am a big fan of Harry Potter the geek and I was looking for another like it. My favorite part about it is the use of technology in it never mind its humor. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9807593/1/Harry-Potter-the-Geek][Harry Potter The Geek]]


** I haven't read this fanfic, but based on the name, you might like Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. HPMOR.com

**** There's a few HPMOR continuation fics over at [[/r/hpmor]], although I've not read any, that might be nearer to HP the Geek, based on the authors.

**** Yeah, if ever there was an example of the problems of judging a book by its cover it would be [[/u/A_FluteBoy]] 's assumption of what Harry Potter the Geek is like.
