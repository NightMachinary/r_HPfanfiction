** A lot of people love [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][*The First Day* by Little0Bird]] for canon pairings. Especially because it picks up RIGHT after the battle at the end of DH. Personally it isn't my favorite because the author doesn't put chapter breaks in the right places (ever?) but it is well written and although depressing is probably pretty accurate head canon.

Right now everyone on this sub, myself included, are LOVING [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7737991][*Put Your Guns Away It's Teatime*]] and the sequel that is a WIP [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7882474/chapters/18003613][*Put Your Curse in Reverse*]] by Frombluetored. The are not only canon pairings but CC compliant fics. The twist is that there is an Albus/Scorpius relationship, but even that is CC compliant with how she did it and so well done (even if youre not huge on slash - it isnt graphic at all).

These fics are SOOO good - the author writes their family dynamics and banter perfectly - and it's updated every couple days which is amazing. Idk how she does it. I highly recommend them! Linkao3(7882474), linkao3(7737991)

*** Little0Bird has the same problem as me when it comes to breaks - sometimes they take, sometimes they don't, and I can't work out what exactly I'm doing differently from chapter to chapter. Stupid ff.net.

I second all these recs though, you beat me to it!

I would also recommend Northumbrian - he's got LOADS of stories, all canon.

Seconding the Northumbrian recommendation. He's basically our Lord and Savior of Canon Compliance.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  Scorpius Malfoy knew his fifth year would be challenging-- but he hadn't expected this. Between his impending O.W.L.s, his new relationship, Quidditch tryouts, the public eye, and the Slug Club, he can hardly catch his breath. Meanwhile, Harry Potter discovers that being a professor at Hogwarts is very different from being a student there-- especially when you've got three mischievous children and a handful of students who can't seem to do more than ogle at you.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
