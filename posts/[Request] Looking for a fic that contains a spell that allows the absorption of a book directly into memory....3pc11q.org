Really, I'd like to read other books like that (so if you know any feel free to share) but I'm looking for a specific one I've been unable to find

Starts off at.. the end of 4th, or 5th year, beginning of Summer, the Dursley's beat Harry badly and abandon the house leaving Harry in dire straights. he ends up getting most of it healed but for a leg that winds up with a rather bad limp, finds the cave sirus had holed up in that's near Hogwarts, and finds that it contains a whole apartment behind a secret passageway.

In it, tons of books including one that had the book absorbing spell, or it might have been a spell that lets you read faster or have a better memory, something like that.

*** Yep, pretty sure you're right, though I'll have to read more of it to be sure that's no hardship, thank you very much.

Edit: Yep that's it, not quite as good as I hoped but better than I feared.

** I don't know the name of the story you're talking about, but the absorption of knowledge is a common trait in stories that revolve around game-mechanics/RPG-elements.

The name of the ability is more often than not "scholar's touch", which might help you in your search (if your fic is one of those that use this term).

Example: 'Harry Potter and the natural 20' uses this concept

** Sounds like yet another massive unearned powerup spell or magical paradigm that for some reason only the protagonist ever gets to use.
