:END:
Hi! I'm looking for a fanfiction that has disappeared from my kindle. I remember that when Harry arrived at the train station, he talked with Dumbledore but instead of coming back, he choses to eat the horcrux. Then he gets to grow up with Tom Riddle since he was a toddler, but in the end it was all a lie from the horcrux. Does anyone know the name of it?

**** Yep. But it was a metaphysical kind of stuff. I don't remember what Harry and Dumbledore talked about, but Harry got the impression, if I'm not mistaken, that the only way to save the horcrux was to take it back again. And he wanted to save it, for his saving-people-thing. Dumbledore warned him not to do it though. In the end he can't save the horcrux anyway and comes back to reality. It was one of the most mind blowing fanfictions for sure
