** I posted once that the wizarding world itself is an SCP containment of magic using humans. The whole planet is a trueman show level containment procedure and their secular society is due to deliberate social manipulation to have them self-imprisoned.

**** Okay, so SCP is the name of a game that has a community of fans that write stories and draw pictures and whatnot about the canon; and the community has decided that all the fanon IS canon, so expand apon it to your hearts content? Interesting.

I'd describe it as an Omniverse of canon thats identity is set by the public (much like the fanon of everything else). It's based around a world where artifacts or creatures appear from somewhere Beyond and there are multiple groups with different interests in containing that stuff. Defense or Profit and so on.

Okay. But tell me, what does SCP stand for? The wiki didn't tell me at a passing glance. It told be that these creatures and whatnot are Called SCPs, and so are the fan made stories, but what does SCP actually MEAN?

***** Mostly yes, except for one thing. SCP was originally a single creepypasta (from 4chan actually, iirc) about the containment of some supernatural monster, then it spawned more of the same type, which then got codified at scp-wiki.net. The game was a fan-game of this site, taking place within the "SCP foundation", which is the name of the institute, where "scp" stands for secure-contain-protect. Aside from that if you're interested I think the best way to understand it is to check out the entries in [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/heritage-collection-arc][this page]] since they're the ones "everyone" agrees on and are the most famous.
