** Omg what's the drama? That was the first fix I ever read (probably like 10 years ago at this point) and it's always held a special place in my heart.

***** Crazy I know, it's a pretty dark fic and the characters get diverted from canon quickly, but it's an enjoyable read overall!

****** I am new to the fic scene in general and so far there have been very few fics I really liked or loved and one of them is mine :/ heard a lot about this one because I specifically looked for 7th year fics but the negative criticisms turned me off to it, NOW I'm curious though.
