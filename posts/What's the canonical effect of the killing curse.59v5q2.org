What I mean is, does it remove the soul, or does it just stop the heart and brain and stuff? Just wondering because I'm planning some Halloween crossovers and wondering if it would impact Jason Voorhees or not?


** The Killing Curse takes things that /can/ die, but are not yet dead, and makes them dead without a mark or other identifiable cause of dead. It's literally a "drop dead" curse.

*** This. There's no indication that the Killing Curse, or magic in general for that matter, works through a physical medium to bring about its result.

Personally the way I think of it is like set theory. It moves you out of the set of the living and into the set of the dead.

** A different way to look at this: what is Jason Voorhees? At one time he was a mentally-deficient boy but he has gone through a number of metaphysical changes in the course of series. Consistently, his body is reanimated by the application of electricity or other mojo. His purpose is to kill humans who sin near his lake (or wherever he happens to be). He appears to regenerate and has escaped permanent death by not allowing his body to be burned down to ash.

My take: his body is an uber-inferi/horcrux being possessed by the restless spirit of the dim kid who used to own it. The reason muggles have such a problem shutting him down is that the body is just a vessel; it's the spirit that needs to be dealt with.

EDIT: [forgot the conclusion] So if Jason's a horcrux made from an animated corpse and you shot a Killing Curse at him, the result would be similar to what happens when it's used on other non-living horcruxes- he's damaged, but will repair.

** The dementor's kiss will remove your soul but not kill your body. The Killing Curse kills you. This points toward the Killing Curse having a somewhat different mechanism than removing or destroying your soul.

The Killing Curse also works on muggles, so it isn't just separating your body from your magic, presumably -- unless muggles have magic just to keep them alive, which would be a moderately novel interpretation.

It also blasts moderate sized chunks in marble, as I recall, so if it doesn't kill him, it should punch a hole in him.

** Here is what we know:

- The curse is powered by hate and malice and a conviction that you want to kill the recipient
- If the killing curse touches something it dies with no visible marks
- It is blocked by any object
- The magical statue in the ministry isn't even marked by it
- The curse transfers no kinetic energy unless you're in the movie universe where the rules of magic are somehow even more inconsistent
- The curse isn't blocked by clothes for some reason

**** Except that magic doesn't automatically screw with electronics. A spell or accidental magic can, but nothing about magic is inherently disruptive to electronics.

/Hogwarts/ has issues with electronics, and my theory is that the kids' accidental magic residue soaked into the walls has a lot to do with it. Also, the spells that make the school Unplottable might seriously affect the ability of radio signals to breach its borders.

** I think it affects the target's body. If it attacked the soul then the results would be the same as we see from a dementor's kiss which leaves a living but 'empty' body. More specifically, I see it as being the opposite of a healing spell. Where a healing spell causes the body to repair and regenerate, the killing curse would cause the body to simply cease functioning akin to a sort of instant full-body apoptosis (programmed cell death), leaving a dead body with no obvious cause of death (or even necrosis, which is the likely effect of the withering curse that took Dumbledore's hand) and no chance of resuscitation. It would necessarily have to be powerful and dark in order to overwhelm the target's magic's and body's resistance. This comes from Crouch!Moody's statement that it needs a certain amount of power behind it and desire to mercilessly kill the target (as an Unforgivable you have to mean it, which is what makes it so much worse than killing with say, a reducto to the face) to get it to do more than cause a nosebleed in a person as compared to his casual dispatching of the spider which we could assume would be much easier to overwhelm on both accounts.

I think the killing curse's unblockability aspect comes from its function of overwhelming the target's magic, and thus if properly cast then no magical barrier could stop it, though there by be more to it than just a power battle such as the exact make-up of the spell and the fact that it's dark magic somehow making magically blocking it more difficult.

While the presentation of what sorts of physical objects are able to stop it is a tad inconsistent, figuring that out really just comes down to how magic in general interacts with physical objects in whatever magic system you're using which can be approached in several different ways and may vary by type of spell. Things to consider include: Does density matter? Does that material matter? Does physical contact matter? Does the power/type of the spell matter?

As for how it affects Jason Voorhees, I would say not at all. He's essentially some type of undead. You'd likely have better luck stopping him with some sort of exorcism-type spell. Or permanently seal him away somehow. Or feed him to a dementor. Or fiendfyre.

** As far as we know, the only canon effect known to it is that it causes the target to die as if the body simply stopped functioning in an instant and that is it. /Any-/ and /everything/ more about it is either pure speculation of an author or done as an AU thing and thus their own interpretation rather than this exact spell.

That said, my personal interpretation (which I will not pretend to be canon *because canon it is not*, but which you might or might not use if it suits your fancy as crossovers tend to be AU to some degree either way) is that the killing curse is basically a (relatively) big piece of raw magic corrupted by the caster's malice and with their intent to /murder/ the target, to make them dead with their own hands (or wand, I suppose), attached to it; such a spell would work by overpowering the magic of the target---which would not be hard unless it was a near-squib casting at Dumbledore or close to that, and obviously the muggles have no defence against it because they have no magic or close to it---and then executing the command given to it by the intent, as if it were the target's accidental magic. Obviously, it is just my interpretation and really nothing more than a speculation as far as canon goes, but it does fulfil the requirements present in canon for the spell (requiring some power, requiring intent to really use it, and being something that gets easier as you use it more because in using it you become more accustomed to being malicious), and it could work for the other two of the unforgivables if you changed the intent to /murder/ to intent to /torture/ or /enslave/ while simultaneously giving a reason why those three spells are considered their own category of bad.

Edit: I guess, with my take on it, whether or not it would work on the smiley machete guy depends on whether or not he is considered “alive” by magic, so you could go both ways.

*** I think my favorite fan-explanation for the Killing Curse was that in order to use it, you must first kill someone without using any magic. The thought being that only a soul already corrupted can cast a murdering curse. I forget which fic used that explanation, though.

** News reports indicate that people died with no detectable cause. When an animated statue stepped in the way of one heading for Harry, the spell deflected off its chest. Later in the same battle Voldemort cast one at the galloping centaur statue and it blew apart entirely.

End result: if Jason is targeted and considered an animated corpse, it'll probably affect him like a Reducto... except not.
