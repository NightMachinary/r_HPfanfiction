I'm looking for a specific story that I read years ago on recommendation from a friend, and I can't find it anywhere. I remember specifically that it emphasized how Harry was abused by his relatives, and he ends up getting stuck with Snape for the summer.

He expects that to be just as bad, if not worse, but they end up bonding some after Snape realizes that Harry had it far worse with his relatives than Snape had ever realized. For example, Harry expects to be sent to bed without food as punishment, and Snape is horrified that muggles would do that to a magical child.

Any help on this would be appreciated!

  One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FOUR MILLION HITS!

*** I think that's it, thank you! I didn't remember it being a sequel, but reading through it, that story looks very familiar. Thank you again!

That's a one shot, 8k words. Sequel is a bit of a stretch.
