  Challenge response. The summer after Harry's fifth year he helps a local pensioner out of a tight spot. The man takes Harry under his wing and by the end of the summer Harry is invited to a party at the golf club of which his patron is the Managing Director. At the party Harry makes an unexpected discovery about the man's family.

Dude, what? Out of all the crazy stuff people write about in a world of magic with wizards, witches, goblins, veela, unicorns, people that turn into animals, a guy that splits his soul into 7 pieces, and forms of transportation that include stepping into a fireplace or toilet, the thing that bothers you is the legal limit for working in the UK?

**** I get where you're coming from.

However, those are the fantasy aspects of a magic fantasy book. You can warp reality and say "he could do that because magic", and I would nod my head in agreement, my suspension of belief appeased.

But, attention to detail in regards to the muggle aspects of Harry Potter. Which are essentially exactly the same as real life UK, is just being thorough.

***** Nowadays, yes. Back in the day, and certainly during the period Harry Potter is set, you could do something like 13 weeks 'casual' requiring pretty much zero paperwork, no NI number required, paid in cash. Did it myself, a lot, working on building sites, in restaurants, in warehouses and an assortment of office jobs, mostly clerking at solicitors' firms.

It has been tightened up /considerably/ since then - the modern zero hours contract being nearly the same thing with all of the advantages removed from the employee side - on the principle that systems that wide open to abuse are only for the rich.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.
