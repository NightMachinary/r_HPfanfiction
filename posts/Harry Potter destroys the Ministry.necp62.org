I'd like a fanfic in which Harry Potter gets sick of the Ministry and decided to completely and utterly destroy it because of its moronic incompetence and corruption.

Preferrably would like the fanfic to begin after Year 4 (as in Harry is angry at the Ministry because they still want to kill Sirius and they completely failed to accept that Voldemort returned) or during Year 5 (because of all the slander) or after Year 6 (because the Ministry caused him to lose one of the people he treasured most).

Either way, I want to see a fanfic where Harry gets fed up and breaks away from all the manipulations and starts his campaign to destroy the Ministry. Not just bring it down a notch, but completely replace it.

I'd like the fanfic to be complete or at least receive regular updates (the last update being no later than this month).

‚Äã

NO SLASH, minimum romance.


** Linkffn(Worthy of Magic) He doesn't destroy it in ‚ÄúI will make things better‚Äù sense but he ,literally, destroys it. Along with many other things...

It's definitely not what you have in mind but it fits the definition of Harry Potter destroys the Ministry xD

*** Fair warning: There's a touch of weeaboo in this fic.

For those who are interested about the Ministry's Destruction as per OP's request, Chapter 34 is when Harry basically brings armageddon. 35 to 36 tells what happened to the survivors afterwards. 37 is a timeskip and is where I dropped it due to the magic samurai thing.

***** Imo it's not so much weeaboo stuff as one OC from Japan has a cliche backstory involving a powerful katana. Overall it's not actually that important to the story and is easily skimmable.

** Linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts) Not quite the time period you're after (Set post 7th year) but a great fic that has Harry decide that the corruption/pure blooded thinking in the ministry will never change unless he forces it to.

** linkffn(Elune's Pebble)

It's a year five crossover. Harry gets new dragon friends, decides the Ministry isn't worth trying to reform. It updates every other Friday most of the time, though I haven't had a lot of writing time lately.

*** This is currently my favorite HP crossover. It's really great, Even a person like myself with limited knowledge on WoW understands this fic easily. I love the progression harry an co is going through power wise, instead of not gaining power or it being instant, it's a good pace. My only problem personally not with the story is that I'm too impatient lol. The build up for taking down the ministry is still on going at a decent pace and the future setups but uggghhhhhh I just want harry to curb stomp the ministry with badass magic and dragons üòÇüòÇ

*** I don't particularly enjoy crossovers, but this one says no prior knowledge of Warcraft is needed, so I'll give it a read. Although, what is Cursed!Dumbledore? Does this mean the fic includes that time where Dumbledore put on the ring and cursed himself to die?

**** It says no prior knowledge is needed but there are paragraphs and paragraphs and huge chunks of chapters that are just the author giving you the warcraft story. I like the idea but the most recent chapter I just scrolled through until I got to relevant action.

I wanted to read a story about the dragon friends in HP world. Not a story about HP in Warcraft world.

  HP/Warcraft crossover with no knowledge of Warcraft needed. Harry in his 5th year could have used a few friends with actual combat experience. A lot of folks on Azeroth during Cataclysm would have been better off anywhere else. If you think HP cannon needed more Dragons, this is the fic for you! Features HP/HG/? Ship and a Cursed!Dumbledore.

  Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.
