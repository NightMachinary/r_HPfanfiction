:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all! I know this is probably a long shot but here goes. I am looking for a fic that was recently removed from ff.net. It is a Harry Potter/SG1 crossover fic. It is over 60K in length. I can't find it on wayback even.

The premise of the story is that Harry leaves the UK to go to school in Colorado Springs. Meets Sam at the start. End up moving in together. Harry and Sam end up sharing knowledge. Both are badass. Also Sam gets magic powers and Hermione joins Harry in the US.

Any help would be appreciated.


** I don't suppose you have it saved in your favorites so we at least know the name to look for?
