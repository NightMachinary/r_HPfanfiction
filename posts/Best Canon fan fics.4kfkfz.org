** Not From Others, written by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] is a great canon-compliant fanfiction about Hogwarts under Voldemort's regime told from Ginny's point of view. Actually, calling it just canon compliant is an understatement. It ties beautifully into canon, picking up all the small hints we get in DH and bringing it to life in this wonderful story. A great strength of this story is characterization. Ginny was perfect, and everyone is in character. The OCs that appear are well-written too and fit well into the Harry Potter universe. The Battle of Hogwarts was outstanding, reading those three chapters was just devastating.

** The Strange Dissapearance of Sally-Anne Perks - simply beautiful elegance in scope of storytelling. All-but perfectly canon-compliant, and one of my favorite fics of all

Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity is probably the best next-generation fic around. His Alexandra Quick series is technically canon-compliant, but set far enough away that I'll not link it here. Great works, though.

The Very Secret Diary by Arabella is a canon-perspective story of what went on in Riddle's Diary, and a truly terrifying thriller.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
