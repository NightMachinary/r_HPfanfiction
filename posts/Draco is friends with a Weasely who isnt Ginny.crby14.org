Preferably the twins Ya I know its a weird friendship but i remember reading it once and liking the dynamic.

It can be any of them except Ginny ive already seen alot of Draco/Ginny friends and romance so someone else. I prefer it focus on the interactions of said Weasely and Draco so there can be like other friendships or like a romance with someone else but they less the focus.

Ive also read the Code series and really liked that Please no OC ships and no genderbending. Preferably complete but if not at least long.


** Plot twist : it's Charlie who molds Draco into a delightful little pyro

** Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

Draco and Ron eventually become best friends, although Draco is friends with all the Weasleys. He still doesn't use first names and calls them Weasley, She-Weasley, Weasley 1 and 2, Prefect Weasley,...

** Draco is friends with the twins in my story “A Slytherin Through Time”, but it's not the main focus... which would be on being friends with Neville, which I suppose is just as weird.
