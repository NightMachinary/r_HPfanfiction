** I made this google doc as an update to the one posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7ad92n/meta_based_on_the_request_in_a_different_post/?st=j9l5n2ss&sh=c3e29add][here]]. It has nicer formatting and extra info in case this would be better for wiki or sidebar

** I seriously think we should bar the top 25 from being recommended for a year, kinda like [[/r/music]] (as little good as it does there). Have a Hall of Fame for barred fics so that newer people can still find it, but make it so that fic request threads aren't so repetitive for anyone that's been around longer than 6 months.

*** I disagree, simply because people on mobile won't be able to see the sidebar on the right.

Unless you make a Hall of Fame thread sticky, not many people are going to bother with it.

**** We might as well sticky it then. Stuff like the character-centric fics usually get no discussion after the first day, anyway, so we might as well replace them with that.

*** Fixed, thanks. My database of FFN info was downloaded about 6 months ago, before the fic was finished.

*** Thanks, it's fixed now. I didn't have the info for crossovers downloaded, so I had to fill those in manually and just missed one.
