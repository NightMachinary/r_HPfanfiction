#+begin_quote
  "Long ago in a distant land, I, Voldemort, the snakespeaking Lord of Darkness, unleashed an unspeakable evil! But a foolish young wizard wielding a magic wand stepped forth to oppose me. Before the final blow was struck, I slipped him a vial of Draught of Living Death so that he woke up in the future, where my evil is law (and so is healthcare)! Now the fool seeks to return to the past, and undo the future that is Voldemort!"
