From what I can remember it was a Hermione/Severus fic but it centered around Hermione finding out the death eaters were going to rape virgins for some dark potion so behind Dumbledore's back she starts a coven of virgins from various houses, Pansy included I believe, and they work at raising their sexual energy until at the closing feast they do a ritual together that, er, breaks their hymens and...does something I can't remember. I do recall they keep the powerful blood they summoned in a vial for later healing use. I think she runs away to Muggle London after but I may be confusing it with another fic, in that I think she got some job as a night club singer until she was found but as I said, may have been another.


** Is it “the twenty” by Leyna Rountree? I'm on mobile and can't link but pretty sure that's the one you're looking for.
