For those unaware Fem-Bashing is what it sounds like it means to bash things for being feminine.

Now I mostly know of this term for it's use in LGBT community chats and discussions. But it does have its uses outside of that.

Now my question is basically do you think Rowling engaged in Fem bashing and do you think this leaks into the fandom and fanfiction and how characters are portrayed?


** Hard maybe. Fleur, Lavender, and Umbridge (yes) are the most girlish. One could say this is Harry, but Harry isn't the only one to mock divination nor is the biggest offender. There's also Fleur being the one unable to handle the grindylows and her overall place in the tournament. Umbridge, the villain, loves pink and is a simpering woman.

And all this does bleed into fan fiction. Though, Fleur is made more subservient and, much like in HBP and DH, whatever talent and life she had is gone.

Also, the last time I did a read through I think I came to the conclusion that JKR made Hermione, the admitted self-insert, an "I'm not like other girls" girl.

I will say that she does her female characters no favors overall.

Lily's story revolves around Harry, James, and Snape. Ginny's sole existence is for Harry. McGonagall, Bellatrix, Umbridge, and Hermione are sidekicks. Two women, Amelia Bones and Millicent Bagnold, who would have had a lot of power and be independent of men disappeared or died. Was Narcissa ever mentioned without mentioning a man? Hell even Winky's story was about men and she just disappeared after GoF.

*** I woudn't put Umbridge as the exampe of being girlish. Her character is supposed to be unsettling, that evil can live in all form, even in someone that's very unlikely. If we don't know from Harry's narrative that Umbridge has a toad-like face, we won't suspect that Umbridge could be evil. After all, she had a girly voice and she liked pink and cats. Other character that could be as non-threatening as Umbridge (supposed to be) is a child, but HP is not an anime and JKR can't do that.

Also, Hermione isn't just a sidekick. Harry's adventure would be very different without Hermione being there. I actually liked what JKR did to Hermione. A female character in a MC team usually become [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart][the heart]] and/or the love interest. However, Hermione isn't one of those and JKR gave the heart and love interest to a Weasley, Hermione became the brain instead. Her role as writer insert is problematic, but overall she's a good female character.

I agree with the other example. Ginny is only there during and after OotP to serve as a love interest. McGonagall doesn't affect the plot. Bellatrix is the only female DH, though it could be sexism in the DE. Lavender, Parvati, and Fleur is mocked for being girlish. Most ministry employees (that Harry met) are male.

However, I won't really put a lot a lot of thought into this. Harry Potter is written in the late 90s with children as a target audience. JKR simply did the classic trope and doesn't really put a lot of thought into it. The MC is a white male with his two white sidekick and his male rival, adults are useless. abuse is simply brused off, etc. By the time it HP becomes YA, a lot of things are already written and it's too popular to do something controversial.

**** Yeah hermione is very important.

But she does have a very "not like other girls" element to her.

Id argue Umrbidges largest problem is that Rowling made her an ugly toad.

Okay let me explain. I like thr movie version more. Why? B3cause she looks like your grandmother she looks like a kind old lady. Then she opens her mouth.

In the book Harry can tell she is unpleasant by looking at her.

In the movie she is unpleasant but she looks normal and to me that works much more as well. She is normal at least for me.

Rowling portrays bigotry as this corruption and it is a bad thing but I like the movie more because sometimes nice people and pleasant people are just a bunch of bigots and it sucks.

She looks like that nice church lady then she opens her mouth and she just called you the f-slur.

That's why I dont much care for her portrayal in the book.

Shes just too ugly sure she acts contemptable but it just felt off.

But the movie made me loathe her as I know people like her ive met and interacted with people like her.

And it feels real because bigotry in real life doesnt just come from ugly people it regularly comes from the mouth of pleasant and attractive people.

She is a kind old lady in appearance but hides a sinister bigot below.

The book makes her monstrous in appearance which to me.just removes the menace.

***** JKR has a problem with conflating physical ugliness (especially being overweight) with moral ugliness. It's not 100% consistent, but there's a definite pattern. See: the Dursleys, Umbridge, Wormtail, Snape, etc.

**** Feel the same way. JKR was a new author and wanted to appeal to a large audience, so she wrote using the well testes tropes for the gente.

Nothing wrong, of course, but things get increasingly hard to pull off as the series progresses and the way she, a female adult, writers a teenager male is affected by such decision, which of course makes some readers read Harry as possibly a Bissexual, de to him "crushing" on Cedric for instante.

(This happens too with male authors writing female characters sometimes and is not a negative bias associated with fender in most cases, but simply a flaw.)

** Uhh, perhaps you should specify what in canon you think might be potentially suspect? Because nothing comes to mind (At least, nothing that wouldn't be really misplaced to blade Fem-Bashing on o.o)

*** Fem bashing I mean as in to bash being feminine or girly characters either directly or through subtext. Making it out as if being girly is bad or being obviously feminine is bad.

And the person below mentioned who id find suspect Lavander.

Though I would also mention Fluer.

***** The only one who I remember bash Lavender was the jealous and bookworm Hermione.. so I don't think we can say even that much, since it fitted her nerdy character.

Honestly, this is pure nonsense, shit is getting to a point in which every character in a story must act as the perfect human being with the absolutely perfect morals of a 24th century startrek human or authors get accused of being this or that..

People nowadays get offended if you breath with the wrong side of your nose for gods sake.. so much fucking nonsense and hypocrisy.

****** Yea, that was kind of the point I was trying to make. All we get in the books are subjective descriptions out of other characters POV.

I really don't know what this thread, and others like it are about, because using a characters POV and including their own view of the world and eventual prejudices to convey information about another character is a fundamental part of any story ever written.

Would be pretty fuckin boring without it, because then the reader would not have to think about what they read. They could just take all the information at face value instead of having to take the character that says something into account too.

EDIT: Yea downvote me and keep getting upset about there being characters with different views of the world lol. Holy fuck how retarded.

** To make it short : No

For a little longer answer : I do not think Rowling bashed any character, lot alone a feminine one. There are some character than can be treated a little . . .harsher than others, but all of them seem to be men (later books Ron, probably influenced by movie though I would not call it bash, or Peter Petigrew who is way more weak and useless than someone than outwitted Sirius and the whole Order should be).

Also, I'm trying hard to remember, but I just can't think of any feminine character who are bashed in the fic. Hermione is loved by the narration (Rowling did admit that she was a bit of a self insert), Bellatrix or Molly have both their moments, but never fall into bashing. The closest thing to a bashed character would be Umbridge, but she was written to just be evil and hated, and I still don't consider it at bashing (she would have needed to completely suck at everything she does to be that, and even if she is one of the worst teacher Harry had, she still managed to do what she came for, out Dumbledore, hurt Harry and "rule" Hogwarts for the ministry).

I remember some people complaining that Harry Potter is sexist, because the few women in power we see do not have any family, but I never thought it was an issue, mainly because the male in power we see also do not have a family (the only "powerful" character we see with his family mentioned is Crouch, and it's mainly to point he completely failed the education of his son who joined a terrorist group and was abandoned by him).

Finally, maybe the "fem bashing" you are talking is about the fact that Harry Potter only have a few "feminine" characters, who are not treated thte best way? Well if it's that I think it's completely wrong. Just because Lavender was not treated as a godess who just charmed Harry with how feminine she was does not mean it's fem bashing. The reader see the story from Harry point of view, and he happens to not be the most interested by "girly" thing like make up. The only female member of the Trio, Hermione, is also a bookish girl who is not really interested by things like that (though spending 6 or 7 hours getting ready to a freaking ball seem feminine to me), so it's not a main aspect of the story. But not getting a lot of screen time does not equal bashing. Lavender did play a role in the story as a "rival" of Hermione for Ron, and yeah she did not handle her relation the best way possible (things like the "won won" jewelry just seem gaudy), but it was just a girl trying to hard and she still pulled her part in the story with her "sacrifice" during Hogwarts battle.

*** Thank you for answer my question.

And I probably should have been more specific.

Also fem bashing is the term.

But it does not only mean bashing in the extreme.

** There's more of a Slytherin and Purebloods bashing in my opinion. I guess that rather than being 'bashed' it could be argued that emales in Harry Potter are too passive and lack more agency; with most powerful witches being 'under' a Wizard (Lestrange/Voldemort, Minerva/Albus, Amelia/Cornelius), but does that hold under scrutiny? The minister is a fool, a disgrace of a man and even grater disgrace as a leader; the great Albus Dumbledore is largely impotent to take any real action against know terrorists deeply entrenched into Wizarding Britain, and is largely passive himself; Sirius is a largely vulnerable and tired man that also is impotent to change the circumstances; i don't think Snape needs explaining; and most of the Purebloods show that support Voldemort are a rather.. unsightly and undignified group. As a reflection of Jk decision to have a male Main Character, the narrative itself tend to focus largely on males, and while that open it's own can of worms, that would be another point.
