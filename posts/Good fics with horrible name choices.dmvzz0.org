Another [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dmnon2/does_anyone_else_use_find_replace_to_fix_terrible][thread]] gave me this idea.

Are there any good fanfics that have bad name choices like Hadrian, which can be replaced?


** I don't think fics with Hadrian can be fixed, because the intention to use this name is generally associated with powerwanking asshole edgelord Harry.

*** Funny thing

Hadrian has nothing to do with harry.

Hadrian is roman name from the 100s

While Harry is the middle english form of Henry, Harold or Harrison.

***** I think Henry is the best choice for having Harry as a nickname (Prince Harry is really Prince Henry) and was Fleamont's father's name. Harrison is a great name but has a strong identity with Harrison Ford and William Henry Harrison was a US president. Honestly I'd rather read any of those names than Hadrian.

****** *Adriatic Sea*

The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along the Croatian part of its eastern coast.

** Well, the name choices aren't horrible, per se, as I actually think they add an extra something to the atmosphere of the fic, but linkffn(Horry Patter and the Philogoger's Stone) is a fic I've mentioned often; because if it weren't for the unfortunate title and the fact that it makes most people completely ignore the fic, I think it'd have been much more popular for that intriguing of a plot and the brilliantly designed world and magic system.
