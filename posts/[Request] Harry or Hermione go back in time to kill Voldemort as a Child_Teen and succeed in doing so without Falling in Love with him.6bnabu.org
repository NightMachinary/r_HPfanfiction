To many stories start off with Harry and or Hermione going back to time to Terminator the fuck out of Rifdle only to fall in Love with him and turn him from the dark side. I would like to see in where they succeed and maybe have to deal with the results (either in the future or the past)

Key thing though Dead ass Voldemort

  Go back to the beginning, that was the plan. Stop Voldemort on the cusp of becoming a dark lord, stop him before he created his first horcrux and change history before it could be written. That was the plan, only Harry made a mistake.

  One last desperate gambit lands Harry in the past, to change the whole course of history - for the better. There's no turning back on the path Harry has taken, no second chances. Dark!Harry, vampire!Harry, time travel. 4th place in May DLP challenge.

*** The thing about meddling with time is that imaginative writer should never run out of ideas for repercussions.

Imagine a different future where for /some reason/ things go horribly wrong. E.g. Muggles find wizarding world and go on a full ape-shit extermination rampage. You could write a story then where having Voldie actually prevented something far worse.

Or Grindelwald managed to escape due to some supporters remaning loyal to him rather than aligning with Voldemort. And yes in my opinion Grindelwald > Voldemort.

Just thinking here that's all.

**** Yes, I agree with your idea.

Riddle could have fought secretly for the good guys from 1944 to 1945 and made some important contributions to WW2.

By killing off Riddle before 1940s, our time travelers inadvertently caused Grindelwald and Nazis to win WW2. So when they returned to their present, they found a world not unlike the "1984".

***** It wasn't an argument. Someone asked a question and he answered.

He wasn't suggesting that it happened, just that it is a /possible/ consequence, previously unknown, in a hypothetical scenario in a fictional world where the fanfiction authors have been known to be perfectly loose with facts, create AUs, and adjusting the birth of Voldemort to make him a few years older is entirely plausible, if necessary (which, given how effective we saw children leveraged in the war against Voldemort, it really shouldn't be).

***** Riddle was already Voldemort by 1944, so he could have a very meaningful impact on the War by then, unknown to Dumbledore of course. He might have slipped a Curse or two in Grindelwald's back during that famous duel after all.

******* Hogwarts kids were perfectly capable of doing very heroic and villainous activities, as the Trio and Riddle demonstrated.

Just because Riddle was nominally a student at Hogwarts, didn't it mean he wouldn't engage in secret 'extracurricular activities'. Remember, he murdered his own family and created his 2nd horcrux still underage.

In fact, I'm going to bet that the coming FB movies are going to show some of Riddle's involvement in WW2. I'm even going to bet that much of his hate of Muggleborns came from the fact that many of them fought for Grindelwald.

*** That sounds more like a boring one shot.

1. Travel back to 1940

2. Find Riddle

3. Disillusion yourself/use the cloak

4. Stab a teenage Riddle while he's asleep.

5. Well done, you are probably erased yourself from history.
