** Yes, it's the only fic I've seen that I think deserves the number of reviews it has and one of the very few that really is of publishable quality.

The only trouble is, it makes me feel hopelessly inadequate as a writer and puts me off even trying. One of these days I'll analyse it to see just what she does that works so well.

*** Hi! Thanks for your kind words about something I wrote such a long time ago - makes me want to go back to my computer and find some time to write!

Don't feel discouraged or inadequate - I remember specifically the heavy cloud of doubt I felt before posting Cauterize. I was sitting in a dorm room thinking 'who the hell wants to read my weird fanon daydream where Charlie and Lavender end up getting married?' before finally just saying 'fuck it, who cares' and uploading it. I had no idea I'd be here almost ten years later, still getting a few emails daily about people favoriting and reviewing.

I think every person who writes feels insecure about what they write - I know I've read other authors with other styles and felt that hopeless 'why do I even bother' feeling. Don't give up!

***** Haha not many. I honestly don't even remember that one - probably wrote it off to [[/r/im14andthisisdeep][r/im14andthisisdeep]] and went about my day.

** You know, the way it's written, I think it could work as a picture book.

If you look closely, every segment, in between line breaks, presents something that could easily be illustrated as a still scene. 17 pages, starting from when Dennis picks up the camera, ending when he puts it down...maybe 2 pages for Draco's bit seeing as it's longer.

** u/chaosattractor:
#+begin_quote
  The popularity aspect of the collection was a masterfully constructed aspect of the "muted crowd." It really brought the whole piece together. I wonder, why did you decide to ignore Ron and Hermione? I think that in itself made me realize that I don't like this story. This work feels shallow, because it's just a portion of tale, drawing emotion from the story - but the story itself lacks depth.

  My world view just looks different than this, not better, but just more. I took a course on holocaust literature, and this just seems unsophisticated in comparison. I remember waking up to go to school and seeing 9/11 happen. This feels petulant in comparison.

  That all being said, I want to praise you for being able to draw out those comparisons. While not really living up as the sixth best fanfiction, I do believe that people can find something special here if they are looking for it. I thank you for sharing this with us.

This has to be one of the dumbest reviews I've ever read

*** omg, didn't see that one :D

Whoever wrote that has some serious problems. "I don't like this fanfiction because it is not as well written and thought out as holocaust literature and I felt more when 9/11 happened. Bad writer!"

*** I know most readers go into Harry Potter fanfic hoping to find a fic that will make them feel like they're reliving 9/11, and I'm deeply sorry I failed to provide that.
