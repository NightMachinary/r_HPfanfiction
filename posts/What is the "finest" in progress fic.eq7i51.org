In progress meaning updated in the last few months. Finest meaning best or most worthwhile or perhaps just your favorite.

What are you waiting on updates for that actually updates, and, briefly, why is it worthy.

I chimed in on Victoria Potter by Taure in another thread, saying it was the finest. What do you think is the best, and why if you don't mind?


** linkffn(Beyond the Curtain by Bobika) has insanely good world building, great plot progression and well written dialogue. IMO the most underrated fic out there, and I don't even like dystopia/post apocalypse stories.

linkao3(The Second String) is bound to get recced here. It's the only fanfic I've ever read that had plot twists that I genuinely didn't expect.

** Granger Principle and New Blood update weekly and I'm following them.

Prince of Slytherin and Impostor Complex update frequently enough and they're also pretty good.

Currently reading In the bleak midwinter which was also updated very recently.

** Alexandra Quick series is currently updating biweekly until 2/24 (I think) when the complete fifth book will be uploaded. There is a lot to catch up on though (the first four books are each over 200k words) and there are two more books to come!

It's not strictly fanfiction but an original story set in a non-WW-franchised Wizarding America. Extremely well written and plotted with realistic and engaging characters, and a fair more shade of grey than HP.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/384548/chapters/629550]]

“The Rise of the Drackens” by Starlight_Massacre. The story itself hasn't been updated since April, but a chapter has been added in “the scaled bits” which is another part in the series meant to contain oneshots far in the future in December. Harry Potter turns into a dragon hybrid thing, has a male harem, has lots of gay sex and children. More than 1 million words. There's a similar one called “there be dragons, Harry,” also on AO3, but it has such incredibly long chapters that I couldn't get into it after a while. Best to leave it for a few years and read the whole thing in one go. It also hasn't updated in about year at least, and might be abandoned.
