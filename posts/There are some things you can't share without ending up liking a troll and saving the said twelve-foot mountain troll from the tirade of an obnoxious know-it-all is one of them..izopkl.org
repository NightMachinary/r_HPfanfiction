** Not /quite/ what you're looking for, but in Harry Potter and the Elder Sect, Hermione has tea parties with the Troll in the Forbidden Forest. They also have matching outfits. And that's not even a quarter of the ridiculousness in the fic.

** I remember reading one with a Super!Harry with 3 trolls coming in and he kills 2 with some kind of magical rail gun and uses legilimacy on the 3rd turning it into a smart troll that refers to him as 'father' and I could almost hear the troll speaking like a posh English gentleman... I stopped reading shortly after that..
