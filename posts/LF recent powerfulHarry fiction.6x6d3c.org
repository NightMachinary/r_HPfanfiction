Hey there!,

I'm looking for stories in which Harry is magically very powerfiul, but not OP or god-like. Should be fairly recent, and either completed (with 100k+ words) or regularly updated.

Please no slash, and no abandoned fics.

Thank you very much in advance!

  Mercenary, bounty hunter, assassin, and now apparently a bodyguard. That means having to go back to a place and deal with things I don't want to. WBWL story. pairings as of yet are undecided.

He readily agrees, but the ramifications of the decision he made rear their heads in multiple unexpected ways as time goes on. Time travel, Good Dumbledore, RW/MW bashing.

**** The author was heavily promoting his/her commercial works in this fic, so he/she had strong financial incentives to wrap this one quickly and focus on something that makes money.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
