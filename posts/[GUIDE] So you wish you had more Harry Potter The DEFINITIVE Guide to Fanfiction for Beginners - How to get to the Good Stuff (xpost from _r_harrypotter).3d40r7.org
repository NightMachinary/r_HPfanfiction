Some people have said this guide is not necessarily "definitive" and influenced by these biases. *After a bit of introspection, and much debate, I must agree.* Writing a /definitive/ guide would be borderline impossible, especially for a fandom with millions of fics. I can only hope that this guide has been at least partially helpful in helping wade through the mud and finding enjoyable fanfiction.

* The DEFINITIVE Guide to Fanfiction for Beginners
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: the-definitive-guide-to-fanfiction-for-beginners
  :END:
So, you're /probably/ reading this because you wish you had more Harry Potter material to read. You wish you could experience the thrill of a magical adventure with your favorite characters again, yet it's impossible, because you've read all the books. You long for a tightly-woven plot, mystery, and action in the Harry Potter universe, but you know J.K. Rowling is done writing the adventures of Harry Potter.

Or perhaps you just want to experience something new.

* /So, before we get in to this short guide, there are some things I want to make clear:/
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: so-before-we-get-in-to-this-short-guide-there-are-some-things-i-want-to-make-clear
  :END:

- *The majority of Harry Potter fanfiction is /terrible/.* This is where the stereotypical image of fanfiction comes from. This is an important point to understand - /do not go to Fanfiction.net and try to find stories yourself./ Out of a random sample of 100 novel-length stories, you will be /incredibly lucky/ to come across one good one. This guide will show you how to do that.

- *Size doesn't matter.* Seriously - I thought this too, when I first started reading. After all, what better way to immerse yourself in Harry Potter than reading fanfics longer than half of the series put together? However, you will quickly find that indeed, word count doesn't matter. There are very, very good fics that are under 50,000 words, or even 10,000 words; by ignoring them, you would be doing a disservice to both the amazing writers and yourself.

- *Reviews don't matter.* This is pretty obvious. Review count, by no means, indicates the quality of a fic. Some of the best fics out there, sadly, have the fewest amount of reviews. It's kind of like culture today - the most popular thing is usually not the best. Twilight, while being popular, is not better than, say, The Dresden Files. The same logic follows in fanfiction.

- *While most fics are terrible, some fics are incredible works of art.* And this is the core reason why I have created this guide - there are absolutely wonderful fics out there that do not deserve to go unnoticed. These are your one-in-a-thousand masterpieces, these are works that will rival some of your favorite authors, works that are thrilling and far more immersive than canon! */These/* *are why you read fanfiction in the first place.*

*And this is why finding fics is hard. If you can't sort by reviews to find good fics, you can't sort by words, how will you navigate the ~1,000,000 Harry Potter fanfictions?*

* *Shut up and explain what I need to do, OP!*

There are a few really great resources that will aid your search for good fanfiction. I'll go over them:

- [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=2][*The Dark Lord Potter Library*]] - The individuals that congregate on this forums are undoubtedly some of the best writers the fandom has seen. They have written the epics - they have written the gems. Furthermore, *they have waded through the dredge to find the gems /for/ you!* This will probably be your most valuable resource for finding fics. While the individuals that are part of the forum often come across as sarcastic, snarky, and even caustic, this very same harsh attitude filters out even "good" fics. Their 1-5 rating system works very well, with fics rated "3" being better than most fics out there; fics rated "4" are must-reads; and fics rated "5" are 'stop fucking around on the forum and read this goddamn fic right now'. I don't know what I would have done without this forum.

- [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NkGVr2UUmX3AkexY8P9GZkQFMVfLsxVHckcwW2FzDSA/edit?pli=1][*Taure's 'Best-Of' Document*]] - A great list of /must-read fics/. Do not ignore this resource - this is probably one of the best single-document guides to fanfiction out there. Comprehensive explanations of /why/ a fic is worth reading follow a description of every fic, but you should read everything on here anyways.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Exvector][*My Fanfiction.net Favorites Page*]] - shameless self-promotion. Go to the "favorite stories" tab. Most of this list is very carefully cultivated after reading about 60 million words of fanfiction. Try out everything on this page.

- [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L42j8DtQjwikqv0ggbwA-W25Ccl77V1E2nO96fThTyI/edit?usp=sharing][*My Fanfiction Reviews*]] - please don't read this. I wrote this while starving and half-asleep in the middle seat of an 8-hour-long plane flight. You will probably stare open-mouthed in horror as you see how terribly written my reviews are, even though they are reviews of exceptional fics.

- [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=68][*DLP Story Search*]] - Perhaps you are looking for a fic that is well-written but centered around a theme you can't seem to find much of. The DLP Story Search subforum is an excellent resource to find fics in the vein of other fics, themes, ideas, pairings, and more - /especially if said themes are not featured on DLP's Library/. DLPers will help you find the best fics that match your theme, and I have found this an invaluable resource when searching for fics with excellent writing quality yet somewhat tamer themes than offered by the DLP Library.

- [[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net/][*Scryer*]] is an advanced fanfiction search engine that crawls multiple sites to find specifically what you want. Features include excluding or including stories with certain phrases or words in their description, searching by pairing, character, and much more.

* *Some Important Tips!*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: some-important-tips
  :END:

- *What does "AU" mean, OP? Pls halp!* AU means alternate-universe. While difficult to get into for some people at first, these fics provide a refreshing change of pace. They might change small elements of canon, or send everything careening into an entirely new direction (my favorite!), showing some refreshing imagination. I totally recommend reading through [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?s=0d301120c05c3127e4a102140f27d88b&f=16][*"The Alternates" subforum on DLP*]] if you want to try out some of the best and most interesting fics the fandom has to offer.

- *Romance?* /(Opinion)/ I advise against reading a fic purely for romance. There's a reason why the DLP forums have so few fics in their romance subforum - it's really hard to write good romance and almost always comes across as a mushy, completely overdone criticism of canon. /Pairings/, however, can be written wonderfully. Do note that stories with very well-written "pairings" are often not marked as "romance" on fanfiction sites, and by filtering by romance, you'll be blocking quite a few of these.

- *Leave constructive reviews.* Often, when entering fanfiction, the experience is very emotionally charged. As most of us have very fond memories of Harry Potter, we tend to carry over the emotional burden of these memories to fics we read. Then, if something goes wrong, you'll often see people new to fanfiction leaving very frusterated, emotionally charged reviews. /If something in a story frusterates you, wait a few hours before writing a review./ Perhaps read a different fic in the meantime. This will allow your emotions to simmer down and allow you to review the fanfiction from a more rational and technical point of view.

- *Harry Potter is symbolic and imprecise by nature.* If you see a fic trying to dissect the economics of the Wizarding World, you've probably come across a bad fic. If you see a fic trying desperately to fix plot holes in a re-hash of canon, you've probably come across a bad fic. You should have stuck to the resources above!

- *Review every fanfiction you read.* Writers /live/ off of your reviews. Unless they're MIA, I /guaruntee/ you they read every single review you post, and consider everything you say.

- *Download your fanfictions for offline reading.* I strongly recommend using the [[http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=259221][*FanFicFare plugin*]] with [[http://calibre-ebook.com/][*Calibre E-Book Manager*]]. As I have about 400 fanfictions saved, this really helps me organize all of my fics, export them all to my phone with a single click (using [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.multipie.calibreandroid][*Calibre Companion*]], and I store my library on a local folder in Google Drive so I can easily sync my libraries across computers and phones. *If you're too lazy to set that up*, you can download your fics from [[http://ficsave.com/][*FicSave*]], though it will be a nightmare to manage once you want to start reading more.

- *50,000 words = 3 hours of reading* for the average adult. Just a good metric to judge length by, and how much time you'll spend reading a fic.

This guide is based around the sources I have used to find the fics I have found most enjoyable after a few years and ~60 million words of reading fanfiction.

The sources and lists I have listed *tend to lean* towards novels that might include one or more of the following themes: /Harry-centric, action, mystery, tightly-plotted novels, moral grey areas, sparkly and descriptive magic, more action, an intelligent protagonist, politics./ (That said, sources such as DLP will not deny a well-written, engaging fic just because of a pairing or theme.)

On the other hand, I tend to *avoid* the following: /Romance, romance-or-pairing-based drama, angst, black-and-white morals ("Light"=good vs "Dark"=evil), stories that focus on a specific pairing/

Some people have said this guide is not necessarily "definitive" and influenced by these biases. *After a bit of introspection, and much debate, I must agree.* Writing a /definitive/ guide would be borderline impossible, especially for a fandom with millions of fics. I can only hope that this guide has been at least partially helpful in helping wade through the mud and finding enjoyable fanfiction.

*I am of the* */opinion/* that most people should be able to enjoy action, magic, etc. but it's not always the case.

*If you don't find the above stories or themes to your taste:* Be sure to explore DLP's Story Search (linked above, requires registration), use Scryer, ask here on [[/r/HPFanfiction]], search on the actual fanfiction sites, or more. [[/u/someorangegirl]] recommends [[/u/cambangst]]'s [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/reviews.php?reviewerid=209695][review page]] - I haven't read many fics from here, and I don't necessarily agree with some of the ratings, but it is a popular resource with over 1,200 reviews. This thread itself and [[/r/HPFanfiction]] are great places to find more fics that might suit you better.

** It's a useful guide, if inaccurately --- I would argue pretentiously --- titled. That it's a /Dark Lord Potter/ guide should be front and centre, not mentioned in passing.

That it's a DLP guide means that it skews in a particular direction: generally serious fic, featuring a powerful (albeit usually tastefully so), ambitious protagonist, and operating on a generally epic scale; and, unless it's an AU taking place in an effectively new setting (like Alexandra Quick), Harry Potter /must/ be that lead protagonist.

This means that this guide generally neglects the comedic and lighthearted fics, and fics that occur on the slice-of-life scale, which is unfortunate, because a big part of Potterverse's charm is not Harry Potter and his magical proficiency but the playful, whimsical setting of wizards who wear pointy hats and use trained owls for communication and have a weird --- to us --- perspective on the world. This alone makes Taure's list woefully incomplete for Beginners. [1] OP's favourites are a bit better in this respect, but still miss a lot of the good comedy (list available upon request).

To be fair, the DLP Library isn't bad, and there's a sizable Humour section; but the ratings themselves tend to have a modest signal-to-noise ratio --- and Heaven Forbid Harry is not the main protagonist or that someone else in his generation be better at magic than him!

~~~

[1] Also, while I read /What would Slytherin Harry Do?/ and enjoyed most of it, recommending it as a must-read... Well, imagine, for a moment, an AU of PoA told from Draco's perspective, describing how he first successfully manipulated those around him into sentencing Buckbeak to be executed, then, in an awesome gambit, simultaneously got Sirius Black captured and Kissed, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger expelled and their wands snapped for attempting to aid in Black's escape and for Time-Turner abuse (thus putting himself in line to inherit the Black fortune), and, in the end, Buckbeak's execution was only delayed by a day; and it's all told like it's the funniest thing ever, and there aren't any permanent consequences to the protagonist; somehow, people trust him just as much as before. /That's/ basically how the later chapters of WWSHD read to a non-DLPer.

**** Yes, but, collectively, DLP's standards for non-Harry-centric fic are much, much higher, which means that a lot of TastefullyPowerful!Ambitious!Harry fic that's mediocre gets in, while non-Harry-centric fic (or fic where Harry has to share the spotlight) is lost. For evidence of that, go to the ACA thread and count the number of instances of comments along the lines of "Not about Harry: -1" (not a direct quote of a specific comment, but the general spirit), not to mention the casual misogyny sprinkled throughout.

For that matter, ACA didn't make Taure's list or your list. Are you really going to tell me that every single fic on your and Taure's list is --- as a recommendation for a generic "beginner" --- better than ACA?

You have the right to your tastes of course, but, like I wrote in my original post, it's inaccurate and pretentious to promote your lists as some sort of a generic guide for a beginner in HP fanfic.

****** With all due respect, when you write a post that you advertise as "The DEFINITIVE Guide to Fanfiction for Beginners", it's on you to find some less skewed sources. If you can't find them, then don't advertise your post as "The DEFINITIVE Guide to Fanfiction for Beginners".

I'll take a look when I have time, but the only constructive criticism I can give at the moment is to please fix the OP to be explicit that these guides are catering to a specific taste, and describe what that taste is, ideally starting with the topic.

Ultimately, there are several subfandoms that rarely intersect, and all of them have their "best of", some of which would be utterly intolerable to many of those outside of that subfandom. The best way I can think of to assemble a beginner's guide is to do it by subfandoms and subgenres: best DLP-style, best Dramione romance, best Harmony romance, etc.. That, in turn, might be possible to accomplish by finding people of good taste in each subfandom and asking them for their recs. (Once, someone came to a forum I hang out on asking for Dramione. I am not a Dramionist myself, but I knew one whose approach to the pairing was one that I could respect, so I asked her for the recommendations and passed them on. I don't, generally, read Dramione; but if someone will read it, and they will, they might as well read good Dramione.)

******** No, it really doesn't. What would fix it is to be upfront that these are DLP-based recs and that the recs you're going to get have a certain slant --- and to explain in the OP the type of slant you're going to get.

Adding a link to a DLP thread (which requires registration in order to even ask) that has slightly looser standards --- where, admit it, you're likely to be insulted if you ask for something going against the majority of DLP --- doesn't make it a definitive guide for beginners.

Look, I don't post to DLP, because if I did, I'd get bogged down in yet another venue for Internet debates, and I'd never get anything done, but I do think that DLP library is a valuable resource to the fandom and is generally quite good at pointing out flaws and bad taste even in fics that fit the DLP's general slant; and I follow many of the discussions, as they are interesting and informative, and there are some users whose postings I follow personally; and I believe that Taure is a highly intelligent and well-informed individual whose opinions I respect; but, if you can't find any good non-DLP sources, then don't frame your post as a general guide for beginners, frame it as a DLP-based guide for people interested in DLP-style stories.

************ Oh, I know where I find my fics; I've been in fandom over ten years now. I'm partial to Painless J's rec lists, for starters. I've found the most effective way to find stories is looking up rec lists until you find someone with your taste. Hence why you think DLP is the best place to find stories-- they rec what you like.

** My biggest tip for new readers is don't beat yourself up for not liking a fan fiction that's on a ton of recommended lists. You read for your own enjoyment not someone else's :)

** The title of this thread is an absurd overreach. For a "DEFINITIVE" guide, your sources of material are too narrow and your point of view is far too Harry-centric and AU-centric. News flash: Lots of people like reading canon-compliant stories, romances, and other stories that never see the light of day in the Dark!Powerful!Harry echo chamber that is DLP.

*** Dark!Powerful!Harry is... wait for it... in the /Dark Arts/ subforum of the Library. There are quite a few canon-compliant stories on DLP. Your stereotype of the entire community is an absurd overreach, I think.

I have yet to see a well-written, thought-out, and engaging story rejected from DLP just because it doesn't have a Dark!Powerful!Harry, or because it isn't AU. Indeed, such stories are what you'll find in the General subforum of the library.

Regardless, if you find better sources of material, that provide well-written, engaging stories, and attempt to filter out ones that are not, feel free to link it here. I'll probably add it to the OP.

** It amazes me how much HP fandom has changed in the years since. Fictionalley to DLP. The old writers seemingly stretching their wings publishing their own works. Current Harry portrayals remind me of leatherpsnts draco.

Oh well, time flies, thanks for the list.

** I admire the effort that went into this post, but to echo another poster, I too hesitate to urge new readers to drop what they're doing and head to DLP. While it undoubtedly hosts useful tools and excellent writers, there is also a very troubling atmosphere of casual misogyny that stands to alienate a large portion of new readers. (Just consider the conversation that takes place on [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=28631&page=4][this]] page about whether an eleven-year-old Hermione can be considered a cunt, or merely a bitch. This kind of thing is toxic, not snarky or caustic.) Maybe point to the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/][DLP C2]] instead of to the messageboard?

*** That post in specific references how an AU Hermione should be handled (ala Hermione in the [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2740505/1/Wit-of-the-Raven][/Wit of the Raven/]]) . The two posters did not say that in an attempt to demean women in general. While DLP users couldn't care less about being politically correct, they aren't shortsighted. Even if they /were/, dropping an entire website full of intelligent and critical reviews just because you disagree with the mindset of a few users is a /terrible/ idea.

The message board is a very helpful tool - something I certainly wish I knew about when I entered the HP fanfiction world. The vast majority of people that post there are quite intelligent, have spent quite a bit of time reading fanfiction, and provide insightful reviews and criticisms of more fanfocs than on the C2.

**** Forgive me, I misspoke earlier---the character in question is Pansy, not Hermione. But you're deliberately misreading the discussion if you think that exchange is meant innocently. (Flip to the previous page, where a reader applauds Harry's sexual assault of Pansy because it will "cow" her.) This is an extreme example (although not the most extreme I could have chosen), but it's not an isolated incident or mindset.

As I said in my first post, none of that's to say that a significant portion of the discussion on DLP isn't constructive or insightful. (I follow several threads myself, and occasionally contribute posts.) But as the point of your guide is to nurture fandom growth, I am inviting you to consider that DLP may be more than just "politically incorrect," and that its less attractive characteristic stand a good chance of alienating new readers.

Edited for phrasing and grammar.

*** I think it's problematic especially because he posted it to [[/r/harrypotter]]. Posting a very DLP-centric list and labelling it definitive is a good way to turn some new people off of fanfiction if their interests don't line up with DLP's biases.
