More powerful wizard more eccentric they are as seen with Dumbledore. Thing is Dumbledore isn't the most eccentric one on Isles, that title belongs to one Xenophilius Lovegood.


** I have a prompt idea for this and will write it out but for canon Xenophilius it's best to remember the man is an exceptionally kind and gentle soul. Luna is clearly her fathers child.

They see that in the long run only by living their life they way they want can they be happy. So they are, happy joyful people who genuinely care little about the opinions of others about them.

Why should they care about how others feel about them? They are not those people, so their opinions don't matter.

What matters is how you treat yourself and the world you make around you.

It's an extremely enlightened mindset from a philosophy point of view. When Xenophilius cried about betraying the kids to save Luna it broke my heart.

Alright my Lovegood rant over, seriously my favorite people in the book hands down.

*Prompt response*

A witch or wizard could live a long time if their magic supported them. The stronger a witch or wizard was the longer their magic could support them.

Witch or wizard, weird was there an easier way of saying that?

Xenophilius found himself playing with words as he tried to make an easier way to say it.

Witard? Wizitch? Zitch? Tizr? Caz? Card? Wow? Fat sheep? No that last one would get them up in a tizzy.

Teragent Flupwuffles? Oh that was good!

Teragent Flupwuffles indeed.

He began writing out his newest article and smiled.

Albus Dumbledore set down the latest Quibler and confirmed once again that the Lovegoods were terrifyingly intelligent powerhouses.

The article that had once again let him know just how incredible the man was laid out before him.

Allergies of the Common Teragent Flupwuffles to spontaneous bursts of green: Vaccination Spells!

Somehow Xenophilius had made spells, as in plural, that would guard against the killing curse!

While it was an incredible feat Albus was of a slightly different mind. Honestly the killing curse was a mercy in the hands of Death Eaters.

They had far more painful ways of killing, dark curses that were horrifying in their effects.

If the Death Eaters found out that citizens were immune to the killing curse they would just shift tactics to something far more brutal.

Afterall a crucio ignored a shielding charm just as well, and good luck keeping a shielding charm up under that curse. Then they would just use something far more tortuous to kill their victims.

He may have indebted the house elves to himself finding out dragon blood was an excellent kitchen cleaner.

Xenophilius on the other hand had published an article two years ago labeled "Ancient Dirty Frog Cures for when you lose Shiny Red Rocks"

Buried within it had been an alchemical recipe that a first year could follow to make a Philosophers Stone. The total cost for ingredients was less than three galleons.

Nicholas had not been amused.

*** If only the fat sheep-sorry: "Teragent Flupwuffles" could keep an open mind when they live in a world of magic, and used the lateral thinking that would help with that associated insanity, they might all live forever
