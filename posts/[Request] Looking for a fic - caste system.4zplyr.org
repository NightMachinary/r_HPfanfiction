Hello,

I'm hoping that someone here will be able to help me.

I started reading a fanfic a long time ago and then lost the link.

It started off in I believe ancientish Egypt (though that could be wrong) and the ruler had a prophet that told him about either a way he could be immortal, or something else.

Anyway, fast forward he's still alive and there's now a caste system in the wizarding world. Muggleborns are taken from their parents as small children and put into homes, and when at Hogwarts the students are paired with another student that's their study partner etc throughout their time there. Harry is paired with Draco, and Hermione is a sort of wildchild that was taken into the muggleborn home later on.

Thank you. I'll try to remember some more details about it.

Edit: There was also some sort of camp made up of people that were against the school and the way everything works, and I believe Tom Riddle was the head master of the school.


** Bumping this up in hopes that the new info will help.
