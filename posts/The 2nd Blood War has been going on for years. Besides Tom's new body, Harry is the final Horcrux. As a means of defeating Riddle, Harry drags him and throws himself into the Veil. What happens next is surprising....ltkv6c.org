** He actually does die for once? Like, in the fandon the veil of death is used for petty much everything from hopping dimensions to making sandwiches, would be petty surprising if it actually /did/ kill the person for once like all the DoM seems to believe.

**** Made it up as an example, though I really wouldn't be all that surprised to stumble upon a story in which the veil is essentially a drive-thru and the reason no one ever gets out is that they all make the mistake of ordering some of the food because it smells more than heavily but the staff ends being at the same time slow enough to take until the universe's heat-death before the first order is ready and friendly enough that no one has the heart to cancel their order.
