:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic where Harry has Voldemort's emotions. The fic starts just after harry has been picked from the Goblet of fire. He insults Fleur after she calls him a little boy. And later on Harry goes to the ball with her.


** Harry calls Fleur a filthy half-breed or something similar to that
