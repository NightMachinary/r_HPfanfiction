I've been a lurker for some time now and I was wondering why, even with the search, not a word is said on this amazing (and extremely long) fiction whereas some others (of disputable quality IMO) are recommended.

*** HP adopted by Dursleys, no Dursley, happy childhood, tendency to strive towards normality, Ravenclaw sorting, gaming childhood so when thinking magic doesn't think at turning mouse to table, but giant fireball of Doom, passionned by History (makes links between important muggles leaders and magical ones), mother Bellatrix, badass Grindelwald, Beauxb√¢tons bashing, best Durmstrang I've ever read, best take on Fluffy EVER (and I don't say that lightly), Fidelius clusterfuck, strategic masterminds all over the place.

I hope I didn't spoil too much, if yes, tell me so and I'll edit.

***** Sorry about that, I was dead tired when I wrote it.

So I'll try to summarize it without spoiling: Harry had a happy childhood at the Dursleys, his a bit obsessed with video games and history and doesn't strive to greatness (at least in the beginning) because he considers himself as normal, bland, without anything particular that makes him stand out from the others. This feeling continues at Hogwards, as he his unremarkable, unremarked and ignored by/from any other student, with the exception of a few people, like Snape and later on, Draco. He believes that Lilian Potter (the GWL) is his cousin through his father or a third sister in the Evans siblings.

The beginning (first few books) could be called "the ascend of a revolutionary".

The first few chapters are not the most exciting ones but it gets so much better the more it goes on, it is well worth the read.

** I read a few chapters and it looks like a girl who lived story, with Lillian Potter. I got only up to the sorting and gave up.

*** Trust me, it is well worth it, I don't think I've ever read a most inventive GWL story, much less a good one. In short, she is her own character, without being a SI.

(that is to say that it is a better NBWL story than, to say, HP & the BWL, with Lilian Potter not being a copy paste of the canon HP)

** I just read the first "book".

What the hell. It's very cool but very weird. I'm mostly just very confused, especially with the title of the second book.

It's kind of a clusterfuck, but I guess all good stories are.

Yeah, how come I haven't found this before? Thanks for sharing.

*** Seconding the confusion. Spoilers below:

I finished the first year, and though the author kept saying here you go, hints!, I still don't know exactly what's going on, when he was possessed(and what happened then) and how some people are able to know he's there and others aren't. Also why certain people are helping him.

** I vaguely remember reading that one ages ago.

On the one hand, it has really good parts. A lot of really fun and INNOVATIVE ideas that I've never seen done that way before or again.

On the other hand, it's a nightmare to get everything that's going on at times. There are so many chessmaster-type players, like for example almost every horcrux is active and plotting. I seem to recall a part where multiple time-turner variants of the same person are running around, fighting and obliviate each other or sth. Shit was confusing, especially when told from the perspective of the one who got obliviated. Was an interesting approach, basically an unreliable narrator, but SO hard to follow what's going on.

TL&DR; I personally liked it, but I understand everyone saying they don't. I guess it's one of those everyone just has to try and see for themselves.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

** I don't think I'd ever recommend it because of how incoherent it is in the last quarter of the fic.

There are lots of unneeded complications that don't really add anything to the story. I had to read all the authors notes to keep track of what was going on and I don't think a good story should need an explanation every chapter and the explanations shouldn't be confusing either.

However I did enjoy the world it was set in.
