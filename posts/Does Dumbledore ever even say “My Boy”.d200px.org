I feel like that's a “manipulative old man tactic” a lot of Dumbledore!Bashing fics will shove on him. It feels so out of place when they make him call everyone “my boy.” Giving me Zelda CDI vibes. “I'll help you, My Boy. I say that so it seems like I'm trying to get close to you.” Canon Dumbledore respected his distance from Harry more than this, right???


** He calls Harry boy twice at the end of PS:

"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times," said Dumbledore. "Quirrell does not have the Stone."

"Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed."

Also he calls Malfoy "dear boy" several times in HBP and during Felix Felicis and probably elsewhere (iirc) Slughorn calls Harry "m'boy" and Scrimgeour also calls Harry "dear boy".

All of these may or may not be the American editions, I didnt check.

*** Boy kind of makes sense. It's an adult talking down to a child. But he seems to avoid “my boy,” which makes it's inclusion in fics ruffle my feathers even more

**** Feel free to look through the rest of the books, those were just the searchable pdfs I had on hand. I'm betting it happens at least once, probably in GoF and OotP and possibly during the portrait scene in DH.

***** I couldn't find any instances of Dumbledore calling Harry that, though I did find Oliver Wood, Hagrid, Trelawney and Slughorn all call Harry "my boy."

** He uses "dear boy" a few times in reference to Harry. Harry and young Tom Riddle are called "my boy" "dear boy" a number of times by various people in the books
