A year ago I wrote this one shot for the DLP Q3 competition with the prompt "What the Professors do in their summers."

It's a character study looking at Dumbledore in 1996, after he's been cursed and is aware that he's not long for the world. I hope it's entertaining, and perhaps a little bit sombre in parts. If it sounds like your sort of jam, enjoy!


** Brilliant. If you have more one-shots like this, please don't hesitate to post them.
