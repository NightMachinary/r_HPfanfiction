** Please flair under 'Request'. The 'recommendation' flair is for when you're recommending fics to people on the subreddit.

As for your request, maybe try Colubrina? She's a pretty popular author though, so you might have worked through her fics already.

******** Yeah okay you're a fast reader ;)

I really like the world-building in this fic. Lots of the ideas aren't entirely original (like Parselmagic and the ritual stuff) but she really fleshes them out.

I wouldn't hold my breath for a sequel any time soon, but I'll be pleasently surprised if/when we get one.

** I feel like that too! We have quite similar tastes so just scrolling through my list of fics to see which ones I'd recommend. I'm sure several of these you've already seen/read but might as well link them.

linkffn(The Heir by La-Matrona) for sort of pureblood!Hermione Anything by Aurette e.g. linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Crystal of Time) Anything by OracleObscured, e.g. Her current WIP linkao3(Quartet by OracleObscured) is a multi with Draco/Lucius/Severus. All her stories are heavily based on sex/bdsm but also have interesting character development. linkao3(Of Pure Blood by MalfoyCouture) with HG/LM, nice world building based on fae and fairies. linkffn(Cloak of Courage by WendyNat) with an interesting take on dark arts rituals being highly addictive/parasitic. There is a more explicit version of this on Ashwinder. linkffn(Sin & Vice by mak5258) with fun and unusual time turner concept. linkffn(Bat out of Hell by bleddyn) linkao3(Choosing Grey by betagyre) is a time travel HG/TR story. As per the title, it's not a 100% redemption story but quite grey and Hermione struggles a lot with Riddle's choices, many of which are still terrible. Gets into wizarding politics later on. linkao3(Compelled by SlytherPouf) linkao3(Ginny's Ambition by RavenHairedPrincess) is a bit of a crack fic I guess but I found it quite enjoyable. There is an absolutely hilarious sex poem.

Edit: the AO3 bot didnt load, probably because the website is down, I'll update with links later.

  Hermione Granger's life is forever changed one night by an innocuous spell and a timely Professor. KindaPureblood!Hermione and Not Quite a Marriage Law. I just could't get my tropes right. Either way, the resident Know-It-All and the Bat of the Dungeon collide in this AU, SS/HG story about what happens when you're related to the Dark Lord. Cover art by Freya Ishtar.

  What begins as Severus' anger at Sirius Black's attempts to seduce Hermione leads to a life he never thought he deserved to live.
