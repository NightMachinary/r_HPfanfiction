You know the score. Harry's twin is thought to be the boy who lived, Harry gets neglected in favour of the twin (usually James and Lily live) but Harry is actually secretly powerful and all that shit. Harry goes dark, joins slytherin, hates his parents, etc etc.

Any of that that's actually well written and complete?


** I actually liked too young to die. Has a bit of bashing, but I promise it is much more founded then the usual wrong bhl. Also very dark. Linkffn(9057950)

*** "A bit of bashing." By which you mean, the most idiotic and unsympathetic Potter family in any fanfic I've read this year ostracizes Harry for no in-universe reason, just to make Harry seem more sympathetic and give the author someone he can inflict violence on without troubling readers' moral qualms.

Then there's the easy-routes-to-power-nobody-else-uses problem, the troubling way the author portrays women, and the /extremely/ unsatisfying ending. Why does this story keep getting recommended? Really?

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

*** I honestly though that the writing in that fic was so bad I had to stop reading after the second chapter, does it end up getting better?

** Too young to die is one of the few fics that I forgave for the bashing, because I felt that the ending gave a good reason for the it.

I like it, because, unlike a lot of other works of the kind, it has a truly dark harry, borderline psychopath, but without making him a brilliant manipulative slytherin. He makes tons of stupid decisions since he's a child and it shows. Fic also moves to a completely different direction, paying practically no attention to Voldemort. I am not blind to its flaws, it won't win any "fic of the year" awards, that's for sure, but a good way to pass the time nonetheless. IMHO, obviously.
