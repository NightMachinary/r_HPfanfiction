Most people who have problems with their stories seem to have a thumping good beginning, but run out of steam in the middle, because they lacked an overall plan. At least, that's my take on it - when you start, you should already know how it'll end.

So I've been writing a multi-story series in the style of a first-person, fictional memoir relating the misadventures of my OC (a Slytherin half-blood girl in the same year as the Twins). The trio are mostly off-camera (Harry is strictly an unseen character) so it manages to be canon-complaint - the Twins are the only canon characters I make substantial use of.

Though I guess that's actually irreverent - my problem is that of actually writing the thing. I've got five stories on the go (two are at 100%, the others at about 50%, 30% and 5%). I've been doing in a non-linear manner a lot of chapters that I've found fun-to-write, for example... she's unwillingly recruited into The Order while not telling them she's passing intelligence to the (very) secret Muggle agency that keeps an eye in the Wizards (but that's OK as she's doesn't tell the Muggles she's in the Order); she impersonates Umbridge with polyjuice to escape Ministry arrest (and later on must impersonat one of the Twins to Molly Weasley); she's the only Slytherin aside from Slughorn fighting in the Battle of Hogwarts (doing so unwillingly because she's got no choice); she joins the Aurors in the post-war emergency, to help in the dangerous business of rounding up surviving, fugitive Death Eaters and Snatchers after Voldrmort's demise.... but only because she's blackmailed into doing it.

And so on.

However my problems seems to be that although I know exactly /where/ the overall story arc is going, I have come to a dead stop; when I fire up to word processor to do some more, I find myself spending an hour changing a word here or there in the chapters I've done, rather than getting stuck into composing new chapters, so I've not made any substantial additions in months,I feel its a strange sort of writer's block in that I know where I'm going, but can't seem to get there.

Writing this text post has actually helped me think about the problem. I wonder if I've been subconsciously viewing the unwritten bits (that will join together what's been done) as a dull trudge, when I should be devising how to make them just as fun to write (and hopefully read). I tend to view writing fiction as /being sadistic to imaginary people/ so I need more incidents that are embarrassing, humiliating or terrifying that will drive the plot forward.

So any opinions or comments? All suggestions for block-busting would be appreciated.


** Gustave Flaubert is a French author famous for that kind of problem, as he wrote in a letter "I spent the whole morning placing a comma, I passed the entire afternoon erasing it".

So IMHO it's a good thing, in a way. Also, you can try to not touch it for a few days/weeks and come back to it with a fresh and new perspective, as you would have forgotten the details that you no longer see.

** try sitting down and just bare minimum rushing towards the next plot point you find interesting. if its shit you can throw it all out. but maybe its hard to write because its boring and not worth putting in the story anyways

*** That sounds like a good idea.... I've got one of two of those roughly sketched out. Sitting down and just doing 1000 words no matter how good or bad would be a step forward.

**** It's actually something Stephen King talks about in his book /On Writing/ (which i recommend if youre interested in writing as a craft and a great read besides). He'd set a goal of 3000 words a day force himself to meet it no matter what

although King is quite prolific as an author, i dont think theres many who put out as much material as he does

** Well , I've been trying to get a fic going for a number of months now and still haven't managed to get anything postable yet, so the following is definitely best taken with a grain of salt (this whole writing thing is very much a work in progress for me). But here are a few things that are helping me:

-Don't put everything in one file: Have ‘idea' files, and ‘wip' files and ‘real' files and everything that get you more comfortable. That's probably self-evident for most people but it wasn't for me. The first time I tried to write something, I tried to write it all in one file and as if I was going to publish it directly (I treated that file like a ffn page basically). That did not go well. At all.

-Don't fill the stuff in-between plot point with ‘and thens', this is terrible writing (Harry went to diagon and then he became friend with the goblins and then he went to the train and then a blond jerk came around and then...). Make ample use of Buts and causality. (Harry should have received his letter but the Dursleys stole them, they went into hiding because they kept receiving so many letters so Hagrid had to come and get Harry, so Hagrid ended up showing him around Diagon, It was wonderful but people were acting like he was a celebrity so Hagrid had to explain the first war to him...)

- Write for fun, edit to publish: Sometimes, I like to write super big descriptions of random places... I mean it's like minecraft but with no limitations, people should be going crazy for the stuff. I also have a fascination for long empty dialogues (like absurd levels of empty) and really inefficient communication (people hesitating, misunderstanding each-other, getting sidetracked, getting frustrated with something...). Anyway, you get the idea, the point is: even if it's not usable, write it if it makes you happy. You can decide to use it or not after. I have a bank of a few places I'll probably never use and some dialogues I might eventually use only a few snippets of, but at least I wrote something and explored some ideas that might just be good.

-Just one more: Add one sentence to your fic. It's nothing, just one. Seriously, if you are reading this, do it right now.

I hope this helps a bit, but this comment is getting really freaking long for someone who essentially have no idea of what they are talking about so I'll just end it here. Good luck and have fun!

** These rules were originally tweeted by Emma Coates, Pixar's Story Artist. Number 9 on the list - When you're stuck, make a list of what wouldn't happen next -- is a great one and can apply to writers in all genres.

- You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.

- You gotta keep in mind what's interesting to you as an audience, not what's fun to do as a writer. They can be very different.

- Trying for theme is important, but you won't see what the story is actually about til you're at the end of it. Now rewrite.

- Once upon a time there was /__. Every day, _. One day _. Because of that, _. Because of that, _. Until finally _/_.

- Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You'll feel like you're losing valuable stuff but it sets you free.

- What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?

- Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.

- Finish your story, let go even if it's not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time.

- When you're stuck, make a list of what WOULDN'T happen next. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up.

- Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you've got to recognize it before you can use it.

- Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you'll never share it with anyone.

- Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind. And the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th -- get the obvious out of the way. Surprise yourself.

- Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it's poison to the audience.

- Why must you tell THIS story? What's the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That's the heart of it.

- If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.

- What are the stakes? Give us reason to root for the character. What happens if they don't succeed? Stack the odds against.

- No work is ever wasted. If it's not working, let go and move on -- it'll come back around to be useful later.

- You have to know yourself: the difference between doing your best & fussing. Story is testing, not refining.

- Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.

- Exercise: take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How d'you rearrange them into what you DO like?

- You gotta identify with your situation/characters, can't just write ‘cool'. What would make YOU act that way?

- What's the essence of your story? Most economical telling of it? If you know that, you can build out from there.

*** I have to disagree with your second point. Fanfic is being done for fun. We're not getting paid to write and you can't sell the end result. If you're not enjoying yourself you won't do it.

**** I transcribed the original - it was written by a professional writer as advice to others interested in her profession, which is probably why the second point was included.

From a fanfiction point of view, I agree that playing to the audience isn't necessary, but I can also attest that writing what you want regardless of the reader's possible discomfort with it will reduce the audience considerably. If you're writing something you think is great and can't see why it isn't more popular, it may be that you've misjudged how much effort a reader wants to make to 'understand' an unusual topic or perspective.

***** It's an interesting point. I mean I always knew many HP fandom readers would never consider reading something with an OC protagonist, were only really interested if Harry was the story's focus and would run screaming from anything in first person. At one point, I did /experiment/ with rewriting it as limited third person, so the stories only had two strikes against them instead of three, but I quickly stopped that. I just liked too much having what TV Tropes calls a /"First Person Smartass"/.

So yeah, I'm ostensibly doing what fan authors should be doing - writing whatever they find fun to do. And if the fandom audience doesn't like the result for whatever reason, then so be it.

Yet fan-authors put their work out there to be read for a reason. They want readership and recognition even if they don't get paid (I'm not going to pretend to be an exception). So there is at least an impulse to be audience pleasing to gain that.

** Write something completely different in another genre for another fandom. Make it completely low-key nothing you plan to finish or even show anyone else. It helps stave off the burnout for what you're working on.

You also don't have to write the story in order. Jump ahead and write a part you think is more interesting.

** You're not alone. I have the exact same problem. I'll get back to you when I find a solution😂

I know why it happens though. I keep playing and replaying the entire story in my mind and since I write the story for myself, I've actually satiated my curiosity because I've experienced the story too many times in my head. And then I realized I'm only half-way into the story in terms of writing and there's still a long way to go to get to the end. It becomes a chore to write because of it. I don't know if you can get what I'm trying to say.

** Try to find other things in the story to work on. Perhaps you could start an omake scratch file, with little jokes, and what if scenarios. Another idea is to let yourself go edit. Let your brain chew on the upcoming story, while you engage it with something different.

Another track you can take is to intentionally screw over your future plans. Kind of a "whenever you start getting bored writing, set off a bomb in the story", and then force yourself to plot out what would happen next, and try to see if that takes you where you wanted the plot to end up, and if not, if the new direction is better or worse.

** Take this with a pinch of salt, because I've never posted anything, but one of the ways I've found to overcome writer's block is to just focus on another story. For instance if I am facing writer's block on my "serious" story, I'll just spew out as much words as possible on a crack fit. Story doesn't matter, grammer doesn't matter, just write something completely silly and put down as much words as you can. It helps take my mind off where I want the "real" story to go. Then it's easier to come back later and move along.

** ignore the storyline and write what the person would actually do based on what you know of their personality and how people are going to react to that.

you'll probably write yourself into a corner where things become unrecoverable

think of it as an alternate timeline of what could have been and use that as inspiration to for the real chapter. hell, discarded "what if" timelines could even be a divination dream that causes the character to change what they were going to do.

I think it was the ASOIAF author who said that there's millions of discarded words for ASOIAF that never made it into the books.

** I mean, I shun plans like the plague and I'm 215k words into my story, with healthy success, a little over a year after starting it. Different people have different problems --- some writers lose their muse if they don't write down a detailed plan during their initial bout of inspirations, and others, like me (and, perhaps, you) are disheartened when all the fun part of inventing is done and there's only the drudge of writing it up left.
