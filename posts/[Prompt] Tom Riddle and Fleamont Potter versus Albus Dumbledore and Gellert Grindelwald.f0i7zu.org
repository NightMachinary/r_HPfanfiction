After the death of Ariana, Albus feels like he has to make her death mean something, that he owes it to her to make the world better for the Greater Good, and goes off with Gellert, committing to the path that led Gellert to darkness.

After acquiring the Elder wand, they return to England searching for the other Hallows and kill Marvolo and Morfin to claim the stone, as well as the Potters to claim the cloak.

11 years later Tom Riddle Jr comes to Hogwarts and becomes friends with a young wizard that he later discovers to be the last surviving Potter. The two of them, as rightful owners of their Hallows, are prophesied to take down the burgeoning Dark Lords of Death.

- Merope maintains her control over Tom Sr to survive, hiding as his loving wife and raising her son. She tells him his heritage but sends him to school as a muggleborn to avoid bringing down Albus or Gellert on him.

- Fleamont survives the attack on his family by being out of the home and is taken in by another family, who change his name to hide him.

*** Thanks! I am not good enough at writing to make this a reality, but I hope it inspires someone else enough to take off with.

** I can tell that I'm going to be thinking about this for the next week.

How would Grindelwald's involvement in the war in Europe come into this? Did they hunt the hallows first so that it would be easier? Or did they try to take over Europe, get pushed back to Britain and then focus on the hallows to get the advantage?

*** I came up with this prompt on long drive with my wife and we bounced ideas back and forth.

One idea is that Dumbledore and Grindelwald would have a "falling out" and that they would lead separate sides of the war, with Dumbledore acting as leader of the British forces while Grindelwald played the bad guy. Intending all along for Dumbeldore to win and for them to consolidate power in Britain after the war, with Grindelwald become the shadow behind the throne, Dumbledores invisible guard, under the cloak and wielding the Elder wand.

Another idea was for them to have set up a puppet as magical ally to Hitler and leader of the wizarding wars that the two of them would heroically defeat, entrenching them as heros of the world, and giving them power to take control, for the greater good of course.

The main idea was to stick with the canon consideration that the two of them had started with idealistic thoughts of leading the world to prosperity under their control, and got caught up in a heavy ends justify the means mindset. I visualized them to be brutal, but still thinking that they were right. That causing this war, and highlighting the atrocities of the muggle war would help everyone see that they were right, and that muggles should be ruled over and guided. They don't want to take this by force, they want people to agree with them, even if that means starting a war to do it.

In this concept, prior to the outbreak of hostilities, Albus and Gellert would be working their way into positions of influence in both magical and muggle worlds, and that they would be collecting obscure and esoteric magical knowledge. I couldn't imagine Flamel choosing to work with this Albus, but I could imagine Gellert killing him, and Albus using the resurrection stone and necromantic magic to force him to reveal his secrets and knowledge. I'd imagine that they would have done that to a lot of ancient wizards who might not have passed on all of their knowledge, as well as any living ones who chose not to share.

The story would begin before hostilities broke out, and would include a build up to the fight. Tom would have been raised for vengence by his mother possibly, while Fleamont for survival. I'd imagine that the final confrontation would somehow involve the two boys positions as rightful masters of their Hallows, while the Lords of Death were only usurpers.

Overall I have a lot of world building concepts and plot ideas for this prompt, but I'm pants at actually coming up with a plot to fill it out with, so I decided to put it out there for someone else to maybe take inspiration from.
