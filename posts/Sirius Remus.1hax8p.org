I'm looking for good, well written fics about Sirius or Remus or both together. I don't care if it's AU or cannon. I don't mind slash, either. I just really love these characters. Thanks.

*** How many chapters is this? I would like to read it but the website is confusing to me and I can't tell where to access the story. Help?

** Moony andPadfoot are wonderful! :D I love reading about them too, and these are the things I've found and enjoyed.

MarauderLover7's stuff is pretty good - it's how I imagined them anyway: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=209372]]

RoxanneReluisant's work's also good - the characterisation of her Marauders is perfect (some slash in her work): [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/894770/RoxanneReluisant]]

Arsinoe de Blassenville's The Garden Gate is about Sirius as a child and it's an excellent story: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2736250/1/The-Garden-Gate]]

Mischief Managed by Aurora Dawn is a humourous little story: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=233209]]

Anatomy of a Bromance by Wilhelmina Willoughby is mostly about Sirius and his friendship with James but Remus makes a few appearances: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4466268/1/The-Anatomy-of-a-Bromance]]

That's what I can think of off the top of my head but hopefully there's something there that interests you. :)

** RL/SB is a favourite of mine too. I fell into it by mistake as I couldn't find any good het RL stories for ages. I've been reading and re-reading these authors stories for years though.

--------------

This list is in no particular order

--------------

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1178165/picascribit][Picascribit]] is an occasionally dark author, but her depictions of RL/SB are very well fleshed out and gritty. If you like these two you should definitely read her [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3289010/1/Survivor-s-Guilt-Padfoot-s-Tale][Survivors Guilt]] stories. They're both told from either RL or SBs point of view and are an almost cannon retelling of the events from POA. Those stories also have a nice seperate ending story of how the two spent the summer after POA.

--------------

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1546225/remuslives23][Remuslives23]] is an interesting author who can go from unusual AUs to very very raunchy smut. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6377440/1/Perfect-Strangers][Perfect Strangers]] is probably a good indicator of that. It's kind of a murder mystery love story. It's the first story I read by that author, but I kept reading afterwards.

--------------

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/866426/Children-of-the-Shadows][Children of the Shadows]] is probably my favourite SB/RL author. She's well loved amoung the community. She wrote the mammoth story [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857261/1/Momentum][Momentum]] which has over 2,000 reviews. People love it. It's a retelling of RL/SBs lives from childhood on to after the potters pass away and more. That said I love her story [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4390076/1/Dating-Remus-Lupin][Dating Remus Lupin]] even more. Her snarky well developed lupin and the twist ending are /amazing/. Her slightly authistic depiction of remus in [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7947409/1/Remus-Lupin-s-Guide-to-Successful-Courting][Remus Lupins Guide to Successful Courting]] is adorable and set in a non magical AU.

--------------

I should include this because it's probably the most popular RL/SB story out there, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3378356/1/Casting-Moonshadows][Casting Moon Shadows]], but I personally don't like it.

--------------

My favourite out of the ones listed is probably dating remus lupin. It has all the feels, is well told, very funny at times and is only 11 chapters long. Using the authors I've listed you'll find thousands of stories. All you need to do is search the authors favourite stories and you'll find more and more!

Hope that helped!

** Sam Storyteller's [[http://sam-storyteller.dreamwidth.org/97242.html][Reclamation]] is an excellent, if haunting AU piece that centers on Remus, Sirius, and Thomas Gaunt, Hogwarts Professor. It's one of the finest short stories that one is likely to encounter in the fandom.

An excellent, complete, novel-length, Remus-centric story is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6275865/1/Remus-Lupin-PI][Remus Lupin, PI]] by Larry Huss. Huss's writing has a muted, Jack Vance style of humor peppered throughout his work that I find entertaining.
