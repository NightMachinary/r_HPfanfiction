What initially attracts you to a fanfiction before you even get to the details of the story? If it's the title, what about the title attracts you? If it's the little summary, what kind of things do you think work best? If it's the art on the cover, what works and what doesn't? I'd love to hear what you all think!

*P.S. - I'm putting this in the HP Fanfiction community because I want to know what specifically about HP fics are attractive before one reads the actual story.*


** The summary must contain an actual premise. I see so many summaries that's just like a random line from the fic, or some incomprehensible attempt at a poem, and they've got nothing to indicate what about this fic is supposed to be special or why we should read it instead of the next one down.

Also having half the summary just be a list of tropes and pairings is a big turn-off.

** An actual, functional summary, with bonus points for a decent title..

​

And a massive red flag for myself personally is if i see a story that's 426 chapters with a total length of 62000 words..

​

I don't do drabbles, prompts or snippets.. If you can fit your entire chapter on a post card with space left over i am out..

** The summary. If it's a part of the story, fine. Just don't make it irrelevant to the actual plot. Poems suck, so do “sorry my summary is so bad but please read.” I like titles as well. If I'm looking at time travel fics and the title says, “Harry Potter and the Time Turner,” that's a no from me. For me a good title corresponds to the fic, but not so much that you wouldn't really pick up on it. A well known fic that fits this description is Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run.

** The first thing I look at while searching for stories is the cover art. Some authors have use the same cover for all their stories so if the author is one I like I check it out.

Then there is the title. I have come across titles like Harry Potter smut one shots or Ron bashing and just ignore them. If the title essentially tells what happens in the story I don't read it.

Then I read the summary and check for tags I don't like reading like bashing, harem and such and drop it. Same with the pairings like Petunia/Harry or Troll/Hermione. If after all this I am still curious about the fic I check it out. If I find a trope that is rare in the fandom like good Dumbledore I check them out.

** The title doesn't matter a lot to me, but google translated latin makes me less likely to click. It's kind of pretentious and honestly how many published books actually have latin titles today? Just name your fanfic whatever you typed into google translate.

A summary that actually summarizes the premise of the story and has good punctuation is key. If your summary is in all lowercase letters then I'm immediately going to assume the whole story is that way. If there's a quote from the story or a poem I immediately disregard it.

Honestly the most important thing is if your summary intrigues me and that the tags or characters fit what I had in mind. Summaries that explain the right amount are hard because if you add too much then you've given away the story, but if it's too little then the reader won't know what they're getting into. If an author can write a good summary then I have a lot more hope that the fic will be well written.

** Besides the title and summary, I also look at the follow, review, and favorite counts. It's not the best heuristic, but if enough others like a story, it's a reasonable bet that I might, as well. It doesn't mean that I won't read things with very few of them, and I've detested some stories with several thousand, but I figure my tastes aren't unique enough to ignore them.

** First, I look at the details under the summary. Then, I look at the summary.

- Properly labeled relationshps.
- >100k words
- Completed
- Not having Draco/Hermione/Harry/etc, Snape/Hermione/Harry/etc. Nothing against Slash, it's just not my cup of tea. That, and I don't like Snape/Draco. Arseholes.
- No Mpreg. Magic is a wonderful thing that allows lots of things. But that will always be a turd baby in my eyes.

Cover art doesn't even matter to me. I have that hidden on my phone.

For the summary: Must contain an actual premise. Contains at least a passable usage of the english language that doesn't make my eyes bleed.

THEN, I skip to the final chapter and make sure it's actually completed and not abandoned and marked as complete. This triggers me to no end.

​

Of course, there are exceptions to every rule. Like if it has >4k favorites. Or comes highly recommended on reddit.

** 1. Completeness - incomplete stories are big no no unless recently updated. Otherwise it's dead and probably ended on cliffhanger where author written themselves into a corner.
2. Characters/pairings, Genre.
3. Summary.
4. Information density - some stories go in too much detail about *everything*. Sometimes all of that detail never gets mentioned again. Do we /really/ need half a chapter dedicated to enchantments on Harry's new glasses?
5. Action to filler ratio of first couple of chapters.
6. Ease of reading.

** It's mix between the summery and the tags. In case of ffn mostly the characters and/or ships. Then there is the word count most of the time I filter for stories that have at least 40k words, because then I know the author's muse has the stamina to inspire a decent story. Opposed to oneshots, drabbles etc.

** I think to me open-ended questions are one of the things that intrigue me in the summary. Then there's the problem of pairings. Once I started a story where the author claimed they were unsure of who is going to end up with whom and so pairings weren't tagged. And so I started the fic and contacted the author. Guess what? They were planning to include a pairing I disliked and all the final pairings were going to be canon ones. All of this is to say I want to know the final pairings even before I start. On ffn that's difficult as not all pairings are mentioned.

** summary definitely - like a catchy title is nice, but to be fair, unless it's a story i absolutely adore/has a deep impression, they're just going to fade to the back of my mind anyways

but a good, intriguing summary selling the main points of the story? count me in - esp if the summary shows what makes the fic different from the others

and also you know how some authors put like small snippets of their work into the summary - if that's a particularly intriguing part - that really draws me into the fic (but also a thing is like some snippets do the opposite and sort of just drives me off?)

but anyways yea a good summary definitely, but tbh if im searching the tags/if the writer has something that i had the urge to read (like a particular trope/pairing) then im most probably going to click on it too - so i guess in some sense also the tags on the story!! (okay i know we're talking about like attracts here but i gotta add - when i see a pairing that im just really not into, even tho it's got an attractive summary, sometimes ill just skip the fic and come back to it wayyyyy later if i ever get to accept the particular pairing)

anyways ive no idea how this turned into rambling but yeaaa

basically if you write a fic and it's somewhat interesting then ill read it (ha practically consuming fanfics everyday doesn't leave room for being picky honestly)
