Is there any other fics like linkffn(Physical Education by Adrian Tullberg) where Deadpool teaches at Hogwarts or is in Hogwarts or something like that?


** Well, sort of. In "Thinking in Little Green Boxes", he adopts Harry. Which means he visits Hogwarts occasionally while Harry is there. And Harry acts like a miniature Deadpool.

  A certain young wizard ends up at 4 Privy Drive instead of 4 Privet Drive. He is raised with loving care by a cuddly Merc with a Mouth. WARNING: now with 19.96% more Death Eaters and a Rodent of Death.

  Deadpool receives a job as Argus Filch's Assistant Caretaker at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Features much insanity, hijinks, bedlam, and shameless destruction of the fourth wall, all brought to you by everyone's favorite mercenary. Pure insidious crack.

"Deadpool, whose real name is Wade Wilson, is a disfigured and mentally unstable mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. The character is known as the "Merc with a Mouth" because of his talkative nature and tendency to break the fourth wall, which is used by writers for humorous effect and running gags."

EDIT: Or a bot can do it for me, I suppose.
