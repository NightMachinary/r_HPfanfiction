:END:
this is probably a weird request, but i have an extremely severe anxiety disorder and until recently used reading fanfics to cope. unfortunately my anxiety has gotten so bad that im now getting anxious at nearly all conflict in the stories, which is making things really difficult.

a solution ive found is to read fics with OP harry who curb stomps all his enemies. i know the quality isnt necessarily good, but theyre filling my time and keeping me going.

the sorts of fics ive read so far are things like harry crow, hp and the daft morons, angry harry and the seven, wizards fall, etc. basically stories where even if something bad happens you know it doesnt really matter because the protagonists cant lose.

im fine with bashing, slash, any ships, any quality of writing. the longer the better.

and yes im aware this is fucking dumb, id challenge my brain to a fist fight if i could but alas ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


** I'm sorry, I have no recommendations, but I just have to say this: /Nothing about this is fucking dumb/. You are coping, and pretty healthily too. So don't drag yourself down, please. You're worth much more than that.

*** yea, compared to drug use or whatever reading fanfic is very healthy... shouldn't feel bad about that.

one might also want to look into TextToSpeech options,which allows one to move around and do stuff while enjoying fanfic.

** Pretty much anything by mjimeyg on ffnet should fit the bill. Maybe start with one of the most light-hearted, linkffn(Harry Brown by mjimeyg). Most of his fics are crossovers, but they're well-written enough that even when crossing over with stuff I'm unfamiliar with they were easy to follow.

Also, I will likely never stop recommending linkffn(Adorable Violence).

** Linkffn(13491812; 13426602) are both great, but they're fairly short. If you're looking for something to keep you busy for a while, and are okay with other fandoms, then linkffn(Ashes of the Past) is a nearly two-/million/ word Peggy Sue Pokemon fic with a light enough tone that, even when characters are in genuine danger, it never feels too tense.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes.

I think I'd also recommend Albus and Harry's World Trip linkffn(13388022) It's about Harry becoming OP. Harry is expelled after the Chamber of Secrets, so Dumbledore takes a sabbatical and becomes Harry's personal tutor.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** I'm currently in the process of writing a time travel fix-it fic where Harry's in Slytherin and nobody dies. I don't /think/ it'll make you anxious, but it can get slightly angsty in the second chapter since it goes over a bit of Harry's abuse with the Dursleys, but most of it is more me "telling" you rather than "showing" you. I just finished posting the fourth chapter like a day ago and the fic's currently 20k words long.

** I have a bit of a list for you since I have the same problem. I keep fics that are interesting without making me anxious ready for re-reading.

*Nice Things* linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23243857]])

#+begin_quote
  An adorable Drarry fic in which Harry is touch starved and Draco basically keeps petting him. It's all soft and there's no conflict and everything's gentle and nice. It also scratches my itch for fun reactions from Harry's friends without them reacting negatively, if you know what I mean.
#+end_quote

*Conditionally* linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19456585/chapters/46310860]])

#+begin_quote
  This fic is not soft, but every scene that you would think would have the worst conflict is perfectly written as to not make you anxious at all. Not sure if it's on purpose, but very skillfully done. It's a fic in which Harry learns Snape is his biological father. Read the first two scenes to see what I mean with the conflict avoidance. If that second scene doesn't make you anxious, the rest of the fic shouldn't either.
#+end_quote

*The Rigmarole Dance* linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23723497]])

#+begin_quote
  Best fic for a good laugh and happy feels. Harry has two braincells and one of them is focussed on the snitch, the other on the fact Lord Thomas Marvolo Slytherin, High Warlock of England, is his soulmate.
#+end_quote

*Seventh Horcrux* linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux]])

#+begin_quote
  Hilarious fic in which Harry has all the memories of Voldemort, and therefore basically /is/ Voldemort. It's pure crack.

  After resurrecting himself with the philosophers stone, Tom Riddle realises he's tired of being a dark lord and decides to be the new DADA teacher instead. One of the most excellent and heartwarming series from Tom's POV I've ever read. He basically adopts Harry as well, even though Harry knows he's Voldemort.

  Similar vibe to The Rigmarole Dance by the author of Conditionally. In this one Marcus Flint decides he'll woo Harry Potter, and Harry is bemused but finds himself kind of charmed anyway.

  This one might not be for you depending on what kind of conflict sets you off. For me it tends to be preventable mistakes that I can see the characters make while they make them. This fic has conflict, and is brutal. But since Harry always does his best it doesn't make me anxious. Any time he dies he travels back in time so he can try again, which might make this similar enough to those OP Harry story's that you'll like it as well. He definitely curb stomps his enemies (well, after dying a whole lot and becoming very paranoid)

I hope you at least enjoy some of these! :)

  Marcus Flint doesn't really know what to do with his life after his father dies; his father always told him what to do. So he consults a piece of obsidian, and it directs him to Harry Potter. And, well, Potter has friends, but he doesn't have a husband...
