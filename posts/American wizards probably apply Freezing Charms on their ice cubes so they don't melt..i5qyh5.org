This way they can always have ice cubes on their person and they can put them in everything and everywhere as they are so prone to do.


** Muggles have these, they're just metal squares you put in the freezer.

*** I was more thinking along the lines of having ice cubes in their pockets or purse so they could always have some on them wherever they are.

***** Doing so subtracts the need to conjure them and doesn't need you to potentially perform magic in front of Muggles.

**** I mean, I've been to Europe (albeit over a decade ago), and I don't remember them not doing it. But I also didn't really pay attention to whether or not my drinks had ice.

****** At most Germans and Dutchmen add one or two cubes (unless at McD or some such), Americans fill the cup with ice, then add some drink

At least in my experience

****** The southest part of southeast Asia. Maybe because it's way too hot here? A universal drink with ice cubes that you can get literally anywhere is iced tea with a third part of it being ice cubes. Malls, restaurants, roadside food hawkers, you name it. Recently, bottled iced coffee also got popular here with people usually serving it at home with added ice cubes despite its already cold temp

** I love it. Headcanon adopted. And it's probably flashy ice, with sparkles or lights or bright colors, usually charmed so No-Majs can't see them but one who did see it came up with the idea of those plastic LED ice cubes that flash colors. People buy/make containers to hold their ice cubes and they're personalized.
