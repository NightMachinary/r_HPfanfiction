** I'm reading Momentum right now, it's not as good as ATYD but it's been pretty okay through what I've read.

Let me know if you come across something as good as ATYD I can't get over it.

  When 11-year old James Potter is admitted in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he is not prepared to clash against prefect Lucius Malfoy, who devises a mysterious plot with the aid of the unlikeable first-year Severus Snape. Follow James as he and his three new friends, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew, learn to work together against the growing evil.

** There's a lot by Grasspaw(I think). Warning: lots of wolfstar. My personal favorite of their marauders fics is Saving Sirius, but they've got a lot of good stuff. They also wrote one of my favorite silly fics, '101 Things Albus Dumbledore Won't Allow'.

Also, the marauders One-shots from Daily-Chan's Bond of Family series.

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to discover there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.
