Muggles can't get enough, and it is now the world's favorite pastime. Ron Weasley, pro has-been, is now coach and captain of a failing minor league team, and there's only one thing that can save them. Convincing his best mate to come play for them! Just a wild hare idea I had. Maybe it's been done. In my mind, it's got a “Brockmire” vibe to it.


** Well, you aren't wrong in what would bring the two worlds together. Entertainment, beauty care, and healthcare would be the three major ones, and everyone goes crazy for sports.

*** I've seen an alternative version where catching the Snitch ends the game, but loses the catching team 50 points. You still have Seeker battles, but instead of being for the Snitch, one is trying to stop the other in any way possible, and the other is trying to get the Snitch before they lose their advantage.

Minor modifications can help a lot with it.

***** People who like sports? And writing? Sports rom-coms are a pretty decently popular genre outside of HP, especiallyin the hockey fandom, and so are sports action and sports slice of life. It's easy to see why someone would want to write about quidditch.

  Ron Weasley, an aging quidditch player in the middle of possibly the biggest game of his life, looks back at the places where his life changed for the better and the worse. Book 7 compliant but not epilogue compliant.

***** "Nothin's funnier than a fart. except maybe kids falling off bikes, fuck I'll watch kids fall off bikes all day; I don't give a shit about your fucking kid"

But I doubt it would be very difficult to charm softer balls to fly around like bludgers for kiddy games, and even lower the impact of the snitch down to something reasonable like 25 or 50. Actually I like the idea of having the value of the snitch not be a multiple of 10 to avoid ties, tiebreakers like golden goals and shootouts always feel like a cheap way to end a game
