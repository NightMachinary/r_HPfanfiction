I've been spending some time with my 11-year-old cousin which has gotten me to realize how different her thinking process is from mine. She's very well behaved and actually somewhat mature for her age, but she's still naive, avoids learning as much as she can get away with, and doesn't understand how limited her understanding of the world is. The saying "the more you learn the more aware you are your ignorance" is really true - part of maturing is realizing you don't have to do/know everything yourself and should have people to depend on.

Comparing my cousin to Harry in the early books, they're very similar - kind and polite, but not interested in putting a lot of effort in school or other activities that would benefit them in the longterm. They also don't like having adults involved in their shenanigans. My brother (who is 17) also acts a lot like canon-Harry at that age - convinced he's the only one who can solve problems and no one else knows what they're doing. Neither of them are aware of issues or events that are not directly affecting them or witnessed by them, which is probably why the world building is incomplete in the 7 canon books - it would have been bad writing to just drop all of that on us.

I'm re-reading a LF about a more competent Harry and it reads like a miniature adult, not like an actual child. It also reads like a manual on the Wizarding World. I love this story because of those two facets of it, but I wouldn't have understood it or liked it as a preteen or even teenager.


** At the risk of all the downvotes that I will get from people who disagree with me on it, here is is my unpopular opinion:

​

If you go down that route then no 11 year old can do what Harry did at 11 and I'm sure no 12 year old can fight a snake, let alone a giant snake with a sword. No 11 year old is destined to fight the greatest terrorist, and certainly no school is allowed to run the way Professor Dumbledore ran his school.

​

I don't really understand this strange desire to dumb down kids and force them to be boring, uninteresting but realistic 11 year old kid. This is fiction. Anything strange can be chalked up to presence of magic. Personally, I don't even mind an 11 year old wizard or witch acting with maturity of a grown up person, because it's magical world with supernatural powers. Just say that magic enhances the growth of their minds just as magic strengthened their body.

​

In the books Harry is far from typical real life 11 yer old kid. And even if he was an 11 year old kid in canon, a fanfiction writer going through pain of writing his own story deserve to write the characters any way they want for their story. It's not like they are earning money from it, or forcing people to read their stuff.

*** I totally agree with you. Not only Harry, but everyone of the Ministry Six is totally exceptional and outstanding. Their mental toughness rivals or even exceeds veteran Navy Seals and SAS operatives. A fraction of what they had gone through is enough to reduce average adults to PTSD basket cases and completely break average teenagers.

There's nothing average about Harry and his closest friends.

12 year olds have been child soldiers before. In medieval times, a 12 year old would have been serving as a page and have a firm grounding in combat training, only two years away from graduating to becoming a squire.

Like, 10 years ago a 4 year old dressed as a Power Ranger attacked two robbers with a plastic sword who had been holding a gun to his older sister's head. Don't underestimate what a kid is willing or able to do.

** Harry went to McGonagall about the stone. He wanted an adult before they went into the chamber. He asked Lupin to help him with the dementors. I mean, he even tried to talk to Dumbledore about Draco in book 6.

He was just shut down repeatedly, which is actually very typical of older adults.

The only adult that ever heeded his warnings was Mr. Weasley.

No, a caregiver ignoring a child's fears in extreme situations is not normal.

I mean you might expect the police to ignore a child insisting that the school shooting was being done by aliens, as they have other things to do. But you would expect one of the care givers to sit and listen to them, even if only because letting kids wallow in their fears alone is not healthy

**** To be honest, McGonagall has no reason to believe someone is after the stone and he did rival/argue with Draco and Snape for 6 years. And I don't really see them as his caregivers.

And what I mean by "shut him down" is "we are older therefore we are correct and you are wrong" which regularly happens in the real world.

The stone was moved into the school explicitely for safekeeping, as there had been attempts to steal it from its previous locations. Snape got visibly injured trying to confront a theft attempt. There really is no justification for McGonagall to think that the stone is safe at any point of the story.

That is, no justification except author fiat. The same reason why Dumbledore thought a broom to be the most effective way to reach the ministry from fucking Scotland.

****** Sometimes I chuckle to myself about how truly emblematic Dumbledore's decision to fly to the Ministry is of JK Rowling's biggest (imo) flaw.

Convenience writing. JK often envisions a plot point or a scene, and then she makes it happen regardless of what that forces her to do to continuity, worldbuilding or character. And no single decision shows this more than the choice for Dumbledore to fly to the Ministry.

In Book 1, Dumbledore uses a broom to fly to the Ministry. At this time, the decision is perfectly logical and character/world consistent.

In Book 2, JK overrules that by introducing Floo Powder. Later books and scenes confirm that you can Floo to/from Hogwarts (or at least that Dumbledore could, as Headmaster, given that he can Apparate and even students can Floo-Call like in GoF when Harry talks to Sirius). Now, Dumbledore looks like he chose a multiple hour flight over an easily accessible less than 30 second journey.

In Book 3, JK adds another potential issue, with the Knight Bus. This one is arguable, as there's no guarantee you could call the Knight Bus from Hogwarts and take it to the Ministry any faster than a broom. Especially given you'd likely need to leave the grounds first. However, it's possible.

In Book 4, she does it again. Portkeys. Later books and scenes confirm that Dumbledore is capable of creating one, and able/allowed/willing to do so without any Ministry pre-approval or paperwork etc as often stipulated in fanon. Again, we ask why Dumbledore took a several hour flight over a Portkey.

In Book 5, yep, she does it again. Dumbledore flashes out of his office using Fawkes. Since Fawkes is almost always by Dumbledore's side and otherwise will come instantly at his call, this is even more convenient than Portkeys or the Floo. However, we're not given any information on its' maximum range, so potentially this could be a worse option than flying (except that one could still fly part way and Phoenix-Travel the rest, or vice versa).

Book 6, Apparition. Confirmed later that Dumbledore is capable of apparating from Hogwarts to the Ministry. Absolutely inexcusable to fly instead of turn once on your heel.

Book 7, Dobby transports 3+ magical humans with his House Elf magic. Dumbledore, as Headmaster, has immediate access to literally dozens of House Elves. So why not use one of them if for some reason the Floo, Portkeys, Fawkes and Apparition are all out of the picture for some reason?

Obviously, these aren't necessarily the first instances we get of each of these travel methods (apparition is used and referenced pre-HBP, for example) but these are at least the points in which we either get crucial confirmation that they would be an option (prior to Dobby's rescue in DH, I don't believe we had any info on whether House Elves could transport Wizards, even though we knew they could transport themselves since CoS) or the points in which they are most relevant and play the largest role. (Fawkes in OotP).

Literally every single book, with the possible exception of PoA depending on your take on the Knight Bus, introduces or makes heavy use of a transport mechanism that would be infinitely preferable on all axes to the one that Dumbledore chose to use, especially given the circumstances of leaving the Stone unprotected for the duration of his Ministry visit. This is not because JK wants us to conclude that Dumbledore is an idiot, or a chessmaster engineering Harry's conflict with Quirrell (despite the fact that many of us do conclude that) but simply because she needed him to be out of the picture for her grand finale that she envisioned, and then in later books she needed more effective transport methods for other reasons, and never thought to consider how they'd retroactively effect her previous plots and the characters involved.

It's a fairly minor thing, when compared to some of Dumbledore's more damaging or egregious decisions/fuck-ups (keeping Harry in the dark about the Prophecy, not noticing Fake!Moody) but it perfectly serves as an example of the trend.

****** I should've phrased that better. The stone, regardless of why it was there, was not going to be taken, which McGonagall knew. Or maybe, she trusted Dumbledore's prowess enough to trust it wouldn't have been stolen. Either way she should've explained that to Harry, but for plot reasons she didn't. I would also like to reiterate that older adults really don't explain things to kids.

Not even just plot reasons. Older adults pretty typically feel no need to explain themselves to children. It's his first year, what reason does she have to expect three eleven-year-olds will try to protect the stone. At least by book six she's like "Why is it always you three?"

** I always hear people saying they hate OOTP because Harry was so insufferable and so ~angst~, but I never really understood the hate of his characterization because of those reasons ... I mean, he's 15 years old. I was an insufferable bitch at 15 years old. Most teenagers are. They think they're right about everything (like Harry becoming obsessive with Draco Malfoy being a Death Eater in HBP). Imo I think JKR wrote it very well.

*** I don't know about others, but the reason I hate the Harry in OOTP is because he really doesn't do much except whine all day... I mean, yeah, I understand he is a teenager and life's hardly fair no matter your age, but Harry wasn't in a normal situation. Voldemort just came back, he knew that Voldemort was trying to kill him (or putting that aside, that he has been in mortal danger at least 3 times a year), and that they shared a mental connection.

And yet, he never did anything to prepare for an inevitable confrontation unless he was told to. The DA? It was all Hermione' s idea. Granted he was apparently really good at teaching spells but that's it. And the occlumency lessons? While I believe Dumbledore made a mistake when he made Snape teach Harry, Harry never really tried to look for informations about it either.

And concerning Harry being obsessive about Malfoy being a DE? Well he was right, wasn't he? And the worst part was that no one believed him except for Dumbledore (because he already knew), and Dumbledore was perfectly happy with letting Draco murder half the school in an attempt to kill him so long as he could save Malfoy's soul...

** I disagree. It's the subject material that makes me wonder about Harry Potter. He has the ability to change the world at his fingertips, develop powers almost out of a comic, and does barely anything. It's his lack of wonder and imagination that get to me.

Fanon Harry who for some odd reason gets into adult relationships as a 12 year old or banter with McGonagall is just unrealistic to me. An 11 year old working hard to control the elements, to change the world with a flick of his wand, I find that a more realistic reaction.

Rowling definitely surpasses any fic writers in the wonder and prose category, but she really didn't understand the men very well, as well as putting cliches in teens.

Just because a person is a teenager, doesn't make them a hormonal know-it-all. It is more that they're prone to yell or get angry.

**** Honestly, when i first read the books i was just so confused by Harry because he seemed so uninterested in everything. He went from being abused and living in a cupboard below the stairs to living in a magical world where he could do literally anything he wanted just about, and all he seemed to want to do was get through life and just had no wonder about anything.

Hermione conversely made so much sense. She found out she had magic and absolutely dived right in and learned everything she could about it because holy fuck its cool. Reminded me of when everyone in my class discovered pokemon for the first time and we all dived in the deep end on that, or the kid who played like 700 hours of minecraft in a year because holy fuck its cool and interesting.

Harry just spent so much time complaining about homework and getting into petty fights that made very little sense to me for someone who should have been acting like a christian girl who just went off to college

He /was/ in awe, for like a week. Some notable things still get to him (like the two schools' arrival in Goblet of Fire), but he gets jaded because A) we see that living in magical society just kind of lends itself to that kind of acclimation, like a kid from the boondocks showing up in the big city for the first time, B) everyone just fucking loves reminding Harry that his parents are dead and he's famous for something he had no real agency in, C) nearly everything new and unusual winds up biting him in the ass, and D) he knows that at some point in the near future he's going to have to write 14 inches on everything he's supposed to be in awe of.

** Writing children and teenager in character and write a good story at the same time is a huge struggle.

One I'm struggling with all the time I write ff. Especially HP stories, because our canon characters are that age.

I have a marauder ear story that follows Lily Evans growing up and my aim is to write her and everybody realistical for their age and situation (the ongoing war). I started to write the story because I lost a connection and even respect for her when I read the 7th book and when I realized that I wanted to reconnect with this character and why she acted as she did.

But I know it is not the most exciting story out there and more of an over long character piece.

But everybody has to figure out for themselves what they like to write and read. Idon't like children acting as babies or as mini-adules, it pulls me out of a story. Others don't have the patience for them to grow up

I can't imagine any child going through near death experiences every year and not come out more determined to never be placed in that situation again.

Sure he learned the Patronus Charm but that was because of the threat introduced in PoA. I'm not even sure he even bothered to ask how to defend against them before the second time he was attacked.

It irritates me that someone like that doesn't actively learn how to protect himself when he's never seen any adults actually help him until well after the situation had been resolved.
