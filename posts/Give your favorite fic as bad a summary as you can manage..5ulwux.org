I kind of subverted [[/u/Conneron]]'s [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5uh6eq/summarise_your_favourite_longfic_in_under_400/][thread]] a bit yesterday (sorry bro xD). So let's dedicate this to ruining our favorite stories with summaries that contain as many red flags as possible!

Points given for humor, creativity and twisting the author's intentions. No more than 400 characters please (as per ff.net) - paste your summary [[http://www.lettercount.com/][here]] to get a count.

For posterity:

linkffn(On the Way to Greatness)

/What if Harry was a Slytherin? What if he made friends with Blaise Zabini and Millicent Bulstrode? What if he was tempted by dark magic? What if he slowly expanded his social circle over the years? What if he tried to dance the line between dark and light? What if he tried to make backroom deals with the Ministry? P.S. I SUCK AT SUMMARIES!!!/

linkffn(A Black Comedy)

/Harry Potter falls in the veil and travels to a new dimension! He finds Sirius and they steal from death eaters, fight the ministry and have so much sex! (eww not with each other! but with many hotties!). But WHO is the mysterious wizard in black?! and Bella becomes their slave?!! Dumbledore and Voldemort better watch out! Better than it sounds. DON'T LIKE DON'T READ. Please read and review!/

and a new one,

linkffn(Contractual Invalidation by R-dude)

/A certain green-eyed messy-haired hero is contracted to marry a certain coldly beatiful ice-princess. She isn't happy! Why is that imbecile Potter insisting on dating a Slytherin like her. Is this dating or is it war? Sparks will fly, mayhem and annoyance will be felt! But can the dishy Auror thaw the beauty's cold heart? And what mischief Harry is planning at the ministry! 50 REVIEWS=NEW CHAPTER/

It is very often so that fics are abandoned with no explanation, are the ones with the most promise.

There are several thousand fics on just ff.net alone, and I would think that less than 3% are still continued to this day.

It sadens me to see fics abandoned with no real way of gaining momentum again.

It breaks my heart that Fire Born stopped, I really loved it. It had, according to me, the perfect start, a great way to see the "master of death" and a real feeling of comradery between Tom and Harry (though this may be because of the fact it didn't get far).

I saw so much potential, ...and it pains me to see it just beeing there on my favorites list and expect there to be .. no updates... ever...

** Harry gets scared of Voldemort trying to kill him. Experimental magic will even those odds! But a side effect has given Harry a new quest: have sex with anything with legs, and deride anyone who doesn't agree with him! Also murdering Death Eaters is cool.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

#+begin_quote
  Harry thought he would die; had anticipated it, even. So now what will he do in this new world, one without magic? Not to say that there isn't power lurking here... With snakes calling him 'Lord', and everyone else saying 'Abomination', is it any surprise that he's not going to have an easy time settling down? Subtle HP AU. Eventual Naruto AU. Slow paced. Rated M; Dark Themes.
