We all have those characters we love, but who are some characters you feel are under used in stories?

Charlie and Bill are rather under used in my opinion. Which, is so strange, they're actual relatives of the Weasley's, siblings of Ron, have cool jobs, you could do a lot with either of them.

Lee Jordan is often under used, he might get mentions alongside Fred and George, but all in all doesn't usually do much.

While Blaise and Daphne are popular characters to use, on the flip side of things, I'd say Tracey and Theodore aren't used as often.

Alicia Spinnet isn't as mentioned like Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, even though they're all on the Gryffindor Quidditch team.

Zacharias Smith tends to be used as that jerk ward character in pretty much all fics involved in him, and he doesn't usually evolve from that.

Colin and Dennis Creevey might get mentions but rarely do anything great or interesting in fanfictions.

To name just some of them. Who are some of yours?


** Frankly, I see Tracey and Daphne used almost in equal amounts, as in the fandom they're almost always paired together some way if they play any role in the story at all. Lovers, Best friends, worst enemies, but you can bet if Daphne plays a big role in the fanfic, that Tracey will play nearly as big a role as well. Also, I've noticed that Nott actually gets more attention than Lee Jordan. He generally acts as a foil to Draco. If Draco is the father's son and a Death Nibbler, Theodore will typically be the white sheep of a dark family. If Draco is neutralized or dies early on in the story, Theodore will be used to fill the slot of "Nasty Slytherin"

Frankly, if anyone is underutilized, I'd say it's most of the Order of the Pheonix. I mean, how much do we know about Emmaline Vance and Hestia Jones, or the original order(Caradoc Dearborn, Marlene McKinnon, etc)?

While Tracey appears almost as often as Daphne, she is often reduced to "Daphne's friend". I would like to see her more as her own character with her own goals and thoughts, and not just the Ice Queen morale conscience/ hype girl.

That being said, I agree that most of the members of the Order (outside of the usual Sirius/ Weasleys/ Moody . . .) are underused, and often completely ignored.

** I think that it's not just which characters are underused but how they're used. I feel like characters like Bill and Remus aren't used for their skills so much as a sex object. Like Remus' condition is rarely mentioned unless it's for angst, woe is me or sex rather than as someone who is fairly magic proof and a dark creature and therefore able to interact with dark curses and stuff more safely than others

I'd also love to see more Minerva McGonagall as a spy or vigilante/freedom fighter during the first war

I agree that Dung is hella underused, and so is Alberforth Dumbledore for that matter. Mrs Figg too

Also Agree with Lee Jordan and Alicia Spinnet

And there will never be enough Theo Nott or Regulus Black for my tastes

** Hagrid in canon has more page time than anyone outside the trio, I'm pretty sure, but if you're immersed in fanfiction you could forget he's a character. He's also worked at Hogwarts for 50 years, knew Tom Riddle in school, is the product of an impossible union of giant and human, and is simultaneously a sweet mimbo and an expert on the most dangerous magical beasts in the world. His underutilization in fanfic is /criminal/.

** Peter Pettigrew. His role in fanfictions is either the exact same as in canon, or then he gets caught and punished earlier after which his part in the story is over. But where are the stories where Pettigrew doesn't go hiding, but continues living in wizarding Britain as one of the war veterans with possibly only a few very high-ranking Death Eaters being aware of him being one of them? He could renounce Voldemort and become a respected person among the good guys, causing them a massive dilemma once the truth about him is eventually revealed. Or he could continue being a spy for Voldemort and have a massive role during the next war. How about a redemption story where he betrays Voldemort in a way that is necessary for the good guys to win, and then gives up his life? So many unique and interesting stories wasted just because people like Sirius and loathe Pettigrew.

Another character is Cho Chang. I don't like stories with romance as the main focus, but I would be interested to read a story in which Harry manages to form a functioning relationship with Cho during his fourth year. Cho was a really important person for Harry for a time, but I've never encountered a story in which Harry and Cho start dating and she becomes an important source of comfort, encouragement, and motivation to him.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

Merlin and the Founders are absolutely overused (yeah, with reason), but it would be nice to see more of other historical characters such as Herpo the foul.

Colin and Dennis are definitely underused. Other students in general actually, Dean and Seamus are mostly used for some comment once or twice about the other students position on a matter, Terry Boot (potentially descendant of the American family that helped founding Ilvermorry), all non-British students that could be used as an inn on other culture's magics, the only Hufflepuff that is frequently used is Zacharias (though more as a mini-Skeeter rather than an original character) and Susan&Hanna (as an in with her aunt, Hell, most stories I see have those too being so co-dependent and behave so much like one another that they basically count as a single character).

** Ironically, I think it's Molly Weasley. Sure there are a lot of stories of her doing all the things she did in canon not out of kindness but because she was a money grabbing minion of Dumbledore who brewed illegal love potions and wanted Ron to snag Hermione and Ginny to get Harry even if Harry and Hermione were either in love with each other or in love with other people. But right now I can't remember stories that explore her just as she is: a generally kind person and mum having a bit of a hard time caring for her large family but still had an open heart to take Harry under her wing.

I am aware of her faults such as her gullibility and "overbearingness" - - canon shows her believing Skeeter's articles about Hermione and her disliking of Fleur among her other human flaws - - and I don't want anyone to whitewash those issues. But I'd like to see a fic that explores just how the heck does she make ends meet for her whole family. How does she budget stuff? What are the charms and spells she knows for food preparation and other housekeeping chores? What is her dynamic with Arthur? That kind of stuff. Perhaps even a loose "Julie and Julia" thing where Fleur or Hermione get to understand their mother in law and themselves better through cooking.
