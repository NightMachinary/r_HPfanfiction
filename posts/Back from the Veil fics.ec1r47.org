There's a fic out there that I read ages ago where Hermione summons dead Black men from the Veil and they become soul-bound to her. (What's That Fic, by the way?) What other (good grammar, well-written, preferably long and interesting) fics are there where Sirius or someone else is brought back via the Veil?


** Linkffn(Arx Domus Nigrae) for the first.

Linkffn(The Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie) would qualify for your second request, I think.
