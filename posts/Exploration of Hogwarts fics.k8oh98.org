Recently read linkffn(10473427) and really enjoyed it. I was wondering if anyone can link me some food fics which have this sort of explorer/lobar Harry that gets bored and just walks off and does other things to keep occupied.

** i love the concept, Hogwarts is my favorite character in the series. I couldn't read past two vignettes in the story you linked, though. If you're going to have Harry speak condescending to someone while explaining everything about magic and having him generally know everything, at least make the person he's talking to not a professor with decades more of experience in learning and teaching. I mean, honestly, make the tagalong character a first year or something, McGonagall's actions in the story are indistinguishable from one anyway.
