  "The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...." --- Sybill Trelawney's prophecy made to Albus Dumbledore[src] (Taken from the Harrypotter.fandom wiki)
#+end_quote

So, I'm no English teacher, but wouldn't 'he will have power the Dark Lord knows not' just mean that Harry is more powerful than the Dark Lord is aware of? If it was referring to a specific ability, wouldn't it be 'he will have A power the Dark Lord knows not'?

So, the Dark Lord will mark him as having the same amount of power, but the Chosen One will have more power than the Dark Lord knows about and that power will be enough to vanquish him, no?

EDIT Take II - Reading the comments over has shown me that I'm not really elucidating my point terribly clearly so, to clarify, all I'm asking is why the line 'he will have power the Dark Lord knows not' is interpreted to mean a specific power (be it love or making great cheese toasties) that Voldemort doesn't know and not him just having more power than the Dark Lord knows about, an interpretation which fits far better with the grammar in my mind.

If the line was 'he will have a power the Dark Lord knows not', I'd be fine with the fanon interpretation that Harry has an ability that Voldemort doesn't know. But 'he will have power the Dark Lord knows not' doesn't refer to a specific power, only that Harry will be generally more powerful than the Dark Lord is aware of, as in 'he has aptitude that Voldemort knows not'.


** I don't understand why it's always formatted like that.

It should be like this:

#+begin_quote
  The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches...

  Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies...

  And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not...

  And either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives...

  The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies....
#+end_quote

I could have sworn it said "A power", not just "power", but if it's in the wiki it's in the wiki.

The whole thing comes down to linguistics, and a few tiny quirks in the english language - "He will have power the dark lord knows not" is a convoluted sentence, moreso than any of the others. The real banger is of course "he will have power", like you said, it can refer to "he's stronger", but not exclusively. In fact, it sounds more than a little weird if said like that.

Had he waited and said that he needed to wait for a few years, a great amount of followers would have abandoned him and there wasn't much he could do about it. Yes people would be afraid of betraying him, but Karakaroff managed to hide for quite a long time even though he betrayed all of the inner circle to which he belonged himself to the ministry so it wasn't like he was just some random guy.

*** This is exactly the point Rowling was trying to make! In fact, there is a whole scene in HBP where Dumbles is hammering this point into Harry's head. It all comes down to "If Voldemort had ignored the prophecy, nothing would happen. But he is so arrogant and so fearful he tried to nip you in the bud, thus destroying your life and leading to your living with the Dursleys, and now that he's attacked you like 5 times and killed Sirius, you would never give up would you? So due to each of your personalities, the prophecy is self-fulfilling and really doesn't matter. Voldie's too prideful to give up and you're too heroic to stop fighting, so you are locked in battle regardless of what Trelawney said 16 years ago."

** Iirc the power he knows not is more or less explicitly referred to as love. The "he knows not" portion has less to do with voldemort literally not knowing harry has that power, and more to mean that "the power harry has (love) is /literally uncomprehendable/ to voldemort". Some people assume that it's his conception via love potion that caused this inability to love bc of a misunderstood quote from jk, but that connection was supposed to be symbolic, not literal.

The reason Harry's love is crucial is because it's what allowed his side to win. Harry's selfless sacrifice born of love created a protection around his side (which the book references by showing the crucio and other such spells barely having an effect).

It's not that /a specific/ power is owned by Harry, but his love has a power in of itself, and it's because Voldemort will never truly /know/ love that Harry's love is "power he knows not".

**** "The power of love" that Dumbles refers to is EXPLICITLY what you claim it to be - he has friends and allies and the like. In fact, Dumbles claims that the prophecy is pretty much a load of bull. If Voldemort chose not to act on it, Harry would not have been orphaned or made a Horcrux, and thus all of canon would not have happened. But Voldemort was prideful and fearful, and thus once he heard the first part of the prophecy would of course act, and the prophecy was self-fulfilling.

Thing is, the rest of the prophecy is ALSO self-fulfilling. Harry isn't about to fight Voldemort because Trelawney predicted it before his was born. He does it because Voldemort orphaned him at a young age and Harry doesn't want anyone else to go through that. He does it because Voldemort restarted his war on Wizarding Society and Harry wants the violence to end. And more personally, he does it to prevent those whom he loves (Hermione, the Weasleys, Remus, etc.) to not fall in battle like Sirius did. Whether or not there is a prophecy, Harry has a "saving-people thing" and would never willingly stop fighting and hide.

So yes, there are plenty of times where "love" comes into play, whether from Harry, to Harry, or about Harry. A mother's love powers Lily's sacrifice, and causes Narcissa to lie on his behalf. His own love transfers that sacrifice to the entire Wizarding World when he is killed (which is stupid but nonetheless). the Resurrection Stone revives ghosts of his loved ones when he is too stunned to produce a Patronus.

And yet, none of that really matters, does it? Dumbledore could be wrong. Harry's personal power could be the Horcrux in his head allowing him to come back if Voldemort was stupid enough to tether Harry to life by taking Harry's blood into his body. In fact, "the power" could have been Harry's tendency to be underestimated by Voldie, or to be matched against such a moron as to make such convoluted plans and insist on one-on-one duels with escape routes plentiful, and so on. There are many ways to interpret this line, and not all of them have relation to love.

** Kinda reminds me of the Great Prophecy from Percy Jackson and the Olympians;

A half-blood of the eldest gods\\
Shall reach sixteen against all odds\\
And see the world in endless sleep The hero's soul cursed blade shall reap A single choice shall end his days Olympus to preserve or raze

Both the reader and the characters think it's all about one person, the aforementioned Half-Blood of the Eldest Gods, as half-bloods are also commonly referred to as heroes by gods, monsters, and other assorted members of the mythos. So they spend 80+ years attempting to prevent the birth of a half-blood from Hades, Poseidon, or Zeus and most of the books haveZeus contemplating and engaging in familicide towards his assorted nieces and nephews. But then in the end, Perseus Jackson, son of Poseidon is born and fights his way to his sixteenth birthday. And in the end we discover that it isn't his soul on the balance, he won't be reaped by Backbiter, Kronos' sickle reformed into a sword and actually capable of reaping souls. And it isn't his choice that will raise or raze Olympus and western civilization with it. It was Luke who was the Hero referred to in the second half of the prophecy, who had betrayed his family and fellow heroes to joins with Kronos to overthrow the gods. And it's his soul which may be reaped, not by the soul-reaping Backbiter, but by the very same dagger he had gifted the Annabeth when he saved her when she was seven and hiding from Cyclopes in a back alley. And in a moment of clarity he accepts the dagger from Perseus and uses it to kill himself, and Kronos with him, choosing not to allow Olympus and his family to be razed to the ground. So all along Perseus was only half of the prophecy, but also the only potentially identifiable character. The other wasn't even considered as a different person and could only be known as the prophecy played out.

** So, there's essentially three approaches we can take here:

We can take the text at face-value, and essentially treat it as "holy." We don't criticize the text, and instead try to make sense of it.

Or we recognize that it's a text that's written by a human, and thus doesn't inherently make sense, and may contain mistakes and plot-holes.

These are two ways to have this discussion, with neither being "better."

And the last one, we can take the original text as interpretation, but as fanfic authors we can do whatever the heck we want.

--------------

So, if we treat the text as holy, then we would have to ask why the characters make the choices that they do. Either they make a mistake, or they know what they're doing. Looking at Dumbledore and Voldemort, we get told multiple times, over and over, how brilliant they are at magic. Heck, the series /opens/ with how brilliant Dumbledore is!

#+begin_quote
  “I know you haven't,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you're different. Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.”

  “You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will never have.”
#+end_quote

So, both magically powerful people that we see in the series seem to have this interpretation, while Dumbledore himself is admitting that the prophecy may be self-fulfilling, or was open to interpretation. But through the wording *and* the actions of Voldemort, the definition narrowed down.

#+begin_quote
  “I am afraid,” said Dumbledore slowly, looking as though every word cost him a great effort, “that there is no doubt that it is you.”

  “But you said --- Neville was born at the end of July too --- and his mum and dad ---”

  “You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort. ... Voldemort himself would ‘mark him as his equal.' And so he did, Harry. He chose you, not Neville. He gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse.”
#+end_quote

Dumbledore seems to take a holistic perspective here:

- The prophecy was given to him, and Lord Voldemort heard part of it. So it's rather likely that it applies to them
- It can mean multiple people, but Voldemort (unknowingly) /chooses/ one.

And then, Dumbledore even takes into account his newest information:

#+begin_quote
  "It is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which Voldemort has not at all. That power took you to save Sirius tonight. That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests. In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your heart that saved you."
#+end_quote

Dumbledore, one of the most brilliant magic users around, uses all available information to come to his conclusions - the wording, the actions of those around him, and his deep knowledge of magic.

If you read the text from this perspective, I think trusting Dumbledore that his interpretation is correct is sensible! You can of course make the opposite argument, that Dumbledore is wrong, and Harry wins by the power of the Elder Wand, but that's a bit harder to justify with canon, imo.

--------------

Now, if you want to go the whole "plotholes" route, feel free. Rowling like the trope of the prohecized hero, and wanted to set up the Horcrux thingies and stuff, so she did what she had to do. It's a bit boring to discuss the text this way in my opinion, but go ahead.

--------------

And lastly, you're a fanfiction author! You can do whatever the hack you want! You can use the source material as inpiration. You can adopt it entirely, use my interpretation from above (or any other you want) and write your own story based on that. If you want to make Dumbledore the fool, and demonstrate that the "wise white old guy that knows best" isn't a cool trope, feel free to adopt it: have Dumbledore be wrong!

And if you want to go in a different direction entirely, that's your choice, too!

Anyway, this was a little more comprehensive than I intended, but yeah - that's the way you can look at the text.

*** Not poking plotholes or criticising Rowling, just quibbling over grammar. Also Dumbledore was out-thought by a twelve-year old in the Basilisk incident despite him having a fifty-year head start and a vaster amount of experience. Unless Hermione is even smarter than he supposedly was, his intelligence isn't that high a bar to beat in canon.

But again, not my point. Semantically, the line 'he will have power the Dark Lord knows not' refers to aptitude, not ability - as in, he will be more competent than the Dark Lord knows. Everyone keeps telling me that Rowling thought this meant that he could love where Voldemort couldn't and fandom's many suggestions for what ability Harry might have that Voldemort doesn't, but nobody has said why it's interpreted as Harry having an ability Voldemort doesn't instead of simply being more powerful like the grammar reads to me. 'Rowling did it first' isn't really a good argument to me, since fandom so often loves correcting her mistakes, perceived or actual.

If it was 'he will have a power the Dark Lord knows not', I'd have no issue here. I'd be like 'yep. Love. That's the one.' and say no more on it. It's just the fact that the line doesn't read as referring to a single thing.

To be fair, basilisks are never said to Petrify. And as you said, a fifty-year head start. This might also mean that there were other false clues, possibly planted by Riddle the first time around, that led Dumbledore astray.

Remember, there were other victims the first time it was opened. And they weren't killed. Which means they would've been able to say what they saw, right? Unless Riddle planned ahead and made sure they'd give explanations that didn't point at a snake at all.

The problem with this reasoning is that Hermione wholly trusts in Dumbledore. Even when Harry doesn't, she still does. So if Dumbledore is indeed as incompetent as the basilisk incident might make him out to be at first glance, that also means Hermione is kind of dumb for not putting together the same conclusions you have.

***** Wouldn't that make Hermione working out what Dumbledore didn't even more impressive? She still made the connection in a couple months at twelve where he didn't at a significantly older age over a significantly longer period of time with more resources available to him.

It'd be like the new intern working out wireless electricity in his garden shed after a week when the old gaffer who's been in the engineering field for fifty years and has all the resources of his company workshop and funding didn't. And the electricity somehow works completely different to how wired technology works, but the new intern figured it out from fewer books than the old gaffer had.

If you're taking an in-universe explanation to that, she's a fictional twelve-year old immigrant into a completely new society. Of course she trusts the Legendary Hero and doesn't think too hard on how she worked out something that he didn't. There's a reason that Hermione's 'ingrained trust of authority' and Dumbledore's 'so well believed-in that people will just jump off of cliffs if he says it's a good idea' reputation are such oft-used cliches.

Out of universe, it's also written by Rowling, so it's also just that Hermione getting combative with Dumbledore would be inconvenient for her plotline. And I've also the benefit of hindsight from having read all the books and examined the situation without fearing for my life like Hermione was. Stress is not good for rational examination of things. I am definitely not smarter than Hermione. I'm barely smarter than Ron on a good day.

Again, it is likely that Dumbledore was led astray with false clues. If you know basilisks don't Petrify, and the students from fifty years ago told you it was a multi-eyed creature with legs or whatever, and you didn't have the clues Hermione did, then understandably you wouldn't ever conclude it was a basilisk. It wouldn't matter how much time you had to figure it out.

Furthermore, all that supposed intelligence of Hermione's is negated if you go down the "Dumbledore is dumb" route. Because if he so clearly should've figured out it was a basilisk, then why in the world is Hermione more loyal to him than even Harry? Shouldn't /she/ have also figured out that Dumbledore isn't smart?

#+begin_quote
  she's a fictional twelve-year old immigrant into a completely new society. [...] Hermione's 'ingrained trust of authority'
#+end_quote

She is not a twelve-year-old immigrant new to the magical world for all seven books. Nor does she have an ingrained trust in authority for the entire saga.

Even in the seventh book, when she's an adult, and is such a part of the wizarding world that she Obliviates her own Muggle parents, and there's a book about how untrustworthy Dumbledore is, she /still/ trusts in Dumbledore, even when Harry doesn't.

So there's two paths we can go. One would be to believe Dumbledore is stupid and the entire wizarding world is too if they haven't figured it out, including Hermione. Or two, there are logical reasons for Dumbledore's actions that we simply aren't privy to.

******* By that metric we could also quite viably say that the Purple People Eater broke into his home and gave him dreams of the monster being made of spaghetti and able to fly.

Technically I'm not trying to say that he should've figured it out, only that he could've and didn't. If she did, and the books don't ever give a reason why he didn't, then all we can conclude is that Hermione was smarter than him in this instance. I suppose it could also be that people aren't intelligent at everything (see the Neurosurgeon member of the US Government who thinks Egyptian Pyramids were built by Joseph from the Bible for grain storage) and Hermione simply put the puzzle together as a book learner where Dumbledore didn't as a people or practical learner.

Or a third path/reason being that Rowling really desperately needed a better editor and continuity person, which is the one I favour most in all honesty.

Dumbledore is called a genius. Hermione trusts him, is loyal to him, and also thinks he's a genius. These are all things inside the text.

If there is a contradiction, as you are saying there is, then we must speculate. Otherwise what's the point? The text says Dumbledore is smart, there's text supporting that idea, there's text possibly opposing that idea, so we have to decide.

And that's what we're doing here: speculating.

#+begin_quote
  I'm just baffled slightly by 'the text is holy and gives no reasons, so lets take our best guess!' approach
#+end_quote

I'm not sure why you're baffled. No one said the text is irrefutably holy. It seems clear to me that Rowling simply didn't think of explaining these things, especially early on when it was just a children's book.

But blaming Rowling and calling it a day is kind of lazy and just stifles discussion. You /can/ do that, and I won't argue with you because I agree that's likely the truth of things, but if we're to look at things from an in-universe perspective, then we must assume everything Rowling wrote is deliberate and the truth.

And if it is, then there has to be a reason Dumbledore didn't figure out it's a basilisk, because the alternative implies a certain level of idiocy in not only Dumbledore but /all/ the characters.

#+begin_quote

But you seem to also be implying Dumbledore wouldn't come to the same conclusion as Hermione if he had all her knowledge and /only/ her knowledge at the time. You said he was out-thought by Hermione, as if the game was fair.

If two people are given the same picture to a puzzle, but one is significantly harder to put together, with many more smaller pieces, can you really say the person who solved the easier one faster is smarter?

If Dumbledore knew everything Hermione knew, and only that, then there's no reason to believe he'd be too stupid to not come to the same conclusion as Hermione.

********* Huh. You know what, you're completely right. I think I got confused somewhere because you're perfectly valid in pointing out that (looking back on this thread) I seem to be implying/arguing for about three or four separate and mutually exclusive options by my estimation and I actually find myself agreeing with the vast majority of your points upon rereading.

I'm not entirely certain what I position I hold in this anymore, or how I'd express that position, but you've certainly given me reasons to re-examine the situation and I thank you for taking the time to answer me and not just ignoring my confused twaddle out of hand.

I think the Dumbledore vs Hermione's intelligence comparison was trying to say that it wasn't a fair game. Metaphorically, Hermione is good at jigsaws, but Dumbledore is good at cards, meaning that Hermione isn't more intelligent broadly than Dumbledore, just her 'intelligence' is more suited to solving this particular form of problem. I think. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure what i was getting at either. One of those slightly contradictory points I mentioned before.

And the holy thing came from not reading the names on the comments closely enough and getting you confused with vlaaivlaai, the other person who responded to that section of commenting. My bad, I do apologise.

TL:DR - You're right, but I'm confused and I don't really know what I'm arguing for anymore.

  Also Dumbledore was out-thought by a twelve-year old in the Basilisk incident despite him having a fifty-year head start and a vaster amount of experience
#+end_quote

Again, I like in this case to treat the text as holy, so how can we make this make sense?

Either Dumbledore had his reasons for not seeing it, knew it, but didn't tell everyone, or everyone is wrong about him and he's an idiot. You can argue all of those, of course - though I think the latter is hardest to argue for.\\
The second has fun moral implications, and the first is what I'd guess. Maybe Dumbledore talked to his friend Newt, and he said "can't be a snake", or he had other clues that point away (weird memories, Myrtle testimonial that led him to a false trail, he thought it was a spider, he thought it was a witch or wizard...)

Edit:

#+begin_quote
  'Rowling did it first' isn't really a good argument to me, since fandom so often loves correcting her mistakes, perceived or actual.

Treating the text as holy has nothing to do with the author. It's entirely author-less, it's "why did the presumably smart Dumbledore come to that conclusion? Probably him knowing more than us."

And again, that's only /one way/ to interpret this, but either you treat the text as holy, or you use it as inspiration - in the middle, it gets really really muddy.

That still doesn't answer why he thought the 'he will have power the Dark Lord knows not' was a singular ability that the Dark Lord didn't know and not a general expression of having more power than the Dark Lord knew about.

****** Prefacing this again with the fact that Dumbledore looks at more than words to interpret the prophecy, he also looks at the actions of those around it.

Dumbledore and Voldemort are both incredibly powerful, who have control of most forms of magic.

The most powerful magic (according to Dumbledore and the ministry) is love, which Voldemort does not commands. Dumbledore knew how Harry survived (Lily's love) and he had seen Harry winning in the ministry with love - not with occlumency.

Based on that, he made an educated guess.

**** Got it in one! I should really pull up direct quotes from HBP like someone else above me did, but there is a confrontation between Dumbles and Harry in that book. Harry is sulking because "Prophecy makes me fight," and Dumbles is all "No, YOU make yourself fight."

Will Harry ever be satisfied hiding and letting others die for him? Will Harry ever be able to try and build a life after being orphaned and hounded by Voldemort when he is STILL being hounded by Voldemort? Will Voldie ever let go of his fear to let a potential threat live? Will he let go of his pride to let his teenage nemesis survive? The answer to all of these is NO.

Lastly is the "Die by the other's hand" line, which in Voldemort's case almost surely refers to the Horcruxes... and probably Harry too. There's a theory that the Horcrux in Harry's head protects him (the container) from damage. This could be the source of the golden flames during the Seven Potters Battle, or instances of Harry's crazy luck. Therefore, an unequipped child Harry simply CANNOT be killed because he has a Horcrux guarding him, thus one of them killing the other is inevitable.

Is the 'regret destroys Horcruxes' thing canon? That could be a really interesting What a Wonderful Life-esque suicidal!Harry fic, I think. "Merlin, I regret my life.

** To answer your question (Edit Take II), the reason that fans interpret "power the Dark Lord know not" as a specific thing ( or set of things) that Voldemort doesn't understand (as opposed to a power level or some talent that Voldemort doesn't know Harry has) is because Harry and Dumbledore canonically, in the book, interpret it this way.

Removing 'and' from the beginning, this verse state that they are equal but he has something, a power, that the dark Lord didnt know at the time.

It never state he was 'An Equal' just 'marked'. He can be actually weaker or stronger. The 'but' part tells regardless of the dark Lord marking him equal, Harry has power the dark Lord isnt aware off.

Harry can be as weak as Filch or God like MOD while still be marked as V's equal without actually being one. He just will have power V isnt aware of.

It can be also read as "H will have power and either H or V must kill the other because neither of them can live while the other survive" The moment H has the power they need to kill the other or get killed.

Basically the moment Harry gets the proverbial power, the 'And either' is sealed.

But again it doesn't say 'a power', it says 'power'. If it was singular, you could substitute any other singular noun in there and have it work, but you can't.

'He will have banana the Dark Lord knows not.' vs 'He will have teeth the Dark Lord knows not.'

No? That's my confusion. That people seem to be agreed that it refers to a singular power (including the characters in canon) and I don't quite get why. At this point the agreement is so strongly against me that I'm fairly certain I'm just missing something horrifically obvious to other people - sleep deprivation or temporary insanity or something.

I do like your sequence, though. The idea that the 'either must die' bit doesn't come into play until Harry 'unlocks' his power. It's an interestingly causal-acausal view.

#+begin_quote
  The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches, Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies, And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal.
#+end_quote

'the power' here refers to the ability to vanquish the dark lord. He has it . This was fullfiled with what ever saved Harry that night. This is why V didn't bother with the prophesy thinking its finished. The power H has is 'born' from his parents and from nature of his birth (number seven is inherently magical but as it dies Lughnasadh or something it has to do with a mother goddess dying as a sacrifice for a first fruit. H is technically a first fruit(child) if you will of Lily. XD foreshadowing) this also caused him to be marked. Thus, 'and the dark Lord will mark him'

#+begin_quote
  But he will have power the Dark Lord knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives.
#+end_quote

The 'Power' referred here may not be the same as the first sentence since it is not unlocked. This is proven when Dark Lord knew Lily's protection magic and by passed it. It cannot be referring to the initial power. Thus can be plural or singular, it refers to something else. In canon, it is H ability to go back or H's blood in V tying him to life. When that was used both V and H got perma-death afterwards(meaning no resurrection for H anymore).

#+begin_quote
  The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies.
#+end_quote

This explicitly state that the child will be born as the seventh month dies. Unlike the vague 'born to' part which can describe H's or the origin of the 'power' in first verse. Lead me to believe the first part refer to the source of power rather than prophesied child.

The reason, I believe, why it is thought as singular because magic is not quantifiable in canon. One cannot simply have more or less, either you have or you dont. The rest is natural talent, knowledge and mental capabilities. There is no drawback to using magic, all the tiring things they do is mostly dodging and mental strain.

In canon, H has peace and rest in station ready to fight while V has just seen a kid he killed resurect as well as knowing Nagini(his horcux) is dead he is badly shaken. It also makes sense why V's fear mongering, dementors, and Neville becoming more confident thus powerful works, its literally mind over matter that it is mostly psychological. It also explain why animagus is difficult and dangerous 'shu dreamt he was a butterfly, when he woke, he wondered if he was a butterfly that dreamt he was a man named shu'
