Bonus points if Voldemort is still around, and everyone must find a way to destroy him. But it's NOT mandatory.

Horcruxes can or doesn't have to be a thing, I'm not picky either way.

Harry could have died from something minor or major, it doesn't matter how he died, just that he died.

If it's a time travel type of story, Harry can be in the story, but I don't want him... what's the word I'm trying to use? Be a major part or like, affect the overall story as much?

It doesn't have to be time travel, and I'd rather it wasn't, actually. (As much as I love those).

I'd rather it be completed, but it doesn't have to be.

No character bashing please. Characters hating each other is fine, but the author going out of their way to bash characters is normally a no go.

Am FINE with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be on fanfiction.net or another site entirely.
