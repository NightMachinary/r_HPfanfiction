** I don't know if it's considered "too much romance", but you can try Rogue's Bet. It's AU without Voldermort, just slice of life.

Or "Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much", not "boarding school life", but it's a heart warming short story.

*** Rogue's Bet is a marvelous story that I'd also recommend. The plot is romance-oriented, but there's not too much romance in the actual story. (Centers around Ron and Harry trying to win the affections of Hermione and Daphne respectively in their first semester of 7th year.)

**** Yeah I would say Rogue's Bet is the best "teens being teens" story

  I haven't really seen anything of the sort and I wonder if Strangers at Drakeshaugh fits the bill. Anyway, thanks!
#+end_quote

Strangers at Drakeshaugh is a great fic but it isn't what you are looking for. There isn't much magic and it is Post Hogwarts so there isn't the "boarding school" you are looking for. This may be personal preference, but because there isn't really any magic in the fic I found it hard to read. Magic is essential to Harry Potter, without magic it just doesn't feel like a Harry Potter fanfiction.

  Briallen Bevin has just found out she's a witch. But the excitement is marred by an unusually cruel Flying teacher, a sadistic janitor, temperamental friends and seemingly clingy enemies, not to mention the mysterious disappearances of several students...

** My story doesn't have any Voldemort in it! :) Because I myself wrote Voldemort out of the way (in my story he's still stuck in Albania doing nothing) so I could tell other stories. :) :)
