And no, not by regular ghosts. I'm looking for horror type fics where something (or someone) is in the castle, kidnapping and/or killing students professors and not even ghost like Myrtle or Peeves have seen them

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

  Far away and long ago,\\
  Passed on those mighty four,\\
  But spirits shake and magic wakes,\\
  The lion will walk once more.

  So sings the Sorting Hat before the first years of 2017 are sent to their houses for the first time. Against their expectations, Rose Weasley and Scorpius Malfoy both find themselves in Ravenclaw, where the Sorting Hat's strange parting words are seen as just another riddle to solve. Their first year at Hogwarts begins in the normal way, with new friendships, old rivalries, and loads of Transfiguration homework, but soon they realise that someone at the school is practising Dark Magic --- and whoever it is, they're planning something big. When Scorpius's best friend is attacked, he and Rose must put aside their differences and find her assailant, before the Sorting Hat's prediction comes to pass.

*** Not exactly like that. And not petrification, specifically kidnappings and murders though if the fic has basilisks kill students then I suppose that could work.
