Hi ! I am looking for fics that do not focus on (but can feature) the Trio, Ginny, Draco Malfoy, ... but instead concentrates on more "background characters" (or OCs) building their lives around the consequences of what happened in canon. The plot doesn't have to revolve around Rebuilding The Wizarding World, people have their own lives to mind, or there can be a new kind of threat, or personal hardship, or whatever else the writer can think of.

This is voluntarily vague, as I don't mind even Next Gen. I loved Hogwarts House Divided and how each character was deeply marked by the war and its consequences on their family.

I prefer Epilogue-compliant fics, but there can be "slight" divergences as the one in Grow Young With Me (I remember crying for 20 minutes straight).

Additionally to those I've already mentioned, if you need more examples, I also really liked Cauterize and Strangers at Drakeshaugh.


** Asking for Roses is Neville/Hannah

** If you liked Hogwarts Houses Divided then I would reccomend

The Escapades of Teddy Lupin linkffn(10554013)

There's also a sequel The Lost Children linkffn(11995244) which is WIP

  Teddy Lupin thought his fifth year at Hogwarts would be just like all the others: full of fun with his friends, work, and perhaps a bit of drama. Then the muggleborns started disappearing, and everything changed. The war might be over, but the darkness remains.

** Not many fics that get up to the absolute brilliance that is Hogwarts Houses Divided, but there are a couple that are at least pretty good.

The "We Belong" series is one I have a soft spot for... at least the first two fics in the series, the third fic started introducing some stupid elements and isn'r as much fun... but the premise is that Fred had a son that nobody knew about, and George is raising him.
