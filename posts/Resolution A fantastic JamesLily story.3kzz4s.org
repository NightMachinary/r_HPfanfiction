So normally I'm not too much of a fan of non Harry centric fics, but this summary really caught my eye. Ended up reading through it in a day, and really enjoyed it.

It fleshes out the cannon characters well, while also bringing in some memorable and enjoyable OCs that help to keep things interesting. It also avoids the trap many romance fabrication fall into of having the very first relationship a character gets involved in, be their one and only.

At under two hundred thousand words, is long enough to have substance, while not being dragged out, the pacing just feels right.

  "I think you're an arrogant, selfish pig, and I think you'd be doing both of us a favor if you just left me alone!" Potter stared at me for a moment, an unreadable expression in his hazel eyes, before uttering a single word: "Okay." J/L, Lily's POV

On another note, typing this on a tablet is very frustrating, and I need to buy another laptop soon. Sorry about any spelling errors.


** IF you want to great James and lily fics you should read Before the Fawn and The Life and Times
