Just asking, because i haven't read any HP stories for a while, and wondering if there have been any completed in the last few months.

Any are fine as long as by third or fourth year he can at least compete against voldermort in power, and spells. The more he can trounce voldermort the better.

*** Well to be fair there are a lot of them out there. Also i ask mainly, because by the end of fourth year voldermort is back.

I would also like to point out that whether by luck, power or skill by that point in the story he had repelled dozens of dementers, defeated a thousand year old basilisk, helped stop the theft of the philosopher's stone, disarmed severous snape, and outflown a dragon. Even if he did almost end up dying if it weren't for Fawkes in COS.

Also side note i think in this scene i've got to ask if fawkes could bring the sorting hat why didn't dumbledore come himself. To me this just point's out to me not to mention a lot of other evidence that dumbledore wasn't exactly either right in the head or even downright malicious.

With all this evidence. Especially with the dementor's it shows that he has the potential to be quite powerful early on not to mention after in OOTP where he with a group of student's held off some of voldermorts top enforcer's/henchmen with little injury except a seriously injured hermione, and in that scene they weren't exactly going easy on them even if they weren't trying there hardest.

**** Dumbledore is overworked, not evil. He can't be in 2 places at once. I don't see what that has to do with Harry being powerful though.

***** Oh i know it doesn't. That's why i just made a small quotation about it. Secondly explain all his failing's then. There seem to be too many for it to be a simple case of too much work. Even than he should be intelligent enough to know that working as a headmaster, and as somewhat of a leader for two high up government position's is not healthy nor is it a good thing, because he will never pay 100% attention to any given role. He should quit one or two of them.

Imagine a world where dumbledore's only job after the war was as head of the wizengamot. I mean if someone like malfoy could do all he did as just a malfoy not Albus FREAKING Dumbledore, defeater of Grindewald, friend of Flamel, ender of The first wizarding war, and agreed upon, the most powerful wizard alive if ever. I'm pretty sure he could do a lot for the world, but because he can't focus all his time on it he only does the basics, and a lot of stuff get's through that probably shouldn't, and maybe wouldn't with him there.

As much as the books show people like fudge getting into power there are good people in those position's that could take over. Even if there aren't you've got plenty of great teachers who can become headmaster/headmistress of the school like Minerva or flitwick well before any of that stuff happened in the books.

So overall he is at the least in belief that he knows what's best over everyone else, and therefore always right, and things must always go his way. Granted that would not be his fault completely with everyone around him always fortifying that belief.

***** That's a point of view, not a fact. He was very likely overworked... However there are quite a few folks out there who question just how manipulative Dumbledore was actually being throughout cannon (myself included).

There were certainly some things he knew WAY more about than he let on and still allowed them to happen or encouraged Harry and Co to face things they had no business facing. Just how much we will never know for sure, but JK herself has stated he knew things like Lockhart being a fraud and that he had suspicions about Moody. And he was very obviously guiding Harry along a path in very suspicious and dangerous ways.

At the end of the day even if he was not evil, or crazy, or whatever word you want to assign to him, he was most definitely not the benign friendly old man who was smart but somewhat oblivious. There were methods to his madness and some certainly seem awfully manipulative and malicious.

***** Also with time-turner's he could be in two place's at once, but not three, and it has it's own danger's when using it too.
