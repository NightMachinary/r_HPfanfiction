** So I believe in Death of an author so I only take what the books say when I think of the future of characters(damn that epilogue)

that being said I think most of the world has a different value on what it means to be great than Harry does... The world for the most part think it's money, power,fame.... Harry didn't want any of that.... He has a good life no matter what job he ends up with, good friends, has a family(which he always wanted) and he's a pretty good person.... That's the greatness harry potter wanted in life

*** yup i think you hit the nail on the head here, Harry valued family and friends and loyalty, I think its easy for those of us who read a lot of fanfic to forget, but in the books harry was Dumbledore's man through and through. He believes in the power of Love, and forgiveness, doing what is right over what is easy, and all of those qualities that Dumbledore taught. A great example would be his son's name, Albus Severus. Being an Auror is just another instance of doing what is right, protecting everyone even if it means putting your life on the line or even walking to your death.

​

The Slytherin question is an interesting one, as in cannon (at least for our timeline) all Slytherin's are basically bad people. Even when a Slytherin like Snape does something heroic (at least in the eyes of Dumbledore) it is remarked upon as something unslytherin-like "Sometimes I think we sort too soon". In CoS when Harry asks Dumbledore about the hat wanting him in Slytherin Dumbledore again talks about choice, and its implied that Harry chose the right thing by refusing Slytherin, its presented like he said no to evil temptations. Under that lens of Slytherin, I expect the hats Greatness to be very different from what HArry valued.

I'd just like to point out that Harry interacts with like, half a dozen named Slytherins in the entire original heptalogy. The vast majority of Slytherins seem to mostly leave Harry and the other protagonists alone.

Also, the full quote from Deathly Hallows is, "You are a braver man by far than Igor Karakoff. You know, I sometimes think we Sort too soon..." Dumbledore is not saying here that heroism is un-Slytherin. He's saying that Snape demonstrated bravery worthy of a Gryffindor. Saying that Snape could be Gryffindor isn't a jab at Slytherin, any more than saying Hermione could be a Ravenclaw is a jab at Gryffindor.

That's you and the rest of the wizarding world right there. Harry only interacted with 3 specific Slytherin students on a regular basis. He interacted with 2 Ravenclaws and like....1 Hufflepuff. And that's not counting the other Patil twin. So a total of 7 students outside of his own House. From Gryffindor, we've got Ron, Hermione, the Twins, Wood, Ginny, Neville, the Creevey brothers, the Gryffindor Patil, and that's just counting the students at school. He's constantly surrounded by Gryffindor alumni in Sirius, the Weasley family, and Dumbledore.

** It's difficult to tell if JKR intended this, but growing up in an emotionally abusive household as the unwanted child would definitely create the "thirst to prove yourself" part the Sorting Hat sees in Harry. The problem with shoving him into Gryffindor instead of Slytherin, is that Gryffindor accepted Harry being "great" as is, and just about left it at that. After a lifetime where any achievements he might have gotten would be ignored or even punished, like Harry saying he deliberately didn't get better grades than Dudley, Harry was happy to sink right back into cruising along, and Gryffindor was the ONLY house he could have been sorted into where that laziness would be unchallenged, as Ravenclaw the smart, Hufflepuff the diligent and Slytherin the ambitious would be an environment where achievements would be praised, and Harry would have more drive to apply himself. The desire was certainly there in the first book where Harry spent quite a bit of time pre-Sorting fretting about fitting in and being as good as everyone else, so he always had the drive to do better, but Gryffindor definitely seems to have allowed that to fall to the wayside.

As for being "great", I don't think his auror career really has anything to do with it, because Harry achieved "greatness" by defeating Voldemort (even if it was very ass-pull), and if JKR wasn't a coward and let Harry be a teacher instead of generic good-guy occupation wizard cop like the DA subplot hinted at in OOTP, he could still be "great" from his previous achievements as well as doing something similar to Slughorn and helping others achieve greatness too.

** Harry (pre-Ron and Hermione) probably learned to hide who he is and his potential in order to avoid punishment. Sure, he was snarky, but since he knew the Dursley's wouldn't let him have friends or positive interactions with people, he learned to keep to himself. That stand alone, wear a mask to survive mentality is very similar to Tom Riddle's (though Riddle's came more naturally to him). The Hat saw that Harry was cunning (for an 11 year old, he knew how to deceive and evade), he had ambition (improve his situation), and he was motivated by survival (Harry tends to do his best when in life or death situations). As much as I hate to admit it (I'm a Slytherin myself) Harry didn't actually enjoy hiding himself as we can tell from his emotional outbursts and lying isn't an instinct from him - he is an honest person. So, in that sense, Harry became his own man by choosing Gryffindor.

*** I think if Harry had chosen Slytherin, he could have influenced some Death Eater families (including important ones like the Malfoys) away from Voldemort. I imagine if Draco had befriended Harry, and the Malfoys met him not as an enemy but as their son's friend and a potential ally/PR source, they would have been willing to support him in ways Dumbledore either didn't anticipate or didn't think was important (effectively deal with the Dursleys to treat him better, holiday tutoring, magical library access). They'd then stick with him not because he suddenly made them good people, but because they would have entwined their fortunes with his too tightly before Voldemort's sudden apparent resurrection in May 1995. They would calculate (probably accurately) that all the PR they had been running in the years earlier supporting TBWL would have severe consequences with Voldie.

If that happened, it would mean that instead of Voldemort easily building from Little Hangleton to taking over the Ministry in little over two years, it would be his newly reduced circle of Death Eaters playing the part of terrorist/guerilla fighters against a Ministry with the full weight of wealthy Slytherin purebloods behind them, in an uneasy alliance with Dumbledore's forces.

The primary struggle of this story would not be Harry finding his courage to do crazy, death defying stunts against vast opposition, but Harry trying to discern which people/plans would work to his advantage, and trying to keep his morals with allies who have no such scruples. This Harry would probably be a much better wizard (in terms of skill and education), but possibly a bit amoral and cold.

what's the point of pondering useless hypotheticals. Draco defenders always go on and on about the pressures of his family and Voldemort, which means there's very little chance of a meaningful friendship between him and Harry. The only exception is if Draco escapes from his family, but then all of those advantages of befriending him go bye-bye. Draco would be just as much a pariah in Slytherin as Harry.

First of all, I'm far from a Malfoy defender, and your antagonism is unnecessary and annoying.

I'm merely constructing a possible narrative where the "greatness" the Sorting Hat promises Harry comes true if he were to choose Slytherin. The Lestranges and Crouch Jr aside, most of the Death Eaters join Voldemort because they think he's going to win, their parents were his supporters and/or because blood purity ideology serves to keep them at the top of their society's heap. In canon, the Malfoys quickly jumped ship once they saw where the wind was blowing. That doesn't sound at all like "the most radical supporters".

If you were paying attention, I was talking specifically about the period between Harry rejoining the wizarding world and Voldemort returning, which is a good 4 year period. Publicly patronizing the BWL and gaining his trust and affection would be obvious things to do for Lucius "Imperius Defense" Malfoy.

You have a point that Malfoy and the other Death Eaters not rushing back to their returned lord would require some extraordinary circumstances, but this is a series about extraordinary circumstances.

If two conditions were fulfilled, (1) Harry showed "greatness" the way young Tom Riddle did while at Hogwarts and (2) Malfoys and other powerful pureblood families showered him with support before Voldemort returned, a story could be told of how some did not return to Voldemort's service, but stayed with Harry or remained neutral. Not because they're secretly wonderful people who are just a bit sarcastic, but because Voldie isn't the forgiving sort and isn't very sane. So they would at the very least remain neutral or flee the country and at best contribute resources towards beating him. You can feel free to poopoo it all you like, but this is a subreddit for fanfiction last I checked, and all I put forward was a possible fanfic premise.

** JKR's version of why the Hat said that HP would do well in Slytherin is because the Hat detected the soul piece inside his head. This is, of course, complete BS, and just reinforces the bias that she's been showing from the very beginning of her series.

I wouldn't say Aurors are the same as police officers in the wiz world, though, since the requirements of becoming an auror are considerably higher compared to becoming a policeman. I daresay they're more like the UK's SAS, or the US Navy SEALs seeing that they need to be proficient in several areas of magic and have, in all probability, quite a lengthy training period as well.

** I never really thought about it but in hindsight the hat's statement that Harry would fit well into Slytherin doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

J K Rowling probably wrote it in to potentially present Harry as a more ambiguous character and play into the whole [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent][not so different]] and [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart][good/evil counterpart]] tropes but she never really follows up on that angle.

Harry, as presented by the books, is about as ambitious as a brick. Right now I can't even name a single long-term ambition that Harry ever spends significant time pursuing throughout the entire series. The only things he ever puts significant effort and planning into are those that he feels obliged to pursue for the sake of others, first and foremost, of course, the defeat of Voldemort.

In fact, out of the golden and silver trio, the only ones that I would consider to have /less/ Slytherin traits than Harry are Neville and Luna, and even those are debatable.

He uses petrified Hermione as an excuse to get away with cutting class to McGonagall in CoS, he uses the Marauders Map to sneak into Hogsmeade because he feels he is deserving of it regardless of rules, he plays up the heroic orphan angle with Slughorn, flatters Hagrid when trying to get information out of him, and so on.

Also ambition isn't just being the best, it's about achieving their goals regardless of what it is. So long as Harry desires something enough, he'll pursue it with a vengeance. Quidditch, the DA, spying on Malfoy, learning the Patronus charm, and becoming an auror are all examples of Harry's ambitions.

I can agree with that, though if you look at your examples you'll also notice that trickery is almost never his first resort and he usually only uses it after he tried asking nicely three times before that. If sometimes lying to get your way makes you a Slytherin then everyone is a Slytherin.

#+begin_quote
  Quidditch
#+end_quote

Wood is ambitious about Quidditch. By comparison Harry just trains because playing is fun and winning is even more fun. Harry treats Quidditch like a hobby, not like an ambition.

#+begin_quote
  the DA
#+end_quote

was Hermoine's idea. Harry just went along with her plan.

#+begin_quote
  spying on Malfoy
#+end_quote

is something he feels obliged to do to keep everyone in the castle safe.

#+begin_quote
  learning the Patronus charm
#+end_quote

Putting in an effort to protect yourself against an immediate threat does not make you ambitious.

#+begin_quote
  and becoming an auror
#+end_quote

Before his career meeting with McGonagall, Harry didn't have the slightest shimmer of what he wanted to do with his life, and he only picked being an Auror because it nicely aligned with his already existing skill set and desire to help people. Harry's choice of career is a great example of how he /isn't/ ambitious, not of how he is.

Being ambitious is about more than just being driven and putting an effort into the things you do. Being ambitious means being proactive and having a long-term goal of what you want in life and then pursuing it.

Harry at his heart is a reactionist. If a problem comes up or if he or the people around him a threatened then he will do his absolute best to rectify that, but if there isn't some immediate issue for him to deal with, he loses that drive and goes back to just living his life and doing what feels right in the moment instead of following some future ambition.

***** But see, you've merely pointed out some of the reasons Harry /starts/ doing things, whereas ambition means working towards goals and achieving success regardless of motivation; the reasons can be anything so long as that strong drive to succeed is there. Plus applying the concept of ambition in an adult sense of having long-term goals etc doesn't work with teenagers who don't have that mindset at all, they are primarily short term focused. And ambition is not a trait that can be exclusive to Slytherin since it's tied to any achievement, but when hand in hand with more... duplicitous means, or seeking things for a sense of power? That's slytherin.

Ambitions wise, Harry doesn't want to become an excellent potion master, and yet he poured over the half-blood prince's book and took credit for work that wasn't his even though Hermione told him it was all a ruse because he liked appearing to do well, and using it as a tool against Slughorn only came later.

He determinedly learns the patronus charm even though the teachers told him it wasn't necessary just because he didn't want to be weak.

Harry creates his secret lesson plans in class for future DA meetings because he enjoys how much the members have been improving, while gloating over doing it right under Umbridge's nose.

These are all indicative of Harry's ambitious streak where he wants to succeed at what interests him, and isn't afraid to use underhanded means to get them. If Harry likes something, he'll give it his full effort, and if it doesn't he'll half arse it. Being ambitious in some things instead of all things still makes someone ambitious.

***** I think the only reason he chose to be an Auror was because Professor 'Moody' said he would make a good one, not because he necessarily wanted to be one, and I think he got pushed into it when McGonagall and Umbridge got into the argument in his Carreer meeting. I also think it's a bit silly to have to chose a career at the old age of 15, I don't know about you, but I didn't chose my career until College. Also by making the choise at 15, you have now discovered that the electives you've taken won't help you in your chosen career at all.

  The only things he ever puts significant effort and planning into are those that he feels obliged to pursue for the sake of others, first and foremost, of course, the defeat of Voldemort.

And that's only in the later books. At least the first what, 4 or 5 books, he doesn't do anything to defeat Voldemort, it just sorta happens by chance of luck and Voldemort holding an idiot ball.

** Harry Potter's greatest ambition was to be "Normal" or at least not have everyone look at him as just this idealized hero that saved them from Voldemort.

Now, being normal was never possible, you simply cannot be the sole survivor of an event that changes a nations future, and expect everyone to just forget about you. So breaking free of that idealized hero image is the only viable option for him to achieve hi goals.

Ironically, Grifindor is the WORST house for that, because while other houses value things such as Loyalty, Intelligence, and Power, Grifindor values... heroism. The very thing he's trying to get away from. As long as he's in Gryfindor, he has no CHOICE but the be the Hero, or the Failure. And due to his history, both will be made very public. Repeatedly.\\
Ravenclaw he could prove himself through studies. Hufflepuff he could prove himself by being dedicated, hard working, and a all around good friend. Slytherin, he could prove himself by personal power, either magic or in later years political.

Anything but a hero he has no interest in being.

** My headcanon, expressed as an alternative Sorting dialogue snippet:

*Harry Potter and the Introspective Hat*

‘Not Slytherin, eh?' said the small voice. ‘Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that.'

‘No doubt?' Harry thought back.

‘Well, it could all go horribly wrong, but they made me to be optimistic and focus on the positives of each House, so I can't really talk about that. Like, say, that one earlier whose hair could barely fit in me---I could've told her that no one in Gryffindor would like her, but I couldn't, you see? Just like I can't tell you whether one or more of your dormmates might resent you for your role in their parents' boss's demise enough to try something. Honestly, if I were sorting based on what could go wrong, Hufflepuff wouldn't be the biggest House; it would be the /only/ House. So, yeah, Slytherin will definitely help you there, if you can survive it.'

‘Can I survive it?'

‘I'm a Thinking cap, not a Seeing cap.'

** Greatness in terms of Slytherin rhetoric would imply a quest for political and monetary power. Which, no doubt if Harry were to give his all, would be an achievable goal. You have to remember that due to his upbringing... Well he's becoming average on purpose. Or wants to.

It all depends on the actions of others. I'm under the belief that he'd be bullied in that house, thus the magical world not being the escape he wished for. Although this might cause resentment for many, so... Not quite the nice Harry we've got in canon.

** I also think this section was meant to mirror Harry and Voldemort's similarity. In fact, I believe it was a point in which Harry could choose between darkness and the light. When getting his wand, Ollivander quotes "I think we must expect great things from you, Mr Potter.... After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things --- terrible, yes, but great." and imo 'Great' was meant to reflect this.

It was meant to mark the path of separation from becoming another Voldemort.

** According to Rowling, the Hat simply sensed a part of Voldemort inside of him and that's why it wanted to put him in Slytherin.

As about Harry, I don't think he would have done well in Slytherin. Maybe in the beginning he would have done well, but after Voldemort's return, most Slytherins would have turned against him. (either because they would have supported Voldemort or because they wouldn't have wanted to become targets of Voldemort themselves, after all Slytherins are known for wanting to save their own skin first)

Then again, an entertaining thought is that Harry would have been able to change Slytherin for the better. Would canon Harry have achieved that? I have my doubts.

** Harry shows absolutely no Slytherin traits and is despised by the vast majority of that house. So he would have done terribly there.

I'm fine with JKR's argument that the Hat probably picked up on the Horcrux.

If the Hat was actually talking about Harry it's a terrible Sorting Hat. (also works, since almost everything in this world seems to be shit or moronic)
