I read this a few years back, so it may have been taken down.

Basically, Dumbeldore orders Snape to forcibly form a soul bond and become mated to Harry to save his life or something. Harry nopes out and runs away from Hogwarts, where he becomes a vigilante and goes on a Death Eater killing spree, until there's only Voldemort left.

I can't really remember the middle part, but Harry winds up living with Snape either for his own protection or to protect Snape from Voldemort.

They seal the bond (have sex) and realize with Hermione's help that Dumbeldore's plan backfired, as he had thought Harry had weaker magic than Snape and would become his submissive, but it turns out that Snape is the submissive.

Harry kills Voldemort by tapping into his mind connection and draining Voldemort of his life/soul. Harry and Snape get into an argument with Dumbeldore, saying that he was wrong about his plan, and Harry accidentally blinds him with a burst of magic.

Harry and Snape go back home and Snape says that he doesn't need to go back to Hogwarts anymore. Happily ever after, yada yada yada.
