What are some fics that seem to have a cult like following and ate must reads. Off of the top of my head i can thing of Methods of rationality, a long journey home, and most of robst things. Even if you don't like one of all of these they are talked about often and definitely do have a cult like following that will defend without fail.

This question was spurred on by the fact that I've been reading fanfiction for years now and I'm curious as to what some people would refer to as must reads and which fics have a following and community behind them.

Personally I think linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish]]) is an amazing fic. It's a mix of crack fiction that still manages to tell a plot and mix in many story ideas that flow into what is an interesting read. Every so often my friends and I reread it and make references to the antics that issue.

What do you think makes a story a cult classic and do you think fanfiction can even be classified as such?


** linkffn(Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness) is one of those fics that is fairly well known.

Edit: Lovely downvoting for actually doing what OP wants and linking him a fic that has/had a cult following.

Edit: who's down voting me? It's true, the fic has a cult following and the writer is actually a megalomaniac cult leader.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2695781/1/Gabriel]]) A very interesting look at ethnicities and classes in the Wizarding world.

*** The disappearance of Sally Ann Perks is a really good story and does in my opinion answer a particularly interesting question with a equally as interesting solution. As a reader I always want to know why certain characters are created and sadly Sally Ann falls into that category where we just don't know.

I can't say I have read the others, but I will check them out

** Wellll..... regardless of its quality, MoR does have a very dedicated following, so one could very well consider it a cult classic.

And I also must admit I am part of the "cult" around Alexandra Quick. Those who like it enough to read through all four books generally end up proselytising people (myself, [[/u/tusing]], some others I can't think of right now).

** Long story short, anything a society/group of people has a sect(s) that enjoy something in particular has cult classics. Harry Potter fanfiction meets this. So yes, there are cult classic Harry Potter fics.

The Oxford Dictionary defines a cult classic as

#+begin_quote
  Something, typically a movie or book, that is popular or fashionable among a particular group or section of society
#+end_quote

So under that definition, you are correct about all popular fics. But that's only if you take society as the absolute, big thing. If we view Harry Potter fanfiction fans as a society, it becomes a far more useful thing to think about. Under this new definition, HPMoR and Robst's entire library of work are cult classics, because they are popular among a certain group of HP fanfiction readers. A Long Journey Home is simply too popular. Another addendum is that 'classic' implies that at least some time has passed by.

And don't give me any of that "but yargle, if you sort on FFN by Favorites, all those ones you talk about being cult classics are at the top, and A Long Journey Home isn't anywhere in the first 20 pages of results!^{1} " Most of those things at the top of the most favorites list are there because new people will sort by favorites, read the stuff there, think it's amazing, and then when they learn better don't unfavorite it. The only thing on that first page that belongs there is A Black Comedy (and some argument can be made for The Lie I've Lived, but I don't feel like arguing with [[/u/Lord_Anarchy]] over it [though I do agree it isn't as good as people say it is]).

You want some stuff that makes me think of cult classic movies? I can do that. Check out anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1228238/DisobedienceWriter][DisobedienceWriter]]. Although I think all of his works are shit (excepting some of his Odd Ideas oneshots and linkffn(Vietnam by Rorschach's Blot)), there are the works of Make A Wish's author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach's Blot]]. Although I generally don't like the style of humor he goes with, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649528/nonjon][nonjon]] is definitely a cult classic author, plus linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon; Dimension Hopping for Beginners by nonjon) are both damn good IMO. linkffn(Partially Kissed Hero), although terrible, definitely reminds me of a bunch of enjoyable, yet not good sci-fi movies I've seen/own. I hate it, but the ironically named linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn518) is definitely a fanfiction cult classic.^{2} linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) is definitely a cult classic, and worth reading just for the fact that it is a 103 chapter, 520k word monstrosity that took 187 days to post (and I'm pretty damn sure that it only took a day or two longer than that to write). And because this comment is getting long, and I don't particularly feel like investing any more time into it, I'll stop there.

1. Yes, I did check this.
2. Her other 'popular' fic is a Harry Potter/Star Wars crossover that I despise due to it's absolutely infantile (a la people who think shittyfanfictionmanipulative!Dumbledore levels of infantile) understanding of the Star Wars universe and its major actors could probably be considered a cult classic. If you want to read it, go to her profile. I refuse to name or link it here.

*** I am curious about stories that people relate to as cult classic and must reads. It seems like more often than not many people just post their favorites. Personally I want to know which fics people go to over and over again. Which are quotable? Which are indeed as you said older stories that have a following like some old movies.

I hope you don't mind I pointed people to your response because it makes the argument about what I mean better than I could myself. It was long post, but a good one. I need to go through all of your suggestions to see what I've not read yet, but thank you for your long thought out response.

**** I think it's important to sometimes recommend fics that you personally don't like, or aren't /good/ because they match the requests. Of course, just because a fic isn't /good/ doesn't mean it is terrible. So bad it's good is a real thing.

Some fics that I come back to, even if they aren't good, but contain ideas I find interesting, applications I enjoy or just remind me of the B-movies that I like are:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Origin War). Sadly, this is a most likely abandoned fic. It does have some lordship stuff, but it isn't completely nauseating like many are. I definitely like some of the ideas in it (particularly the Resonance/freeform casting stuff).

linkffn(Basilisk-Born). An in-progress fic. I can't really say much about it without spoiling the story, but it is essentially the B-movie A Long Journey Home.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar). Goblet of Fire AU. First few chapters are rough, and while I'm an American who is proud of it, there is a bit too much pro-America/boo-magicalBritain thing going on. What it really has going for it is the focus on alternative magical traditions.

And I don't mind at all. I really enjoy these kinds of fics, even though they're not great.

***** I agree you do sometimes half to recommend fics even if you don't necessarily like them. That's what I find frustrating about this community at times and I know I'll get down votes for it. A lot of people just say a story is terrible without stating why. Personally I can overlook a lot of things including a fair bit of grammatical errors of a story is good. I chalk that up to growing up around people who spoke English as a second language. I can muddle through a lot of things and still find them enjoyable to a point. I would rather know if a possible read and at least try it before I discard it myself. There are a lot of fics that I have come across digging through the sites that are good, but didn't have a lot of attention because so many had down voted it that trying to find it in the search was difficult. Like you said just because it might not be the best written thing around a lot of stories like this can have nuggets of ideas which a fascinating.

**** I may be a little early in calling Cadmean Victory a cult classic, but I definitely have the feeling it is going to be considered one in the future.

Cult classics don't have to be /good/. Let's look at movies for examples of this. Starship Troopers. The +Star Wars Holiday Special+ source of my nightmares. The double feature of Jesse James meets Frankenstein's Daughter/Billy the Kidd vs Dracula (actually Frankenstein's granddaughter but whatever). Plan 9 from Outer Space. Sssssss (yes, that's [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070622/][a real movie]]). Dune (1984). All cult classics. None good (though most are so bad they are enjoyable).

Good is nice, not required.
