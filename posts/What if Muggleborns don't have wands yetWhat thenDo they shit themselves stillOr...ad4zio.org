** I'm assuming from your username that your referring to the Pottermore quote about wizards shitting on the street and then vanishing it before they invented toilets? Because muggles did the same thing, only without the vanishing part.

And if a muggleborn somehow makes it into Hogwarts without a wand? I would assume they would do as the aristocrats did in Versailles, and shit in the corner of the great hall.

*** I can't claim to be an expert historian about this, but I really don't think we can assume that.

In Versailles, you mean they went in a chamber pot in the corner, right? Because if not then I really don't think we can assume that was typical behavior. There are a lot of stories about really drunk people doing their business in inappropriate places nowadays, too, but I wouldn't call that typical behavior.

People used to empty their chamber pots in the street if there weren't any sewers, so I imagine some people wouldn't have hesitated to add to the mess directly, but this whole going on the floor in the middle of the hallway thing strikes me as extremely unlikely. Chamber pots were a thing, people.

**** The Versailles thing was in large part because the place only had a few toilets (good going mr architect.) and chamber pots weren't always nearby. Versailles at the time had a reputation for being a very filthy place, to the point where the King decreed that the floors must be cleaned of feces every now and again. Admittedly I did kind of imply that they shat in the corner all the time, they were usually a little more discreet finding hidden nooks, bushes or bribing servants to allow them to visit their masters chamberpot, but it did happen way too often.

** Can we all just assume they had chamber pots enchanted with vanishing charms and stop talking about this?

I mean, it's pretty much canon. Didn't Dumbledore say he wandered off looking for a toilet at night in SS and found a room with a bunch of antique chamber pots in it?

I used to work retail and this is giving me flashbacks to the one time someone went in the fitting rooms. Apparently that's not as uncommon as you'd think. And toilets are designed to minimize the smell of human waste, it's all a few degrees of magnitude more horrible when there isn't one involved.
