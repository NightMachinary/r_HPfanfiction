I know the show just dropped less than a week ago but that would be such a fun pairing/crossover.


** Almost certainly no. In addition to the show having dropped less than a week ago, people are far more likely to start writing fanfics within a single universe before branching out to crossovers. [[https://FanFiction.net][FanFiction.net]] does not yet show a single fic in the The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina universe.

â€‹

Of course, there is one way to fix this. Be the change you want to see in the world and write it :)

*** It's really interesting and the witches are more the traditional black witches dealing with the devil that sort of thing, so I think that would be really interesting paired with the light/dark magic of the Harry Potter World.

**** What I want to see is something causing all the students to have to transfer to Hogwarts and the culture shock that would pin even Sabrina as a dark witch. Or maybe their school held close ties to Voldemort.

Edit: and/or Hermione is actually related to the Spellmans because my husband pointed out how similar the two actresses look at times.

** I'm writing a xover at the moment, I need to flesh a lot of ideas yet but the basic plotline is Zelda visiting the old country to check on a coven near Godric's Hollow. After visiting a friend over there she feels an explosion of magical energy, that being, of course, Voldemort trying to kill Harry.

Zelda ends up adopting Harry as she can sense how much potential he has, thinking Satan would be pleased with a child like that signing the book of the beast. Which he does by the age of 14. I was thinking on using the good ol' "summoning Harry" to the Triwizard Tournament trope. That's the basic idea, I don't know if I will change more stuff but yeah.

P.S. Nice to see you are still alive Fresh owo

** Let's wait, it would probably take a while before writers on [[https://FanFiction.net][FanFiction.net]] begin writing fanfics for CAOS by itself. not to mention crossover fics, unless you do want to take the initiative yourself.

Also, regarding pairings. what do you mean? are you talking like Harry x Sabrina? I feel it'd be a bit complex, though you can have the Aunts and Ambrose initially disapprove of the fact Harry and Sabrina are dating due to Harry's being an adult who is 38 dating a 16 year-old teenager. unless either Harry is de-aged or Sabrina's aged up.

*** Well yeah if Harry and Sabrina were paired together there would be some time shifting unless Harry fell into some plot hole and wandered into their universe or something.

**** Now, a different question would be. can Sabrina and Harry can get along enough that they can become friends and eventually lovers?

***** Well there will of course be an awkward beginning, especially when Harry realizes she is basically a devil worshiper. I'm assuming Harry had some sort of religious knowledge, not necessarily any religious belief mind you, and that would mesh not well with Sabrina's way of life.

Once that got figured out, I'm sure friendship and perhaps romance could develop. There would always be bumps in the road though.

******** I imagine Sabrina tearing into Tom with the full force of a train, just for (in her point of view) having the nerve to pretend that he's a Dark Lord. while she doesn't like Satan, she still grew up with him as a God for her. so she'd still believe that he's the true Dark Lord while she'd consider Voldemort as nothing more than a mere imposter.

First, I see I'm not the only one who thinks Harry would be a smoker. it just seems to fit him.

And second, yeah. that would be so damn badass.
