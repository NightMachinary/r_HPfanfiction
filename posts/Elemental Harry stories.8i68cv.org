** A question about Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power, does it get better? The dialogue is just bad and in no way how any 11 year old would ever talk, "Well goodbye bitches, see you next year" for example. It just is so ooc for any Harry to talk like that, or, even worse, the line after the first portkey ( ch 4). All super not in line with any children.

Coupled with Harry just getting the elderwand by buying it from Ollivanders and his general "opness" just makes the fic feel bad.

But i have seen it recommended to often for it to be completly garbage and id hate to miss out on it, is it like prince of slytherin where you just have to fight through a horrible opening to get to the good parts?

*** Hey, Patrick1t, just a quick heads-up:\\
*completly* is actually spelled *completely*. You can remember it by *ends with -ely*.\\
Have a nice day!

*** The dialogue and grammar get a little better, and there's a few spelling mistakes and things to slog through, but even with all that it's a really entertaining story and is still one of my favorites, just due to a lot of interesting takes on things and how fun the fight scenes are. It's like an action flick you can just put on and not pay attention to, but still follow along with half an ear. some weird shit, but still definitely a fun story

*** It is okay by fanfic standards, but definitely poorly written. Not including grammar mistakes, which force me to put a fanfic down usually.

Except for Harry Potter and the Other Path. Decently written, but mediocre grammar.
