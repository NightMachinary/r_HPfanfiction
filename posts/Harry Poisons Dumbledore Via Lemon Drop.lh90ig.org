:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I seem to remember a fic where Harry handed Dumbledore a poisoned lemon drop... can't remember which fic though. They were on their way too/from the cave where the locket horcrux was kept. Harry has realised Dumbledore plans to have him sacrifice himself, however at the end Dumbledore gets a chance to explain his reasoning (thinking Harry would survive bc of his blood in V's veins) etc and Harry gets the wind taken out his sails.

Harry has slowly been descending into darkness when this occurs. He feels guilty but ultimately justifies himself, I think, mainly because he's committed to this path now - no turning back.

Does anyone know this fic?

  In the aftermath of a peaceful summer comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually. And now, a free remastered version is coming to my Patreon and website!
