Golden Boy, the Golden Trio and the Gryffindor Princess.

These seem to be used in nearly every fic, yet I can't remember them being used in the books at all. Unless I'm very mistaken (and I just searched some epub versions of the books for these terms) these are never used in canon.

Are there any other terms used with such regularity that aren't cannon and stick out to any of you?

PS: If I'm wrong and it is used in the books, please tell me.


** In addition to those mentioned, I don't like it when fanfiction has the professors calling them lions, badgers, snakes, or Ravens. It's especially terrible because it should be eagles not ravens!

** You're not wrong and you'll come across other non-canon phrases that get used a lot in fanfic. Someone uses it once, then someone decides they like it and also uses it, and it snowballs from there. Slytherin prince is one I've come across a lot, being a Draco fan. Gryffindor princess is not one I've ever heard before though. I'm guessing it's used for either Hermione or Ginny?

And yes, I forgot to check Slytherin Prince for Draco and Slytherin Ice Queen for Daphne, But I'm guessing those aren't canon either.

** It's not used in the books. But I would guess it's because they are a trouble causing trio and the name "Golden Trio" is an attempt to make them seem more akin to the Gryffindor pranksters of the 70s who owned the Marauder's Map in a subtle way. Plus most of the time, they're in Gryffindor and the primary colours of that house are red and gold. So "Golden Trio" applies.

Personally I think Golden Boy and Gryffindor Princess were originally probably used as derogatory terms in fanfictions, designed to provoke an emotive response from the character being called such names. Like say, Draco Malfoy trying to provoke Harry by calling him the Golden Boy or what have you.

Hilariously the Marauders aren't actually called that in canon. Only by their names. The only thing that makes people think that's their name is that their best creation is called the Marauder's Map. So I guess that applies?

But outside of them, how about these; Prongslet, pup, Pronglet, cub, whenever the Sorting Hat gets given a name. The other name for the "Golden Trio" which is the Gryffindor Trio. Or the Silver Trio (Albus Potter, Rose Weasley and Scorpius Malfoy). All the Dumbledore nicknames. Slytherin Sex God/Slytherin Prince (Draco) and Sirius being called the Dogfather.

Another one which doesn't exactly fit your parameters, but I think is a good one to mention, is that writers make characters such as Lucius Malfoy, Sirius Black, Harry Potter and other people belonging to prominent pureblood families be akin to peers or landed lords. Whilst it's true they're rich, there's very little evidence to suggest that they're actually lords at all. So I would guess it's a fanon thing.

*** Prongslet is a major big pet peeve of mine actually, especially with femharry stories as I read it as prong-slet and 'slet' is Dutch for 'slut', which breaks my immersion every time I read it used by her godfather affectionately. And yes, I know this is completely unreasonable of me.

And at the Marauder's Map, that name alone should have hinted that it didn't mean they were 'the Marauders', as then it would have been the Marauders' Map. It's a map for a 'marauder', not belonging to/made by the marauders (at least going by the name). It's not something I really mind though and it seems like a plausible nickname they'd use for themselves as a group.

*** On your last point; some of those families are really old, like a lot older than the statute of secrecy. I really don't find it hard to believe that these families really were bona fide peers back in the day, and its not like the existing world is going to stop acting like they are just because all the muggles forgot about it.

**** I get what you're saying but I'd counter that by saying that just because their families are older than the statute of secrecy itself doesn't mean that they're landed lords. They could be merchant families or some other type of family that earned wealth. It doesn't automatically make them peers. It's primarily a fanon thing to make that jump, which I will accept if I read it, I'm just saying that there's no canon evidence to back that up.

*** I think JKR did say in an interview that the Marauders did think of themselves as marauders, but I got the impression that they called themselves that in the same way they would call themselves pranksters, as a descriptive term, not as a group name.

**** Our literary tradition traces its roots back to Homer, which is filled with such expressions. They are often used in conjunction with the character's name, though, as in "Odysseus, master of men" or "O Eumaios! o! mine swineherd!" or "Zeus All-wise". Still, it's merely an attempt to get back to the old and venerable traditions in story telling.

The history part is true, but I don't think the fanfiction authors that do this are trying to emulate Homer. They've seen it in other fanfiction and think it sounds cool so they do it also.

*** Actually I really like this. Her name was meant to be Queenie before it was changed to Daphne, so in my head-canon that is still her first name but she goes by her middle name, Daphne, and The Ice Queen is a nickname her friends made up to tease her.

** My pet peeve is when people constantly refer to them by the nickname or some random descriptive phrase. Would you actually call Harry The Chosen One if you were talking to him? If you're trying to get Hermione's attention, would you yell "Bushy haired beauty?" If not, then don't keep referring to them that way. Referring to someone by name is the whole point of a name!
