Ron gets a lot of flak. He may be the most bashed character in the entire fandom. Does anyone have a good fic for us ron lovers out there? I don't have a preference for ships, but I do prefer long and finished.

The fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1920286/1/The-Hero-of-Hogwarts][The Hero of Hogwarts]] by Moslyu.

I wonder if it will work if I add the author.

******** This can happen if there are generically named fics. For something like Conlaodh's Song, it's not an issue, since there aren't other fics by that name. But if your fic name isn't unique, you run the risk of not getting the correct bot reply.

Linking by fic number ID will always be 100% accurate; linking by fic name + author will be 99% accurate; linking by fic name alone isn't always accurate for generically named fics.

This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

*** Courteous fics are fine, but I'm really looking for something with ron as the protagonist for a change of pace. A lot of fics (hpmor is just one example) ignore him completely. Probably my favorite fic is "hermione granger and the goblet of fire" by couldsonn eagle. Hermione's name comes out of the goblet and the whole thing is from her point of view (this is, relatedly, a fic that does not show ron in the best light). I'm looking for something similar, but for ron.
