** I'm not going to attempt to write a fic but I'll try to speculate as best I can what would happen.So this would completely change book 2. With the death of Draco, I can't imagine Lucius still attempting to pass off the Horcrux diary to Ginny. It's likely that Dobby isn't necessarily privy to this information so Harry and Ron are still blocked from getting onto platform 9 and 3/4 quarters.

Assuming that Malfoy doesn't try to pass off the book this year Harry and co has a surprisingly uneventful year except for Dobby still trying to mess up Harry during quidditch with the bludger. Possibly this doesn't happen because Ginny wasn't writing shit in blood all over the walls this year.

Harry never learns expelliarmus because there is no Duelling club as the chamber of secrets never opened and Harry never realizes that being a Parseltongue is rare.

Overally it's likely that Lockhart is fired for pure incompetence rather than losing his memory. Dumbledore never gets the Horcrux diary and the sword doesn't get basilisk venom on it. We can also assume that Harry doesn't learn as much backstory about Voldemort and Hagrid's name is never fully cleared but on the bright side he doesn't end up in Azkaban. Dobby is not released.

For the sake of this prompt I'm going to assume that Malfoy keeps the diary and doesn't try to pass it off at any point as likely the raids ended with the death of his son.

I think it's still safe to say that the Weasley's win the gold in the beginning of book 3 and Ron is able to get a new wand. Therefore Sirius still escapes Azkaban and Lupin is hired that year. Harry doesn't have to put up with Malfoy's dementor shit this year and Buckbeak doesn't end up on trial because Draco is dead.

The gryffindors play slytherin in the first match without Draco's injury and it's likely that Slytherin wins by a large margin because Harry falls off his broom (Sirius would still be there to watch and thus the dementors come to watch) Harry would still then learn the Patronus charm from Lupin

Without draco to tell on Harry being in hogsmeade, lupin never gets a hold of the marauders map. Harry and co don't sneak down to hagrid's either because buckbeak's execution doesn't happen that day. therefore they don't find wormtail at hagrid's hut.

So from here i'm not exactly sure how to speculate. I guess sirius continues to roam around hogwarts not caught. I could still see Snape being a huge asshole and letting slip that Lupin a werewolf. I mean the dude is a huge dick.

I feel like the triwizard tournament would have been cancelled with Sirius still on the "prowl" but i'm guessing wormtail would just go seek out voldemort that year but there wouldn't be a prophecy because there wasn't much of a showdown.

I think the only way Sirius doesn't end up dementor food is if he is able to talk directly to dumbledore. But there has been too much of a butterfly effect at this point to even begin to have an idea of what would happen.

*** I don't think the Triwizard tournament would have been cancelled simply because Sirius was on the prowl. Recall that Sirius escaped the Ministry officials at the end of PoA, and during the canon Triwizard tournament, he was also known to be on the prowl.

**** Touche

Corollary: once Dumbledore knew that Sirius was innocent he got rid of the dementors. Without knowing that Sirius was innocent he wouldn't have fought to get rid of them IMO and it's a pretty bad look for hogwarts to be playing host and having dementors up in that shit.

*** Good write up. Sounds like Draco is way more important to the canon plot than I realized. Not having the diary horcrux or the basilisc fang could have big consequences at the end.

**** Draco's not important, that specific day is. If draco dies a day later the whole of second year is almost identical. Now 3rd year might be a bit different, it just depends whether Sirius ever gets another chance to ambush Peter with Ron and Harry around. Because Lupin wasn't actually needed that night.\\
Peter probably wouldn't go running to the dark lord if he isn't captured, he only did that because the secret was out, if it's still just Sirius he may well just go hide somewhere else.

But yeah if peter didnt go back to voldemort they never would have captured bertha jorkins and thus freed fake moody so even if the tournament happened then harry wouldn't have been made to compete

****** Alternatively, Lucius Malfoy feels the Dark Mark getting stronger, amd seeks out his old master because, without his son, he really has nothing left to live for. Might as well go back where he can take out his anger by killing and torturing innocent people.

**** Thanks. I had to reread a couple summaries of book 2 and 3 to try and tie up all the loose ends. But yeah the war could very well have gone on longer. We know in book 7 after harry "dies" in the forest he sends Narcissa to check his death. If draco was dead she wouldn't have a reason to help Harry. Plus Lucius might still be in voldemorts good Grace's for not letting the diary be destroyed.

The diary getting released in book 5 or 6 would actually make for an interesting prompt now that I'm thinking about it. Harry probably would have handed it over to dumbledore sooner had he found it.

*** It's quite possible that Sirius would have found Pettigrew and killed him without everything going on with the kids during that year. With a fresh body that has the Dark Mark tattoo on the arm it could be enough to clear his name.

Edit: Also Hagrid found Scabbers in his hut. So he might have happened to call the kids down to get him. Everything would have gone the same way, but without Lupin. So, once they're in the Shack, Harry might listen to Sirius or he might attack him. When Lupin arrives he seemed to keep Sirius focused and actually maintain control over the situation, without that influence Sirius might keep rambling and the kids would attack first and ask question later. But, assuming Sirius was able to get through to them, Snape was knocked out, and they captured Pettigrew, then Lupin wouldn't have been there to transform and let Pettigrew get away. So, no need for time travel or to save Buckbeak and provide Sirius an exit, Sirius could be free and Harry could live with him.

** Draco died that day. A curious glance turned into an exploring touch, further changing into a parent's worst nightmare. His body froze, suspended in midair. Mr. Malfoy froze, so unfamiliar with what true danger was after years of complacency under a pardon.

Mr. Borgin, the proprietor, knew he was a good as dead.

Mr. Malfoy pulled the many strings attached to his fingers. Borgin and Burke's was liquidated within the week; Mrs. Malfoy retreated from society after the somber funeral. The family established a scholarship for “needy children” under the guise of helping children reach the graduation their son never would, but a careful eye would see a pattern in recipients.

The contrast of his horrific loss to the generosity of his contributions further solidified Mr. Malfoy's positive reputation. The diary did not make it into Miss Weasley's hands. Instead, Mr. Malfoy continued to rebuild his sphere of influence into something rock solid, a platform of benevolence and concern for society so strong that none doubted him when certain reforms began racing through the Ministry.

This is all I've got. Less of an exact response but more of an examination of how the butterfly effect would go.

** I think they would make another son, because one of Lucius' life goals was to produce a male heir. Grief, guilt, and blame would threaten to separate the Malfoys, but Lucius would be heavily invested in keeping the marriage together. After all, who would he marry, if Narcissa left him? Maybe he resorts to the Imperious curse, or amortentia.

Regardless, the Malfoys welcome a new son, probably within the next year or two. Perhaps they name the boy Scorpius. Eager to get things right this time, they would drill it into little Scorpius' head that when a parent speaks, a child obeys. This Malfoy heir would grow up simultaneously coddled, and on the edge of ruin. He would understand his parents to be loud, angry people, always eager to jump down his throat over every little mistake. He would slink through life, seen and not heard, struggling with the pervasive sense that every silly thing could suddenly and inexplicably result in dire consequences.

Scorpius would be very young when Voldemort returned at the conclusion of the Triwizard Tournament. Far too young to get mixed up in things. Narcissa would be especially worried about bringing the wrath of the Ministry down on a house where a child was learning to speak. Lucius would see no choice but to answer to Voldemorts' call, but Narcissa would make plans to flee with her son.

When the battle in the Department of Mysteries resulted in defeat, Narcissa executed her plan. Less then an hour after the fighting ceased, Aurors descended upon Malfoy Manor, only to find an empty shell. There wasn't a galleon, an heirloom, or an expensive piece of decor left in the house. The Gringotts vault was similarly empty. Far away, in some windswept hinterland abandoned by the modern world, Narcissa and Scorpius eked out an existence under assumed names. The farmhouse they lived in sat on a mountain of gold and treasure.

The Ministry had a pretty good idea that Lucius knew where his family and money had gone, but he couldn't tell them. Indeed, Lucius had agreed with Narcissa that it would become preferable to flee the country with Scorpius and their money, and had gotten an ally to obliviate him.

When Azkaban fell to Voldemort, Lucius was able to contact his wife and son for the first time in nearly a year. When the Ministry fell nearly two years later, Lucius wanted the family back together in Malfoy Manor, but Narcissa wasn't sure about bringing Scorpius, or all the money and heirlooms, into a Wizarding UK where Voldemort still had a tenuous grasp of power. There was still resistance, and people still died. She ultimately decided to return with some money, no heirlooms or treasures, and left Scorpius in the care of a house-elf.

I think the confrontation in the Forbidden Forest would go the same. She didn't like what Voldemort did to her country, or her family. Maybe she doesn't say anything to Harry, maybe she just makes a show of checking his vitals, and makes her betrayal.

Less then an hour after the fighting ceases, Lucius and Narcissa agree that it might be best if they left the country for a bit. So Narcissa sneaks herself and Lucius away to the isolated farmhouse sitting on a mountain of gold and treasure.
