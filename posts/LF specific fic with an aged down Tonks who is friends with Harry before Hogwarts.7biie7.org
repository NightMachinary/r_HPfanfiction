Edit for details: I remember Tonks found him sleeping in a park, and took him to her place. Dumbledore was there for a bit, Tonks' mother yelled at him pretty good. I think he might have been a metamorphomagus too.

** You should try to include some details.

Is this the one where Tonks finds Harry like.. abandoned in a park or something?

Harry hates muggle because of how the Dursleys treated him?
