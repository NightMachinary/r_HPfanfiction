(I tried posting this in [[/r/askreddit][r/askreddit]] but it didn't work) Are there any examples in Harry Potter fanfiction about a full vampire and full werewolf having a kid? It seems whenever I try to search for this, it is ALWAYS either half vampire/half human or half human/ half werewolf.


** You'll want to check out crossovers with the vampire diaries / the originals fandoms.

********* I recommend you watch the 1997 show first. It takes two or three episodes to hit its stride, but it gets really good after that.

******* Read... You've never heard of Buffy the Vampire Slayer?

It is only the quintessential Young Adult TV Series developed by Joss Whedon in the mid 90's Early 00's with a HIGHLY successful spin off of 'Angel' and I believe a on going Comic Book Series.

***** But Twilight is one of the largest fandoms on FFN and the movies came out around the same time for both series. I hate twilight and have nothing specific against the Vampire Diaries; it's a question of size & overlap.

****** Yeah, but I'd rather recommend those 304 ones. Not just because I wrote two of those back in the day.

To be fair, most of it is just Harry/Klaus crap.
