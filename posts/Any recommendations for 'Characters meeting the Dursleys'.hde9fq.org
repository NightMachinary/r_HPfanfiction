I read pretty funny fic about Ginny and Harry going to Dudley's wedding ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7099852][Aunt Marge's Even Bigger Mistake]]), where Ginny gets to meet them and hilarity ensues. I was wondering if anyone knows any similar ones. Any pairings are fine (just not with Snape or Voldemort pls) and gen is good too. Thanks in advance!


** Something like linkao3(An Unexpected Meeting by ballerinaroy)? There is also [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=289683][A Very Dursley Wedding by RumbleroarRedvines]].

linkffn(Harry Runs Into An Old Muggle Classmate by LumosSword134) is not exactly that, but it is from the similar league, I guess.

  Harry had not intended to ever see the Dursleys again. Their parting at Privet Drive felt like a proper close to their relationship. That was until he'd viewed Snape's memories and suddenly he'd been burdened with questions of his mother that no one else could answer.

** linkffn(4133728) has Harry and Luna, married, visiting a zoo with Ron, Hermione, and all the kids. They run into the Dursleys taking Dudley's son to the same zoo. Luna, being decidedly not normal, practically gives them an aneurysm.
