Like in Full Circle, where he acts just like Tom, but only when Dumbledore or Snape are in the room, and just to freak them out.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922615/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Last-Chance]]

In this fic he imitates Tom's speech patterns for a scene to terrify Slytherins.

** Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches linkffn(11574569)

Not quite. But Harry has all of Tom's knowledge and skills. He adopts the persona of Lord Slytherin. And his fighting style is so close to Tom's, Lucius thinks he is his old master in a new body.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
