Scariest fic you know? Psychological thrillers and suspense are welcome too! :D


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]] is pretty good. It's one of the few psychological thrillers that doesn't become edgy.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7701205/1/][Origin of the Damned]] has been really good so far, despite the cliche name.

It's written well enough that the first chapter actually made me cry.

Also... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186953/1/][Are you into Silent Hill?]]

** This is a good one. Psychological-fuckery and pretty darn gory. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4446981/1/All-Problems-Solved]]

The ending is disappointing, but most horror-themed stories have disappointing endings in my opinion.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2837735/1/Temptations-of-a-Dark-Soul][Temptations of a Dark Soul]] would be my favorite of the genre although it is incomplete. Apart from that, there are maybe a handful of good Horror/Psychological Thriller fics ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3292913/1/Skepsis][Skepsis]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/Deathly-Hallowed][Deathly Hallowed]], etc) which is a shame.
