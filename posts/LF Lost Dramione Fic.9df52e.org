I am looking for a specific fic I read a while back and am unable to find again.

The fic is Dramione, post war.

Hermione disappears shortly after the end of the war, and suddenly reappears (7ish?) years later. Draco wonders why she left and why her old friends are so hateful towards her

  we find out that during their time alone in the woods, Hermione and Harry were intimate. She left Britain when she found out she was pregnant with Harry's baby, because she didn't want Ginny or Ron to be hurt by her and Harry's betrayal. (It sounds pretty soap-opera-esque writing it out like this, but it was very well written and this came as a twist later in the story)

** Sounds like Broken

  He felt something close to pity for the woman in front of him. And while that disturbed Draco to no end, what really disgusted him most of all was the harrowing fact that someone or something had broken Hermione Granger's spirit beyond recognition.
