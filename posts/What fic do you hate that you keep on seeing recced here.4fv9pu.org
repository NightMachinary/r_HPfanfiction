[[/spoiler][Harry and Sirius go so Harry can listen to the prophecy, but when they get there they realize Voldemort and his Death Eaters have beaten them there. They get the prophecy orb and start trying to escape and have to fight their way through several Death Eaters. Sirius almost gets blasted through the veil but Harry saves him. When they get to the atrium Voldemort is there and Harry kills Bellatrix to keep the prophecy secret (she heard it before Harry smashed it). Dumbledore doesn't show up in the atrium like in canon, so Harry makes a deal with Voldemort to let him and Sirius go if he tells him the prophecy. Voldemort agrees and Harry leaves out the final two lines, but Voldemort thinks he got the entire prophecy.]]

*** I liked it because it shipped Harry/Katie for a while. However, for some crazy reason the author decided Harry/Katie wasn't good enough, made Katie cheat on Harry (which felt so fake, and obvious that the author didn't care about giving a realistic reason for them to split) and paired Harry with Fleur. That annoyed me so much. How many Harry/Katie fics do you see? Not many at all. On the other hand, there are thousands of Harry/Fleur. Then, unbelievably, the author just *kills* Katie near the end. I felt cheated by the then.

As to what's wrong with it besides the cliches? I shall count the ways:

- Harry's a little emo twat
- His friends turn on him for basically no reason
- Learning from a portrait makes no sense, otherwise why wouldn't at least some of the Hogwarts professors be portraits? It would stand to reason they have far more accumulated knowledge that a live professor could
- Not only is Harry a emo twat, he's also basically a Gary Stu. I mean really, the kid is able to study a years worth of two very difficult classes (at least that's the impression you get from canon) over the summer, and enrolls only to find them easy
- Harry getting a super special wand made for him in hours that increases his magical ability is incredibly stupid

** HPMOR. It's recced frequently enough that I remember it being mentioned. I read some of it, and I really didn't like it.

C'est La Vie is boring, but I wouldn't say I cared enough about it to hate it.

There are lots of fics that I see recced frequently which sound boring or otherwise unappealing, so I don't bother opening them. I can't hate something I've never tried to read.

** The Fallout.

MUCH too angsty for my tastes to even be remotely enjoyable.

** u/MacsenWledig:
#+begin_quote
  What fic do you hate that you keep on seeing recced here?
#+end_quote

None.

It's childish to be offended or outraged by someone else's /Harry Potter Fanfiction/ preferences.

What an immature question.

*** The OP simply asked which apparently popular fics the people here dislike, they did not say anything that insinuates that they are offended or outraged that someone else enjoys them. So, I don't quite get your argument to be honest.

**** From another reply in the thread:

#+begin_quote
  I have absolutely no idea what the fuck you all are smoking when you read this fic.
#+end_quote

Sure sounds like someone's offended/outraged to me.

***** Which is a response to the people inside the thread who dislike that particular fic, not the thread itself. The thread which is asking people what fanfic they disliked that is consistently recommended.

It's simply asking people for their opinions.

*** Naw, there's a good reason. For example: someone asks if any fics out there use this interesting idea, and someone recommends the same pet fic they always do because in chapter 57 of it a background character briefly alludes to the concept in passing.

Also when they ignore requests for a grounded, canon-compliant fic and people ignore it and rec their shitty fap bait because "it's MY interpretation of canon :^{)"}
