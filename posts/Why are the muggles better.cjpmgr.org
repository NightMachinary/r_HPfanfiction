I see it as a reoccurring theme that the authors always assume that the muggles are stronger than the wizards.

Doesn't it seem strange, they always say that the wizards would be unable to shield from bullets, forgetting that the muggles themselves have invented a way to shield bullets, called Kevlar.

I would assume that dragon hide clothing is stronger than that, and those that say it's rare, remember that in the Hogwarts Items list, all students get dragon hide gloves.

And i am sure that they can make wards that defeat bombs and such, by simply breaking the activation trigger or such.

And also, remember the imperious curse, one wizard can cast it on the world leaders and control them easily.

​

I just don't get why the wizards are always made illogical which means stupid, i would assume that when you have the power to change reality, logic wouldn't bear much thought.

And when someone says that the muggle outnumber the wizards, well i'd say remember the mass destruction magic like fyndfire and inferi and the raising of the dead, or hell dementors which can be unleashed on muggles to drain there souls, wizards themselves barely manage to overpower dementors, how would muggles do that when they are unable to even see them.


** I don't think that guns can go through a magical shield, but they're /fast/ compared to spells, so if someone doesn't have a shield charm up 24/7 a surprise bullet could kill them before they could cast a shield charm.

*** You are right, if taken by surprise a wizard could be killed by a muggle. But here are several points to take into account if you want to do it :

- You need to be able to "find" a wizard. Wizards can (and did) create "safe zone" which seem completely invisible for muggles. The anti muggles protections seem to be considered as the simpliest and the most basic protection for a wizard (like, it's their equivalent of a mosquito net), and can be easily topped by some more serious protection like the one they could erect during a conflict.\\
  So, a muggle should be unable to find a wizard while under these protections, meaning he has to look for him in the muggle world. Where wizard are rarely present, and even when they do, most (of the one who bother to come into the muggle world) are indistinguishable from the Muggles. The only time you could find several wizards in the open seem to be at the start and the end of the year, when they bring their children to the Hogwart's Express or take them back home. And even there, you may accidentally shoot a muggle with strange clothing taste by mistake.
- Even if you do manage to do all of the above, and shoot a wizard by surprise while he is in the muggle world, you better make a headshot. Anything else (even shooting the heart I would think) and the wizards may survive long enough to apparate (or be apparated) to the hospital and treated. You litterally have one shot.
- You did it, you got a wizard by surprise and he died. Congrats. Now wizards will consider themselves at war (if it wasn't the case before) and have lot of way to make you pay for it. A angry wizard can kill Thousands easily (Imperius curse on muggle with order to kill people around, release some magical creature and watch the destruction, or just some good old spell like Fiendfyre). Hell, the wizards could make a deal with dementors and just let the "Invisible Death" kill the muggles while they look from afar.

​

In case of a conflict, Wizards would wreck Muggle. I still maintain that the Wizards choose to create the Statute of Secrecy (and maintain it even now) because Muggle were an annoyance (annoyance, not danger) to them and it was the simpliest way. Especially because Muggle have absolutely nothing of interest for wizards. In case of conflict, the first (and potentially only) victim on their side would be the Muggleborns, and even there I think the wizards could not wait for Muggleborn to enter at Hogwarts and go get there after the 1st sign of accidental magic.

**** Your point about the Statute of Secrecy is spot on. It was created in the 17th century in a time were Muggles were even less technologically advanced then now, and Wizards went into hiding even earlier when burning wizards was still common. It was definitely more annoying then dangerous for the wizarding community

**** What about wizards with muggle weapons? Bury five tons of magically multiplied plastic explosives, trigger the taboo, apparate half a mile in any direction and blow the entire hill once the snatchers arrive? Or mow them down with a few machine guns as soon as they materialise. Transfigure the air into Sarin while they apparate in.

I can think of so many ways you could kill wizards with Muggle means or by using them magically, hell Gryffindor had a sword and that supposedly worked well. So why not Potter's AK or 1911 (if you want to go with the copypasta)?

Again, not enough information. A killing curse is more lethal, and seems to light inanimate things on fire.

We can't tell of the lethality to wizards, who seem to shrug off injuries like falling off brooms, windows, and bludgers.

Mind, I always thought the muggleborn/raised wizards ended up better for not taking things for granted.

If a muggle surprised a wizard sure, they could win. If a wizard surprised a muggle, they will almost always win.

Open warfare never really happens, but you have to ask yourself, but not because the wizards were afraid.

Person for person, a wizard is more capable. Wizards have absolute defenses against fire. They have absolute defenses against the physical with the protego.

You have mind control with the imperius.

What you were arguing is that they will win. Sure if someone apparates into a bomb and blows up. But why would they, if it happens once? A smart enemy learns.

It's knowledge. Knowledge is the biggest factor.

The mindset they had in book 7 is bad, but Rowling did not write adult fiction.

***** Yeah, magic and muggle weaponry combined is easily superior to either one by itself. It's a good thing that there aren't many people who know both magic and physics otherwise the risk of magic nukes would be really worrying. Take a small sample of plutonium from a lab, duplicate it until you have enough for a nuke, use magic enchantments to compress it, duplicate the entire thing and turn them into portkeys and send them off to their targets. Even more worrying might be what magic and genetic engineering could do together. Black Death but way worse and not even curable with magic. Or a tiny rune stone that turns other objects around it into copies of itself and you quickly have a grey goo scenario.

**** I've always thought it would be an interesting conflict. Muggles would have a (vast) advantage in numbers, fire power, and industrial/agricultural production. Wizards would have the advantages of mobility, stealth, and individual fire power.

In a pure wizards vs muggles fight I think wizards would win simply because they'd be too elusive for the muggles to catch and could assassanate high priority targets and commit various acts of sabatoge at will, as well as being a generally out of context problem for muggles in general.

However, It is almost assured that /some/ muggle borns would come down on the muggle side, and even if an overall very small fraction of the wizard population "defects" it may be enough to let the muggles leverage their advantages and swing the results decisively.

**** I'm not talking about full on war, I'm more talking about a single guy with a sniper rifle taking out a wizard who doesn't expect this kind of attack. Most wizards don't know too much about muggles, they would have methods of countering guns somewhere in a book but wouldn't constantly use it.

***** Wizards don't "need" to know about muggles weapon. A shield Charm "should" be able to stop a bullet, and if they are not complete morons, it's the 1st thing they would do if one of them is killed by the sniper (ok, maybe 2nd, the 1st would be to apparate but then they would be safe).

Also, your sniper is a muggle, so the attack must happen in the muggle world, somewhere the average wizard pretty much never goes to. It limit your potential victim to:

- A Muggleborn or Halfblood visiting the muggle side of his family
- A Hogwart's teacher going to visit a Muggleborn
- A Ministry employee in a mission like Arthur's Missuse of Muggles Artifacts Office
- Any parents bringing going to, or from King Cross with his child

From these 4 situations, 3 are unlikely because they would need too much informations for a muggle to know without the participation of a wizard (and in this case, the wizard would be better to do the killing himself).

That leaves King's Cross.\\
So, I'm pretty sure that if there is a shooting at King Cross, your sniper could kill one wizard, maybe 2 if he is fast and/or lucky. But then all the wizards would have either apparated, retreated to Platform 9 3/4 or throw a shield charm, Statute be damned.\\
After this, your muggle better leave very, very fast before he is caught by any magical security who is present there, or called after the attack.

At best, your muggle is thought to be a terrorist (because who else who fire a gun, or sniper in this case, in King's Cross). At worst, the Statute failed and Muggle know about magic, and in this case I'm pretty sure it would turn into a war, in only to defend themselves from all the crazy among the muggles.

Magic's involved in reducing toxicity somewhere along the line there, and I just think that given how wizards are already generally sturdier than Muggles, it'd make sense if their innate magic gave them some level of defense against nonmagical poisons.

** Yes, it's very strange how some people think modern day civilisation could defeat a civilisation which can:

- Teleport

- Manipulate matter/create objects from nothing.

- Create shields.

- Enter and manipulate thoughts and memories.

- Alter gravity.

I am speaking, of course, of Starfleet.

This is, I think, a useful comparison: do you think modern day civilisation could defeat a civilisation from Star Trek? Well, wizards possess similar capabilities to an advanced sci-fi civilisation, so if you don't think Muggles could beat Starfleet, then you shouldn't think Muggles can beat wizards.

Indeed, wizards have a number of advantages that Starfleet lack - time-travel, ability to manipulate space, the fact that their abilities do not depend on an industrial base or an energy source. Each individual competent wizard is basically a one-man starship. In truth, wizards are more like the glimpses we see of 28th century Starfleet.

The particular reason why I think this argument is so powerful is that it doesn't engage the mystical aspects of magic. Now, personally, I think that the way HP magic works is fundamentally mystical in nature such that a lot of these comparisons to technology are pointless - magic will essentially always overcome technology.

But the best way to convince someone of your point of view is to argue not on the basis of your own framework, but to say /"even in your framework, my position still holds"/.

So you will notice that I do not mention above any of magic's more weird and wacky abilities such as Fidelius, Taboo etc. Personally I think those abilities speak a lot about the nature of magic and really hit home how magic is operating on a completely different level to technology. But crucially, I don't think such observations are necessary to show that wizards possess capabilities far in excess of Muggles. Even if you limit yourself to a relatively "physicalist" understanding of magic and ignore all the stuff working at a conceptual level, wizards still possess /massive/ advantages.

And all that is just focusing on the question of magic vs. technology. If you expand the scope of the discussion to societal factors too, wizards have even greater advantages, as we see several times how wizards essentially /already have/ an absolute grip on the highest levels of Muggle government.

**** Well, the other mistake here is to assume that Muggles in the HP universe are as smart as Muggles IRL. This doesn't seem to be the case, e.g.

#+begin_quote
  “Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?” said George.

  “Just Muggle-baiting,” sighed Mr. Weasley. “Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it.. Of course, it's very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking --- they'll insist they just keep losing it. Bless them, they'll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if it's staring them in the face... But the things our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn't believe ---”

#+begin_quote
  “How come the Muggles don't hear the bus?” said Harry.

  “Them!” said Stan contemptuously. “Don' listen properly, do they? Don' look properly either. Never notice nuffink, they don'.”
#+end_quote

Muggles in the HP universe are continually depicted as blind to magic to the point of delusion, preferring the comfort of ignorance to facing up to the fact that their world view is fundamentally wrong.

Of course, the point JKR is making is that HP Muggles /are/ real world Muggles - that people are close-minded, and the more "Muggle" you are (i.e. confident in a world view which has no place for the mystical or spiritual) the more close-minded you will be.

Some real world Muggles may take exception to this, wanting to say that real world people would remain coolly rational in the face of magic. But if you do so, then you have to admit that real world people are not the same as HP Muggles, who (much like HP wizards) are generally quite stupid.

And in any case, the use of weapons of mass destruction is hardly common in Star Trek so it does not really represent the "standard" abilities of a starship in that universe.

On top of that, we /do/ have examples of wizarding abilities which could at the least devastate a city. Not that this really matters, because thinking in terms of mass destruction is to make the category mistake of conceiving of warfare in Muggle terms. Wizards' victory condition is not the destruction of Muggles, it is the restoration of the status quo.

It is also to make the mistake of conflating /scale/ with /power/ - something which may hold in the muggle world, but not the magical one.

They like muggle wank and to do that successfully you have to ignore just how powerless muggles are against them, even with the Statute of Secrecy.

In DH we learn Petunia sent a letter to Dumbledore asking if she, too, could come to Hogwarts. How did it get to him? We must assume that wizards have something to do with the muggle post.

We know Kingsley was guarding the Prime Minister, who didn't know it until Scrimgeour mentioned it. One of his employees was almost successfully Imperiused as well. A previous Minister for Magic, Orpington maybe, was friends with a queen. We know there's an Obliviation squad that erases and modifies the memories of muggles.

Something as small as the muggle post and as large as constant contact with the Prime Minister and queen. It can never get to a point of bombs and guns /unless/ muggleborns are involved.

#+begin_quote

Because Hermione said it and muggle wank and Hermione wank typically go hand in hand.

A muggle adult getting blasted off their feet and scent flying 10-20 feet with an Expelliamus would be expected to suffer several broken bones to immediately fatal injuries.

Newt make sure Kowalski was wearing protective pads when going up against the Erumpant when he had none nor spell protecting him.

** There's been several discussion on this and most of it boils down to the fact that while wizards would technically have the advantage in almost all areas, canonically they ARE absolutely awful at any form of strategy. While people bring up that Hermione's the only one to SAY wizards are illogical, we never really see an example of tactical competency from either side throughout the entire series, so canon does back up that claim quite a bit. Basically yeah wizards COULD overpower and counter all muggle opposition, but we never see any example from canon that would lead us to believe they would actually be able to. Oddly enough Barry crouch jr is a actually a really good example of the type of witches and wizards that they would need to take on a muggle government, so there's that.

PS: two more things. One while were used to seeing "soldiers" and professionals of the wizarding world fight, they are the exception, dont remember the exact quote but Charlie at one point literally said that the average witch or wizard cant even properly cast protego. And two, people were mentioning that every shot had to be a one shot kill cause they can just apparate to mungos but that doesn't take into account that movies lie about the amount of dmg bullets cause, if you get shot the absolute last thing you're doing is concentrating perfectly on the ER at mungos lol, at absolute best you end up leaving your legs behind in a splinch and pop up dead in your bedroom cause you decided to try apparating while your insides are actual mush.

PPS: and also all of this is if the war is strictly wizard v muggle, and not most purebloods and some halfblood wizards v muggles, almost every muggleborn, a big part of the half bloods, and a very small amount of purebloods.

For example, muggle repelling charms. People think of them in terms of protecting wizarding settlements from all harm, but they can be used offensively too. A team of a dozen or so wizards could successfully siege pretty much any given muggle settlement just by setting up a ring of muggle repelling charms so that nobody can enter or leave.

Not so well trained in combat magic at the start of the war? Cool, that's what training is for. Not well versed in muggle technology, that's fine, makes sense because you have no need to. Imperio a muggle, have them teach you.

Set up Anti-Muggle wards around every major settlement. No transportation in or out of any kind. Starve them out in a matter of weeks. Don't wanna wait that long? Apparate into the street and cast fiendfyre, disapparate to safety. Apparate into the headquarters of their nation that you are shown to keep at least vague tabs on and decapitate their leadership in ten minutes.

Oh no, you've lost a few dozen people of your several thousand strong force of /demigods/ to landmines. That sucks. Guess you'll have to start going on these raids on brooms instead. That's fine, it's faster than walking anyway.

So losing anyone I a big hit. And it'll get worse as the war goes on, you mentioned the wizard site of preparing and developing an opposition. But on the muggle side its; find a muggleborn, learn the location of the one hospital, the one government building, the one school, and the two social districts, get an easy way around muggle repellants (ie not directly entering the area of influence via long range fire or simply getting a muggleborn to dispel it) and then simply bomb and/or gas them.

You can't get coordinates because wizarding settlements can be made unplottable. It's not clear how that works, but it just doesn't. You can't pinpoint them on a map.

And I've explained why discounting muggleborns is also discounting the entire argument, the fact that they're society treats a part of their population like actual shit is a integral weakness, if you remove that then it would be like removing the fact that muggles can die or saying that every wizard can actually lift entire continents, sure you can write a story where those people have those abilities but at that point its random non HP wizard civilization vs some random humans, it doesn't work for this argument. Furthermore yes while there's not much in my argument about protego being unable to stop a bullet there still much more reason to believe it cant then can, an "extremely strong" example of the charm is mentioned as being cast by a witch to save an injured kids from some mad earl, and said charm stoped his charge and knocked him and the horse back a bit so the horse went on top of him. Now mind you, that specifically an "extremely strong" version of the charm and it repelled maybe 2500 lbs of force spread out across a wide area, an avg bullet hits with 16000 lbs of force across a single precise point and some guns fire around 10 rounds every second second, with each bullet travelling at such a high speed that if you were 250 feet away you would literally not have the time to blink before your chest is caved in and half your internal organs are a smoothie. So even if literally every wizard was capable of performing an "extremely EXTREMELY strong" version of the charm (which we know most cant perform one at all) then that still doesn't account for the fact that most of them would be dead by "PrO-" also fiendfyre is pretty deadly but but we actually dont see if that often, that "untrained teenager" was actually the child of a terrorist who was also being taught to be a terrorist and was at his LAST year of education. Some could be taught but even then the spell does have a tendency to consume its caster and takes time to actually use.

Like, they literally have a dude surveilling the muggle prime minister's office 24/7 even when they aren't at war.

Fiendfyre /is/ difficult to control. Fortunately, you don't need to control it when you can immediately disapparate and let it rage however it wants.

********************** She probably has to be there for them to read the signs and enter the place but they clearly know WHERE the place is and that all anyone needs to know to do a bombing run.

The apparating straight into a military base is suicide in the first place, a gigantic "crack" would alert the entire base and you'd immediately get caught on camera, so you're spotted and hunted within seconds, if you're lucky you apparate near a random soldier and manage to get a snippet fo info like the name of the leading officer and where he is sometimes. Then you'd have to immediately obliviate the guy or kill him or else that information you gained would be useless as they would change things up immediately.

After that you have to hope that the entire conversation wasn't recorded for reasons stated above and that the military decides to continue there normal day like nothing ever happened. All the while now your on the hunt for another guy which means more apparitions which means more security everytime, and every interrogation will simply put you one step closer or lead to a dead end as military likes to keep some stuff out of common knowledge like spymasters and the such and they'd rarely have them meet in person cause that's just common for security.

My argument is that fiendfyre is a niche last resort that's currently known by very few people of an already minuscule population and that most of the people who know it are in super prison for life. Even if they were to release said people the chances of the average wizard being armed up with fiendfyre is slim as even teaching it is considered dangerous and immoral. It's the same reason why I'm not bringing up the oodles of biological weapons the military can easily use. Its unrealistic to assume they'll be common use in battle.

And yeah paragraphs have always been my weak point, it's even worse on here though as the mobile reddit app has a weird way of formatting stuff lol, sorry if my arguments are a bit sloggy to read through in that sense.

You have clearly never been in a military base if you think a loud bang is weird there. Furthermore, the sound generated by apparition varies wildly based on skill and focus, that's demonstrated fairly clearly in the books. It's not like a firework every time.

Generals know who works under them. That's how chain of command works. They also have things like offices, which are pretty easy to learn the location of.

You're also straight-up ignoring my point that wizards can seize control of a muggle government pretty much at will, especially since we know for a fact that they keep very direct tabs on them. The Imperius curse isn't just a limited time in-person affair, it can last for years even on wizards that are actively trying to resist it.

Fiendfyre has been demonstrated to be easy enough to learn by an extremely stupid teenager. It is not a difficult spell. It's only a last resort if you need to stick around after you cast it.

My primary issue is that you continue to just assume that muggles will perfectly countermeasure anything that wizards do but that wizards can't do anything in response, when frankly the opposite is far more likely.

************************ It's more like a loud bang in the middle of a hallway would be weird, especially during a war. And I think we only ever see Voldemort and maybe Dumbledore apparate silently. For everyone else it's a loud crack.

I'm also arguing more for the fact that there's intentionally not a lot of connectivity in between branches of the military specifically to counter the leak of info. To specifically find the guys in charge of keeping track of the muggleborn spies would be a slog of tens to hundred of interrogations. Each time causing the security to ramp up.

And yeah the mass mind control is a big point but from what we've seen there has to be some sort of limit to the number of people one wizard can mind control and when your population is as small as the wizard pop is you would really need to plan out exactly when and who to control.

Which leads me to the last point about countermeasures, the reason I haven't been accepting that point is because my whole argument is that while a wizard community with the tactical knowhow could easily trump a muggle opposition, the wizards we've seen and have been told about throught all of canon have showed not a single sign of being able to pull off anything like what were discussing here.

Yes, under a good thought out plan and through specific training a wizard could apparate in without being detected, leave and use that info to eventually find any and all resistance. And if they just thought it through a ward which disassembles bomblike devices could be an invention that changes the war. A new type of protection charm could make magical shields impervious to bullet fire.

The only problem is in canon, we see that in between two (four if you count FB as canon) different wars there's been little to no new developments tech wise, spell wise, defense wise, and most importantly tactics wise despite every one of those wars taking out significant chunks of a population that they are fully aware is already on the decline.

To be one hundred percent clear here I've been only talking about if the wizarding Britain people went to war against regular Britain's people but the situation could be (and probably is) completely different for other societies. (I could actually see MACUSA using a few of these techniques actually)

The identities of the directors of various intelligence organisations are public knowledge, and thus easy to get to. From there, it is extremely easy to just work down. Only difficult part is finding those leaders' locations, which again, easy with mind control.

Wizards are perfectly capable of this sort of organisation. We see it happen. Imperiusing ministry figures to undermine the resistance. It's a major factor of why Voldemort was winning.

As I said in my above comment (it was a quick edit so you may have opened before I made the change), Diagon Alley existed during the blitz. They would have developed bomb wards /then/ to avoid random bombs even if they somehow hadn't beforehand. Same with gun protections.

By what metric do you claim there was no development of new magics in wartime? Because of course there was. We know they invent new spells and techniques all the time, hell we know even an unusually gifted teenager can develop all sorts of advanced shit in high school for shits and giggles.

The public identities of directors makes them easy to find if you know what you're looking for but in 1980 to 2000 finding that info without a good basis of how would be pretty difficult for anybody honestly.

That's actually a really good point about diagon alley (which I did miss lol) and yeah that's perfectly reasonable. I dont know about gun protections being developed but I can see some rudimentary stuff being set up to protect from bombardment.

I'm assuming that because we see that in between the two wars the exact same spells are used with newbies like tonks using the same combative spells as we see used in the first war leading me to believe that what's being taught hasnt really changed. Which also is supported by the fact that aside from (ironically) Lockhart and maybe umbridge, the textbooks used in class were written ages ago.

We do see some spell creation but aside from the weasley twins, the only new spells were told about is from snape and volds and neither of those two's spells were then taught to the general population. If we take FB as canon then they make it worse since the combatants in those books still use the same ones we see in base HP meaning that even WW2 didnt change what spells were used.

Yeah 1911 was still used sorta commonly around that time but iwmt wasn't exactly the standard thing a soldier was armed with.

Hmm I still think muggles would come out as the technical "winners" just due to sheer size but either way I think not only will it be an extremely bloody war but if the wizards keep using tactics like what you were talking about I dont think they could get wiped out at all.

If anything I'm now convinced the entire war would be entirely useless as what would most likely happen is a short and bloody war with a bunch of deaths on both sides followed by wizard kind just kind of disspaearing into more safe zones after "dealing" with all their muggle sympathizers. Like at that point the only two options would be available, reinstating the statute, or trying to just live alongside their counterparts.

Wizards couldn't keep the land they claim due to shortage of people to actually occupy said land and most claimed spoils would be useless but at the same time muggles couldn't actually finish of the wizards cause their would always be some sort of leak as to when and how thier being hunted and thier mobility means they cant get cornered easily. Plus mother side could actually use each other best advancements (ie charms/computers etc)

TLDR ;kinda just seems like itd be a causuality heavy war followed by a cold war that would either end in a peace treaty via people protesting the Brit v Brit violence or a VERY long campaign to get the statute back in place (however the hell theyd do that,wish we had more info on how that was originally implemented) with neither side really gaining anything along the way.

Yeah, they can teleport and shit, but they can lose literal peices of their bodies doing that if they're not 110% on their game about it. You're not gonna disapperate in the middle of combat.

What are they going to do about IEDs and other anti-personnel mines? Modern military groups still have problems with them.

They've got brooms, but muggles have planes going supersonic. You're not gonna win a battle when your opponent is dropping bombs from so high up you can't breath without specialized equipment.

People here are calling wizards demi-gods, but forget Grindlewald had an army of wizard-nazis fighting along side actual Nazis, and lost - and he was the rightful master of the Elder Wand at the time!

Sorry, but if the best advantage wizards have is being able to set up charms that make it so their stuff is unplottable, they're not gonna get very far. During the 90s, AT BEST Britian had 14k magicals, with 3k being the real estimate(per JKR), (and they had already made everyone but wand wielders hate them). In that same time period, Britian's Muggle military numbered above 200k.

Sure Mugglewank stories are ridiculous, but you can't sit there and honestly say Muggles would lose a war against magicals. Through sheer numbers alone they wouldn't be able to do anything. The only reason the SoS works is because the Muggle governments are in on it.

** Imo, current technology is equal to or superior to magic in terms of raw firepower. I.e. in a flat out fight an armed and trained muggle has a good shot at killing a wizard, and in terms of pure destructive power nukes are probably superior to friendyfire. However, magic is much more versatile than technology.

I mean, magic allows you to become invisible. You can disguise yourself as someone else. You can modify someone's memory, read minds, and take control of people. You have the ability to heal damn near everything. You can travel instantaneously.

While armed muggles could probably take wizards in a one on one fight, that one on one fight would never happen. Wizards could infiltrate and destroy muggle society, possibly without a shot being fired.

*** How are you going to find a place that you literally cannot perceive?

It's like the hosts in Westworld, you show a muggle the Burrow, all they'll say is “doesn't look like anything to me”. The hosts only managed to have any kind of uprising when one of their programmers chose to allow them to do so.

Personally, I think including “muggleborn spies” into the argument defeats the entire purpose of the discussion, because then it isn't “magic vs mundane” it's “magic alone vs magic plus cannon fodder”.

****** Where are you getting this "meatshields" idea from, anyway? Do you think muggles are just extremely numerous monkeys? Also, your argument of muggles vs muggles with superpowers is just as boring, if not moreso. Obviously, if you have special plot magic that negates every advantage muggles have arbitrarily and without exception, the magical world wins. If your magical worldview is more nuanced, and you admit to things magicals can't do, or don't know how to do, it's more ambiguous.

A lot of people seem to be under the impression that "muggle-repelling charms" are some absolute, fidelius-level protection against being discovered by muggles, but we have no indication that's the case. When a muggle approaches a protected area, they suddenly remember an appointment they have to get to, or something else requires their immediate attention. That won't work on drones, and it might break if a large group of muggles is given reason to hold their combined attention on a magical site.

Lastly, if these wards are absolute, and the chance of muggles finding a warded site is zero, what is even the point of this discussion? Is it just to moan about fanfics where muggles aren't so hopelessly outclassed?

** I find one of the interesting things is the assumption most wizards are equally skilled or ever highly skilled.

Quite honestly in general, the wizarding world is not combat oriented. Most folks are going to be able to fight a war if one becomes a thing. Now those that can fight will and probably be very effective, but as others have said there is a lot of separation between the worlds. Would wizards know who and were to strike?

How would they endure a fuel-air bomb? A surprise Hellfire from a drone that waited 19 hours to catch them and lots of other little surprises? What about once you figure out that they rely on natural materials for potions? How would something like agent orange affect wizarding plants? Sure they are magical but they are still living.

As Von Pelt mentioned I thing chemicals are going to be a big things. I thing traitors are going to be an even bigger one. Muggleborns that side against the established wizarding world and aid the Non-wizard one. That would most likely be the deciding factor.

Bioweapons are also an option. If you can isolate a magical disease that doesn't harm no-majs then unleash it repeatedly... Well... Wasn't it Dragon Pox that killed Harry's Grandparents? What about Dragon Pox 3.14?

** Honestly, I think the major difference is that the wizarding world doesn't seem to have arrived on the scientific method of knowing at all. They seem like a rather incurious bunch, or maybe it's that we're looking at them through the eyes of an incurious individual.

The fact that they are long lived means that change is slow to occur, leading to stagnation, which leads to all kinds of societal rot that's bad for progress. Sure, pop culture and scientific inventions are great, but what are the societal conditions that lead to these? They cannot be replicated by making wizard versions of the things themselves.

** There's also just...more of them. Any group can take down any individual, and if muggles believe themselves to be in danger from wizards and thus started a war, then the muggles would fucking obliterate them, no question about it. Especially in America, where police and military violence is so hypernormalized.

There's also the fact that wizards by and large need their wands to perform magic. Wandless and wordless magic is a rare skill that most wizards do not possess. This is literally part of why the secrecy statute exists in universe, it's not that wizards are dumb (I'd more characterize them as out of touch my self.) but that, if there were some kind of reveal of their hiding places and who they are then it would be easy to take them down.

But that's war, in an individual situation it would be more salient. Like a teenage wizard with no access to their wand would be screwed if in a situation where cornered by a group of muggles, but someone like Snape or Dumbledore would be able to come out of it unscathed.

But technology + magic is way better than just magic.

A missile enchanted to ignore anti-muggle charms, to have infinite fuel and duplicated a few hundred times could easily be used to destroy most of Wizarding Britain in a matter of minutes.

If you could enchant an assault rifle to have infinite ammo and enchant the bullets to be slightly magical so they do a little damage to shield charms then you could mow through tons of people ridiculously quickly. Higher fire rate and range than casting from wands.

1) The kinda ok one: People want to bash the hell out of pure bloods, or make their character stronger but in a different way. So they make muggles really strong, compared to wizards, then make the MC strong compared to both.

2) The one that annoys me: /We/ are muggles. Not wizards. Write yourself better to feel better about yourself or the state of the world or something.

One thing that might excuse it is that our MC is a school child fighting /terrorists/ so the offensive spells we get to see are: 1) Instadeath, 2) Stun, 3) Small granade, 4) a charm that's basically scissors no matter how much you read about ‘over powering' the spell, 5) Death by a ton of invisible swords.

** Honestly it is simply the setup. There would be no reason for the Statute of Secrecy if Muggles would do absolutely nothing to wizards if they knew.

And given that the Muggle world has made, well, fantastical advancements in the last few hundred years while the wizarding world is displayed as static, it is hard to see the situation not being worse now then it was before (from a wizarding perspective).

Now, you could say that they did it because it would have been an annoyance to them, or that they wanted to prevent muggle deaths, or that they thought it would end badily for muggleborns, but none of those really resonate with the wizarding world we know.

It is a lot easier to say that while wizards are individually superior to muggles, one wizard vs an army of 10,000 would not win, and given the number ratio difference, it makes sense for them to stay hidden. I wouldn't call muggles "better" in this situation, but the reality of hiding means that you have to entertain at least some possibility of significant damage should the statute fall.

(Now, a lot of fics have the muggle world wiping the wizarding one without any serious harm, and that doesn't have to be the case. You could have it set up so any fight between Muggle and Wizards would result in the victor significantly wounded, weather that be Muggle or Wizard. After all, there are no winners in war).

(Also, I continue to hold that Muggles would totally win in a straight up fight. However, a more realistic outcome would be whichever organized a good attack first would win: Preparation is key, and the wizarding wold is so unstable that it should be easy for the muggles to destablize it enough to win a definitive blow before wizards could organize. For wizards it is even easier: If they prepare, they could set the muggle world fighting itself pretty damn easy, as they have no defense against such deception.)
