** Depends on what you want in your trial scene, there's:

"It's actually my first offense because of Dobby."

"Only my muggle cousin saw me so I haven't broken the statute."

"I was defending myself from dementors and I can prove it."

"You made me an adult with your tournament."

"Behold! I hold the Gryffindor/Slytherin seat, which precedes the creation of this government and so I cannot be judged by mere mortals. Super!Harry away!!!" At which point he blasts off into the distance to save the world from the evil wizard that he is richer, more powerful and better trained than.

Or something original.

What were you looking for?

I almost want to read this as a crackfic, but it'll never live up to the hype in my own mind.

**** Harry raised the relic high above his head as though it were a sword and he a barbarian on the cover of a pulp fantasy novel.

"Behold! I hold Gryffindor's, er, Slytherin!"

"His what!?" yelled Dolores Umbridge.

"His snake. Well, his trouser snake," said Harry.

The severed and yet fully erect member pulsed ominously in Harry's hands, and gave off an eldritch glow. It was almost thirteen inches long, and, most disturbingly, it seemed as though it still possessed life.

"His what?!" asked Umbridge, incredulously.

"His beef wand," said Dedalus Diggle. "His cum gun. His flesh flute. His baby maker. His every-flavor beanpole. His..."

"Enough!" shouted Albus Dumbledore. "Of what relevance is this?"

"Under Wizarding Law," interjected Elphias Doge, "Gryffindor's, er, well..."

"Slytherin," said Harry.

"Yes, fine, anyway, under Wizarding Law, well, it's the Supreme Organ of Government. It will only allow itself to be, er, wielded I suppose is the word, by The Chosen One who is Prophesied."

"You can't be serious," said Cornelius Fudge, who was staring straight at the object and looking somewhat queasy.

"Quite serious," said Dodge. "Under our antiquated, bizarre and ridiculous system, Mr. Potter's word is now Law."

****** A skilled crackfic writer can twist /any/ idea into crackfic. If you had typed "seat" in, I'd have made it about buttocks.

Remember, ladies and gentlemen, any sufficiently advanced form of mental illness is indistinguishable from crackfic!

"Buy Classic Cherry-Flavored Crack! So addictive, you'll read it over and over again! And also try new High Fashion Crack, with extra Draco in Vinyl Pants! Sticky and sweaty, but irresistible! You know you want it!"

*** I'm not picky. I recently read the scene in linkffn(12068079) and I wanted some suggestions for other ways stories that Harry turned the tables on Fudge, or if there were any stories with Harry being charged for something else he did or didn't do.

** I wrote a court scene just today and was thinking I should probably read a few good ones to get inspired. I'm almost glad I didn't because I really like how it turned out. Now that I've written it, I'd like to read some to see how it compares.

Saved!

Oh, and two rec's for you OP, though the second is a WIP. linkffn(8895954) and linkao3(8374798)

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

*** While I personally really enjoy the stories that Vance writes, I feel like the lack of dedication to actually /finish/ any of the already started works hinders a great deal.

The Ilvermorny Champion, Rose Lily Potter -- Metamorphmagus-Who-Lived, and The Vanishing Cabinet Of Time were some stories I really enjoyed reading, then I came to their stopping point and was left hanging, wondering where the story is to go from there.

If, instead, of focusing on new ideas and worked on finishing older stories, I would also recommend Vance, but as it stands right now, I cannot truthfully suggest this author.
