** You can make a post about it in various places (like this lol) but the main question would be are you looking for a Beta (someone to read over, correct mistakes, polish up for a final product) or someone to actually actively write a fanfic along with you. Whichever it is, just make it clear in asking.

** I understand, I've been contemplating finding someone to co-write a fic(I write drarry) for awhile, but I don't fancy having to share my writing and I just feel it'd be awkward. And, like, how would someone even do that with Covid? My laptop doesn't like Zoom or anything like that, apparently.

***** Imagine having a word document where multiple people can log in and edit at the same time. That's google docs.

****** I usually use word and whenever I use docs I don't really explore much. That's actually great.

******* It is pretty good. Doesn't have all the features of actual word (since Google Docs is Google and Word is Microsoft), but it has enough to work with. I use it regularly for collaboration in professional contexts and it's always served us well.
