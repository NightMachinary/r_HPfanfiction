*** Because i'd like to see if any abandoned stories i liked were continued, maybe find some new writers, and break up the monotony of the same "lf xx/yy" that could be found by doing a search or a check of the wiki.

  What could've happened if the Dursleys avoided one traffic light, and Harry arrived at Kings Cross Station just a few minutes early? A chance for Ginny to do something she'd wanted to do all her life.
