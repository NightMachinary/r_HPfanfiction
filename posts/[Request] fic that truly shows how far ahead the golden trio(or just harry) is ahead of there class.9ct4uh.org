As much as they goof around and are lazy, everyone seems to be in aw of them for there conquest. Even if they started off as the laziest students, experiencing those battles and conflicts changes a person. At minimum there reflexes would be increased from dodging death eater spells


** /their/ class, /their/ reflexes, /awe/

** Not really what you're looking for but I feel Tell Brave Deeds of War does a good job at a similar concept with Harry, Ron and Hermione being viewed as heroes-only they are also shown in a human light.

  Ravenclaws aren't meant to be rebels, but then again nothing else this year is normal.

** I don't think they were ahead in their classes. Without Hermione's help, neither Ron nor Harry would have passed the OWLs and left Hogwarts without a degree. Dodging spells they could have learned without attending Hogwarts. It's not an accomplishment.

*** There is absolutely no evidence of that. Hermione might have improved their marks, but neither Harry or Ron are stupid. Plenty of teenagers hate studying, and yet still manage to pass exams and essays. Their exploits outside of class might not have any bookworm applications, but it does help their problem solving skills and ability to work under pressure, which will certainly help them in class. Also, you don't get a degree from Hogwarts, they simply leave with OWLs and NEWTs.
