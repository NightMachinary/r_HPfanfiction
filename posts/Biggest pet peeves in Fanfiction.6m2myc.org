** Mindless canon rehashes, especially when Harry had a different childhood, when protagonists are altogether different characters, or when protagonists are time travelers. I remember one fic in which Anakin/Padme took over Harry/Ginny respectively, and the 2nd Year played exactly as in canon. I say FUCK those writers without a shred of creativity and originality!

*** Exactly. What's the point of writing a fanfic if you're just going to write the books again?

The most egregious offending scene of this in fanfiction is the graveyard scene because a lot of the authors that do this aren't creative enough to find a new way to revive Voldemort. Not to mention I'm of the opinion that even canon Harry could have put up a decent fight against Pettigrew if he had been a little less tired and a little less shocked at Cedric's death. Therefore if you have your ultra-lordship Supreme Magical Duke Harold Potter-Slythinpuffclawdor, who has been trained in magic, wandless magic, blood magic, pyromancy, necromancy, spidermancy, shoelacemancy etc since he was a baby be caught and used for the ritual in the exact same way I simply lose all respect for your creative writing ability (not that I read that far in these fics these days anymore).

**** The mandatory Graveyard resurrection plot is getting nauseating to me. If you ABSOLUTELY have to do it with your super!grey!lordPotter!Harry, do it at least as in "Seventh Horcrux":

#+begin_quote
  We bowed, raised our wands, and began. "Avada Kedavra!”

  The following fight can best be described as very green. Avada Kedavras flew wildly through the air. His were weaker than mine as he was still cheerful after gaining a new body while I was carrying a grudge over his sabotaging my time in the tournament.

  We effortlessly dodged each other's spells. But they found targets easily enough.

  One by one, Death Eaters fell. A few realized what was going on. Lucius, for instance, was using Crabbe as a human shield. Yet their numbers kept thinning.

  Voldemort's spells took out more of his people than mine did, which was surprising because I was actually aiming.

  Eventually, I maneuvered myself close to a wide gap in the ring of my former and apparently current followers. With one last Avada Kedavra in Voldemort's direction, I sprinted away, headed towards the graveyard's gates.

  However, I took a small detour to grab the Cup because it was mine. As I snatched its handle, something tugged at my navel and the world began to spin, eventually solidifying into the familiar grounds of Hogwarts.

  Greeted by the surprised faces of my teachers and classmates, I knew immediately that I had to tell them. After all, I knew something incredibly important, something that mattered. I could not allow them to wallow in ignorance for a moment longer.

  I held my trophy aloft and shouted, "I declare victory!”

*** Oh hmm... But sometimes there are small details that do turn out to be significant later, and when they're covered as a flashback it sounds a bit like you're trying to take an easy way out.

For example, if several of your character's plans in year 3 and onwards require a slightly better Slytherin-Gryffindor relationship than canon, it might not be very convincing to just say "Oh, I sure am glad everybody started to get along better in year 2" when it comes up. I think it would be nicer if the author shows how this development happened by actually writing out the series of minor differences that led up to it in year 2, even if it would mean following the main canon conflict for 10k+ words.

Of course, bonus if the author can write a whole concurrent plot in the shadow of canon during the year 2. Maybe some sort of side quest while the canon main quest is happening?

** Most obnoxious pet peeve is actually misspelling character names. I've seen several stories that were going great, seemed to have a good momentum, and then went: Voldermort. VOLDE- r? - MORT.

Several other fics, different writers, and all of them end up using this one very incorrect spelling. Why?

I hate when people throw out abandoned stories as complete. I once ran across a story that author himself had changed the status to complete on, but only when you hit the final chapter, did it have an "update chapter" saying, "Hey, I've abandoned this."

** Abandoned fics in general are a massive problem. Authors please.... if you have no plans to complete a fic at least allow others to take it over if they wish.

However as bad as that situation is, its not my biggest pet peeve. No... that would be authors tagging a fic with EVERY GOD DAMN TAG KNOWN TO MAN to attract more readers instead of tagging accurately.

PLEASE don't over tag. PLEASE dont tag inaccurately. PLEASE don't tag with misleading tags. It is frustrating, irritating, and strait up hurts the FF community. I really wish FF sites would severely limit tags so that you have to tag with the most important features and not 50 different things even if they only show up for 3 sentences in some random chapter.

Other annoyances: Excessive authors notes, excessive use of cliff hangers, and authors who clearly hold back a fic's possibilities to go for a T rating over M for fear of turning off readers. The cannon books (mainly later ones) are easily M rated. Please dont babysafe your fics simply out of rating fears authors!

Its the same thing as a big budget movie trying to keep their movie from being rated R and instead aiming for PG-13 because they want a larger audience. In the end though by doing that they often compromise the quality of the movie.

Some fics its harder to tell but others.... it can be fairly obvious. FF with darker themes that skip over any violence, instead choosing to simply "imply" things happened. Or FF that treats teen (or even adult) relationships like they are full of chaste kisses and rainbows instead of more realistic depictions. Stuff like that.

** Bad writing. Misusing sayings: jury rigged instead jerry rigged just makes me lose respect for the person. Indiscriminately adding prepositions everywhere because somehow it sounds more mature or posh. People who rely entirely on spellcheck so that their work is littered with the wrong homophones, or when they decide to spell a word phonetically when it'd be so easy to look it up. I recently read something that spelled Reese's, as in the candy, reces. Face palm. Although sometimes it makes me laugh: writhed vs withered.

Gary Stuing. Completely changing a character's personality for no reason (not because they're exploring an AU version of that character). Insane power ups that basically make the character god, which usually follows with that character never taking advantage of said power ups. Indiscriminate bashing that is just juvenile instead of writing a character who is legit fucked up because they're human. Conversely, excusing everything a character ever did because Slytherin=awesomesauce. Making a character super feminine because they're gay.

Being racist without even realizing they're advocating things like eugenics. Because apparently British wizards are just born naturally better at battle magic, no matter that other cultures have traditions of being warriors. Because Riddle, and Dumbledore, and Grindlewald (never mind he's not British), and Harry Potter all lived at the same time somehow equals British superiority. Too bad for every other society on earth, they're just always going to get stomped because they're just not as good as the British, so they're going to act like dumbasses. Or, when writers are even more blatant about it and make muggleborns less powerful than purebloods (and halfbloods because we mustn't make Harry weak) because those purebloods must be on to something if they believe so staunchly in their bigotry that they're willing to die for it.

**** Alright, I've googled it.

The problem is I'm from a city that's known for being corrupt, so jury rigging, as in jury tampering, is not out of the realm of possibility. So whenever I've seen it in a story when someone means the character MacGuyvered something, I've rolled my eyes and wondered if the person actually paid attention to what they were writing.

But, according to the Great Google, jury rigged isn't necessarily wrong since the etymology comes from a sailing term.

Thanks for making me look that up.

historical inaccuracies. I read a fic where Harry time traveled to 1989 and he had the Internet hooked up and invested in Google stocks.

utter nonsense in the wizarding economy. A cup of tea and a week at the Leaky can't cost the same amount.

the use of the phrase " he let out a breath he didn't know he was holding". This is completely insane that I hate this phrase, but I do.

Not tagging a romance fic as romance. I prefer my Harry too busy trying to save the world to have any angst over a love interest.

** My biggest pet peeve is when Slytherin!Harry manages to get the other Slytherin kids to abandon the pure blood ideology by pointing out "Hermione is Muggleborn, and she's the best in our year!"

That's it. That's all the reasoning he gives. Some fics at least add the part about Lily Potter being the one actually responsible for defeating Voldemort, but even then someone who spent their /entire childhood/ listening to the pure blood dogma would at least attempt to provide a counter argument. They wouldn't just drop their beliefs immediately just by seeing two cases, especially when one of those cases is something as relatively trivial as being best in the year for grades.

Inb4 well you know that's racist.

I'm not defending the Pureblood ideology or anything of the sort. I'm just pointing out that these sorts of beliefs don't magically disappear overnight.

"She's not that smart, she just can learn well, if we worked as hard, we'd be as smart"

** One of my biggest pet peeves is actually with canon. There is barely any setup in the stories for magic uses. The only ones I can think of are parseltongue being explored at the start of book 1, then being useful in book 2. And the diary horcrux being used in book 2, then being explained in book 6 (seems convienient though)

Everything else was introduced in the same story it is used in, and stops being used afterwards. Portkeys are a great example of this, Introduced at the start of book 4, and then being the plot point for the end of the book, and never seen again. Other examples are Thestrals in book 5 Deathly Hallows in book 7 Time turner in book 3 I would have much prefered the magic to be foreshadowed in a previous book, rather than be a one and done thing

Newsflash: If you let your house be represented by scum shouting Nazi slogans whenever possible and acting like Nazis when the opportunity presents itself, everyone else will assume, and rightly so, that you support that kind of shit.

If Draco is acting like in canon, then either the other Slytherins are supporting him, or they are cowed by his and the other Death Eater families' influence - and too scared or too stupid to go to Dubmledore and have him rectify the problem with a few visits to parents and a small demonstration why Voldemort feared him. Either way, the rest of the school is not to blame for treating all Slytherins like junior Death Eaters since for all they know, they act like it.
