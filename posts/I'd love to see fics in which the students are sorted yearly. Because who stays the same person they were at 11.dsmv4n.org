** You're not the same. You're more <house>ish.

Look at Neville. He is pure potential realized.

See the 6th and 7th years, how they exemplify their houses?

Sorting isn't an appraisal--it's a sentencing. #WearTinfoilWhenYouSort

** I feel like the house system works a lot better when it's treated as a tool for like scheduling classes and grouping kids with like personalities together so the chance of world war 3 breaking out in the dorm rooms over someone leaving their socks out is significantly lower. The problem is it's considered the be all end all of who you are as a person. Which is a heavy thing to drop on a kid fresh out of elementary school.

This is a fandom problem. The books stress that the house is what you value the most. Hermione says as much tbh. "Books and cleverness" but bravery above all else.

** If you are going to do that you might as well have different houses for every year.

Would make the system make a lot more sense in the hp context though.
