Can anyone link any good "Harry has a gun" fics please?


** Voldemort is someone who totally loves destructive things. Never, ever assume that because the Dark Lord hates Muggles, he would not adopt their modern inventions he finds useful. If Bellatrix runs around with a knife as secondary weapon, what's to prevent Voldemort from using a [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minigun][minigun]] that is magically cooled, lightened, recoil free, and fed by a vastly expanded magazine?

I think the following scene should rather be funny:

#+begin_quote
  Harry and his guerrilla fighters have finally surprised the Dark Lord in the Forest of Dean. He strode forward and declared: “Tom, your evil ways end here today!”

  To his surprise, a minigun emerged from Voldemort's enchanted left sleeve. Firing at 3000 rounds per minute, it cut down Harry to several pieces before he could even scream. Harry's friends returned fire after the initial shock, but their bullets bounced off harmlessly against Voldemort's robe, charmed with Dark Lord's strongest Protego Maxima. It didn't take more than 60 seconds before they were all silenced by Voldemort's minigun and killing curses.

  Looking at the carnage, Voldemort madly cackled: “Muahahaha! Honestly Harry Potter, do you really believe I was that incompetent as not to make a few cool weapons of my own?”

  Harry received some useful advice before the third task. The butterfly effect will be going full-speed. Not everyone is happy with the changes. Enjoy

  Begins summer after fifth year. Harry is stuck at the Dursleys until a phone call changes his life. With goblins, the muggle government, and one Hermione Granger at his back Harry is ready for change and eager to leave an unjust, cruel, and stupid magical world behind. AU, summary not as good as it probably could be, H/Hr

** linkffn(The Sniper by DobbyElfLord). The trial goes the other way.

linkffn(Harry the weapon by slytherinsal). The gun is only a minor bit in the story, which is fun, if tropey.

linkffn(Harry Potter and The Muggle Tri-Wizard Tournament by MartinDC). Cracky one-shot.

  Vernon gets the smarts when accidental magic in response to a bellow breaks the compulsion to be mean to Harry. He is well sore with the magical world which is making a child soldier by grooming Harry, so he decides to turn the weapon back on them by teaching Harry all he needs to survive.
