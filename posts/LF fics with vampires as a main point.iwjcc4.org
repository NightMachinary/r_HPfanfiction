#+begin_quote
  Ron Weasley was a sidekick. He knew that much, despite many believing him to be stupid. He was Harry Potter's best mate, a part of the supposed 'Golden Trio'. So nothing would happen to him, right, being a sidekick and all? Wrong. Ron is unprepared when he is attacked by a vampire just a few short weeks before sixth year. What in the hell is he supposed to do now? AU of HBP.
