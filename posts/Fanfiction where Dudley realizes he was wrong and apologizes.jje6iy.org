Are there any fanfiction out there where Dudley (of the entire Dursley family) realize they were wrong for how they treated Harry and talk to out with him?

Im looking for more of a healing fic than a revenge Fic where Harry is able to get better closure from the people who raised him.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4172226/1/A-Hero][A Hero by Celebony]]

Basically Dudley realizes his families actions are abusive towards harry and helps him escape. It is not much of a healing fiction but rather a Dudley redemption fiction.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

  What begins as a simple trip to retrieve extra cleaning supplies for his mother turns into something more for Dudley, something even he can't explain. He still hasn't forgotten what the Dementors showed him the previous summer, and he's beginning to think that maybe they were right after all. Oneshot.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.
