There have been some fics that I have read, and one that brainstorming/outlining that makes use of squibs.

Basically, are Squibs just Muggles born from Magicals? Or are they an in-between Magicals and Non-Magicals in what they can do?

For example, Filch is a Squib, but he works (and maybe lives) at Hogwarts, where there are wards to hide it from Muggles. So does that mean he can never leave, and/or has to be escorted back to the castle if he does?

In my mind, Squibs can do everything that regular Magicals can, with the expectation to things the require a wand; like casts charms or transfiguring something. However, they can still make potions, or grow magical plants or such, etch runes.

Thoughts?


** I don't think they can actually execute magic, but they can sense and see Dementors and spells designed to repel Muggles don't work on them. My current WIP features the ghost of a British Army Lieutenant who was a squib. According to JKR, Muggles can't become ghosts, but I figure a squib would be able to.

#+begin_quote
  I have been asked all sorts of questions about Squibs since I first introduced the concept in ‘Chamber of Secrets'. A Squib is almost the opposite of a Muggle-born wizard: he or she is a *non-magical person born to at least one magical parent*. Squibs are rare; magic is a dominant and resilient gene.

  Squibs would not be able to attend Hogwarts as students. They are often doomed to a rather sad kind of half-life (yes, you should be feeling sorry for Filch), as their parentage often means that they will be exposed to, if not immersed in, the wizarding community, but can never truly join it. Sometimes they find a way to fit in; Filch has carved himself a niche at Hogwarts and Arabella Figg operates as Dumbledore's liaison between the magical and Muggle worlds. Neither of these characters can perform magic (Filch's Kwikspell course never worked), but they still function within the wizarding world because they have access to certain magical objects and creatures that can help them (Arabella Figg does a roaring trade in cross-bred cats and Kneazles, and if you don‘t know what a Kneazle is yet, shame on you). Incidentally, *Arabella Figg never saw the Dementors* that attacked Harry and Dudley, but she had enough magical knowledge to identify correctly the sensations they created in the alleyway.
#+end_quote

As can be see squibs are non-magical and can't do anything magical. Contrary to what other implied Figg lied about Dementors.

Now to address what [[/u/AutumnSouls]] referred to.

#+begin_quote
  They're not quite Muggles and they're not quite wizards.
#+end_quote

It's from here - [[https://www.pottermore.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-squibs]]

Firstly, it refers to societal stuff.

#+begin_quote
  Although like a Muggle they can't perform magic, a Squib is often far more integrated in the wizarding world. For while a Muggle is as Muggle can be, with Muggle family members and, well, Muggle everything, one of the main differences with a Squib is that they're related to a witch or wizard, just without the magic.
#+end_quote

Secondly, it's from "Features", which is written by some random people and not Rowling.

  Do all young people in Britain's Wizarding World go to Hogwarts? For example, did Stan Shunpike attend Hogwarts? Or is Hogwarts a school just for those who are particularly good at magic while others go into trades without formal schooling? [Mugglenet/Lexicon question]

  Everyone who shows magical ability before their eleventh birthday will automatically gain a place at Hogwarts; *there is no question of not being ‘magical enough'; you are either magical or you are not*. There is no obligation to take up the place, however; a family might not want their child to attend Hogwarts.

In context, these quotes are pretty explicit. Squibs, like Muggles, have absolutely no magic, which is a binary thing - you have it or you don't.

Squibs are not the complete opposite of Muggleborns though, because a Muggleborn is always born to two Muggles, whereas a Squib can be born to just one wizard.

Does this mean that Muggles and Squibs are the same? No. They both have zero magic, but they occupy different social categories. Social categories, like most things, are recognised by magic. We know that job positions have magical reality, for example. So it's perfectly possible to cast magic that distinguishes between Squibs and Muggles, notwithstanding that they both have no magic. This is presumably why Filch can see Hogwarts where Muggles cannot - whoever cast the spell distinguished between the two. (Either that or once you're inside, you can see everything, Muggle or Squib).

Also, FYI, most of Pottermore is not written by JKR, but rather compiled into Buzzfeed-esque articles by a team of copywriters and editors.

Yes, I know, Filch at Hogwarts and all that, but you know -- he may have some kind of spell or charm on him that cancels out the effect of the Muggle-Repelling Charm -- or maybe the "Muggle" part of the charm is just that specific.

Or, one idea that I've had, maybe it's individual from Squib to Squib what they can or can't do, and all that's required to be classified as "Squib" is to be born to at least one magical parent and not have enough magic yourself to be accepted into Hogwarts.

***** Fudge is an idiot though, and Bones didn't have motive to question Figg due to her family's history with Voldemort.

If you read the rest of that passage it becomes clear that she can't even describe what they look like. Even Harry acknowledges internally that it sounds like she's never seen anything more then a picture of a dementor. She certainly didn't see them, only the aftermath, and was mostly lying to back up Harry.

As for squibs in general I guess that can be up in the air as to whether they can see Dementors. Figg definitely didn't, but it may have just been timing. Based on her description of them it seemed like both Fudge and Bones thought something was up... and I never understood why they didn't press the issue. Fudge giving a derisive snort, Bones responding coolly... neither of them believed her.

Fudge not pressing the issue was what ultimately tipped my interpretation towards one in favor of squibs seeing them. In the entire scene he battled every single bit of counterargument - just not the squib. Since I doubt Fudge is a complete idiot - you have to be somewhat capable to become Minister I would presume, even if its just by perfectly navigating your supporters - I always thought he had nothing to win, and knew so as well, by questioning it, even if her testimony was wacky.

As another user pointed out, Rowling made a statement about it, clarifying that she couldn't see them. So my interpretation obviously changed. Now, honestly, I see it as a tiny potential plothole that Fudge wouldn't viciously dig deeper into Figgs story.
