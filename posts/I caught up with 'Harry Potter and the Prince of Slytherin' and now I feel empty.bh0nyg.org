It is such a well written fanfiction. I really like the idea of twin Potters and James and Lily are written well. The manipulations are quite well actually and I used to think that the canon!Harry is actually rather smart but nah, this makes me believe that he was quite ignorant of his surroundings and only bothered to learn about things that concerned him or his acquaintances (somehow makes me swallow his EEs in O.W.L. more smoothly). A lot of things - he simply never even bothered to figure out or try to excell in things in which he wasn't a natural.

Although I do wish the prologue is not how the plot progresses throughout the story. For some reason, I have a thing whenever they pull some name changing bullshit and change Harry's surname from Potter to Black, just not my thing. Also I don't like whenever Harry and Jim have a spat at each other, it feels uninteresting when you got way more interesting things going on (they patched things up until now but judging by the prologue, something drastic is incoming. And everytime they go against one another, the interesting bits gets held back) but then again, I think that's probably the last thing that'll happen considering the whole story is about two similar forces simply going against each other using different skills. I really enjoy the comedy for some reason, even though this is not a comedic fiction. I still giggle like an idiot whenever I read Harry telling Tom about what happened to the Gaunt's house, how it is used by some musician and he says "He's Muggleborn, you know" - that is amazing. In fact, the entire chapter about Harry ridiculing Tom Riddle is amazing, things like he thought Voldemort was bad simply French or how Tom Riddle thought about becoming a genocidal Dark Lord if Binns didn't shut up about Goblin Wars.

It has no bashing (as I prefer it to be) and when it does, it doesn't feel uncharacteristic as most of the bashing fictions are. Bonus points for not following the canon event dates as a lot of them do (which is kinda disappointing when it does happens, I'm not sure if I'd like to read the Voldy is possessing Garlic-head > CoS > Sirius Black > Triwizard Tournament > Prophecy... and so on like it happened in the canon books. It's like they replaced the outer packaging except the inside item is the same, meanwhile this one replaces the outer packaging and also modifies the inner contents quite a bit), it seems to take a different road than the one we're all familiar with and it does it well.

I feel sad knowing that I finished all the pages in like four days and now will have to wait because the third year is turning out to be as juicy as it ever has been.

P.S.: I wouldn't mind some more well written fictions similar to this one.

** I honestly think POS is really quite good even if it has an unfortunate acronym. Most fanfics are just threads, but POS is a tapestry. The author has made significant changes to the backstory of the world, but he's also made sure that those changes make sense in context and can be seen throughout the story; for example, he uses the Lord of the Wizengamot trope, but leaving the Potters alive prevents SuperHarry, and he uses Lord Rings, but those fit in with the theme of his magical Britain being tied together with ages of mutual pacts and agreements. (I think his explanation of fanon Blaise Zabini is superfluous, but maybe he's been in fanfic long enough for it to be relevant.)

That said, sometimes the story feels a bit too densely threaded. Chopping it up into "books" might fix some of the slight pacing issues. Characters from Books 4-6 are appearing in Year 3, which allows for more denseness, but it feels like the story's at a Year 5 place in Year 3 and if it keeps going at that rate it'll probably spend year 5 entirely bogged down in politics like the Star Wars prequels. The benefit of having the whole series be out lets you tackle Horcruxes much, much earlier than Year 6, but at the same time if you're tackling Horcruxes in Year 3...

Nevertheless, I'll have faith in POS until the author proves me wrong.

*** It has a very anti-Slytherin James Potter and he takes it out on his Slytherin-sorted son, Harry.

It's reminiscent of James-bashing stories where he hates his son simply because of his bigotry but, in the case of this story, there's a /good reason/ for it, even if you're not aware of it immediately. So the "bashing" that /does/ happen happens for a reason, but it feels like bashing because you're so used to reading bashing stories.

**** Also, it doesn't help that you get pretty far into the fic (and the bad James Potter behavior) before the reason is revealed.

And I think it may be needful to clarity the usage of the word reason here. For me personally at least, it's a reason in so much as "There is logic to why he's doing what he's doing. He's not a complete irrational bastard." However, I still very much think his actions are morally wrong even in the added context. His actions are at least arguably logical but I would not call them reasonable.

***** I agree.

Find a legal way to disown him.

If you can't disown him, befriend him.

If you can't befriend him, kill him.

Being antagonizing doesn't help with any of those goals.

But his character isn't supposed to be very Slytherin. He sees Harry, rightfully, as a threat. A threat he can't just put in jail, like he's been able to do for most of his adult life, I'd reckon. His actions, while not particularly reasonable, /do have/ reason and fit his character (brash Gryffindor).

That's not an argument against what you're saying; I'm just clarifying why I wouldn't consider it /bashing/ in the normal sense. An attribute has been added to the story and I think the way the author is writing how James reacts to that in a rather in-character way.

*** It's not really clear cut in the fic either. James makes some poor decisions and does some assholeish things, but he has reasons that while not justifying his actions, at least somewhat explain them. So he's not just an asshole because he's a bigoted asshole, so it's not quite the same as typical bashing. This isn't revealed till later in the fic though, so in the beginning it looks like straight up normal bashing.

*** Admittedly this isn't Harry Potter fanfiction, but given you mentioned reading Worm it seemed too fitting not to mention given this is the series going toe to toe with it in terms of popular web serials.

Might I recommend [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com][A Practical Guide to Evil]]? I could wax poetic about it for pages (honestly to the point I fear it may become tedious), but I don't wish to do so on an unrelated subreddit unless actually asked to.

If comparing directly to Worm, without getting too spoilery I would say Taylor and Catherine (the "main" character of PGtE) certainly have similarities though each are shaped by the world that they are in. While the world of PGtE is crapsack for the average person, it is not as dark as Worm. There are definitely consequences for actions, but it's not so dark that you can't enjoy the humor that's actually in the work because you know something terrible is going to happen in a few paragraphs.

In terms of length, it's over 1.5 million words right now (more than Harry Potter, closing in on A Song of Fire and Ice) and has an extremely consistent thrice weekly release schedule with an extra chapter at the beginning of every month

** linkao3(11284494)

It's a ten part series that total over a 1.1 million words as of now. I initially avoided it since the summary didn't particularly capture my interest, but after (the then) 9 parts that I had high on my hit lists when all filters and word count requests were met, I ended up giving in. And I'm so glad that I did. It's currently my favourite HP fic. +(despite that I sometimes still feeling a bit weird about one of the ships, but /at least/ one of the characters shares my sentiment from time to time)+

It's incredibly rich in historic world building (and a bit of international magic world building through that, as well) and I just love how thoughtfully that has been woven in. I'm just going to forcibly stop myself here before I start rambling on about all the things I liked and end up spoiling too much.

Funnily enough, it's what I picked after I binge read through Prince of Slytherin as well. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

**** I can't tell you without major spoilers. I know that's unhelpful. Uh, let me think how to clear it up while occluding the plot.

The thing is, the characterization of the characters works really well together, and most of the time I enjoy the pairing- right up until I start to overthink it. Then it gets weird (on both sides). But that is also handled as one of the relationship issues within the fic, which does diminish my own conflicted opinions about it, too. It helps that it isn't just ignored for the plot, but part of the plot. I can tell you that it isn't an inappropriate power-relationship that makes the other feel coaxed tk obey nor is it incest, though. And it is wholly consensual from the start.

Gosh, that probably made it more confusing, didn't it? 🤔

Wait, I know! Mild spoiler warning:

There would be an issue of an age gap but time travel took care of that, but with a bit of a twist.

Edit: I suddenly realized that I should probably also mention that it has slash pairings, het pairings, etc, as well as mention of polyamorious(?) relationships (what's the adjective of polyamory?) and other genders.
