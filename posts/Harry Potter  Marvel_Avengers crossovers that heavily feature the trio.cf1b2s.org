I like Harry as a character, truly I do. But his character can't carry the entire Harry Potter side of a crossover for me. So are there any crossovers where Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all central characters?

â€‹

(Or just Ron since he's my favorite character )


** It's not really a Marvel crossover but Hermione tries to form an alliance between her group and the Avengers to fight against the Death Eaters and the Voldemort-sympathic Ministry. The 'Avengers' aren't actually the Marvel ones, just wizards who read too many comics. To be more exact, undercover aurors who pretend to be rebelling muggleborn so they use the name from a comic to say 'hey look we're so muggle culture we're totally legit' and infiltrate Hermione's Muggleborn Resistance.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
