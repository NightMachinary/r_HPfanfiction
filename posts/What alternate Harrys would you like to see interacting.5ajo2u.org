So, I've been batting about an idea of a time travel story, but with a twist I don't think has been done before. Basically instead of one Harry, at least four tried the same thing, resulting in poor Lily having to deal with a minimum of quadruplets. But we can go more than that! Anyway, they've all got their memories and personalities, and were raised in different homes, with only Harry (the one named Harry in this universe) going to the Dursley's but all meeting on the Hogwarts Express. The Harrys I'm definitely using are

- War scarred veteran who went back to set things right
- Perfectly happy Harry who got sent back on accident
- Female Harry (she will have other character traits, but I'm try to be brief here, don't worry)
- Evil Harry raised by Voldemort

Can anyone think of other alternative Harrys they'd like to see and request?


** Genius/Mad-Scientist Harry who has figured out how to timetravel and did it for shits and giggles.

Lord Potter who really owns up to the title, demands a harem and gets really pissed when he has to share the wealth of the Potters with 4+ others.

***** Oh no, having a female Harry and just naming her Harriet is one of my biggest pet peeves, I find it obnoxiously lazy, sorry.

Snarky and confident, in her universe she grew up in a universe where her twin brother Harry and her dad James died, but Lily didn't. The result is an impulsive, cocky teen. Haven't decided yet, probably the Weasleys

****** I made a suggestion, not a request. No reason to say sorry.

Though, names in general aren't really hard work... Use what you like. Nothing "lazy" about using Harriet. Just like its nothing special if you go all out and find some super-obscure flower that makes a great name. Names are names. They don't have a massive impact on a story, they only have the purpose of identification.

** I would love to read this story! It would be nice if they could work together as a team. So not sure if truly evil Harry is a good idea, maybe just dark Harry like in Dark Prince Trilogy (he was raised by Voldemort). Canon Harry would be a good idea instead of happy Harry. So he wouldn't want exactly to go back because he alreday won the war but will come to terms with being back in time. War scarred Moody-style veteran - maybe? About female Harry I'm not sure, but maybe more socially confident and cunning.
