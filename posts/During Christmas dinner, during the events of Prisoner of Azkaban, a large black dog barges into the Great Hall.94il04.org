** First half only, since I just kept on adding and my writing tends to be long anyway. I'll probably finish it tomorrow evening. I'd also love some feedback since I haven't actually written anything for a /long/ time, and I was also worried about my tenses while I was writing this. Anyway, my first attempt at a writing prompt:

Sounds of laughter bounced around the great hall, ricocheting off the bells and holly that brushed against the hair, ears and paper crowns atop Hogwarts' holiday residents. The hearth crackled along cheerfully while keeping feet toasty and cheeks toasted, a feeling of deep comfort stretching itself along the single table playing host to the Christmas feast. The single table was filled to the brim with a mismatch of students and teachers, young and old, who, for whatever reason, found themselves seeking the familial cosiness of winter gatherings inside the hard, cold walls of a thousand-year-old castle.

But the walls didn't feel cold, thought Remus Lupin, as he laughed along to Pomona's retelling of one of his friends' many misadventures during his initial courting of Hogwarts. Remus couldn't think of a single holiday he spent having dinner here where he felt any colder than he would when the hall was bursting at the seams from a horde of loud and boisterous students. Even when the distance from the sole table to the walls morphed into a mindfully vacuous chasm, Remus felt the walls closing in on him, encapsulating him, and yet he never felt trapped. Surrounded by distant walls and a motley crew of lonely strangers, the Great Hall always felt snug, the stranglehold of the walls felt secure.

Hogwarts always felt like home, no matter how many it happened to host.

Remus first discovered this as a lonely, desperate 12-year-old. Days after a full moon, while his parents frolicked around the south coast no doubt ecstatic at his decision to spare them his post-transformation blues during Christmas, he limped into the Christmas feast (the limp being an annoying reminder of a particularly brutal battle against a wooden desk in the Shrieking Shack that Moony supposedly had a long-standing disagreement with) only for his senses to assaulted by a physical manifestation of winter merriment. He knew that description was a /slight/ exaggeration, but, while staying at Hogwarts during an integral period of animagus preparation, Sirius had used it to describe Dumbledore, albeit in much crasser language, and after eventually picking himself up off the floor Remus lamented how he'd never be able to look at the man the same way gain, and the description stuck.

It was moments like these that made Remus' reacquaintance with his old haunt unbearably difficult. A constant reminder of contradictory memories, clashing his feelings and stirring up his emotional stew, rediscovering the homeliness of Hogwarts was as much a blessing as it was a jarring taunt that he would never truly feel at home here again. Even as his heart skips a beat while turning his head and getting startled by the grin of a ghost long gone, covered in knitted sweater that flashed like eyes he'd never forget, the hollow feeling that stalked him for the past 12 years had a vice-like grip that was all too familiar to a familiar like himself.

'So I'm rushing down the halls wondering what on /earth/ those devils could have done to have Minerva /screeching/, and I pull open the door of the classroom they're in only to be run over by a giant black dog and a /pig/,' Pomona managed to say in between bouts of laughter that were probably only half brought on by the story and half brought on by the bottle of sherry that was currently being jealously guarded by Sybil. 'A pig! A live pig in Hogwarts!'

Remus couldn't help the smile spreading across his face as he recalled /that/ Christmas, despite him knowing the true identity of the 'giant black dog'. He looked around and saw that even two glasses of Merlot wouldn't have Minerva (God would it ever stop feeling weird calling her that?) leaning back with laughter, although he could see the glint of amusement in her eyes and a soft smile beginning on her lips.

Snape looked about ready to murder someone.

(And God would it ever stop feeling weird hearing people call him /Professor/?)

'Honestly, I don't know how long I stayed on the floor just wondering what the /hell/ just happened. By the time I got up I swear Minerva had Potter's ear so tightly in her hand I could see it ripping at the seams!'

A young black-haired head turned his head at the last comment, but quickly ignored it in favour of his discussion with his friends. He laughed at something the youngest Weasley said and Remus turned away before memories devoured all his attention once again.

'I looked around the room and honestly could not, for the /life *of me, understand *what/ I had stepped into.' Pomona continued with the story, clearly building up the anticipation for the state of the room. He had never expected this of the dirt-covered, gentle-hearted Head of Hufflepuff. Loud and uninhibited, when Remus arrived at the school she was placed at the centre of everyone's attention, and, in his four months in the Hogwarts staff room, she'd never left. 'Four third year Gryffindor boys wearing nothing but a witch's hat and blindfolds prancing around in a circle around a sleeping Peter Pettigrew, Remus tied up by his ankle on the ceiling belting out 'God Save The Queen' at the top of his voice and James Potter sitting atop of a chair made entirely of cooked Macaroni! Cooked!'

*** (apparently it was too long for one comment???)

Fresh peals of laughter broke out again and Remus couldn't help a chuckle escape at the mention of James' /throne/. He'd /insisted/ on cooking the macaroni, for whatever god-awful reason he'd thought of, and after Remus commented on how unbelievably /stupid/ that was, Peter had simply pointed out that that wasn't even the stupidest part of James' role. Before Remus could get in his rebuttal, Sirius was already rejoicing at what he called 'his perfectly cooked high Italian cuisine'.

It was then that Snape got up and stormed out the hall.

'/Merry Christmas, Snivellus/,' Remus heard an unwelcome voice in his head comment.

'Where was Black in all of this, Pomona?'

Septima's question seemed to dampen the mood a bit, but Remus felt that there were too many empty bottles on the table for that to last. '/Think of the Devil, though/' said another particularly annoying voice in his head. '/That isn't even how the saying goes, stupid,/' replied a more sensible side of his mind.

He ignored how the two voices sounded like two bickering voices from his past.

'Oh, that's my favourite part of the story, Septima,' Pomona replied, the slight smugness in her expression betraying the fact that she wanted nothing more than that exact question at this point in her story. 'Although I believe /Minnie/ would enjoy telling it more.'

/Minnie/ met Pomona's teasing expression with a cold glare of her own, and Remus idly wondered how many homework excuses he'd have to sit through before he could match the scowl on her face before Pomona turned her attention toward him.

'Remus?'

Well aware that she was simply stalling to build yet /more/ anticipation (he was a Marauder, dammit, he /knew/ how to tell a story) Remus just shook his head: 'I'm sure your memory of the event is much clearer Pomona, as you recall I was somewhat preoccupied at the time.'

Turning back to her captivated audience, Pomona continued, 'Oh, I'll tell it then, but even I couldn't believe what he did. And I was there!'

'Oh get on it with it, Pommy,' Septima's patience said as it ran out the doors into the fields of Hogwarts snow.

'Oh fine, /Seppy/,' Pomona quipped back, and Remus couldn't help but reflect on how much his tipsy colleagues were acting just like the students they so complained about. 'Just as I started wrapping my head around the chaos of the room, Black storms into the room wearing nothing but a towel and wrestling the damn pig into submission! I whip my wand out expecting to see the giant dog run back inside only for the pig to jump into me and knock me flat on my arse!'

Now /that/ was news to Remus, but he wasn't one to complain about someone embellishing his own exploits. The almost ceaseless laughter and the odd tear around the table made him decide the odd half-truth wasn't hurting anyone.

'So Minerva banishes the pig away from me and swings around to face Black. I was just happy I couldn't see the look of her face at the time... But then guess what Black says!' /Pommy/ was getting into the story even more than her audience at this point. A chorus of 'what's and 'tell us!' went around the table.

'He just starts smirking, I'm sure all of you who knew him remember his smirk,' Nods and wistful smiles went around the table and Remus found himself wishing he were one of the few who /didn't/ remember. 'And then he says, '*Morning Minnie, don't you look positively fabulous today?''

At this point the raucousness of the Hogwarts staff had drawn the attention of the students on the other side of the table and the uncaring teachers were receiving more than a few questioning looks. Minerva seemed to be looking on in disapproval, but any true Gryffindor could tell the difference between her 'disappointed' face and her 'exasperated indulgence' face, the latter being a favourite of Remus'.

Of course, the story didn't finish there. It was easy to tell with the Marauders' stories since they all finished the same way.

'And how many points did you take for this one, Minnie?' Pomona asked once the laughter died down again.

'You know very well I didn't deduct any points, Pommy,' Minerva admitted, seemingly embarrassed. Remus knew why, and he wasn't going to let Minerva get away without mentioning how /exactly/ they were punished.

'As I recall, Minerva,' he said, the mantra /it's still weird/ chanting through his head, 'You punished all but one of us for that day. Tell me, why exactly didn't you give Sirius detention for that?'

Indignant calls went out around the table. Tipsy or not, this coven of teachers couldn't stay silent at behaviour like /that/ going unpunished. Luckily, Pomona (not one to let go of the spotlight that easily) put to bed any possible rumours of Minerva McGonagall being /soft/.

'Oh, she tried, she did. But Black said he didn't do anything, he just found a pig outside and tried to subdue it. Oh, you know how he used to talk his way out of everything. But Minerva was well past any tolerance she had for Black's antics. He'd barely finished giving his explanation when she started shouting: 'Two Weeks! Two weeks detention, Black, for not handing in your Turtle Tortoise Trasnfiguration Task two years ago!''

And as the laughter went round the table one last time for this story, Remus found himself laughing just as much as everyone else. It truly was his most enjoyable Christmas in years, ghosts wherever he walked be damned.

It was as he thought this while looking down at his empty plate and resolving to head off to his quarters that the doors to the Great Hall burst open and Remus's world started to turn upside down.

A large black dog, pursued closely by an even larger pig, crashed through the doors and sprinted towards the table.

Sybil, whose consciousness had been doubted by many for the last quarter of an hour, was the first to react.

'GRIM! DOOMED! WE'RE ALL DOOMED!'

A young student screamed, the dog reached the table, jumped onto it, and then all hell broke loose.

**** Last part:

Remus froze as the students panicked and scrambled to get out of their seats and away from their uninvited guest. A few elbows from his neighbours and even a pasty crashing into his head couldn't snap him out of it and he soon found himself alone at the table as the pig joined the dog's protest against the excessive opulence of their feast. 

Of course, it wasn't the novelty of an impromptu swine-canine grand prix that prevented Remus from reacting but rather the shocking realization of the identity of the dog. The shaggy, sable,  pudding-covered mass currently slipping its way down the table was, of course, none other than Sirius Black.

‘POTTER!' screamed McGonagall as Dumbledore and Flitwick tried to corral the students into a corner of the hall. Harry swivelled his head towards the voice -- with his wand out and ready, Defence Professor Lupin noticed -- and cringed when he saw the look of his Head of House's face.

‘I have nothing to do with this Professor,' Harry shouted over the racket while placatingly raising his hands. ‘Watch out!' The pig had, of course, run straight at Minerva and was about to crash right into her.

It would take more than an over-sized pigmy puff to get one over Minerva McGonagall, however. With the speed and accuracy that was the envy of many a herbology professor, a swish and a flick was all it took and a silent, squealing pig was frantically thrashing about in mid-air. Another swish, a murmured incantation and a yelp coming from Remus' right indicated that the ‘threat' had been completely subdued.

A short silence enveloped the hall as its occupants slowly came to terms with what just happened, and Remus, being slightly more clued up to the *real* goings on, suddenly started when he realised that the ‘threat' was indeed much more threatening than a couple of rowdy pets. Hand snapping to his wand, Remus had the worst curse he could think of on his lips before he was, once again, beaten to the punch by Minerva.

‘Remus! Please tell me that you have, in fact, matured beyond the reckless reprobate that your ill-begotten friends turned you into and did not ruin our Christmas feast with this foolishness.'

Remus blinked in surprise at the tone of the Deputy-Headmistress' voice and had to stop himself from looking down at his feet in embarrassment. 

‘Now, now Minerva, I'm sure Remus had nothing to do with this,' said Dumbledore, mischief and amusement clear in his eyes making Remus think that he was enjoying this part of the evening more than Pomona's story time. ‘Also, if I were to hazard a guess as to where these large creatures came from, I think Hagrid would be a more sensible explanation.'

Attention once again drawn to the dog, Remus turned again and pointed his wand towards the crouching form while Minerva and Albus squabbled over how to deal with this issue, only to freeze in his place for a second time that night. Remus looked on at the dog, wand still pointed, and saw him lying flat on the ground, front paws over his eyes and moaning softly. The sight was so quintessentially *Padfoot* that Remus couldn't call forward all the hatred he had taught himself to feel over the past twelve years. When the paws hit the ground and a pair of milky grey eyes looked up at him, Remus found himself lowering his wand and all the air in his lungs deserting him.

Confusion and conflicting feelings waged a battle for the ages inside Remus' head while normalcy returned to the hall. Elves had begun restoring the feast to its former glory, while students and teachers either returned to their seats or used the excitement as an excuse to end the party on a high note. A cat, one Remus recalled belonging to Hermione Granger, stalked over to Sirius and started rubbing up against the prone dog affectionately. Spotting Remus' intense stare, the cat returned a glare and took up a protective stance in front of the uncharacteristically quiet, subdued dog.

Mind made up, although feelings still scattered and mushed, Remus turned to the still squabbling senior staff members: 'I'm not sure about the pig, Minerva, but the dog isn't Hagrid's. It's just a stray I saw walking in Hogsmeade a few weeks ago. I'll take care of it for now, no need to worry.'

Not waiting for any response beyond a brief acknowledgement from Dumbledore, Remus turned towards the dog only to find it standing behind him, ready to follow. After staring into the dog's eyes for another short eternity, Remus started towards the doors and out onto the grand staircase. A soft pitter-patter followed him, and Remus tried to pay attention to that instead of the ghosts of the hallways that now used this emotional opening as a new opportunity to assault his carefully forgotten memories. Making his way up to his quarters, his head started spinning as the battle inside his head reached fever pitch. Sense and reason fought against a deep aching in his heart, a long-lost hope crushed by a decade of loneliness, and Remus found himself stumbling into his quarters and having to lean against his dresser.

The pitter-patter stopped and Remus found he still had the sense to wave his wand and close, lock and silence the door behind him. Still facing the back of his room, his shoulders started shaking as the past five minutes caught up with him and he started to truly process what was happening. As his eyes began tearing up, his gaze was caught by a photo on his dresser that he usually had the good sense to ignore. His resolve building by the painful reminder in the photo, Remus managed to slowly start turning toward the beast behind him.

He didn't raise his head, however, and as he finished turning he found his vision dominated by a pair of dirty, broken shoes and the bottoms of ragged pyjama legs sitting atop ankles of pure flesh and bone. Sucking in a deep breath, Remus slowly lifted his head and took in the ghoulish appearance in front of him. Emaciated, shrivelled, frail, weak, all the descriptions flew out of his head when brown eyes met grey, and all Remus felt was a deep welling in his chest.

Another short eternity, and then:

‘Sirius.'
