Like lord potter except with Sirius instead where he has to navigate to pureblood society but he is still in character

So he still doesn't like pureblood society and the whole situation irritating to him but its a useful position and he is the one with the title

mc Sirius

no oc x sirius no one harry generation x sirius no incest no marlene x sirius

anything else is fine including slash fics

** There's the Pureblood Pretense series by Murkybluematter. It's an AU in which Riddle is a powerful politician and blood supremacy is alive and well in Britain, but in a more subtle way than the civil war/terrorism of cannon. Sirius's 'son' goes to Hogwarts and happens to make friends with a bunch of blood supremacists (but is firmly not a blood supremacists himself), and Sirius finds himself in a position that requires him to play at Pureblood politics, despite his aversion.
