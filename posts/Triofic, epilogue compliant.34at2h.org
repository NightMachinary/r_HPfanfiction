Anybody ever read "Always and Forever?" looking for something like that - Triofic or non-canon pairing or trio that's still technically epilogue compliant.


** Sorry, you'll have to help me out here. Which Always and Forever are you talking about? Who is the author?

** You know, I thought I'd read all the good triofics out there, but I tend to avoid the post Hogwarts stuff unless the description catches my interest.

Glad to see I was wrong. Always & Forever has to be the most realistic, most /human/ triofic I think I've ever read. To be honest, I'm not quite sure if I really like it, but I know it's damn good. If that makes any kind of sense at least.

I normally go for a more gushy, romantic focused triofic, and Always & Forever is definitely not that. It's very gritty, and I could actually see it happening in real life. I found it really hard to like any of the trio in this fic. Maybe it's because I've been involved with a threesome relationship, but I found the dishonesty fucking disgusting. There were numerous times I really wanted to just punch Harry straight in the goddamn mouth while reading through.

That right there tells me the author did something right. Because even though I had that emotional investment, and really wanted to knock out all three of them, I was still rooting for them in the end.

So uh, in DLP terms, 5/5.
