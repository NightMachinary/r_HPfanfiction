** As far as weird mixes are concerned I think "Pack" is definitely up there. Harry Potter/Jurassic Park...

Linkffn(13391615)

At least it worked for me. Your mileage may vary, but seeing as its by "mjimeyg" who is some kind of weird crossover expert, you should at least have fun with it. He has a bunch of other weird ones, like a HP/Hawaii-Five-0 crossover that is decent too. Or "Harry Brown". And of course the less weird and more well known ones like "Ah, Screw It!", "Harry Potter: Geth" or "Harry and a Vampire". I come back to his stories like once a year to reread them and anything new he came up with.
