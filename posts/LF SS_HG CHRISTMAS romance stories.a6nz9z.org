** People on [[/r/HPFanfiction]] mostly abhor Severus Snape, loathe ships with Severus Snape, and don't really enjoy fics that do anything other than bash him: they will almost always downvote you to fuck if you ask for or rec anything along the lines you have.

I might recommend asking on a Snape-centric or SSHG-centric community on Dreamwidth or Livejournal. I run [[https://snapecomm.dreamwidth.org/][snapecomm]], which is a Snape-centric Dreamwidth (although I don't really ship SSHG so I can't help you myself), and from what I can see, [[https://sshg-promptfest.livejournal.com/][SSHG Prompt Fest]] is active, so you could ask one of the mods there for recs.

Snape is an abhorrent human being, but a quite interesting character. You can do a lot with a character like that in fanfic, but as most fanfics suck, so do most interpretations of Snape.

When he's shipped with students, yep. Just as I wouldn't be ok with a story of Sinistra banging Harry. However I have no objections to reading a, say, Snape/random dark witch pairing, for instance. Also Snape/Lupin pairings are among the few in the fandom that actually produce less crappy stories than usual.

Not true. Soul Play is an excellent story, perhaps 9.5/10 material and it's Snape centric. I like plenty of mentor/guardian Snape (ofc most are AU), like Resonance and Stronger Than Hope. Lomonareen has a bunch of gen stories where Snape plays a role and she's very competent in her interpretation.

Random tangent: Snape was done a disservice in his moment of death. He should have died taking down half a dozen death eaters, rather than because V wanted a wand.

**** I like Snape as a gross misanthrope with a tendency toward nastiness too, lol. The person didn't say they wanted Hermione as his student - generally, I would assume people are referring to adult Hermione if they ask for SSHG.

I was generalising about the general tendencies of the sub to explain to OP why they were downvoted to oblivion for asking for such a simple rec.
