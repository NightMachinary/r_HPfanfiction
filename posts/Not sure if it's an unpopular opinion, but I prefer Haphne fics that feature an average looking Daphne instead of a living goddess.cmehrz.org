** I'm toying with a story where Daphne has the potential to be a beauty, but due to psychological issues (read: melancholic depression) she doesn't put in the effort to make herself look attractive. Think no make-up, dark lines under her eyes from a messed up sleep schedule, hair messy and unkempt (usually just pulled back into a loose ponytail and with large bangs covering part of her face), things like that.

  Daphne that is either average looking at best
#+end_quote

Canon Harry isn't going to notice an average looking girl and he's only going to notice an ugly one to point out what's ugly i.e. Pansy is described as pug-faced every time she makes an appearance. So this might be true for the Daphne Greengrass in JKR's mind, but the blank slate is going to be pretty for the fanfiction community.

*** ...But Harry /doesn't/ notice Daphne. Like, at all. Plus, Hannah and Susan are arguably average, in that Harry doesn't take particular note of their appearance. He notices the Gryffindor Chaser trio, but doesn't do anything in particular with regards to them, pretty or not.

**** No, Harry doesn't notice Daphne, so, as I said, her being average might be true in JKR's mind, but she's a blank slate and, despite having them wear name tags, JKR has him miss Nott's whole existence for 4.5 books, so this can and is often explained away by Harry being oblivious.

What little stories there are involving Hannah and/or Susan are typically harem fics or Harry with someone else entirely.

#+end_quote

He doesn't notice them, actually, and the only one described as pretty in canon is Angelina. There's also fewer stories with them on FFN than Hannah and Susan.

Most Harry/Daphne stories are in a canon world and begin no earlier than Harry's 4th year therefore a semblance of his character must be kept and that is why the blank slate is often described as beautiful. That's all I was getting at.

Because they're underdeveloped, and they don't really offer an alternate take of Slytherin that the community is desperate to see. A Slytherin instantly adds conflict and drama to the story.

This is true, actually. I thought he'd described them as pretty once or twice, but I can't find it so I'm probably wrong.

******* I disagree, isn't she as you said a blank slate? As long as she isn't a model tier goddess in the canon of JKR then she can be subpar looking and still wouldn't be too hard to imagine. As for the second point, in many fics harry falls for her for a lot of reasons, often times none of which are her looks. They have options together for example, just because he never got hard looking at her doesn't mean there is no chance for them to get close and fall for each other. You mentioned Hermione, well I know many stunning looking women and I can't bring myself to think of them as nothing more than a sister figure as best, that's their relationship. According to you, canon harry will only fall for a woman if he found her attractive physically from first glance non? Ps: died you actually downvote me for giving my opinion? Xd
