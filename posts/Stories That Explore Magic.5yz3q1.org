Looking for fic that plays with magical boundaries, pushing or expanding on the canon map of how magic works in the HP universe. Fine with any pairing. Example: Temporal Paripatetics linkffn(12016373)


** My go-to recomendation for requests like this is linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane)

Harry and Dumbledore are both great characters in this. Its well written and has some good worldbuilding going for itself.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

*** Once upon a time, I would have also recommended For Love of Magic, but the author has something of a (literal) hard-on for excessive amounts of smut. In fact, as of the latest chapter, his author's notes include a rant on why he's including smut-with-plot and why you, the reader, just need to grow up and deal with it.

I still like the story, I just can't recommend it.

**** I completely reccomend it. The smut is frequent but I feel like its explained well enough to not bother the central story. Most of it can be completely ignored if you chose to and you wouldn't miss anything story breaking.

That said the story is long and convoluted. It's not a story for everyone but it is a fantastic work. All of noodlehammers stories are on my favorites list.

** linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches) -- dark, voodoo magic

linkffn(Harry Crow by robst) -- goblin / alternate magic, somewhat OP Harry, but nice development of goblin culture

Then of course there's also linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality). I didn't like this one as much - I got bored half way through but it's an interesting read if you have time on your hands.
