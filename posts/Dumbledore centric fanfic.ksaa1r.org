I watched Crimes of Grindelwald recently and I'm craving for some Dumbledore centric long fanfic. No bashing of any characters. If you do know any fanfic please do link them below. Thank you.

** Beside Me... Always is an 82-chapter, 600,000-word retelling of Harry's story from Dumbledore's perspective. While I haven't read it in a long time and it may have weaknesses I didn't notice when I was younger (I was a far less critical reader back then), I remember enjoying it at the time as one of very, very few stories that I felt did Dumbledore justice. Hope you enjoy it.

** Dumbledore's next great adventure is good. I haven't finished it yet, so it might turn to shit half way through.

*** Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure is one I'd definitely classify as bashing. It's fairly clear that, from the author's perspective, the "bad" Dumbledore is the canon one, and the "good" Dumbledore is what the author believes he should have done.

*** Might be a stretch on the no bashing actually, there are two Dumbledores, the bad one gets bashed.

** I think the closest I know of is The Peace Not Promised. That's actually focused on Snape, but as they're working closely together, Dumbledore does appear a lot.
