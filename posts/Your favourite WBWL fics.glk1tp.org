*** Yeah I dislike any amount of bashing It's one things to have characters shown in a negative light and another to destroy all of their positive aspects and have them portrayed as idiots on top of that

** I mean, this is my own, but I honestly can't think of many that meet your requirements, (hence a self rec here) It updates weekly and I don't really “bash” characters. I will portray them in a negative light and have them do questionable things, but they will all have their roles and motives that justify said events. linkffn(13507192)

I would normally recommend Prince of Slytherin, but I am assuming you dislike the portrayal of James in that story.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.
