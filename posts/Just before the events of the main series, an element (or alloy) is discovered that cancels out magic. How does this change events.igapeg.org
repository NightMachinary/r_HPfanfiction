Even a small amount can "weaken" the surrounding magic, i.e. repelling charms lose effectiveness.

If bound to a witch/wizard like handcuffs, they become powerless. And if they are bound for too long, their magic goes into overdrive (like an autoimmune disease) and starts killing them.

How would this change the events of the series? And what if muggle discovered this element?


** Muggles might accidentally create it, but since they don't know about magic they'd not realize that it had any significant property. There are two other groups who might discover it though, with very different results. If goblin metallurgists discover it first and make melee weapons with it, you have another goblin rebellion that'll last until some muggleborn gets the idea to use guns against them. If wizard alchemists discover it, it might first be used for scientific purposes such as vials that can hold magical acids that'd otherwise destroy any container. Eventually someone might make bullets out of it and depending on who gets that idea you get another civil war.
