Before:

1. OK writing
2. Has a plot

Now:

1.  Great writing + minimal spelling and grammar mistakes
2.  Harry is the main character
3.  Set during Hogwarts years in a recognizable/magical universe
4.  No canon re-hashing of events (e.g. PS, basilisk, Sirius) -- new, interesting plot
5.  Realistic villains
6.  Limited romance
7.  No crackfics
8.  No bashing (no evil Weasleys, Dumbledore, etc.) -- by extension basically no WBWL
9.  No long-range time travel
10. Features a reformed/fanon Snape
11. Pulitzer prize winning
12. Will change my life


** Yes. 100% yes. I found an old floppy disk (yup, been reading HP fanfic that long) with a bunch of really old fics saved on it. I tried to read one and holy shit was it horrible, but years ago I thought it was so good it was worth manually copying and pasting every chapter into a word doc to save it.

If anyone is interested in some ancient shit tier fics that you've probably never heard of let me know and I'll send them along.

** I'm definitely not as far into extremes as OP.

For me to read it, a fic has to have the following:

1. Decent writing + minimal spelling mistakes.
2. The premise is interesting
3. The summary is well written
4. Does not have unannounced crack.
5. Does not bash characters.\\
6. Does not bash settings.

I would also like to see the following, but it is by no means required:

1. Old tropes used in new ways
2. Creativity
3. Places larger Author's Notes at the bottom of the chapter, not the top.
4. Addendum to 3: A large author's note is fine in the first chapter to talk about your fic before jumping in, particularly if it has problematic elements.
5. Avoids engaging in power level wankery. Does not nerf things author dislikes and buff things author likes.

The main thing I look for now is great writing and moderate pacing. I don't have the patience to sit through a 13 year olds first attempt at fanfiction or a major, philosophical debate slowburn.

** Yes.

Personally I think its because I'm getting older - and in particular because I have so much less free time.

Back in high school, or even university, I would read anything to pass the time. Especially since I didn't usually have the money to buy books, fanfiction was a blessing. (Although in hindsight, I regret the fact that I didn't ever think to go to a library...)

But now I have so little free time that I demand a higher level of quality. Plus I also have more spare cash, which means I can more easily fill what reading time I have with published fiction. So any fanfiction I read has to be able to compete with published fiction to be worth my time, which is a high bar to cross.

** Oh yes! 100%! Sometimes I look back at the stories I've read before, not even fan fictions just on wattpad, and I have to wonder how I thought /this/ book was the best thing ever when the only “plot” was “he/she doesn't like me!” and has many spelling errors and ridiculous nicknames like “Slytherin Prince”, “Ice Price”, “Golden Boy,” “Gryfindork”, “TBW” (the boy who lived; literally that was what the author used the entire book).

My standards are higher than ever. Before I didn't have standards besides that the book had to be capital “I” and have proper punctuation. Now I have to have a great plot, small angsty, strictly slash, strictly bottom Harry; with certain people or I don't read, must be at least +20,000 words (longer the better!).

And oh my god, your #12. Must change my life. I usually don't get to pick those, I usually find life changing books by pure accident and don't realize what I'm getting into until I'm utterly destroyed (but in a great way) then I must question my entire existence whilst knowing deep down it'll take me months or even years to find the next book that will wreck me - which is sad but at the same time gives me good motivation to keep reading and searching for that next diamond among all the silver and gold.

The pickier one gets the harder it gets to find great reads, but once we find them it's so worth it all in the end!

** Not really. I find that restricting myself too much means I miss out on the fun stuff. I like clever ideas and seeing interesting concepts be explored and I'm not reading for ships so I'm not limited there (although, some dynamics I am not terribly fond of and some ships have characterizations that I don't really enjoy when they're paired together - but there are always exceptions). I might be on a Harry Potter binge or a Ginny Weasley binge or Nagini binge but it's usually because certain concepts and tropes tend to favour certain characters.

I love WIPs, rarely read anything that is complete unless I just happen to click on it, and tend to bounce between fandoms depending on what tropes and ideas are more prelevant in them when I'm binging (this week has been a lot of demension hopping and Time Travel, for example, so a lot of HP, Naruto and BNHA).

Good written stuff can be terribly dull, badly written stuff can have an entertaining and interesting core concept that makes my brain whirl so I don't consider grammar a measurement for how good something is as long as I can get through it.

** I've only been reading Harry Potter fics for a year or so and I definitely have standards. Of course, I was reading fanfics long before I started with these, and was writing some in my head even before I heard the term, so some standards do tend to migrate from one fandom to the next.

Decent writing skills are important (spelling, grammar, etc), but I have made exceptions, depending on plot and the author. New to English, sometimes, early story but later ones have improved, that sort of thing.

Related is I'd rather not read the 13yo's first story, since they don't understand a lot about life and it shows. They also tend to gloss over or rush events that should be expanded upon. I read my own efforts from when I was 16 and wince and shudder, so not being that harsh.

My preferred ship is Harmony, and I find I've started avoiding HP/GW ones unless I've already read it. Other pairings I will not read is Harry or Hermione with an authority figure (Snape, McGonagall, Dumbledore), the undeniable bad guys (Voldemort, Bellatrix), or incest. Not a fan of a lot of slash (although background WolfStar is OK), so forget Drarry as well. There are others I reject because the characters are unappealing or I don't know them very well. Luna's usually just fine, though!

Don't mind most Weasley or Dumbledore bashing (always disappointed when the twins are full bore gits), but I'm happiest when Hermione and Sirius stay on Harry's side. And it's nice when Neville gets developed.

I also don't mind covering old ground if presented well. I've read a lot of 4th year fics and post 5th year ones where Harry gains his independence, for example.

Not interested in fem!Harry and not a lot of WBWL ones, although I've seen some good ones.

If you're reforming Snape or any of the Malfoys, I need good reasons for the turnabout.

Tone down the rhetoric and the repetition. Reading the same revolutionary concept 5+ times /in full/ in one fic is dreadfully wearying. Also, this isn't a soapbox. Please be subtle if you can.

** Definitely. I think it's because fanfiction at first managed to get by in my mind as a gimmick, knowing the characters beforehand and the setting just made it such a comfortable read. But once that stopped being a gimmick and instead became just a regular accepted part of what I expected... Good writing is good writing. I went from well written original works to shitty fanfiction, and now I won't read anything if its not at least well written fanfiction. Though I do obviously accept lower quality when I latch onto a new gimmick for a while. Specific pairings, crossovers, self inserts, that kinda thing. Eventually gimmicks in writing always burn out, but good solid writing is always a great read.

** Yes and no. What really kills new fics for me nowdays is lack of novelty in something. The first time I read a Marauder-era fic for example, it was a new and exciting era for me, and I read more or less anything that was part of it. A while back I asked in here for the first Marauder-era fic I read since I forgot the title. Someone delivered and I tried to re-read it again, but wasn't able to stand it.

But a fic that can stand on its own, not just for the novelty? I could probably re-read most of them today, and new fics of similar quality.

** I'm extremely picky as well and I hate it. I miss the days where I could open any fic and have a grand ol' time, but nowadays it takes really subtle things like the author's choice of words for me to drop it instantly. It makes me feel like I'm such an insufferable snob, like I'm only worthy of Tolkien-level writting.

I'm trying to change though, and I think I'm making decent strides. I started 'The Black Book' by mosteveryonesmad yesterday and did not drop it at the mention of Harry's full name, though the whole "Blacks destroy their enemies!!!" spiel really did test my patience lmao.

** Don't worry, you're gonna grow out of that. You'll slowly get more and more disgusted with the fandom and abandon it for 2-3 years, to cleanse yourself. Then one day you'll stumble on a recommendation or alert and you'll read it in one go... and you'll feel your addiction rise up again. You'll start reading in a frenzy, trying to discover everything you missed the years you were asbent. Afterwards you'll find yourself parched and your standards will lower again, so that you can get your fix.

Yes, its what happened to me.

Tl;dr Fanfic is crack and low quality crack is better than no crack.

** Definitely. I think it's a feature both of tastes refining as we age, and in the case of HP in particular, of having enough variety to allow for choosiness. For my smaller fandoms, I'll read just about anything that looks even half decent if I want fic, because that's the only option. HP, on the other hand, is such a massive fandom with such a vast quantity of fanfiction that you don't have to settle for scraps.

I actually just dug up the first couple HP fics I ever read back in 2005-6, and I'm a bit nervous to reread them, hah. I have such fond memories but the odds are good that they will not have aged well.

** First rule, if it has slash, its a no go, girl boy don't care. If its Dumbledore talking or recalling past events fine. But I find all slash fiction tedious to read. Same with op harry, lord harry, Harry getting treated like a half elf, same applies to evil Ron duplicitous Hermione. Essentially I want a coherency to what I read. OC characters that are gay is fine. Another pet peeve is saving fics which goes along the harry as a house elf bit. Finally shoehorning romances into a fiction also. It should not be the focus of the story. Also out of character. I am sorry but the idea Draco would just magically fall in love with Hermione is idiotic to me, just like Snape having a good side. Essentially I want a story, but I don't want to read an oc pretending to be a character.

** Yes: most fics these days are just rehashes of rehashes. I don't even give fics that have "bashing" or "Lord Blah Blah Kitchensink" in the summary a glance now.

Originality is dead (well, mostly: including crossovers, there's like 1/1000 fics that aren't trope-filled crap now?).

It's why I mostly like niche sites/areas than FFn: more originality comes out of these areas than on there.

Hell, this sub is one of them: it frequently has a ton of good ideas that aren't tropey and are unique.
