**** Statistics beg to differ:

[[https://bbc.com/news/stories-5414287][bbc.com/news/stories-54142487]]

Summary: Statistics show that predominantly peaceful protests are far more successful at toppling governments than violent revolts (1 in 3 vs 1 in 10). At least part of this is that for a variety of reasons, peaceful protests tend to have a higher level of participation, which means its more likely that regime forces will know people they care about among the protesters, and be less willing to use lethal force on them. In other words, statistics show that love is politically more powerful than violence, at least in some situations.

There is some ambiguity, noted in the article, about what forms of protest constitute violence, for example is property destruction that doesn't hurt people violent, is self-immolation that only hurts oneself violent, etc? However, the presumption that violence is the most or only effective tactic, in politics at least, is false, and unsupported by evidence.

Edit: For some reason, the link doesn't work. Shame, its a very good article. For anyone who wants to read it, its titled "How many people does it take to oust a political leader?" and can be found on the BBC website.

****** Just refuting the idea that violence is necessarily more effective.

However, we do see at least three cases of love/unwillingness to kill people on the other side causing followers of Voldemort to defect: Snape and Regulus in the first war and the Malfoys in the second. Sirius also noted that Voldemort had widespread support at first, until people saw how far he was willing to go for power.

It wouldn't deter Voldemort himself though, or Bellatrix. Normally in the real world that doesn't matter- if the regime's troops refuse to fight, it doesn't matter if the leader and a few fanatics want to fight on. There just aren't enough of them to maintain control a country. However, magical Britain has so few people, and is so reliant on magic, that a few exceptionally powerful people can arguably be a nation-wide threat (hence major wars being decided by duels between individuals).

So yes, Voldemort himself had to be forcibly opposed- but non-violent tactics might have been successful at peeling support away from a Death Eater regime.

Its pretty telling how fast Voldemort's regime crumbled into nothing (both times) when he himself fell. Its clear to me that he did not have broad support- he stayed in power only by his personal prowess in battle, something a real world dictator could never do.

******* .... You do realize Snape wasn't "Non-violent" in his bringing down of Voldemort. You seem to be confusing individual actions that helped bring down the regime with the regime being dismantled. Voldemort was violently opposed, a few in the opposition of him may have been nonviolent, but the overall resistance was violent.

​

As for real world dictatorships falling apart when their leader died:

May I point you to the Macedonian Empire, Alexander died and all his Diodachi decided to fight among themselves?

Trujillo is a good modern example, he died and all of a sudden people had been against his regime from the inside all this time. Shocking /s

I'd use the Nazis but they were kinda falling apart long before Hitler offed himself.

The list does keep going though.

​

Non-violent movements only work when the government doesn't want to just disappear the dissidents:

PinochetJapanese Empire, if Gandhi had walked up to a Japanese officer and told him he would nonviolently protest the Japanese, they'd have laughed at him. Then killed him.

Nazi Germany wasn't brought down non-violently.

******** I presented solid statistical evidence for the effectiveness of non-violent protest. Vague assertions, or examples from thousands of years ago (Alexander) or extreme outliers (Hitler) do not invalidate the overall point.

I also never claimed that there is no situation ever where violence is justifiable- Hitler is kind of an obvious one. And also an exceptional one, even in the history of authoritarian regimes.

While there may be rare cases were violence is both justified and effective to some extent, the presumption that violence is always or usually more effective is just that- a presumption. And not a credible one. People insist that it is right because centuries of cultural conditioning, appealing to our primitive instincts, make it feel right- not because the evidence supports it.

Those who believe change must or should come through violence are actually often very useful tools for fascist dictatorships in the real world. They're the ones dictators hope to whip up with agitators, to turn the opposition violent in order to discredit it and justify a crackdown. Street violence is very comfortable territory for fascists, and they aren't afraid of facing their opponents on those terms, because they know they'll usually win.

The fictional threat of Voldemort is a somewhat different situation, due to the unique strategic situation in the magical world which does not and could not exist in reality. Yet even there, Rowling is smart enough to show that the most violent approach isn't always the most effective one.

********* One cannot help but conclude that such reflexive dismissals of non-violent protest occur not because violence is demonstrably more effective (it isn't), but because on some level, many people /want/ it to be.

Its not surprising really. The idea that violence is inherently more effective, "pragmatic", etc. than non-violence may not be supported by empirical evidence, but it speaks to the primitive, savage animal part of our instincts, the desire to lash out ad dominate and kill, reinforced by thousands of years of social conditioning which glorifies war and violence as honorable, righteous, manly and "bad ass". It doesn't have to be right to /feel/ right- to have what Steven Colbert once termed "Truthiness". And it seems so simple. Everyone "knows", on a gut level, that violence is more effective and powerful than non-violence, and so any evidence to the contrary can be dismissed as self-evidently false.

*********** Yes and no. Violence may be "easier" than restraint on an individual level, for people who are already frustrated and angry enough to want to engage in it.

However, for those who have not reached that point, its probably going to be easier to get them to join a peaceful protest than committing violent acts. Also, while a random act of violence takes little in the way of planning or training, waging an effective campaign of violent resistance takes a great deal of both. These practical difficulties are among the reasons given in the article I originally cited for why peaceful protests tend to attract more participants than violent ones.

But yes, violence holds an emotional appeal to the angry and frustrated which appeals to our more primal instincts (reinforced by millennina of social conditioning). It is then rationalized as "necessary", but too seldom do people stop to really examine whether "necessary evil" is actually necessary, or just an excuse.

****** Whether violence can bring change is not the question. Whether it is the most effective or necessary way to do so is. And the answer, factually, is a resounding "no".

The statistical evidence is clear: non-violent protest is overwhelmingly more effective at overthrowing a regime in the modern world than violent protest. No one has actually refuted that evidence. You certainly have not. You have simply asserted that "radical change" (for however you define that) usually occurs through violence, and cherry-picked a few examples, most of which occurred centuries ago under very different conditions from those that exist today.

But of course, any counter-argument or evidence can be dismissed out of hand, because "that's what they want you to think". This is why it is pointless to argue with a conspiracy theorist- any possible counter argument has already been dismissed as a lie, and a part of the conspiracy.

Most governments do not want protest of any kind, violent or non-violent- but authoritarian ones would most likely prefer that if there is widespread protest, it turn violent. Because then the opposition will lose support from more "moderate" elements, and they'll have a gift-wrapped pretext to arrest or shoot the opposition as "terrorists".

Aspiring fascist movements want violence, if anything, even more. Do you think for an instant that fascists are intimidated by the idea of their opponents engaging in violence? Hell no. Fascism fucking thrives on street violence. That is the territory on which it first gained power, and that is the territory in which it is most comfortable, at least in the early stages before it has completely consolidated its control.

And no, that doesn't mean everyone who engages in violence is a fascist. But violent protests, regardless of their motives or ideology (which may be sympathetic) are, to some extent, playing the fascists' game. And I question the strategic wisdom of that choice.

********** Non-violent protest played a key role in a number of the revolts that lead to the downfall of the Soviet Union- Romania seems to be something of an outlier, IIRC.

Also, not all the revolts of the Arab Spring were successful in bringing about the overthrow of a government. The first and probably most successful, in Tunisia, were mostly non-violent protests, with most of the deaths resulting from attempted government crackdowns, and succeeded in toppling the existing government and setting up a democratic state. Meanwhile the most violent conflict to emerge from the Arab Spring, the Syrian Civil War, was an utter failure that after killing hundreds of thousands of people, creating millions of refugees, destabilizing the entire world, contributing to the rise of xenophobic fascist movements, and basically leading to ISIS's rise to power, ended with the dictator Assad still in power.

Again, the question is not "Can violence ever effect change?" The question is whether it is the most effective approach, and particularly whether it is the most effective means for internal protester movements to overthrow a government. To which statistical evidence suggests the answer is "no". Citing individual examples of violent conflict bringing change does not refute the larger picture.

************ While I don't have the data to confirm "most", that can certainly happen, yes.

The escalation of violence sometimes takes the form of a deliberate tactic by oppressive governments and law enforcement (or by fascist militias)- to try to provoke opposing protesters into violence in order to discredit them and justify the crackdown. It is not at all unknown for police to use agitators hired to infiltrate a crowd and instigate violence. This is kind of my point- authoritarian regimes try to turn protests violent because its an effective tactic to do so, thus discrediting them and "justifying" the use of more violent measures against them.

In the article I cited above, a crucial point is that a protest movement needs large scale support to have the best chance of success. Around 3.5% of the country's population seems to be the magic number- if that many people are actively involved in the protests they will (almost) always succeed. The main reason offered for this seems to be that the more people are involved, the more likely it is that regime forces will know people among the protesters, and the less likely they will be willing to use lethal force against them.

If regime forces are willing to simply gun down the protesters en mass, then the revolt will probably fail. If regime forces split fairly evenly, then I suppose that's how a protest movement turns into a civil war.

Yes, it will take a certain amount of people to be involved in the protest in order for the authorities to say "this is my friend. I'm not killing/beating/gassing/arresting her/him" because otherwise it's considered a coup/terrorist attack. But I will also bring an argument for your statements.

  Besides, he preferred not to share knowledge of any sort, as the more his ants knew, the more complicated they made things, and the more trouble they were to manipulate 'For The Greater Good.'

  He'd never quite completed that phrase out in public. People always imagined the tag line 'for the greater good of the world', or 'society in general', but every time he spoke it he completed it in the privacy of his own mind the way he actually meant it, 'for the greater good of Albus Dumbledore.'

  It really was only fair. To his mind, the rest of wizard-kind were nothing more than bugs, deserving of pity perhaps, for not being as magnificent as he, but certainly no empathy.

1. Thinking that spelling out the full name of Dumbledore is some sort of a sick burn. ie: "Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore".
2. Making Dumbledore's eyes twinkling into some sort of a sign of him using mind reading or alternatively and even more lazily just make Albus's eyes twinkle every god damn fucking time he speaks to Harry, so much so that one might start to draw the conclusion that Dumbledore has asked a couple of brain surgeons to install friggin' laserbeams inside his fucking eye sockets!
3. Make characters tell other characters how stupid and how sorry they'll be that they ever did bad stuff or said bad things to Harry and that Harry is the bestest EVAR and that they and everybody is just not worthy is licking his fucking boots or whatever. People that write like this must have some sort of a serious mental problem. It's definitely giving me mental problems to read this shit!

****** I've got a fair few character tropes that I dislike, and Harmony/muggle supremacy is near the top. Daphne isn't a character that I dislike per se, I have a decent amount of fics with her that I enjoyed. My issue with her is that the majority of authors that write her as lazy as shit and try to push her in against all logic, sometimes even when the fic is 75% over. Majority of fics she's in, it's always the same character, down to even her lines being the same. Outright rude until she's suddenly not, uses 'neutral' or 'gray' in every other sentence, has a father that has a raging boner for the idea of his daughter marrying a guy she's just met. And while none of those things are explicitly bad, it feels like 90% of the time they're done in the exact same manner. /Down to the same sentences./

Daphne to me is pretty much a character where I don't really mind her, but I get worried every time she pops up in a story because half the time she ends up being copy-pasted from another story, which copy-pasted it from another, and so on.

** What is it about the way that authors write Dumbledore saying "for the greater good" that has you steamed?

I'm automatically assuming that it's because the authors use it in a way that doesn't fit properly with the characters or story or whatever.

Its like the phrase "the next great adventure". I've seen people throwing that phrase around when random characters use it to talk about death just because Dumbledore used it once or twice.

The reason Albus used it (from what I understand) is that he's an old man close to death that is making himself feel better about the unknown that comes after death. He's reminding himself that there is a natural order to life, and that there is worse things than death. That someone who fears death can do incredibly evil things, like Tom Riddle did.

So when I see a young character using it as a euphemism for death even when they aren't giving a eulogy, then I just kind of roll my eyes at the immersion break.

-Any gratuitous portrayal of rape/other non-consensual sexual acts/other forms of abuse, eg for shock value, as a plot twist, to bash/prop up characters, or (ugg) for porn. And yeah, that includes coercive arranged marriages.

-Attributing most or all of Harry's protections to Dumbledore's magic (devalues Lily).

No, Wizards aren't all stupid, backward, and completely ignorant of the non-magical world, and the No-Majs aren't all more enlightened than the backwards wizards (no, not even the "first world" ones).

I also have an intense personal dislike for the use of the term "wards", but that's mostly just irritation at how often the term is used given it never appears in canon. So I didn't include it on the list.

**** Fair enough.

Though I'd appreciate if you could expand on 'House Elf slavery apologism', which I find a bit strange. I acknowledge that AUs exist, but in canon portrayal the House Elves are only enslaved to the extent they allow.

*rant start*

They have potet magical abilities without a need of a focus, can perform multiple feats that are impossible to wizards (teleportation at Hogwarts) with little effort, there is no canon evidence of them being regulated... Their chains are literally paper thin, since as Dobby proved, it's possible to free the House Elf without meaning to, and as Kreacher and Dobby both proved, they can be sneaky and ruthless when motivated. If they truly wanted to be 'free', they would be, and wizards have no means to prevent that. The chains here might as well be made of wet paper mache.

Despite this, there are a total of 2 examples of a HE bending their Master's orders, or doing something to harm them that was not covered by them.

#+begin_quote
  A *brownie* or *broonie* ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language][Scots]]),[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownie_(folklore][[1]]]#cite_note-1) also known as a */brùnaidh/* or */gruagach/* ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic][Scottish Gaelic]]), is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_deity][household spirit]] from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_folklore][Scottish folklore]] that is said to come out at night while the owners of the house are asleep and perform various chores and farming tasks. The human owners of the house must leave a bowl of milk or cream or some other [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice][offering]] for the brownie, usually by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearth][hearth]]. Brownies are described as easily offended and will leave their homes forever if they feel they have been insulted or in any way taken advantage of. Brownies are characteristically mischievous and are often said to punish or pull pranks on lazy servants. If angered, they are sometimes said to turn malicious, like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggart][boggarts]].
#+end_quote

Seems familiar? Labour in exchange for offering, very proud, sneaky and cunning, not afraid to get their mitts dirty... I'm looking at you, Dobby.

So in a setting where the wizards took their time to genie-proof the elves, or place some serious magic on them to keep them in line, sure, I'd join SPEW. But in canon we see several hundred elves, four of which were named. The only ones deviating from 'perfectly happy, don't bother with me' were Dobby (belonging to the arc villain and designated sneaky bad guy) and Kreacher (driven insane by lack of social interaction and, possibly, dark magic).

But in any setting or AU that does not go out of its way to change the situation they're in, I see this as a symbiotic relationship, into which all parties entered of their own free will.

Additionally, on SPEW itself. Insisting on granting someone the right to self-determination in direct opposition to the decision they make using that very right strikes me as hypocritical and wrong. *If you make someone choose, respect their choices.* The lack of research done on the matter by a usually research focused character was not the best for that either.

***** This is exactly what I'm talking about.

There are only three house elves who have any significant role in canon.

One, Dobby, explicitly and repeatedly violates his masters' orders, and desires and embraces freedom.

A second, Kreacher, accepts being a slave in theory because he's been taught that his whole life, but despises his current master (Sirius) and actively schemes against him.

The third, Winky, is devoted to her master- but she does not transfer that devotion to her new masters once she ends up at Hogwarts.

The only "evidence" the books offer for most elves being content with their lot is Dobby's claim that the Hogwarts elves were offended by Hermione's attempts to free them. That is... very slim evidence to go on. What was their objection? Was it that they were all super-stoked to be unpaid labour with no rights? Were the offended not by Hermione's intentions but by the half-assed way she went about it? Did they prefer to remain at Hogwarts simply for lack of better options? Were they simply parroting the beliefs they'd be indoctrinated with under threat of punishment and magical coercion since childhood?

In short, all indications are that House Elves are sapient beings with a range of individual attitudes toward servitude, not automatons who are all biologically or magically coded to want to serve wizards.

The claim that it is "a symbiotic relationship, into which all parties entered of their own free will" is entirely fabricated. There is virtually no canon information, to my knowledge, about how House Elves come to be or enter into service with a family or institution, but what little we have suggests that they are generally born into it. In any case, Dobby clearly did not remain with the Malfoys of his free will, nor did Kreacher with Sirius. So even if they had entered the arrangement willingly (again, there is zero evidence for this and quite a bit against it), they would still be slaves. You cannot sign a contract permanently forfeiting all rights- not in a civilized society, anyway. Nor can "consent" given under coercion or threat of force be considered valid.

But since you said yourself that you find the clumsy but well-intentioned efforts of a teenager to oppose injustice worse that defending actual slavery, its clear from the get-go that you have a fairly warped perspective on this issue.

And if I seem worked up about this, it might have something to do with the fact that a lot of the arguments offered in defense of house elf slavery (they're happier/better off as slaves, etc) are the EXACT SAME BULLSHIT American White Supremacists used in the real world to justify Black slavery.

*#1*: Wouldn't know, as the topic was not touched upon further.\\
*#2*: Possibly, mine certainly was. The fact that it was Hermione doing it was worse, because I had higher expectations of her at the time.\\
*#3*: Possible, though unlikely. As the situation with Mrs. Smith proves, the token non-evil Pureblood is not likely to mistreat the elf, even if they are not particularly respectful of them.\\
*#4*: Possible, though, as before, unlikely. After all, there is only one instance where a Hogwarts elf was given orders of any kind that I recall, and that was during the Battle of Hogwarts. That means, little restrictions, well divided work and ability to observe generations of students from many backgrounds. In that case, the first step would be to distribute educational materials to get them to consider alternatives.

Finally, there is one more thing you didn't mention: Dobby didn't just say that they lacked appreciation for her efforts. They actively refused to come anywhere near her and excluded her place residence (the Gryffindor tower) from their coverage. That means both: a, that they were against her actions. And b, perfectly able to refuse to perform their duties, which is directly counter to the definition of slavery, which is:

#+begin_quote
  *Slavery* and *enslavement* are the state and condition of being a *slave*, who is someone forbidden to quit their service to another person and is treated like property.
#+end_quote

Add to that that while our society is, more or less, build on commerce, it is not the only way to build a society. And using any one model as 'superior' or 'civilized' is a slippery slope. Besides, even in this capitalistic society, there are arrangements where pay is lowered in exchange for things like free access to cafeteria, apartments, various other amenities. Dobby, as a free elf, only ever spent his wages on socks - a hobby and a gift to his idol. All his other needs were provided for, or at least there is no evidence they were not.

I also mentioned that if any compelling evidence was provided, I was perfectly happy to reconsider. Unfortunately, your post contained very little in the way of that.

Finally, we come to Hermione.

#+begin_quote

Starting with argumentum ad hominem, then continuing with a reference to atrocities commited under paper-thin justifications... And quite a different situation as well. After all, if the comparison was complete, both the Native Americans and the black slaves would have had nukes and the only concern for retailation (or lack thereof) would be saving enough usable farmland.

As for the argument itself - the road to hell is paved with good intentions. The revolutions are always bloody. So, yes, I do consider using one of the most forceful methods available, without researching the matter, without consulting anyone who could have a more informed view on the matter (Great man, Dumbledore! to go for a low hanging fruit)...

I'd even go as far as state that just using/connecting to that event was an argument made in bad faith in similar vein to me comparing Hermione's quest to free House Elves *explictly against their will* to the Crusades, and the attempt to 'save the pagan souls'. I'm not doing that, mind.

I also noted that I acknowledge the Elves as individuals... And that means *respecting any choices they make, regardless of my opinion of those choices.*

One thing I will give you is that I lack evidence to disprove the following:

#+begin_quote

Fair enough. I checked, and there are only two instances of unemployed elves, Dobby and Winky, and only one instance of re-employment (Dobby). Dobby's employment comes as a result of meeting with the Headmaster and coming to an agreement on terms of it, that's it. But I will admit that it is not a definitive proof.

​

In the future, I'd like you to limit yourself to blaming me exclusively for my actions and their direct results, and not pull me into the conflicts that, presumably, neither of us has first hand knowledge of. I, for one, came into being on the other side of the world and over a century later.

** You know what? I'd like to read a Dumbledore story that actually embraced For the Greater Good, and stuck it in preexisting canon. Meaning Dumbledore sided with Grindelwald. Meaning Grindelwald won. That would be the darkest, at least plausible reality. Because remember, you can't have Greater Good Dumbledore without Grindelwald.

** Kkkk I hate Dumbledore, so anything that allows me to indulge in it, I'm all for it. I'm all for some good old Dumbledore bashing. If you sprinkle some Ron bashing too, I'm hooked.

*** Could you expand that? What is it about the character that you dislike? Any canon traits of his you find repulsive? Or is it just that you love hating on him? Just curious.

Myself, I'm generally against flat characters, but by Merlin I do love me some slapstick or shadenfreude from time to time...

** I tend to excuse this depending on when the fic was written. I know a LOT of fic I remember reading back before the connotations of the phrase were revealed in canon had Dumbledore using this as an explanation for his actions. It was already pretty cemented in manipulative!Dumbledore fanon before it ever came up in canon.
