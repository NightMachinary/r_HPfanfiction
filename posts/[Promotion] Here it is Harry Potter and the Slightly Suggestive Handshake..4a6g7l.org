A few weeks back I asked this subreddit about two possible titles for my fanfiction, and everyone was extremely helpful. Some people asked me to post when the story was out, so here it is!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11823877/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Slightly-Suggestive-Handshake][Harry Potter and the Slightly Suggestive Handshake]]

Summary: In order to increase 'the power the Dark Lord knows not,' Dumbledore gives baby Harry a powerful love potion. This bold move results in...unusual consequences. Witness Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, Boy-Who-Caught-the-Snitch-Two-Times, and Boy-Who-Conquered-Voldemort-But-Did-Not-Kill-Him at his very best...which is considerably less impressive than everyone expects. AU.

Hope people enjoy it!

*** Thanks! Some of Harry's actions disturb even me, sometimes...thankfully, he is not based on anyone that I know. Can you imagine being friends with someone like that in real life?

** This is exactly how I'd imagine a fic based off Lockhart would read.

And I have no idea what that means.

*** I hadn't though of it until you brought it up, but I do kind of imagine that an adult Lockhart's personality placed in a young child would seem like Harry. Though of course, Lockhart doesn't have Harry's many talents. Such as his abstract sculpting abilities. Or his many scars...

Speaking of Lockhart, I have big plans for him for Year Two. He and Harry will certainly clash. Especially when you consider that Harry loves Hermione. And Hermione...has a bit of a crush on Lockhart...

** That was unique. Perhaps go easy on the short sentences and sentence fragments. Overuse makes them slow down the narrative when I think you were trying to speed it up.

*** I really appreciate the feedback. Was there a particular place that you noticed a big problem with the fragments and short sentences, or was it just a general issue? Reading it back, maybe the Sorting Hat scene especially has this issue?

**** Perhaps right at the start. I seem to remember lots of 2 or 3 word sentences slowing it down.
