My idea is that after the end of Book 4, Harry finds a Fifthist church and converts to Fifthism. What would change in book 5?


** As i am not entirely sure what that belief is about (besides worshipping chuhulu/scp like creatures?) If Harry is FOR the creatures, i could see him sending DE sacrifices to various beeings, gathering followers in hogwarts, or other crazy (or bloody) stuff.
