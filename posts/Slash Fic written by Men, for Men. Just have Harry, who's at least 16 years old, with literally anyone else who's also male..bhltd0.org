Don't post it if the person who wrote it has a girly user-name or writes girly fics. Don't post fics with the pretext: "i know you said you didn't want slash written by girls, but...".

Other than that, feel free.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

*** That was one hell of a fic! I have spent the whole day and night reading it and have no regrets. Thank you for suggesting it. Do you know any similar fics? I mean, without stupid slash tropes, an awesome Harry, maybe with a rare pairing as well.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/979182][Cartographer's Craft]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/copperbadge/pseuds/copperbadge][copperbadge]] - Post-sixth year Harry paired with a sixteen-year-old Sirius Black. I haven't read this fic, but I've enjoyed his Remus/Sirius fics.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785][The Man Who Lived]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/felix_atticus/pseuds/sebastianL][sebastianL (felix_atticus)]] - Post-war EWE Harry/Draco. Haven't gotten around to this one either, but I enjoyed the author's Remus/Sirius and Neville/Male OC fics.
