** I swear I read a fic like this, but all I can remember is that Harry was in a relationship with Tonks and Snape didn't approve. Anyone remember the title, or anything else that would help me find it?

*** Could it be "In Blood Only" by E.M. Snape?

Snape is definitely not a nice guy in this one and his methods of taking care of Harry are kinda twisted.

  Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]

** "By Baker Street Station I Sat Down and Wept". One of the few "Snape is Harry's Dad" stories where they still hate each other after the revelation.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19456585/][Conditionally]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/598019/][Digging for the Bones]] both have Snape being a horrible paternal figure/sperm donor, though he becomes less completely horrible by the end.

  Harry finds out that he's Snape's son. It goes as badly as possible.

  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.
