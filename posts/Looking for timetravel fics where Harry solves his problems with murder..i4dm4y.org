Inspired-ish by /Returning to the Start/. I'm not necessarily looking for dark!Harry fics (I will take any recs, however!), but rather fics where if Harry had the chance to do it again, he would opt for the killing his enemies route rather than the flail around and hope these people don't kill me later route.

My standards are low, and I will take any recs you can think of. I'm not picky about pairings, or about most things, really.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** I know this is my own post, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19889305][Outages So Hideous]] by Lomonaaeren - linkao3(19889305) - is good, very similar, if without the time travel bit.

  Harry knows that everyone would be disappointed in him. Hell, he's disappointed in himself. But he just doesn't see any other way to change the rotten structure of wizarding society.

** Linkffn(Faery Heroes by Silently Watches) is a time+dimension travel story with Harry/Hermione/Luna as the pairing. They pick the Death Eaters off family by family during their fifth year, eventually raiding Azkaban and killing all imprisoned Death Eaters before Voldemort can free them. They eventually attack Voldemort in Malfoy manor as well A nice ruthless time traveler fic.

Linkffn(Potters Against the World) is another where Harry, his twin sister and Gabrielle (aged up) travel back in time to the Second Task of the Triwizard, to prevent Harry from being convicted of underage magic in 1995, amongst other things. They are specifically targeting Fudge and Umbridge, who Rose (Harry's twin) blames, though Malfoy, Snape, Skeeter all end up as casualties. Twincest warning though.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).
