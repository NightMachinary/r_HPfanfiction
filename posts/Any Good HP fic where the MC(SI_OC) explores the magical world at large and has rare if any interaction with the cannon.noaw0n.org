** Hmm, that is a difficult request.. moving away from canon would require Authors to bring out their own worldbuilding and characters. Authors who are capable/interested in doing that do not tend to write SI fics. Plus the HP SI scene is a bit weak relative to other fandoms. linkffn(No Gryffindor) for example is a demonstration piece which avoids the problem by summarizing it.

OC fics on the other hand:

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1211079][Alexandra Quick]] series is probably the most extensive in terms of non-canon exploration.

If you want to stay in Britain, there are several next-generation series which are technically filled with OC's. Linkffn(Ignite by Slide) and sequels is a good one. The Albus Potter Series (/both/ of them) are also worth a try.

  COMPLETE. I wasn't the Lavender that could have been ... I was no Gryffindor. (A realistic attempt at an SI fic, attempting zero Mary-Sue-ishness).

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

** linkffn(13497859) and it's sequel - Maybe this? It takes place alongside canon but he doesn't interact with the original storyline much and also explores magic

** It's incredibly OOC, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) is fantastic and doesn't particularly care about cannon, it also has a sequel, Heartlands of time, which is a bit... abrupt, but still a pretty good fic.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
