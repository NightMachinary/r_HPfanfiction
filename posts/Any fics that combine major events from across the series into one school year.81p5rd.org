  There was no way Lily Potter would let her son anywhere near her sister, so she told Dumbledore about her cousin in America. After Halloween 1981, the Fentons gain another son. Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter or Danny Phantom and related media.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** huge self-promotion, but my fic 'draw the curtain back for Venus' ( linkao3(draw the curtain back for Venus by aceisgay) ) is ongoing, but has the Sirius Drama, the Basilisk, and Dumbledore dying + the nonsense that follows all in 2nd year, although for very different reasons.

  -- the station is on fire, and the glass of the arches is glowing and melting, and something was hidden here but it is burning up now, it is burning to death in the fire and screaming-- -- something else is dying here, something is dead, something black and silver is visible through the space where the glass used to be, another spirit just like him-- -- we should have burned it while we had the chance, it says, I should have fought harder, my job isn't done, and Harry feels his magic red-hot, and calls it forth, and says is it ever done, and there's a great deal of noise, and there's a great deal of silence. Contains: debilitating injuries, characters named after Greek myth, plotting, scheming, conspiracy, deeply inaccurate depictions of custody law, unnecessary poetry, class politics, misery, mood whiplash, and the author's piss-poor attempt to apply logic and and the laws of physics to the Wizarding World.
