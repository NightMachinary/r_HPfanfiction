Any fics where everyone has magic and hogwarts is a super exclusive(?) school. Anything like that would be great!


** I know it's not really what you're looking for, but the best I can give you is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6822698/1/Magic-as-opposed-to-Magic]]).

Atleast here they're involved slightly in a world with no nonmagicals.

  Harry Potter was lost, but now is found. The Arch-Mage isn't happy. Harry isn't happy. And they're just the first two people who are going to find The Boy Who Lived's destiny one immense headache... Completed. It's my "Winnie the Pooh" to my A.A. Milne. (That's NOT a complementary comparison, by the way.)

*** If there's no muggles or muggleborns, then there's no halfbloods. Which means everyone's pureblood. Unless the no muggle/born thing is fairly recent or something.
