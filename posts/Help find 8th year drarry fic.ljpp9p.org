:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fic several years ago, Harry and Draco return for their 8th year and by spell gone wrong (or something like that) they are forced to be touching at all times or they suffer from pain. They move into some room together and the fic basically takes place mostly in this room. Obv they fall in love at some point.

I think there was some PTSD/ after war stuff were Draco was very depressed and sad. Harry gets worried because Draco isn't eating(?). I remember some shower scenes where the other waits behind the door but both get headaches because they are not touching.

The fic is most likely in ao3 or [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]

Please help me I made Reddit for this ..


** There's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20404573][Protective Bonds]] by Sadie Dragonfire, which sort of fits your request, but it's very old and is not an 8th year fic.

** Is it Light of Heaven? [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8357308?view_full_work=true]] It kinda matches the premise but it's been a while since I read it so I'm not sure
