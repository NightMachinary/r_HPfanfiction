Lemme just start off and say that I've been reading fanfics for over 4-5 years and this is the first time I've had this problem. I always finished a fic even if it took a turn I disliked or, in some rare cases, hated. But this fic is one that I neither disliked nor hated. In fact, I really enjoyed the fic's world and characters. Just the general premise itself is interesting to me. But as I was closing in the conclusion, around ~20 or so chapters, I just could not finish it. This fic I'm talking about Harry Potter and the Birth of a New Sun by fisico on ff.net . This is actually the second and last instalment to the series. My biggest issue was how roundabout and vague the story is. Everything was brought to the front in the end, but for the majority of the story, the topics were, for a lack of a better word, ethereal. They were not very cohesive to me until the very last second. And so, for the first time ever, I gave up on a fic. I wanted to put this out here just to get it off my chest because it's been eating at me for abandoning a story, and to see what all yall think.


** Ouch. Unlike you if I get to something I find really annoying I often drop a fic. Like repeated really bad grammar or just stilted and dead writing style. Or an awful trope. I have no patience lol

**** Do you mean where's Slytherin? My name and flair have a long winded explanation I promise! But I'm tired so I'll cut it short. Multiple sorting quizzes. I don't feel brave but it insist I am. In a scholar. Yeah lol.
