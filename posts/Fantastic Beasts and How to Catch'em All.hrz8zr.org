On his ride to Hogwarts, Harry was unsure what was waiting for him. It had just been a few days since he was told that he was a Pokemon Trainer and was given his Pikachu, a pokemon he was destined to have. Now, he was riding this magical train to the best Pokemon Traineer School in the whole UK, with only 2 pokemons to him. A shiny white Hoot-Hoot been the other one, given to him by Hagrid.

Ron seemed to be just as scared in the seat in front of him, as he tried to wake up his Rattata. But Harry didn't know what other pokemon he had borrowed from his family, a long line of pokemon training family. As if that was not enough, a girl named Hermione came minutes later, looking for some boy's Poliwag. She seemed pretty knowledgeable about the whole world of Pokemon as she strode about next to her Bidoof.

Harry was hoping he could do well, when the compartment door opened and the blond boy from Diagon Alley appeared. He didn't had any pokemon around, but the two bodyguards at his side where showing a a purple snake and what seemed to be like a floating ball of gas.

---

Harry couldn't stand Professor Lockhart, or his Hypno for that matter. The school was a mess, and if Professor Sprout's Oddishes didn't worked, he didn't know what was going to happen to the Petrified students. There was also the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, which was something to be afraid of by the reaction all the Ghost Pokemon in Hogwarts. Hopefully everything could turn alright.

---

Harry panicked as he saw the cloud of Mismagius approaching his godfather... not even his faithful Mightyena would be able to save him. That's when Harry remembered, his new pokemon, the one his father had favored. He let Stantler out, the pokemon strode to them with Hypnosis beams... miraculously scaring all the Mismagius away...

---

Harry felt so small as the last task was about to start.... He didn't want to say it in front of PIkachu, but he felt at a clear disadvantage. Krum's Garchomp and Fleur's Milotic seemed so experienced, and even Cedric and Dragonite seemed like a more fearsome duo and Harry felt.

He tried to focus... Hermione's Buizel was clapping in the stands and Ron's newly evolved Flareon seemed excited as well. The twins were there too, with their Minum and Pusle. Harry turned to his side.

"Are you ready, Pikachu?" asked Harry.

"Pika..."

---

It was a titanic battle. Harry didn't know how he could ever be in their level. As the halls of the Ministry thundered with the attacks of Dumbledore's Moltres and Voldemort's black Rayquaza... Harry knew he was probably seeing the greatest battle of all. Still, his mind couldn't be put away the fresh memories... Bellatrix's Banette sneaking on his godfather, putting him out of combat...

---

It was as if none of it had ever happened. All that mattered to Harry was the wind on his face as he rode his Stantler, trying to beat Ginny and her Rapidash to the Battle pitch. Nothing could go wrong now.

---

"It doesn't matter Tom! Can't you see? Your Rayquaza has received damage all night and you have not cared about it. No Potion, no nothing. It's also paralyzed." Harry said as he circled his rival in the Great Hall. "Are you aware that I have a Z-Move ready on my Pikachu? Can you take it?"


** I dropped the ball here at missing a reference to the giant Tentacruel in the Lake

** Would it be in bad taste for Wormtail to have a cat Pokémon who gives him shit all the time?

I soooo want that.

** "Oh no, Severus," said Voldemort, "I won't have you attacking twice in a row. This is a turn-based duel. We'll wait for our turn."

** So I'm not a pro-pokemon battler but I imagine the professors having both a specialty in Pokemon types as well as subject they teach:

1. McGonagall would teach about general concepts. Types and attacks. Strategies. Evolution. I see her having a Balanced team. Water-Fire-Electric.

2. Snape would teach about potions(ha), and other items and enhancers that can be used in Pokemon. How to use them and balance a battle with them. How to prepare your own potion. He'll be a Dark/Poison expert.

3. Flitwick is a master duelist. He would be all about combos and assembling a team. About choosing Pokemon that work towards a same strategy. About tournaments and gyms. He would use fairy and maybe dragon.

4. Sprout would be about healing Pokemon and a major bug/plant expert.

5. Vector would be all about EVs IVs and stats Maximizing. She would use psychic of course.

6. Hagrid would use normals and be an expert about the catching part of the deal... About tracking and finding them.

7. Binns would use ghosts for sure.

** In quidditch everyone flies on school pidgeottos as standard, except harry who is gifted a rare Pidgeot in his first year. The aim is simple for Harry - catch the golden baby zapdos at all costs while dodging the beaters Golems. Harry isn't too sure about chasing.. it seems a bit weird, all they do is play catch with a great ball? Harry shrugs, not his idea of fun.

His trusty Pidgeot unfortunately flies into the Whomping Sudowoodo in his third year, leaving harry without his HM Fly until a suspicious pokeball arrives containing a rare Ho-oh!

Harry eventually gets his legendary Pokémon back from the professor's in time to catch the baby zapdos and win the cup for his house, Pyroar.

Just how on earth was harry meant to get past the giant shiny charizard in his first task? Thankfully his Ho-oh released herself from his pokeball on his belt and took the initiative, leading the charizard on a chase around the grounds, allowing harry to secure the Exeggcute.

** To the Pokemon experts out there: what is more likely, that Pikachu could beat a Rayquaza or that Stantler could outrace Rapidash?
