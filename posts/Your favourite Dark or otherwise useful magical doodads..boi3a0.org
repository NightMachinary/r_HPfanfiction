Looking for ideas for my story. Doesn't have to be from Harry Potter, but ideally something that fits within Harry Potter lore well.


** I mean, the Monkey's Paw is obviously an all time classic and I think it would fit reasonably well in the HP canon. Wouldn't be surprised if that thing was hanging around Borgin & Burkes

** Magical artefacts are always super fun, but they don't really seem to be a thing in the HP universe. The Hallows are pretty much the only things (that I can think of off the top of my head) that are important in universe because of their magical properties; everything else is either just something with historical significance and no particular magical power (how Voldemort chose most of his horcruxes), or just normal enchanted objects, like, say the Weasleys' car, or a (non-Deathly Hallow) invisibility cloak.
