Does anyone know some good fics that fit this criteria? I just finished rereading HP3 and I'm in love with Moony now.

** Search up the Girl Who Wasn't Sorted - it was one of my favourites, beautifully written! It's on Quotev I'm pretty sure. The Shadows Between Us is pretty good, though not too focused on the romance aspect. Philophobia on Quotev, and another story by the same name on Wattpad are also really great!

*** Gotta say that one wasn't one of my favourites. The main character was a bit “quirky”, very similar to a lot of stuff you'd find on the not like other girls subreddit. It kind of ruined my experience with the story, as well with the other characters being a bit OOC, but I can understand the appeal.
