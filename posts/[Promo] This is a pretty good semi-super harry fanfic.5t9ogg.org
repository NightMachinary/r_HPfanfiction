I can't tell you a lot without spoiling it for you. But it was pretty good. It had a little bit of bashing. Not that much romance. Harry was pretty powerful but he had to train for ages. Harry was like a cheeky marauder type person in this one. Like he made a group and they pranked the school. The premise was really good but I cant tell you that without ruining the plot. Harry was pretty badass too. It's AU but not and diverges pretty heavily from canon. I'm new at this promoting stuff so go easy on me if I did something wrong. lol forgot the link ill post it here too linkffn(Harry Potter and The Other Path) original link [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=224105]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry's life up to his eleventh birthday was painful and harsh. Dumped in an abusive home by dead parents, running away from that home to take his life into his own hands and then surviving by his wits and his feet. Then a letter came, and opened a whole new world... An AU fiction with hopefully enough action and comedy to entertain.

** This is one of my favorites partly just because it was so original. Love the Harry characterization, love the hints you get as you try to solve the mystery.

*** Can I get a better summary? Compared to the one on the site I mean, it's basically just saying, 'trope, trope, trope, he gets a letter when he's 11 and things change'.

People keep talking this up ad I'm interested but would like to get some more info before I invest a large amount of time in it.

Thanks!!

**** I just read the first six chapters. Indy!Harry who starts the story homeless but the first thing he wants to do at Hogwarts is be the new prank king. Oh, and he */can't ride a broom/* at the first riding lesson. So Harry in name only. I'm struggling to see the appeal, obviously.

**** It's hard to describe without giving too much away. The characterization for Harry is totally different from canon. He is a bit Marauder-y, but also avoids some of the worst indy Harry tropes.

He runs away from the Dursleys. After first year, of course Dumbledore insists that he go back. In this case he doesn't yell and scream at Dumbledore, or announce all the terrors of his childhood to the great hall. He goes along with it and runs away again at the first opportunity.

** Just read the first two books. Many misspellings but grammar was fine. I enjoyed the plot originality, so thanks for the rec! Always on the hunt for new fics.
