  "A man's motives may vary, even for the best of acts. I cannot afford to be generous and trusting any longer, Mr. Constantine. The students entrusted to my care, and the parents of those students, /must/ be able to trust your character themselves. Or, barring that, they must at least know exactly what they are dealing with. My judgment has, of late, been questioned more than I would like." He nodded towards the Hat. "This has not."

***** linkffn(1980013) - but brace yourself for the massive disappointment of it being abandoned just as it's really getting going. Up to that point it's /brilliant/.
