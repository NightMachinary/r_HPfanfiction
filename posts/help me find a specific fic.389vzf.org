a long time ago, i read a hp fic that was set after the half blood prince, where draco had the locket horcrux around his neck and joined harry and the gang at the burrow. i think draco and harry were possibly romantically involved at some point...

could anyone help me find this fic or at least point me in the correct direction?

thanks!
