I don't see it as often, but usually when I do it's to explain either OP harry, or give a character a way out of a situation/escape, or give them a leg up/advantage. I have seen a few fics where it's just there because it's a part of every day life.

Myself, I'm not really religious, but I don't mind if writers decide to put it in their fic. However it does irk me when it's either the entire fic, or it gives a huge advantage, talks too much about it, or the entire way harry or someone wins the war, or some horrible situation is because of that religion/god. etc.

Whats your thoughts? Religion a do or a don't?

** To me, the most interesting angle to approach this is not to think about Christianity, witch-burning etc. (from that angle I think it's clear that wizards remain culturally Christian but unreligious in character).

Rather to me the more interesting element is to consider the religious implications of magic itself. Wizards know the soul exists and survives bodily death. They know that there is some form of afterlife. And they know that many rules of the universe are anthropocentric, such as it being a rule of magic that you cannot create food from nothing - "food", of course, being a concept that is defined relative to humanity. Another example is the impossibility of making gold without the philosopher's stone - gold's special status, again, being a quirk of human society/history, not a physical fact.

These facts of life would surely impact the way wizards view the world in a way that is much more fundamental than belonging to a social group ("Christians", "Muslims" etc). In real life, the vast majority of religious people compartmentalise their religion - they still fear death, even if they believe in an afterlife, and they don't give away all their belongings, even if this is what their religion tells them is correct. Presumably this is because they have doubts. But for wizards, regardless of whether they have formal religion or not, those doubts simply do not exist. They know, with all the certainty that I know if I jump, I will fall, that these things exist.

***** My take is, it's /possible/ to Transfigure gold (and rather easily too), /but/ the Untransfiguration charm that goes with it is also /really/ easy. If such manmade gold that can be produced in any quantities was allowed any market value, the Wizarding World's gold-based economy would collapse, so paying in Transfigured gold is considered forgery; Goblins (and the more business-savvy wizard merchants) will test any gold that comes in with the Untransfiguration spell, and, if the gold disappears, the witch or wizard will stand a very good chance of taking a vacation of a few weeks to Azkaban.

** I'm not a fan of religion in HP fanfiction, as all to often is seems like the author is trying to force there religious worldview on both the setting and the reader.

I think it could be interesting, but would take a /lot/ of worldbuilding. How many pre-Roman traditions survived, what influence did the Roman Cults have on roman wizarding traditions, how did wizards interact with the church before the witchhunts, and the repercussions of the SoS. Then there are contributing factors like the fact that wizards lived longer, were better traveled, and better educated than muggles at least until about a century ago.

That's not even including the problems inherent in magic being real. How many miracles can be debunked or replicated with magic, what articles of faith can be disproven with magic. Herpo the Foul, an Ancient Greek Dark Wizard, the first wizard known to successfully create a Horcrux proving that wizards have had proof that souls exist and are somewhat mutable for millennia.

***** My explanation to this dilemma is that the Creator is indeed almighty and powerful, he just doesn't consider humans all that important when trillions other experiments (some of them far more promising) are running.

We have only been dabbling in scientific research for a few hundred Terran years, an almost negligible time in geological history, and already deduced that billions of Earth-like planets exist in our galaxy. There are at least 2 trillion galaxies alone in our OBSERVABLE universe.

******* Well, I would say we don't have enough information about that yet.

Humans have only started to explore the Universe and made some good progress, but it's IMHO only the very beginning.

Only a few years ago most of us thought the Earth was flat and everything in the universe revolved around us - how arrogant, egomaniac, ignorant, and stupid we were!

On the other hand, our mind, our maths, our science, and our engineering give us the ability to actually understand this universe and its laws. We are the first specie (known so far) on this planet that has a fighting chance of long term survival and interplanetary expansion. I think we can be a little proud of that.

The more we discover, at least I marvel more about this universe. Whoever created it and lay down its laws deserves respect.

** In the books, religion isn't a big part of the Wizarding world. They do Christmas and Easter, but they don't seem to have a Christian connection at all. It could be thought that wizards celebrate these holidays more in the pagan tradition, but that's not shown, either. Are the Patils Sikh, Muslim or Hindu? Do they celebrate Diwali? Ramadan? Could there be a fic where they do? Of course. Seamus Finnegan is Irish. Is he Catholic as well? Harry is Teddy's godfather, but was Teddy christened? Doubtful.

I don't think I've read a fic where religion is mentioned at all, but I do kind of wonder what role it might play.

To be fair, religion isn't a major part of British society in any event. It's not something that people really discuss and those who do believe don't advertise it (and often themselves do not actually attend church). As an example, I found out recently that a friend I have known for 3 years is a Roman Catholic.

The depiction of Christianity within Hogwarts more or less lines up with the presence of Christianity in the life of the average Brit - public holidays, a few traditions, but no real religious significance to any of them other than a historical association.

*** Luna Lovegood is a Christian in "Learning to Love Good" by Lia Kada. This one has some mixed reviews, but the religious aspects are actually handled fairly well.

"Goldstein" by Laazov is terrific: probably the most theologically sophisticated /HP/ fic I've ever read. As the title implies, it focuses on Anthony Goldstein and his experience at Hogwarts as he struggles to connect the fact that he's a wizard with the tenets of Judaism. Be forewarned, though: this isn't the kind of fic that's going to hold your hand and explain all the different background religious concepts. It may be helpful to get some context from [[http://axforthefrozensea.tumblr.com/post/80134273913/on-anthony-goldstein-judaism-in-the-potterverse][this essay]] first.

  "Merry Christmas, everyone!" called mum, bustling into the room with her hair still in curlers. When she looked at Ron, her eyes filled with tears, and she hurried over to the tree and started fussing with the presents. Mum had been crying a lot, Ron noticed. He turned his own damp eyes away. He had been too, though he wouldn't admit it.

  "Before we start," dad said, standing next to the tree gazing around at everyone. "I want us to all take a moment." He cleared his throat and looked a little embarrassed. "I'm not normally a religious person, as you all know, but today, after everything that's happened, I think we should take a moment to say thanks, and meditate on the fact that we're all here. Healthy and whole, and how easily it could be otherwise."

  Mum sniffed a bit, wrapping her arms around her husband and bowing her head. Every one else did the same, hugging the family member next to them. Fred and George even sat on either side of Percy and embraced their older brother. Percy for his part put an arm around Fred and George, looking solemn. Ron hugged Ginny and Bill, Charlie put his arm around Bill and reached out to hug his father, and Ginny clung to Ron. The silence lasted a long time, but it was neither awkward nor unpleasant. The entire Weasley clan took delight in the closeness of family and their love for one another.

  "I think we should pray for Neville and Dean and Seamus," Ron blurted. He looked around earnestly, trying to fight back the tremble in his voice, but he noticed that his hands were shaking slightly. He wondered if he'd ever be able to really play quidditch now. The healers said the cursed nerve damage was permanent."

  "Why don't you do it, Ron," dad said quietly, looking at his youngest son with pride.

  Ron bowed his head. "Dear God, or magic, or whoever is listening. Thanks that I'm OK, and that my family is here. Thanks that Neville is OK too. Wherever Dean and Seamus are, let them know that we were mates, and I wish I could have saved them and that I tried. Keep us all safe, and don't let nothin' bad happen again, OK? Thanks."

Very odd, but non-denominational. Definitely religious, but not overly so. It's still very unexpected coming from Ron, who has "the emotional range of a teaspoon" and all.

  *"For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever and ever, amen,"* Charlie said quietly. The rest of the family looked at him in shock. He shrugged. "Well, I guess I found more than dragons in Romania. They're a bit keener on church there than we are here. Not going to make a big deal about it, but I'll be praying for all of us a bit harder now."
#+end_quote

See, that's my problem, right there. From meditation, to general sort-of-but-not-really prayer, to straight out in-your-face promotion of Christianity. It's proselytisation. Way to go Charlie, embracing the faith that persecuted, tortured, and murdered your ancestors for centuries. How very [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome][Stockholm syndrome]] of you. Why don't you burn a witch while you're at it.

I wonder, is the author trying to tell us something here? I have the feeling that someone is trying to remind us that there's a "Christ" in the word "Christmas". I've seen plenty of Americanisms, and this fic has it's fair share of them, but this is the most egregious. Americans might not react to it, but it looks very out-of-character for a born and raised European.

There's more. It's unexpected, it's embarrassingly blatant, and it's wildly out of character for everyone involved. /It's no longer Harry Potter/.

**** That's an interesting example and thanks for sharing it. Now question--is there any other mention of religion or worship preceding this event or is it all walloped on at once? If this is the first mention of it, then that's pretty surprising and I can see where it would be off-putting for a reader.

Dumbledore's funeral doesn't make any mention of religion or prayers and neither did Bill and Fleur's wedding. Both are presided over by wizards. By these illustrations, JKR clearly shows that wizards aren't religious (and I think she's said as much in interviews). I think maybe the Dursleys go to church? Maybe at Christmas? And of course leave Harry behind. I would tend to agree that a religious wizard would be a bit out of place, especially in the UK where, despite the figurehead of the government being the head of the church, there's a pretty strict separation of church and state.

For myself, I tend to lean toward a more pagan approach to things. To use California Dreamin' as an example, Harry and Ginny perform a handfasting presided over by Mr Weasley and they receive little pagan tokens as gifts from the local witches and wizards. Still trying to figure out that "godfather" bit, though. In the church, the godparents are responsible for the religious education of the child, but it's also popularly used as "you will take care of my kid if I die", which seems to be the case with Harry and Teddy.

**** *Stockholm syndrome*

Stockholm syndrome is a condition that causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity. These feelings, resulting from a bond formed between captor and captives during intimate time spent together, are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims. Generally speaking, Stockholm syndrome consists of "strong emotional ties that develop between two persons where one person intermittently harasses, beats, threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other." The FBI's Hostage Barricade Database System shows that roughly eight percent of victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.

It was formally named in 1973 when four hostages were taken during a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden.

To a lot of religious people, including at least some Christians, they're very similar. Prayer is very much /not/ just "saying words to God". That can be the outward manifestation of it, and words out loud are used to draw peoples' attention to particular concepts that they should think about.

The idea that Christian witch hunts happened in the HP universe for no reason bothers me. Why is there never any discussion that maybe a Dark Lord DID arise and tried to take over prior to the creation of the Statue? Maybe the Spaniards were so fearful of witches because one had been using magic to enslave and subdue them and they were terrified it could happen again. People have this idea that witches and wizards were always the victims, but it seems to me that if anyone actually was using magic to hurt or enslave muggles (and seeing as how two dark Wizards in Europe during the 20th century wanted to do just that it doesn't seem unreasonable that over the course of hundreds of years there was more than one incident where muggles were abused enmass) then the reaction that they needed to burn witches would be more than a little justified.

It's the mutant problem in the Marvel universe all over. Sure, most mutants just want to be left alone, but when super powered people keep killing thousands and trying to take over the world, people hating them and wanting to destroy them is sort of a reasonable reaction.

Eight words. "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live".

A more important couple of reasons for the authorities to persecute them would be that people who don't go to the state-approved church are hard to control, because the church is where propaganda was preached, and that it's useful to have a minority that you can point at and blame when bad things happen.

And I wasn't talking about magical power competing with spiritual power but magical power competing with secular power, which merely used the spiritual as a tool. The Church of England was set up quite deliberately to bolster the power of the secular authorities, and the secular authorities /frequently/ didn't just tell priests what to preach about, they sent them sermons that they had to preach. Similarly the Catholic church was set up partly in ways that would maintain the church's secular power - bishops and abbots had vast lands, large incomes, and the ear of kings; the Pope was effectively king of a large part of Italy. Objection to that secular power dressed up as religion is in fact what sparked the Reformation, and so literally sparked many /many/ burnings of filthy heretics who disagreed about who should be in power. Few in power actually cared what religious beliefs people had, provided that they went through the motions, didn't cause a fuss, and supported the secular power.

Yer village witch, unfortunately, undermines the secular power by performing "unlicensed miracles", so burns as an enemy of the state.

** It's worth mentioning that the Hufflepuff ghost, the Fat Friar, was /actually/ a friar. For those that don't know, a friar was essentially a Christian (primarily Catholic) missionary who was intended to live a humble life, if not outright poverty. They'd travel, live on charity, and preach. They weren't allowed to take work or own property. That's why the joke is that he's a fat friar - you didn't get fat in his time by being a beggar, even if you were backed by the Church.

Of course, Rowling didn't set the standard too high for religion in the series. The Friar was born sometime in the 900s, long before any of the mendicant orders formed, even the ones nobody cared about. It'd be another 300 years before you had friars. I suppose you could say that his nickname isn't accurate and he wasn't a friar, but Pottermore does directly state that he joined a mendicant order after he finished his education.

Supposedly, he's also salty that he wasn't made a cardinal, even though the Church executed him for witchcraft.

Point is, as long as you take the 15 minutes to double-check your religious content, at least where it aligns with historical accuracy, you could probably do better than Rowling did.

  Even if that wasn't a stretch on its own, mendicant orders arose out of changes in society across Europe, mainly increased urbanization. Erasing all evidence of the orders is insane in itself, particularly because this is the Roman Catholic Church we're talking about, but you'd also have to somehow downplay 300 years of urbanization in order to not have an odd gap in Christian activity during that time period.

  You're going to need a lot more to convince me that the civilization which produced men like Arthur also could completely rewrite history without anyone catching on.

First, orders of Friars have existed in documentation since the 1100's. There is also an Order called the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crutched_Friars][Crutched Friars]] that purports to have been founded in the 1st century and revived in the 4th. Obviously we can't rely on Wikipedia for authenticity of research, but the great thing about a fictional history with a known element of being revisionist is that any hint of evidence can be leveraged as a mis-interpreted truth rather than an outright fabrication.

As for Arthur Weasley's competence as a reflection of the effectiveness of the worldwide Ministries who implemented and enforce the Statute of Secrecy, I think you've insulted all involved. Arthur is wiser than he acts, the Ministries are more competent than their current leadership and the Statute has been ably sustained for centuries.

The Fratres Cruciferi (cross-bearing brethren) are a Roman Catholic religious order. There were four main independent branches of Fratres Cruciferi: an Italian order, a Portuguese order, a Belgian order, and a Bohemian order. They were also known as Crutched Friars, Crossed Friars, Crouched Friars or Croziers because of the staff they carried with them surmounted by a crucifix.

Humans tend to just jump to the next best "unexplainable" thing once their god turns out to be just nature doing it's thing).

I ended up having the magical society versions of the monotheistic religions as well as the norse and celtic pantheons, as I would imagine they'd be in modern times. It gave me a bit more grip and conflict between people and the whole Wizengamot.

Now of course, religion as a plot element has to be done well like anything else, but if you do include it in your story, even if it is well done, you are going to catch some flack.

The church was created by a venal, secular man who wanted a divorce. This means that from its very inception, the church was designed not to serve the needs of the people, but to act as a weapon and tool of kings and princes. When people saw how the church was a white washed tomb that looked nice on the outside but was full of death and corruption on the inside, they decided that there was no point in acting like the church had some deep spiritual meaning or had any reason to be a part of their lives.

Religion is supposed to provide for the needs of people by providing a moral center and an explanation to the questions of life that rational thought (IE scientific reasoning) cannot provide. When the Church of England fundamentally failed in this mission because it was far more concerned about answering political questions of how and by what means, the people found new moral centers and did as their leaders: they called on the church only to provide political power and justifications.

In America we expect our leaders to attend church because that is still our (supposed) moral center. By being religious, the politicians are demonstrating that they share the same moral grounding and views as we do. This means that we can trust them to make moral decisions being in government requires. This isn't something people usually are cognizant of, but it's at the root of it. Religion HAS to be demanding because morality is demanding. If the religion doesn't demand something of you, it means that it cannot provide something truly meaningful for you.

Of course that gets into the whole issue of how often politicians everywhere use religion and religious trappings to grab power without actually believing the underlying axioms, but this post is long enough already. Suffice to say that because religion in America is separated from the state, it is more real, and therefore has the ability to make real demands and command real respect. People who want to turn America into a theocracy do not realize that ultimately they will undermine their own goal by killing their own religious structure and crippling it forever.

******* Well, firstly, I should say your history is wrong. It was Elizabeth I who founded the modern-day, protestant Church of England via the Elizabethan Religious Settlement. Henry VIII's church separated from Rome but was still fundamentally Roman Catholic in character - Henry was not a protestant. Although his actions set the ball rolling, in no way does the doctrine of the Church of England reflect Henry VIII's religious beliefs or outlook.

In any case, returning to the present, I think you simply do not understand the religious character of the British people. They are not yearning for some religious provision which they currently lack - they are completely disinterested in religion. This is something which is completely divorced from belief in God, which splits roughly 50% atheist 50% theist (according to the [[http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/latest-report/british-social-attitudes-28/religion.aspx][British Social Attitudes survey]]).

But here's the rub: even among those who do believe, most do not want religion to be an active part of their lives. 56% of those who consider themselves religious never attend a single religious service or ceremony, and just 14% of people who consider themselves religious attend any kind of service on a weekly basis. British people, whether they believe in God or not, do not want religion to actually occupy a significant part of their life.

All this is of course a modern trend. There's no basis to suggest that it has its roots in the nature of the Church of England as a state religion, since the British people remained highly religious for hundreds of years with that system in place. And if they merely rejected the Church of England, there are plenty of other churches to attend, or other religions to convert to. But it's not the Church of England that the people reject, it's all formal religion. The only religion which the people still subscribe to is that of vague spiritual sentiment.

In short, you have cause and effect the wrong way round with the Church of England. For many years the CoE /was/ morally demanding, evangelist, etc. Hell, half of the justification for the British Empire was religious in nature - the need to bring civilising Christianity to the world - and the British people under the Church of England were active in missionary work throughout this period, as well as moral crusades such as stamping out slavery around the world.

It was the British people who changed first, and the Church of England has had to change to catch up. The current stance of the Church of England is an attempt to appeal to the views of the people, not the cause of those views.

******** The vast majority of the Swiss treat religion like folklore for some holidays as well, no matter if they are nominally catholic or protestant - and neither Church was founded as a tool for princes.

(From a moral point of view, the central tenet of the Christian Faith, that Jesus died for human sins and that only by accepting him as your saviour will your soul go to Heaven in the afterlife, /no matter what good you did in your life/, simply doesn't hold up well these days.)

*********** Right. I think you proved my point for me. In Catholicism it's a both/and deal; you need to have both faith and works. So you can't say, "no matter what good you did in your life," as that good is part of the equation. In the Catholic view, you need to both have faith and live out that faith by doing good things.

However, the protestant traditions that profess the /Sola Fide/ tenet maintain that your works, ie, the things you actually do in life, don't matter at all. This was all one of the big points of contestation in the protestant reformation.

As for mortal sin, yeah, you go to hell /if you die in a culpable state of mortal sin,/ but mortal sin itself is easily and simply absolved in the sacrament of confession.

*** Well, in my story "Patron", the wizards "went back to our pagan roots" after splitting off from the muggles in 1692 and started worshipping pagan gods again. But that was mostly done to sneer at the witch-hunting Christians, and after 1000 years of Christianity, they didn't so much go back to their ancient faith, but went "back" to what people in the 18th century /thought/ was that faith. So, they have pagan rituals and holidays, but only a few - "The Faithful", a splinter group - actually do believe in them. The mainstream wizards just go through the motions. With magic being real, what many would consider a miracle can be explained as (accidental) magic anyway.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** I too am not religious. I used to be, and I wish I still was because the sense of belonging and community can be wonderful, but I just don't believe any more. I'm one of those irreligious types who occasionally goes to church anyway for the art. I went to a Latin mass in the local Catholic cathedral last weekend because they had Palestrina on the menu :-) Anyway ...

The two stories that really stand out for me in this regard both have Snape as a religious character. I can't remember what either of them are called, unfortunately. One has him as a Christian, with some kind of Christian art in his private quarters which Harry (or was it Hermione?) sees and Snape explains. His faith is fairly important to his actions in the story. In the other Auror Harry goes to arrest Snape, who is a Moslem because (I paraphrase) Allah is merciful, but he doesn't think he deserves Christ's forgiveness. The story's author puts it much better than me. I especially enjoyed the latter story, where the religions and theological differences were at the core of the story but also well explained (without breaking the fourth wall) and without preaching.

Others have had passing mentions of religious people (there's one where Sirius is taken in and cared for by a priest immediately after his escape from Azkaban, for example) but none of them that I've seen have been the focus of the story. And of course there are the mentions of Thor/Zeus/Christ/whatever as having been wizards who got a bit up themselves, but again I can only remember them being mentioned in passing. Those make me sigh at the author for being too obvious and having poor taste but they don't really detract from the stories.

It's a topic I'm interested in, and I very much like when it's done well. Usually it's not done at all, which is fine too. The only instances I can remember where it's done badly are first one (again I forget the name) where Hermione's parents are weirdo evangelicals who take "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" a bit more seriously than normal Christians do. While they are persuaded to let her go to Hogwarts and they aren't horribly abusive (they don't actually murder her) she is treated poorly and I vaguely remember an attempt at exorcism. The second of course is the gloriously awful linkffn(Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles).
