:END:
I can't find this book I don't know where it went. I looked all through my history and I still can't find it. It's a time travel AU

So I'm kind of remembering the summary but I can't remember the title or anything.

All I remember is that it was a time travel fanfiction featuring Harry Potter in Harry Potter is point of view and it was during the summer of 5th year I think. Sirius isn't dead and the Order is staying at griamore palace. And I think Harry absorbed Voldemort and his memories in the future / past from where he traveled from.

One scene that stayed in my mind, was when Molly went upstairs to get a boggart out from under an old desk and Sirius and Harry heard her scream so they went to check on her cuz they knew she was facing her fear. The boggart didn't know what Harry spear was cuz Harry's not really experiencing fear anymore. It turned into many things from dementors with voldemort's face two draco's dead body to it just being a voice of the night his parents died and then the boggart exploded. And Harry said "guess that solves are boggart problem".

Everyone else was horrified and the people in the room was Remus, Sirius, Molly, and Moody that's all I can remember.

Please help me find it, I've been losing my mind trying to find this fanfic.
