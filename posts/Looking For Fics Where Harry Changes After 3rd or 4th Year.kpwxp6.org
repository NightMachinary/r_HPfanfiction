Harry's encounters with the Basilisk Venom, Phoenix Tears and a spike from the Hungarian Horntail in the First Task lead to him changing in ways that no-one could have predicted.

A Harry is asked to become a Bulgarian Auror story.

** While I can't pinpoint a specific story, filtering by H/Hr pairing generally shows a lot of stories where Harry finally takes magic seriously. A lot of it is centered around Year 3/4 as well.

** Yes, but for the life of me I can't recall exactly which fic it was. I know it was a Harry + Daphne fic, but I've read about 40 of them now and they start to blur together.

This is going to bug me all day now.

** Malfoy Flavor, I suppose?\\
Not exactly like that, but after fifth year he definitely...changes. In more ways than one, I'd say.\\
