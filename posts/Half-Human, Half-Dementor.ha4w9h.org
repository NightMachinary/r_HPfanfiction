Just a strange idea I had, I would think that if they went to hogwarts they would be friends with werewolf students or anyone else who isn't fully human.

Don't know if this would actually be worth making but I've always felt like dementors were the most interesting hp creature and haven't been fully explored.

** linkffn(11031294)

This is one of mine where Harry becomes half demented and wants to devour everyone's daemons (soul).

Yes, he literally doesn't have a heart and is half decayed/rotting etc.
