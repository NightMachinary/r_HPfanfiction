** linkffn(The Aurors by FloreatCastellum) is my favorite story this year. It is the canon compliant Auror!Harry story I'd wanted basically all my life. The author also wrote /Aunt Marge's Even Bigger Mistake/, a hilarious oneshot that is really a must-read for anybody. linkffn(11982933)

Astolat has written some really good stories this year, linkao3(House Proud) chief among them. I'd even recommend her stories to those people who don't normally read slash, the writing is really good.

linkffn(Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much by Casscade) is a touching little story about Dudley becoming acquainted with the magical world after his daughter turns out to be a witch. There are frequent mistakes with spelling and punctuation though, the author needs a beta ASAP.

...and that seems to be all. Not too many good fics published this year, sadly.

** *Dividend and Entwined*, linkffn(11910994), is my top choice for fics published this year that's still WIP. It's a significant improvement over [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5's]] previous work *Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, which also features the theme of Muggleborn resistance/uprising. The plot, characterizations, writing quality, and realism are much much better. I especially like the fact there are good and evil people on both sides of the conflict.

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), is my overall top pick for fics published this year. It's already completed, and I've recommended it many times.

*Gothic*, linkffn(11922116), is pretty good, but comes with a typical Brennus ending. A sequel is all but certain at this time.

*The Opposing Movement*, linkffn(12005632), is being written by fellow redditor [[/u/BigFatNo]]. The story starts off slowly, but is getting better and better.

*Escape*, linkffn(11916243), is a story about Harry/Hermione running away from a marriage law in year 6. I've only caught up to chapter 18, and I like the premise. A few characters (Snape) are a little OOC though.

****** The last chapter was disgusting. I should have known Brennus couldn't go an entire story without completely flanderizing some or the other character. He's physically and mentally incapable of it. Of course Draco would turn out to be an evilly evil person who would beat muggles to death in his torture room and use the imperius to rape them. Could you possibly create a more ridiculous caricature than this?

The story was actually going fairly well for once. But Brennus gonna Brennus.

*** Just read /The Sum of Their Parts/ based on your recommended. I can definitely second it. Only real frustration is that it ends kind of suddenly and with an epilogue so it probably won't get a sequel.

Basically it jumps from giving resolution to a small part of the conflict of the story to a epilogue 8 years later where lots has happened.

I'm trying to be intentionally vague to avoid spoilers but still.

There's an authors note, and I honestly don't remember which of the fics it was in that talked about this. What he's doing with this series is exploring how a Slytherin!Harry would react to all the things that happened to canon-Harry, instead of creating a divergent AU ala What You Leave Behind, The One He Feared, and so on and so forth. And this is the only way for him to do that, without resorting to a collection of one-shots based on the idea like linkffn(What Would Slytherin Harry Do?).

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

*** I enjoy reading The Pureblood Pretense, but I find myself disagreeing or outright hating the authors additions to canon. The whole cores thing is a good example. But it's the little things like in the second book when a bunch of pureblood children sit down to talk genetics or sirius living in grimmauld place

Rigel is also a super duper genius which kind of dehumanizes the character somewhat for me.

**** The cores isn't great, but I would say that it's at least done better than many other stories with cores. It at least serves a purpose.

***** True. It's probably a more glaring issue because the rest of the work is so good. It's odd to have these sudden drops into tired tropes.

  Harriet Potter is back for a fourth year of quietly masquerading as her pureblooded cousin in order to pursue her dream. There are those in the Wizarding World who refuse to see her fade into the background, however, and when the forces she's been ignoring conspire to bring her to the fore, it will take everything she has to see her artifice through. Alanna the Lioness take on HP4.

Dumbledore has offered to take Harry as an apprentice, with the goal of teaching Harry sorcery - the manipulation of magic in its purest form. Harry is happy to learn, but Dumbledore seems to have another agenda...

** The very rare Witcher crossover linkffn(The Lesser Kindness) by a fellow redditor [[/u/zeitgeist84]]. A very well written crossover dealing with Potter and crew being born in the Witcher setting. It also mirrors how the books are written: several short stories detailing the adventures of the MC.

  It goes without saying that a Witcher's life is one of thankless peril. Mutations, vagrancy, a profession of murder, and all they get for it are insults and a few pieces of gold to tide them over to the next contract. Yes, life is bad enough for one witcher, but two, in one small village? In that case, peril doesn't quite do it justice.

** I primarily read slash, so these are all slash fics.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4707098][If the Sun Goes Black]] and the prequel [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6264406/chapters/14353156][There Is Always the Moon]] were written this year and are great. There is Always the Moon is the better of the two and is much longer. I would give a quick summary here, but there are some cool twists and reveals and I don't want to give anything away. Read them in the order of If the Sun Goes Black first because otherwise the plot twists are nowhere near as good.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5625616/chapters/12957970][Stop and Stare]] - Saras_Girl's 2015 advent fic was really good. In this Draco runs an animal sanctuary at the manor and Harry owns a company designing/building magical tents and sheds and stuff. This is a really unusual love story where they both know they are falling in love but do not address it hardly at all until the end - I really loved that. The animals (a Saras_Girl signature) were all beautifully written and Harry and Draco were so richly characterized I felt like I knew them. Loved loved loved this as always. Can't wait for her next fic! linkao3(5625616)

  Harry's life is full of care, he has no time to stop or stare; he has no time for anyone's shit, until his friends aren't having it. A story about the unravelly things. 2015 advent fic.
