  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...

  What if Snape had received some better guidance when he was young from people who cared enough to notice what he was going through and looked deeper than the surface? What if there had been Slytherins who weren't aspiring Death Eaters? Would their assistance be enough to help a few young and hot tempered teens? (Slow burn romance)

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

** linkffn(7937889) is the best fic I've read from Snape's POV. Basically canon, starting from Snape's childhood, until his death at the end of DH.

*** I dislike post-5th year (as in 1976, not 1996) Severus&Lily interactions -- they're far more cordial than I got the impression that they'd be in canon (where I imagine they'd only talk when absolutely necessary -- pure academics, etc), and the overly convulted way the fic sometimes try to explain his behaviour during the 1990s, particularly towards Harry (for example the 1st Potions lesson).

Besides those minor issues, I agree that it's an excellent fic. I especially liked how the fic didn't just brush over the 1981-1991 period but tried to do some original plots during the downtime, and the fic letting pre-Hogwarts play a significant role. I've seen some fics brush over this time, especially fics giving Severus-Lily interaction a major focus, but nothing else of his upbringing -- his family life, and so on, besides this fic.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

**** You're in luck! There are AU sequels and spinoffs on the author's profile. The spinoff has snape not die and help round up remaining DEs and the spinoffs have snapes memories that he gushed out at the end gain sentience. Better than it sounds :)

Snape centric, Marauder era and no character bashing. I have /almost/ finished writing it, but since it's over 500k long I'll probably have it done before you reach the end. I also have a lot of other Snape centric fics on my page, but they're all a bit shorter. I'm also on AO3 if you prefer that platform under the same username.
