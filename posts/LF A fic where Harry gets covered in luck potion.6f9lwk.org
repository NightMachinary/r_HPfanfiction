It happens in the department of mysteries at the end of book 5. It's written from the points of view of unspeakables.

*** Speaking of Bobmin, does anyone know what happened? The last update on his profile seems to indicate things were taking a very good turn in the fight against cancer.

And then nothing. I'm worried that is/was a bad sign but I haven't kept up really on news so I probably missed out on any other news from other non FFN author page sources.

***** Well... Carp.

I figured but hoped not. Had whiled many a day and night to their fics.

Was one that I actually didn't mind their author notes/forewards before chapters either.

Too many good fanfic authors lost last year. Man 2016 really was crap.

I'll raise a glass of some whiskey to him later then :(
