** I think linkffn(the first day by little0bird) does. It follows a bunch of them around that first year, including George. A bit heavy on the Harry/Ginny relationship angst though.

** Sort of similar to [[/u/girlikecupcake][u/girlikecupcake]]'s suggestion, linkffn(twelve days by My Dear Professor McGonagall) follows a bunch of people around during the first Christmas after the war and there is a pretty strong focus on George. Plus it's festive for this time of year. :)
