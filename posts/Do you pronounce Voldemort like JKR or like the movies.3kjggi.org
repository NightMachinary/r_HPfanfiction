Do you prefer pronouncing with *t* silent, /Vol-deh-mor/? Or do you go for /Vol-deh-mort/, with the voiced *t* at the end? JKR prefers going without. Thoughts?

** With the T, because I couldn't take him seriously if his name was pronounced with a French accent.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort pulled out his baguette. "Now, Monsieur Pottair, we duel. You 'ave been taught to duel, oui?"

  Harry nodded, and they fought. Inevitably, Voldemort's superior skill gave him the advantage, and soon Harry was disarmed.

  Voldemort raised his baguette, ready to cast the final, deadly spell, but paused. "Eet is time for lunch," he said, lowering the baguette. "We shall continue in three hours. Do not move."

  Confused, Harry watched as Voldemort and his Death Eaters left for an extended lunch break. He waited for hours until Peter Pettigrew returned to the Graveyard. He was alone.

  "Where's Voldemort?" Harry asked.

  "We're going to have to reschedule," Pettigrew said, untying Harry's bindings, "the Death Eaters have gone on strike."

I can't imagine Tom Riddle, a Brit, taking on a name with a french pronunciation. Also, he put so little thought into the anagram, I can't see him bothering to get the pronunciation right. /Flight from death? Really? He-who-wets-his-pants-and-runs-away-from-his-own-mortality?/

I heard that in the French editions, Severus Snape is Severus /Rogue/. True? If so, do you think readers get a different impression of him with a different last name? the alliteration from the double S of Severus Snape conjures feelings of snakes (of course), sneaking, shifting, etc. Rogue sounds more solid, brash. It means /arrogant/ in French, correct?

The thing is that the French translation of names is a mess... some are not translated at all (Weasley, Granger, Mcgonagall), but a lot are... and if sometimes it works (Wormtail/Qeudver Longbottom/Londubat are both litteral) and sometimes your learn that the name of the Dark Lord is Tom Elvis Jedusor (for the I am Voldemort thing). What always sounded off for me as a kid was that there was English names (Lavande Brown, Fred Weasley) and very French names, for example Oliver Woods is Olivier Dubois, Sprout is Chourave (which is a kind of Turnip) Hogwarts is Poudlard ("bacon lice") the houses are Gryffondor, Poufsouffle, Serdaigle (Eagle Claw) and Serpentard ("Snaky")

*** I've seen this on a few websites, but nothing terribly reputable, so take it with a grain of salt:

#+begin_quote
  The pronunciation of "Voldemort" was changed for this movie. When J. K. Rowling wrote the books, she intended for the final "t" to be silent, just like the French phrase from which the name is derived. For the movie, however, the "t" is pronounced (probably to make it clear that the root "mort," meaning "death," was part of the name, since viewers couldn't see it written down). Evidently Rowling must have consented to this change, because she now pronounces the name that way as well.
#+end_quote

Except that JKR /doesn't/ pronounce it that way. So like I said, a grain of salt.

"I's no' proper ta' spea' 'I's name 'ere" the large man replied, looking at the tables around the pair to make sure nobody is close, before pulling out a quill and a bit of parchment. After writing something on it, it's promptly handed to Harry.

"Lord Voldemort?"

"No, ye' don' say the T". He said, looking annoyed that Harry said his name even after his efforts to keep quiet

"Why's that?"

"Why would I know? I ain't some soddin' poofter like Malfoy."

I'm guessing it's a result of loaning my books to my father's girlfriend when I was young (before the third book came out), and her being somewhat of a Francophile. We probably talked about the books a bit and I learned that pronunciation or such.

My pronunciation of 'Hermione' is the same as in the movies though, as I didn't read any of the books in English before seeing the first movie (and her name is different in Dutch).

Hermelien Griffel, for those curious to know what it is. It's pronounced H-ehr-mu-line.

Curiously, the nickname 'Mione' would actually make some sense here if it'd be translated, since Lien is a popular name here.

Other names are:

Weasleys -> Wemel (suggesting that they have something to do with small animals).

Dumbledore -> Perkamentus (the Dutch name for parchment + -us)

Neville Longbottom -> Marcel Lubbermans (which roughly means 'unhandy')

Gregory Goyle -> Karel Kwast (which retranslates to Carl Brush)

Luna Lovegood -> Loena Leeflang (Luna Livelong)

Alastor Moody -> Alastor Dolleman (meaning Crazyman)
