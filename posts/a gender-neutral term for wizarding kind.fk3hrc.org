I mean seriously I can't keep on writing all wizarding kind or all magic kind I am partial to Wix (singular) Wixen (plural) myself thoughts


** Wizards are those with the extra wand, Witches those with the hidden holster, and Magicals are all of them.

Class over children.

** Pretty sure it would be fundamentally impossible not to laugh out loud saying “wix” in conversation.

Mage or Magical would work best. Or Warlock, though that is implied to be some sort of formal title within magical society.

*** Depends on the language or how deep you want to go linguistically to figure out the true root of the word.

** I quite like Wixen, though it does remind me of that ridiculous fairy TV show thing. Outside of actual stories, I tend to use 'Rowling-Magicals'.
