I'm currently writing my first fic in about 10 years. Safe to say I'm more than a little bit rusty. I never had a beta or looked into it before, so I have a few questions.

How does one acquire a Beta?

Are there betas patient enough to work with someone "new" and inexperienced, who might get a lot of errors since English isn't their first language? I also have quite a bad memory and might get a couple of things wrong canon wise.

How about odd pairings, are there any betas for that?

Is there a cost and if so, how much is it usually?

Any general advice in working with a beta?

I'll probably think of a lot more questions eventually, but these are it for now.

My fic is only one chapter long so far, but as a (very) long time fic reader I feel like I've got something quite unique going on and I'm very excited to be writing again, but I'm a long way from needing a beta yet.


** If you get a beta in sites like ffnet you will discover the beta profile tells you all you need for picking one or the other.

Your first step is to decide which kind of beta you need and want. Grammar beta? Story outline beta? Characterization beta? World building beta? A beta that will tell you if you need to make your crack funnier? Or your smut raunchier?

** I scrolled through your posts after commenting on your other post. I haven't written in a very long time but I am a consistent reader and have 2 degrees so my English is first language and I believe above average.

Would love to work with you to develop and edit and assist where needed. I would love to be involved in something that HP fanfic readers would love.

*** That'd be amazing! I really appreciate the offer! I don't have that much written out so far, and since I haven't written in quite some time I feel like it's going slowly (but steadily) and I'm not quite ready to share anything I've actually written YET. I can probably blame Christmas stress a bit as well, it's a strange Christmas this year.

But I could PM you and explain my basic idea of this fic and if you're still interested in helping me when the time is there, I'll just turn to you again? ðŸ˜ƒ
