Any era, prefer cannon pairings but if the story's quality then I'm willing to read anything.


** I keep recommending this one but linkffn(The Long Journey Home) details what the main character did as a response to the Goblin War in terms of a historical perspective. We have yet to see it happen in story but essentially she's immortal so there's a scene where Professor Binns describes her actions in battle and her anger at the Wizengamot's inaction afterwards. The fact that Binns' grandfather was present is implied to be a reason why he's so interested in the wars

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
