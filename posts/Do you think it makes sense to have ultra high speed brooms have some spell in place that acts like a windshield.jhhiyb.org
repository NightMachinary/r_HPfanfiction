** Given that they're mostly used in sport, I suspect the answer would be no. As being able to change airflow using a shield would be useless for some positions, and for seekers remove a large element of the skill they need.

I can imagine it being a feature on racing brooms, in the same way that track cycles bear very little resemblance to road cycles.

** It's magic. Before the power of wind, G-force would make the flyer squashed.

**** In a straight line acceleration, maybe. Banking turns and high speed aerobatic maneuvers would do much worse than that.

** I'd say it should work more like a cow-catcher or a snowplow than a windshield. Windshields work quite well, or so Top Gear told me, due to cars needing to be a certain shape to help them handle their mass and stay on the roads (air flows over the body of the car and pushes it down onto the road). Brooms are a lot smaller, a lot lower in mass, and need to turn in every direction without the need to stick to roads. Something more conical would probably be most appropriate, letting it deflect air and bugs by diverting them around the entire broom rather than absorbing them (holding up a flat dinner plate shield in front of your face would fuck with your flying, and curving the windshield spell like an actual windshield would keep pushing the broom downwards).

*** I was thinking like a bubble head charm but way bigger around the entire broom. That way you could fly at 10000 mph if the broom was capable of that without getting wind in the face and without breathing problems at high altitude.

Maybe a spell to move the air out of the way like the knight bus moves cars out of the way would make more sense though. Less aerodynamic trouble and no fiery ball of plasma when you go past mach 5.

**** Both of those could theoretically work, I think. I'm not enough of an expert to poke holes in it, certainly. My first comment was basically the extent of my knowledge on this - I'm a psychologist, not a physicist or an engineer. :)

** Up to each person I think.

I'd say probably not because of the increased resiliency wizards have; they wouldn't need a spell to deal with the ill-effects of high G-forces such as passing out.

On the other hand, it might also be needed because the increased resiliency doesn't come with increased strength. While the high wind and high acceleration might not result in health consequences, the wind might cause one to let go of the broom without a spell to mitigate it.
