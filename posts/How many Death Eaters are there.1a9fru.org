Hi folks, just wondering about something. I've read many fics where the final battle is between hundreds of Death Eaters versus the Order and Ministry forces. Or where Harry and co kill tens of (fodder) Death Eaters every week, but it doesn't seem to even put a dent in Voldemort's followers. Every time I read this I think "that can't be right". For some reason I imagine 20-30 DEs at most, not counting werewolves and sympathizers. What do you think?


** The [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/death_eaters.html#profiles][HP Lexicon]] lists about 30 known Death Eaters. Like you, that is about the amount of Death Eaters that I always imagined, but I think that they could be interpreted to be something akin to his lieutenants with many other lowly foot soldiers. These lower supporters would probably help in battles, but not be trusted with important information or missions.

** I don't think JK specified exact numbers, but in the final film there seem to be about 200-250 snatchers/low level DEs in the bridge scene with Neville, and about 40 people behind Voldemort when he brings Harry's (assumed) dead body. Assuming those were actual Death Eaters and assuming about 40% losses in the previous battle, that puts a conservative estimate at about 50 high ranking death eaters and about 250 low level mooks/snatchers.

*** [[http://imgur.com/SmcuhdI]] Those are only 1/2 of the people attacking Hogwarts, and I'd estimate that number at much higher than 250

** I think that the death eaters that get named number about 20-30, but essentially they operate like a terrorist cell with each death eater controlling maybe 1-2 children raised as death eaters plus 5-10 sympathisers or coerced people. No official information, plus smoke screens, confusion and false leads are what makes the death eater fear factor so effective.

** I would say around 30/50 Death Eaters. 30 we know of by name and 20 who are unamed. I assume there are ranks within the Death Eaters, hence why Snape is, pretty much, Voldemort's right hand man. Many Death Eaters may not have been summoned to Voldemort's rebirthing party, others may not have joined up until after he returned. Then we got to think that some of Voldemort's followers aren't Death Eaters at all and are just plain followers that Voldemort feels he can afford to lose. Thats not to mention all the people he tricked and curesed into following his orders, as well as all the magical creatures he has on his side.
