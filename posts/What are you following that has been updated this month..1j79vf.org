** Firebird's Son ([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son]])

This is the best thing I have ever seen.

/A completely AU story of Harry Potter in a world with four times more women than men. But will a world run by women, in which wizards are commodities to be controlled and threats to be contained, actually be any better?/

Why would anyone think that would be better?

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9408516/1/Hit-The-Ground-Running][Hit The Ground Running]] by Tozette /The Horcrux in Harry's head wakes up and begins talking to Harry long before he's ever heard the name Voldemort. Philosopher's Stone AU./

I LOVE this story so far. Updates are quick too, always a bonus!

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8684786/1/A-Dark-Tale][A Dark Tale]] by the-shiny-girl /Why exactly did Hermione Granger force Severus Snape into marriage?/

You'd think you've read it before, but I really enjoyed the author's twist on the marriage law fic. I also really appreciate the realism of it all, love doesn't just blossom between the two.

** This prompt makes me sad, looking through my list to see just how many haven't updated for several months.

- [[http://hpmor.com][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]], a multiple point-of-departure fic that upgrades the intelligence of every character and watches them go.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]], Tom Riddle wins his first war against Dumbledore, and goes on to mentor an orphaned Harry Potter. Well on the way to having covered the entire 7 books.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural D20]], humour fic just on this side of being a crack fic, with an OC from the D&D universe wreaking mayhem at Hogwarts. Just started Book 2.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/689909/chapters/1267386?view_adult=true][The Spellmaker]] - it's nice to read a fic updated so regularly, though I suppose we'll see if that remains true.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/45/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], Harry/Bellatrix with a time-travel angle, with the pair getting involved both at the start and end of the war against Voldemort. Should be finished in an update or two.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9185028/1/Scarred-Roots][Scarred-Roots]] /An AU story set in a world with no magic. James and Lily were killed by Peter's deceit; Sirius imprisoned, Remus tortured for a long painful year. Now, they raise Harry. Sirius dates every girl that crosses his path and Remus concentrates on surviving one day to the next. It all changes when a red-headed cop trips into their lives. Will Remus see her love before it's too late?/

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8423267/1/A-Life-More-Ordinary][A Life More Ordinary]] /"Two escapees that the ministry would love to catch, kidnapping Harry Potter and hiding away out of sight. That, Moony, is the perfect way for us to raise Prongslet!" Sirius and Remus, running from the wizarding world, kidnap Harry and raise him in a house filled with love. How will this effect the Boy-who-Lived. How will their actions change the wizarding world?/ It is not a generic cuddle-fest like most, actual plot and character development to fix damaged souls (mostly Remus).
