I've found that recently (in any Fandom ) I just can't read depressing or angsty stories anymore and I much prefer op (no chance they'll lose) or comedic stories.


** It depends.

I find it hard to enjoy fics where Harry acts like a complete idiot and thus gets into trouble. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion and it grates on my nerves. However, I'm also quite sick of super!Harry fics where /everything/ is solved through magical prowess. Fights can be fun, but they kinda wear out, and right now I prefer to read a clever Harry with average magical skills who goes for some actual subtlety in his actions.

*** What longer fics do you like with Harry that's not super OP or annoying? Personally I really enjoy reading about him succeeding in general, but my problem is that it usually means no visible effort and struggle.

I have recently started The Hogwarts Battle School because I liked the idea and thought it's going to be entertaining in that Harry is going to be forced to compete and improve. But it turns out he starts out hilariously talented and smart, and it looks like the only thing that's wrong with him is underestimating his opponents and some lack of creativity, which feel very forced. It's a an obvious "look, see, it's *not* a Mary Sue, he *struggles*" move from the author and I don't know who's convinced by that..

**** Battle School certainly isn't a particularly good fic, honestly.

Characters are quite lacking and the actual content of the story isn't really worth the presentation.

It also has terrible "wand-is-a-gun" combat with magical exhaustion. Did it have cores too? I can't remember.

****** I am, actually. I find the writing to be okay, but the setting.. isn't very good. It applies magic to combat quite poorly - or rather, it applies combat /to magic/ poorly.

The Hermione in that fic and her interactions with Harry is not very well done, either, I'm sorry to say. It's above the general riff-raff of fics, but it isn't worth the hype the fic gets.

And for a fic with a focus on magical combat, it does it very very poorly. If your characters run around like maniacs using their wands like guns, and you have /magical exhaustion/, I'm going to have to say you failed. Should have just written an Ender's Game fanfic instead, because this isn't very good HP content.

******* Hmm. I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree, then. I feel that the spells Harry performs are much more complex than "being guns", and the concept of magical exhaustion makes sense with the scale of magic being executed - I, personally, felt it was well-done, and never felt arbitrary at all.

The setting, I thought, was incredible - one of the most interesting portrayal of Hogwarts and Hogwarts professors I've seen. The combat scenes always got my heart thumping - it was action-packed and generally well-done overall, with creative solutions for nearly every problem Harry faced.

And Harry's emotions were handled beautifully, I think.

The story certainly is worth the hype, in my eyes. And it may not be to everyone's tastes, of course, but I certainly thought it was far, far above "better than the riff-raff".

***** Really? This fic really has one of the best Hogwarts setups in my humble opinion.

Even though it has been a while since I checked it out, I will disagree with the wand-gun trope. Unless I remember incorrectly, a lot of different magic spells and tactics were being used.

I am curious. If you don't think this is good, then what is?

Edit: Ok, just got to admit something though. The particular fic has strong dystopian qualities and can be pretty depressing. Could that be what is annoying you? Cause the other things you mention are a bit nit-picky.

****** It does use a lot of different spells and tactics, but it still boils down to treating the wand like a gun. Limited reserves, rather straightforward fighting, dodging, rolling, running around for cover and preserving energy.

This isn't how skilled duellists fight in the HP universe. If Voldemort even bothers to move, he walks casually. When Sirius and Bellatrix, or Molly and Bellatrix, fought, they weren't throwing themselves into rolls and hiding behind cover - they duelled like their wands were swords, or better yet, an extension of themselves.

The only ones that run around like Battle School makes out is the best tactic in the HP world is school-kids when fighting skilled adults.

Finally, if you limit magic by "energy" or "reserves" or what have you, I'm going to have to tell you to kindly go fuck off and write a sh≈çnen fic instead. This isn't /magic/ and it definitely isn't HP magic.

The dystopian qualities I'm fine with. It's not that strong, and it works for the story. Snape's a bit of a disappointment though, as he always is in fics.

I think this is a good story as a fic. I've yet to read a single fic that holds a light towards actual good writing - but to be fair, neither does the HP books.

I'd say there are far better examples of writing in the fandom, however. Just recently, Resurrexit was pretty good, even if I didn't much like the story and hook. A Black Comedy is a fantastic example on how to write comedic fiction. HPMOR is a study in episodic writing and (arguably shoehorning) educational overtones into a well-written story.

**** There's much more to being a Mary Sue than being good at magic. Harry in HBS certainly is not a Mary Sue. He's ambitious, capable, and smart - that doesn't mean Mary Sue.

Hell, the fic is a fun read precisely /because/ Harry is not a Mary Sue. Challenges are scaled to his ability. The struggle is certainly there, and it makes a very enjoyable read.

I'm not sure how you could say Harry is a Mary Sue if you've actually read the fic. There are massive struggles, absolutely massive plot-centric trials Harry is going through. Just because he's good at magic doesn't mean he's a Mary Sue.

***** You remind me a bit of those people who go "Yeah s/he can do anything well and is super brilliant and has great personality and humor but it's not really a Mary Sue because their perfection itself is annoying".

The fact that from chapter one, /one peer/ in the castle can beat Harry solely because she takes it /seriously/ and /plans appropriately/... makes for an an awful, awful setting.

And let's not forget his own brilliant mind, always finding the perfect solution, having witty last word, analyzing problems to the point of hilarity, noticing everything around him that happens to be relevant, we can go on

Check this out:

#+begin_quote
  Deciding to intervene on her behalf, Harry said: "You mean the charm to unlock doors? I know you had trouble with it, Draco, but it's called Alohomora. Do you want it in syllables? A-lo-ho-mo-ra. Kind of.. kind of like it sounds!"

  "Potter, leave the humor to Zabini. You're not as good at it as he is."
#+end_quote

This perfectly shows /the lenghts/ the author has to go to, to prove to us that Harry isn't perfect. *He literally has to tell us.* Pathetic. Bad characterization is bad.

****** I can only ask how far you've read it as I don't think anyone should be able to come away reading most of the story and thinking Harry is a Gary-Stu.

Other problems with the fic aside, I do think that Harry in his Third Year proves - [[/spoiler][unable to see the big picture, willfully denies his past abuses which impairs his current emotional state, doesn't understand the political ramifications in engaging in every battle people provoke, invades other's minds for personal gain, refuses to trust his house to do their duties, and in general - can be an unceremonious prick to those who he deems lesser.]]

******* You're right, there's no way I'd read /most of a 300k word fic/ that does everything it can to stop me. If the writer gets better, hey, good on him - but that's like barely surviving 3 seasons of a bad show just because it gets bearable in the end. My benefit of the doubt just doesn't expand this far - I believe most people would have better things to do.

****** /One peer/ that is incredibly intelligent, capable of planning on a level beyond almost anyone, and (from canon) having perhaps the most analytical mind of all. In HBS, why should Harry plan to evade the potentiality of such a peer when he's won every single battle, gone undefeated in his glory? There's no threat to him. He doesn't even know she exists.

Hell, that arrogance is the first obvious, glaring piece of evidence that Harry is /not/ a Mary Sue. And he certainly pays for it - /unlike/ a Mary Sue.

Harry is not the end-all-be-all of planning, social skills, and intelligence, and I'm not sure how you could read past the first chapter and still think that.

So is being witty the same as being a Mary Sue, now? And where are you getting "noticing everything to the point of hilarity"? Last I checked, that's one of the things Harry is /struggling/ with.

Great characterization is /great/. I'm confused as to how you think that's the author telling us Harry isn't perfect - it's witty banter between Harry and Draco. I have intelligent friends that make sarcastic, witty comments. Are they Mary Sues, now?

*So far, you haven't countered a single point of mine,* instead telling me how I remind you of a fangirl. You seem to judge the fic off of barely skimming past the first chapter, seem to replace every incidence of "character dynamics" or "witty banter" with "Mary Sue".

** I can do dark fics. Fics that display war in all of its horror and sadness.

But I can't stand angst anymore. Where Harry goes all noble and thinks "we love each other but we can't be together". I've read it often enough, and it gets annoying. You have to get the angst right for it to enrich the story, but most of the time it's overdone and it overshadows the plot too much.

** Most of the time I stick to fairly fluffy, low-angst, oftentimes romance-ish stories. Because there's enough bullshit and depressing stuff in real life.

That's not to say I dislike darker, angsty-er stories. Often they get left on my to-read list for a while and then I binge them until the feels are overwhelming, before going back to the fluffier stories.
