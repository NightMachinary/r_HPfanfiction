If we look at the timeline, Hermione is “currently” Minister of Magic. How would the ministry handle something like Brexit, and would the ICW get involved?


** I like the idea of Gridlewald or Voldemort doing the negotiations instead - just execute the delegates and conquer Europe.

Margaret Thatcher would too, but she would be quicker about it.

** In many ways, the ICW is already the wizarding equivalent of the EU, albeit global rather than European:

#+begin_quote
  “What are you working on?” said Harry.

  “A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation,” said Percy smugly. “We're trying to standardize cauldron thickness. Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin - leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year -”

  “That'll change the world, that report will,” said Ron. “Front page of the Daily Prophet, I expect, cauldron leaks.”

  Percy went slightly pink.

  “You might sneer, Ron,” he said heatedly, “but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow bottomed products that seriously endanger -”
#+end_quote

GOF Chapter 5.

This is exactly the kind of thing the EU does, and it exists in the magical world too. So I guess if you wanted a magical equivalent to Brexit -- going with the theme that Muggle and magical events parallel each other -- then I guess it would be magical Britain leaving the ICW.

**** The wizards don't need much of an agricultural industry. It's enough to have a small plot of land to grow a bit of everything and then use magic to multiply it.

And hiding land from muggles is possible in either case, e.g. Hogwarts and Diagon Alley.

********** I read it again and while you didn't /literally/ say that, it is pretty similar and basically equivalent.

​

Let's analyze what you said:

#+begin_quote
  That's an absurdist, borderline racist view on the matter.
#+end_quote

Leave out the "absurdist" because it is irrelevant to the discussion and we get

#+begin_quote
  That's a borderline racist view on the matter.
#+end_quote

I am not entirely sure what "the matter" refers to, but since you are replying to me and insulting me I assume that "that" refers to what I said, i.e. "I bet that JKR never even wasted a thought on where all the food for Hogwarts came from."

So you are claiming that the sentence "I bet that JKR never even wasted a thought on where all the food for Hogwarts came from" is a borderline racist view on "the matter", whatever that refers to.

If you actually meant something completely different I would be delighted to read a clarification.

***** In DH, we see that Hermione is unable to spell the mould off a piece of bread. This seems to imply that magic cannot create freshness. So while you can multiply food as much as you like, the copies will only be as fresh as the original was. Which means that quite quickly you're just going to have a massive pile of rotten food -- you do actually need a decent sized crop to supply you with fresh food.

****** I would say that Hermione not being able to spell the mould off is just her not knowing a spell to do that. That said, just removing the mould wouldn't make the food fresh again, it would just make it less bad. There's other things that happen to food besides mould that make you not want to eat it after a while.

However, you don't need to be able to make the food fresh again, you either have a way to keep it fresh (magical stasis might exist, although not mentioned in canon) or you just make sure you have a tiny little bit of fresh enough produce all year round. Magic probably helps with growing citrus fruits in the British winter if you just find the right spells...

But even if wizards had to buy food from muggles because they can't grow what they want all year round, they still only have to buy a few things once a month and can multiply those, so price surges in the muggle world would not be felt in the wizarding world as much.

** "Minister Granger," Harry shouted through the hallways after the official result was published. However, since no important dignitary was around, he dropped the formal act and sprinted through the corridor leading to her office. "Hermione, the Muggles want to secede from the European Union."

"That is unfortunate but sadly not unexpected. However, it'll be their doom, not ours, Harry."

"Aren't you worried about the impact on the economy? Or the - "

"First of all, the Ministry predates our membership to the European Union by 267 years. We endured Napoleon and both World Wars with little to no impact until Grindelwald attached magic homing devices to the V2s. Our trade is with the magical communities, not the EU - "

"But food prices - "

"We do not pay customs to Muggle Governments, the prices will not be affected."

"Tell that to the reporters downstairs."

"Already?"

"You know how Malfoy uses every opportunity to attack you."

"We really should have thrown him into Azkaban when we had the chance. But no, you had the vain hope that he would suddenly become a decent - a human being."

"I owed his mother," Harry mumbled before shaking his head. There were more important matters at hand. "We still need to do something about the reporters and I promised Ginny that I would - "

"Fine, I'll give them a press conference. But you are not getting out of the next one, Potter!"

"Of course not."

"And you will make that spicy Gyros of yours when I come over on Sunday."

"As my Lady commands."

"And you will bring some cake for our lunchbreak - "

"Honestly, I need to find you a husband so that he can be your delivery boy. Or maybe a wife - "

"Harry, I don't need a spouse to bring me food. I've got you for that. Now run along before I drag you downstairs with me - I am sure Rita would love to continue your last interview."
