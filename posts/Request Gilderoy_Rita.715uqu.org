Looking for any Gilderoy Lockhart/Rita Skeeter stories. No idea why but Gilderoy/Rita is a pairing that I just love, it's weird I know but I just love the pairing a lot.

Can be any rating, would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is okay.


** Now, I'm just curious, but how do you love a fandom that's so out there?

*** If you mean the pairing I really don't know, I stumbled across a story a while ago, read it, read another one and was pretty much hooked on the pairing.

They're both out there, Gilderoy and Rita even are both pretty full of themselves. I don't know, I can't explain why I like the pairing, I just do.

** This pairing does make sense. It's a good idea. Rita/Dolores could be quite fun too.
