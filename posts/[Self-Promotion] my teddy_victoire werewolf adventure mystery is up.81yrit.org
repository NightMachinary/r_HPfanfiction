read at your own peril! linkffn(12828427)

the story is completed, and is in the editing process right now. i'm /trying/ to post every weekend or so.

i'm also looking for a beta who can help me refine the dialogue and help me craft an essential element of the story with which i'm struggling. message me if it's something you might be interested in doing!

this is the first story i've written in a long, long time, so i apologize if it's a bit of a mess.

cheers!


** Surprised your fic doesn't have more follows honestly. Pretty interesting read. Keep it up.
