I'm interested in anything that's good, not slash, and complete. Lately I've been reading lots of Adventure/Romance, any pairing is fine. Preferably some stuff that's not on ff.net or that is on there but isn't as well known, since that site is where I usually find my fics. I usually like anything where Harry and company are 4th year and above, since it's hard to relate to characters that still think the opposite sex has cooties. I'm hoping for something with good action and fights as well as a good pairing or interesting dating where the relationships are at least somewhat believable (The Triangle Prophecy trilogy did this really well in my opinion). Despite all that I just said, I'm really not picky as long as the fic is entertaining and/or original in some way. What do ya'll got? If anyone actually looks at this and wants recs from me, I'd be happy to help. Usually I just lurk on this sub for new reading material but I figured I may as well actually ask for stuff I like.

*** Seconding Incorruptible. It's an incredibly well done story. MS3K is not rec'd nearly enough.

  So, I'll assume you've read the classics such as Black Comdey

I just started reading a bunch of HP fanfic. What are considered the classics?

**** If you search this sub for something like "Classics" and sort by Top you'll get a ton of results. A lot of them have a bunch of the same fics featuring things like Black Comedy, Lie I've Lived among others.

** These are all complete (though some have incomplete sequels) fics that I've liked. They're all from ff.net though so I don't know if some/all will be things you're familiar with. Some may start before fourth year, however. No slash.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][Firebird's Son]] It's a trilogy and the whole thing is finished.

*** Thanks, I've only read one of these so I'll definitely check some out. Here's a few I liked that I don't see get recommended too often on this sub (all of these are complete except the last one):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4545504/1/Aspirations][Aspirations]] by megamatt09: I know it's clich√© and H/G shippy at first, but hang on for a few chapters and it becomes badass. There may be an awesome arc involving a vigilante towards the second half of the story, and the shippiness chills way out after a bit.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2686464/1/To-Fight-The-Coming-Darkness][To Fight the Coming Darkness]] by jbern: yeah I know everyone's heard of jbern's stuff, but this one has the single most realistic, badass Voldemort as the antagonist that I've ever seen. By a large margin. If you haven't read it, do it. Stop reading this post and click the link, now.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]] by kb0: It's been a while, but I remember enjoying this fic. Harry/Hermione/two more witches - don't want to spoil it for ya. One is easy to guess, one is less so.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/288212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Psychic-Serpent][Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent]] by Barb LP: First of a trilogy that is awesomely long and 100% complete. I loved this fic, which had compelling action and drama related to fighting, etc but also had some refreshingly realistic dating (ie people dating who they can instead of who they want, sex for the sake of sex, pining after someone in a relationship with a friend, etc.) I can't remember half the fics I've read these days, but this one is still perfectly clear in my mind.

There's one really funny one where harry goes to Azkaban after second year, and comes back a year later with a pet Bellatrix. It's really funny, with the Horcrux Riddle keeping control of Ginny's body and dating Hermione and Harry spends all his parent's money on a huge magical blimp? If anyone remembers the name I would appreciate it.

And lastly [[http://www.fictionesque.com/fic/1847/A_Butterfly_Effect/chapter:1][A Butterfly Effect]] by SlyGoddess: This is the only WIP I ever rec. I would kill a kitten in a dark ritual if it would make this fic be completed. Still worth the read. Good action. This is the only well done girl version of Harry I've ever read. Starts much the same, but Harry is a girl. Becomes much more AU over time. Harriet and Ginny will pair up (if Ginny ever stops being so frustratingly blind). Hard to describe, but it's an addictive read.
