  “I'll understand, of course, if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle,' said Sirius. 'But...well...think about it. Once my name's cleared...if you wanted a...a different home...'

  Some sort of explosion took place in the pit of Harry's stomach.

  'What - live with you?' he said, accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling. 'Leave the Dursleys?'

  Of course. I thought you wouldn't want to' said Sirius quickly. 'I understand. I just thought I'd -'

  'Are you mad?' said Harry, his voice easily as croaky as Sirius. 'Of course I want to leave the Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can I move in?”

  Sirius turned right around to look at him; Snape's head was scraping the ceiling but Sirius didn't seem to care.

  'You want to?' he said. 'You mean it?'

  'Yeah, I mean it!' said Harry.

  Sirius' gaunt face broke into the first true smile Harry had seen upon it. The difference it made was startling, as though a person ten years younger was shining through the starved mask; for a moment, he was recognisable as the man who had laughed at Harry's parents' wedding.

  Mrs. Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put her arms around Harry. He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother. The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs. Weasley held him to her.
#+end_quote

And

#+begin_quote
  "Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry" said Mrs. Weasley, beaming at him. "He had to leave early for work, but he'll be back for dinner. That's our present on top."

  Harry sat down, took the square parcel she had indicated, and unwrapped it. Inside was a watch very like the one Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had given Ron for his seventeenth; it was gold, with stars circling around the face instead of hands.

  "It's traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age," said Mrs. Weasley, watching him anxiously from beside the cooker. "I'm afraid that one isn't new like Ron's, it was actually my brother Fabian's and he wasn't terribly careful with his possessions, it's a bit dented on the back, but --"

  The rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged her. He tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them, because she patted his cheek clumsily when he released her, then waved her hand in a slightly random way, causing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor.

#+begin_quote
  He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the others existed only in the mirror.

  She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did.

  Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.

  "Mum?" he whispered. "Dad?"

  They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.

  The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.

**** The night before the Goblet fiasco Harry and Ron were talking about entering the tournament. When Harry's name came out, it's not too farfetched for Ron to believe that Harry got it in using the cloak or some kind of Parseltongue loophole or something. Also, Ron was 14; he underestimated the dangers of the Tournament enough that he totally wanted to enter, and he probably thought that with Dumbeldore overseeing it that nothing too dangerous would be chosen as a task.

As for being a flip side of Draco, I agree. Ron is can sometimes be unintentionally racist, what with casually mentioning how they don't talk to his mother's Squib cousin. But again, he's just human, and he's not being malicious about it. Racist =/ Evil.

***** Well they didn't really talk about it, Harry did fantasize about winning it, who didn't? Now, I might have missed the page where they discuss it in detail, that I will admit freely. Ron let his jealously run wild, which is always below the surface, which makes it hard for me to like him....then again, I was older when I started the books and Ron was not endearing himself to me. I find him to be nothing more than an enabler of Harry's worst habits, along with Dumbledore himself. (Yes, Hermione and Harry can irk my nerves too, though Sirius was the worst offender. Sure I gasped at his death, but his death didn't shake me as others did)

I agree that racist doesn't equal evil, but Ron kinda saw it that way (of course, he never saw his own racism). He tells Harry that Slytherin is basically the house of evil, which solidifies what Hagrid told Harry. It's a bunch of hypocrisy that NO ONE seems to call out. History is repeating itself and nobody seems to wonder why! This is one of the reasons that I like the name for Harry's second child (though not the wife, too clean, too fairy tail ending. High school sweethearts is too damn cliche), also about what they discuss. Of course, the fandom seems to ignore the underlining significance of epilogue scene, just complaining about the name.

Yes I can. You don't get to dictate what balances morally for someone else. Ron doesn't exist in a vacuum.

We have a standard to judge Ron by: *Hermione.* She wore the horcrux and didn't leave. Why did he? She realised Harry didn't have much in the way of a solid plan and didn't leave. Why did he? I'm certain that she missed her parents and the Weasleys every bit as much as Ron did and didn't leave. Why did he?

If there were no standard available to judge Ron's actions, I would agree with your points (rudely phrased, they might be). But since Hermione was in the same spot and stuck around, then Ron's actions fall short.

************** Ron and Hermione are two very different people who both have very different situations surrounding them.

Hermione basically cut ties with her family by obliviating them and sending them off to Australia. She was a direct target of Voldemort, being a Muggleborn, and thus didn't really have anywhere to go even if she did want to leave Harry.

As for Ron, a large part of his character is his inferiority complex, always being just second best. Everything he could do has already been done by his brothers. His best friend is the Chosen One, while the girl he likes is the Smartest Witch of Her Age. Compared to them, he's just the ginger tagalong.

Ron also had to deal with worrying for his family, all of whom are basically on Voldemort's shit list; most of his family was in the Order, and he knows Snape must've told Voldie about the identities of the members.

Hermione =/ Ron.

#+end_quote

Voldemort didn't try to kill his family in DH. Hell, he even allowed Arthur and Percy to continue working at the Ministry. Not that this clashes with loyalty, of course, it practically confirms it; Ron has loyalty to his family and friends, which is why he fights. And he could easily decide not to fight, to abandon Harry, and live the untroubled life of a pureblood under Voldemort's reign.

The rest of what you said in the continued argument is equally retarded; very few people would do what Ron did, especially in the wizarding world. With the Horcrux, he was a victim of circumstances - he didn't know the Horcrux was affecting him until after he left. The fact that he "took the responsibility" to destroy "wizarding Hitler", at age 17, when he could have benefited greatly from not doing so, shows just how loyal and brave he is. I doubt... no, I flatly don't believe that you would do anything of the like. But I suppose it's easy to talk about loyalty and bravery against an unbeatable monster when you sit in front of your computer screen.

******* No I'm not, though it seems people think I am by pointing out instances where Ron's loyalty flip flops. Or when I point out that someone didn't completely read my comment. Hermione is a better example of loyalty, Ron isn't. Sure, his disloyalty is triggered by jealousy and perhaps a cursed object, but he still left or abandoned Harry when he needed his support the most. Ron does come back, but the fact that he leaves is a glaring sign. Ron allows his own jealousy to come between him and his friends. So yes, Ron's loyalty to Harry flip flops, when Ron let's his jealousy consume him, Harry becomes the enemy, that's not a good thing.

** When Lupin and Sirius meet for the first time in the Shrieking Shack, and Lupin easily forgives Sirius for believing he was the spy, and there is just a real sense of pain to me there: Lupin realising that their lives were ruined essentially because his friends, his best and only friends, had believed that he, as a werewolf, was the most likely person in their group to be a spy and betray them all, and had discussed this as a group and conspired a conspiracy which they kept from him.

Sirius and James decided Lupin was likely the spy. Because he was a werewolf. And Lupin realises this, and forgives Sirius so quickly. Lupin had every reason to believe that Sirius had killed his friends, but Sirius's belief that Lupin would do it appears to have been based on nothing but a prejudice that his friends had tried to convince Lupin they did not hold.

And it is, in some ways, such a throw-away moment in the middle of a packed scene, but it hurts my heart.

*** A) I just now noticed your tag says Professor Albus Dumbledog. I love that as much as saying Dumb-assledore!

B) That example is one of my favorite points in the entire series.

***** All pet names eventually become shorted, though! Even if you called him Dumbledore, you /know/ you'd eventually shorten it to Dumbles and then Dumby.

I don't know if this is true at all, but it /sounds/ true, and it might just be enough to convince you boyfriend.

** When Harry and the Twins are banned by Umbridge from playing Quidditch ever again- the run up of injustices came to a sharp point then, when Umbridge essentially trumped the Deputy Headmistress and abjectly abused her authority in a way no one could challenge. Half the scenes with Umbridge drive me mad, but this and Hagrid's first lesson truly bring visions of violence to mind.

** Harry Potter: How come you're not at the feast?

Luna Lovegood: I've lost all my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them.

Harry Potter: That's awful!

Luna Lovegood: Oh, it's all good fun. But as this is the last night, I really do need them back.

Harry Potter: Do you want any help finding them?

Luna Lovegood: I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

[clasps his hand comfortingly]

Harry Potter: Are you sure you don't want any help looking?

Luna Lovegood: That's all right. Anyway, my mum always said things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end.

[they look up and see a pair of her shoes hanging from the ceiling arch]

Luna Lovegood: If not always in the way we expect.

Awww. This always makes me melt. Harry/Luna OTP.

**** Definitely, I don't have the book to hand so I had to make do with the quote the internet gave me. I can't help but feel all emotional when I get to that scene. That and when she says that the DA was like having friends. I just want to wrap her and Harry in a hug and never let go.

** "Always."

Snape is a divisive character: an unlikable, unattractive jerk with few redeeming features; a hero and a villain at turns; a bullied child who became a bullying adult. But in one word, one simple "always," is a world of feeling. Lily Potter was quite possibly the only person who ever liked Snape for Snape, not because he was on her side, not because she could use him, but because he was her friend.

And that was enough to make him defy Voldemort. Even if it was a horribly obsessive, selfish, one-sided love, the outcome was sad as hell. A man who could never move past his past ultimately sacrificed himself for the memory of it.

** I agree with the commenters who mention the watch gift and Neville's parents. Neville is another one who gets short shrift in the films.

One that always made me sad was when Hermione gets a tiny egg for Easter, because Molly believes Skeeter's reporting. Ouch.
