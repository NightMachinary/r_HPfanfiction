Turns out the curse scar is not strong enough to anchor a soul, because it was never fully prepared for that function, like the other horcruxes were - so what happens when it's the only tether holding Voldemort's soul to the mortal plane?

To illustrate, suppose that Voldemort's soul is a ship, anchored to the sea floor, and Death is a storm coming to sweep it away and sink it. All the chains that anchor /SS Voldy/ to the sea floor are snapped, but there's one dock rope tied to the mast of another ship in the harbor - Harry. The storm blows in, and Voldy's ship is pulling against Harry's - just one, weak little dock rope straining to hold it all in place.

What happens next?

Does the dock rope snap? If so, how does that backlash affect Harry, and is that damage something he can come back from?

Does the mast break? This would mean irreparable damage to an actual ship, so for Harry it could mean anything from he loses his magic to he loses his sanity, becoming like Neville's parents.

Maybe Harry's own anchor snaps, and he's swept away in the storm as well.

Maybe Harry finds out about the dock rope before confronting Voldemort, and starts the process of loosening the knots. How would that work? In canon, the only way to heal a split soul is through regret. Are there other ways?

Are there any fics that explore this scenario?

Sorry for the extended boat metaphor, I'm happy to clarify things in the comments if it got too confusing.

*** Username checks out.

The way I see it there's a few things that can happen in this scenario.

First is heavy but manageable damage to Harry's soul, with effects that either take a long time to heal or lead to a chronic condition of some kind. He's still who he is, damaged but alive.

Second option is irreparable, massive damage that can never be fixed, and would drastically affect him or his lifestyle. He loses his magic, he loses his sanity - something along those lines.

Third, Voldemort's dying soul drags Harry's down with it and they both die. Maybe Harry ends up in King's Cross and comes back - which would be the best case scenario.

Are there any fics that explore this concept?

** I think that's a rad thought.

Another metaphor could be tug rope and Death is on one side with extra help of some kind, maybe all the people he'd killed or something, and just a tiny piece of Voldemort is on the other trying to hold him off

** I think, that at the end (completely ignoring the boats metaphor) Voldemort could somehow feel that he's gonna die and using that â€˜rope' he would use it as the final battle ground and try to possess him for the last time but this time he just doesn't want to be a head in the back of the cranium he wants the full body for himself, so the souls fight to consume the other one, we're depending on the type of you rather is 3 options -Voldy wins, nothing more maybe gains his sanity back maybe he doesn't but has all of Harry's memories and knowledge -Harry wins, he keeps all of Tom memories, knowledge and parceltongue -Tie the consume so much of one another that he don't even know were Harry starts or Tom ends they were two souls and now they're one,Will he be Good? Bad? Gryffindor? Slytherin? What does he think about muggles, Kill them? Slave them? Ignore them? What's his future? Married to Ginny and Work as an Autor? Become the Emperor of Magical Britain? Solve the world's problems, Or destroy the world and recreate a new one better? Does wizard really need to live in Earth? Take the wizards off planet and become the Emperor?

*** Well shit now I want to read the third option that sounds incredible.

Actually all three are good and honestly this whole line of thought is much more interesting than mine. I'm imagining there's an explosion, like the one that destroyed Godric's Hollow, and Voldemort's shade attacks Harry - cue the actual final battle, which happens entirely in Harry's head. All the while, because the Horcrux connection is so unstable, Death is slowly but surely dragging Voldemort (and any attached bits) into the abyss. This manifests as a crumbling mind palace, slowly being eaten away. So Harry and Voldy are fighting each other while also trying to escape this disintegrating environment. Who comes out on top?

Goddamn.

*** By that point, the piece of soul in Harry is more of Voldemort's soul than the main soul, which are both only the smallest fractions of a whole soul. And Harry already fought off Tom's possession once.

**** that depends on if in the soulscape or whatever you want to call it if the horcrux souls return to voldemort. also was it ever confirmed that it split his soul in half, how do we know the soul dosent equally distribute amongst the containers. or if voldemort can chose how much goes to each horcrux?

** Another possibility is that the anchor detaches from ship voldemort and slams into ship harry, damaging it some, but still seaworthy and repairable. But now ship harry has an extra but of broken line. That while it can be repurchased it would be difficult to do so

** Well, clearly Harry may suffer some soul damage.

This will, of course result in some behavioral changes on Harry's part.

A loss of rhythm. Given Harry's extant dance skills, that will not probably be noticed.

A cheerful disposition, and a gravitation towards sales and marketing.

Snogging Ginny Weasley, taking up that offer to promote Firebolt in Wizarding Britain.

Shaking everyone's hands after the battle.

Except when you look into his eyes, there's just something subtly missing.

And a really severe reaction to Dementors. He's getting by with a broken soul, after all.
