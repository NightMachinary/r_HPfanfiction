Well the title is pretty self explanatory but let me just add a bit to that. By OFC, I mean an original female character. Eventhough Daphne and few other girls can be considered almost oc...that's not what I want.

I have read linkffn( behind blue eyes) and I enjoyed it. I was also reading the one where Harry meets a muggle waitress. I find that interesting, the muggle and wizarding world coming together. Though, it doesn't have to be that. Right now I was thinking what if Harry meets someone post war. Or even in Hogwarts...

It could be any premise as long as it's interesting.

So I would appreciate if you could give few recommendations, Thank you !


** Harry/Muggle: linkffn(Grow with me), linkffn(Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss).

While less popular (at least on this subreddit), I really like Matt Silver's linkffn(To End in Serenity). Features one of the best "trio" dynamic of any fic I've read.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  The war's not over. Voldemort created one last Horcrux and sent it back in time, and Harry, Ron and Hermione have to travel back to destroy it and prevent that timeline's Voldemort from rising once and for all, all while doing some good old fashioned meddling along the way. HP/OFC, RW/HG, RL/NT.

** the waitress is actually a (film) canon character

my linkffn(a trek to the stars) has harry with a (vulcan) ofc based on Rachel Riley. People have actually commented "I dislike O[F]Cs but I really like T'ryl" which made me feel pretty good.

  Exiled for three centuries on a barren rock, Harry's saved by the crew of the Enterprise D. He makes it to the colony world his people planned to go to and finds they're just as insular as ever though Hermione and his friends set them on a better course. Their nuclear option, though, left Harry with no escape. A prophecy is once again in play and he's the Chosen One. Again.

** There's a story called "Harry Potter and the Transfer Student" by Enterprise1701-d. Unfortunately, the story was taking down because it was pretty much just a typical Mary Sue OC story, but I really liked the foreign culture world building stuff that was explored. You can find it on the author's yahoo page, but it's probably not worth the effort, though the story was about 80k words iirc.

** linkffn(You'll Be The Death of Me)

If you're ok with the male protagonist being Neville instead of Harry, then try this. It's WiP but at 500,000 + and with semi-regular updates (usually monthly).

** Thanks for the recommendations but I am kind of disappointed to be honest. Not because of you just because of the lack of good stories that develop their own characters.

I feel that you have a lot of leeway with your own character .

Anyways thanks again
