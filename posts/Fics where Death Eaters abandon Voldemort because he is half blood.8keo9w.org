I've been musing on this for a while. Would also like it if if comes from the POV of the abandoning death eaters or Voldemort.


** I feel like that story would end with Voldemort slaughtering most of the renegade Death Eaters and placing the rest on permanent Imperius until he finds some new henchmen. Seriously. A rebellion against the Dark Lord would /not go well/. The man's basically invincible if you're not Dumbledore, Grindelwald, or similar.

Weren't Slughorn, McGonagall and Kingsley (together) able to hold their own against Voldemort? So I don't think he'd flatten all his followers - who are in hundreds - easily...

**** He /was/, but I'm allowing for the fact that 1) Slughorn, Kingsley and McGonagall are more of an unknown to Voldemort than his followers whom he knows very well, 2) this was all happening in the middle of a heated and messy battle where Voldemort also had to deal with Bellatrix's unexpected demise and protecting Nagini, and 3) Harry's sacrificial protection thing was going on, which meant any would-be lethal hits he landed would have been severel downgraded if they worked at all.

Also, you are /way/ overestimating the amount of Death Eaters. At most there may have been 30, 40 Death Eaters in all, and none at the same time; probably less. Now of course, there were also a lot more low-ranking mooks who didn't have official Death Eater status (e.g. the Dark Mark), including the Snatchers and Fenrir Greyback, a lot of whom Voldemort dressed up in Death Eater robes in the Battle of Hogwarts to make his army appear even more fearsome; but these people aren't as loyal to him as the true DEs, few among them who are would be so because of bloodpurism, and few to none of them are decently competent wizards at all.

*** I agree but the fic doesn't have to have them launching a rebellion or coup, just mass desertion and probably a couple of families moving out of the country.

** Voldemort bragged about using his Muggle father's bones in front of his Death Eaters in the Graveyard.

â€˜Might makes it right' was all what those guys believed in. Now, if there was a newcomer who was more powerful than Voldemort and just as ruthless, but significantly less tyrannical, you should expect Death Eaters defecting to this new Lord en masse.

***** True, though it'd take just one shot to make him lose said concentration and then shit hits the fan.

I guess it all depends on how many DE are there.

***** Hey, I had forgotten about that one!

Is it dark though? It's a glorified bombarda afair, but it counts as a curse. Is every curse /dark/, I wonder?

** They already know it isn't a pureblood. They don't care. Death Eaters, or the ministry post takeover, didn't discriminate against half bloods at all only muggleborns.

** IIRC there was a one-shot where they used the goblet of fire to take away Voldemort's magic, and then it ended with the Death Eaters realizing he lost his magic and couldn't fight them, so they attacked Voldemort.

Aside from something like this, a rebellion would totally fail because, as others have pointed out, he would just kill them all lmao.

** I remember a fic where Harry gets Sirius out of prison(early?) then leaks Voldemort's identity and blood status. He had to rebrand himself as the last Gaunt. Time travel may have been used, I can't remember. Sorry for being so vague, but it has been a while since I read it.
