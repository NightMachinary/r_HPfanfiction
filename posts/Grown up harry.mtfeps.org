Harry is grown up now, he's 14! He doesn't have to listen to dumbledore! He knows what's best! He could beat anyone in school! Even Voldemort! So why is he still listening to dumbledore even though he does bad things?!??!


** I have a feeling this version of Harry is extremely childish and gets beaten up a lot.

*** Nah the idea is that while he is powerful and can fight other students he's also a 'rebellious' child who thinks he can beat dumbledore in a fight (but only in his head) while not being overly arrogant

** Yeah i've never gotton fics where he gets emancipated because of the goblet and acts like a mature adult at 14. My sister is 14 and she isn't even close to an adult. I remember being 14 and offended for harry when fluer calls him a little boy, but looking at my sister now really has changed my perspective on it.
