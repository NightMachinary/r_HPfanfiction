Old story I read ages ago, I remember it being fairly long and pretty decent, it actually ended too.

One girl is a redhead who is in Gryffindor as a Fire Elemental and the other is in Slytherin as an Ice Elemental. I remember it moving on to a big AU war near the half way mark, with the end being both of them realising their full state as Elements. Was also F/F

I've spent like three hours looking for it and I'm beginning to believe that it's been deleted.


** That sounds a lot like linkffn(12798308), but it's its an oc girl in Gryffindor and Harry in slytherin

** For the life of me I can't remember the title (or find it), but are you thinking of the story where the Fire elementals name is Lily (I think) and they've essentially become immortal gods? I vaguely recall that the Fire elemental had a whole queen of the underworld schtick going on, while Harry rules earth? Or something like that, it's been a while since I read it.
