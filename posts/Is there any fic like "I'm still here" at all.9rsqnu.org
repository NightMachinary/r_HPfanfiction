** Technically From Ruin by GraeFoxx linkffn(13025350) is extremely similar and it is being updated regularly.

*** I felt that From Ruin is grammatically incorrect in that the author uses present continuous tense to narrate the story, but switches to simple past every now and then. The constant change makes reading it a chore.

Here's an excerpt:

#+begin_quote
  After their oaths, Harry explains enough for the couple to know he's from the future---there was really no way around that. Initially, Nicolas couldn't move past that fact until his wife threatened him with sleeping on the couch if he didn't stop asking questions about the future. Harry refused to tell him what became of many people who he honestly didn't know, or the exact mechanics of how Horcrux-Voldemort used arithmancy, runes and magic to traveled back in time.
#+end_quote

The first sentence is present continuous, but the next is simple past, as is the one after that. The next paragraph, he returns to present continuous.

#+begin_quote
  “Everyone,” Harry grimly returns. “After he started putting the heads of muggle presidents and other leaders on the wall, I knew the war had extended past the magical world, and that the very little they could do with their weapons, didn't work.”
#+end_quote

But here, he's mixing present continuous for actions with simple past for reported speech, and the whole effect is very...odd.

Maybe it's because English isn't my first language, but the whole experience feels very awkward to me. I put this as a review on FFN, he didn't bother replying to it or addressing the issue

**** I agree, in fact I have a bit of a hard time reading it, but it is otherwise a nice fic that's better than many horrors found around and when I am horribly bored it helps pass the time.

***** The part about Hermione being forced into giving blowjobs to upperclassmen is just shit-tier writing though. Even the slightest accusation of sexual assault is enough for a man to have a very rough time these days. A real one, backed with proof, will get him into a world of trouble, even if he's a juvenile.

  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

*** It's a decent fic, but Harry is a bit of a Gary Stu (oh and of course Hermione is a mousy little girl who gets sexually assaulted without Harry existing and desperately needs his help).

**** Its ok, there's some funny stuff, mostly between Harry and Draco (they hate eachother but have to live and work together), Harry's a bit OP, Dumbledore is a fucking prick, but its the old GG. There's some cool stuff though, where Harry does cool shit to save them, because Dumbledore is a fucker. The Flamels are nice, but I preffer Kathrin's Flamels. Harry also has a Phoenix, is (according to the last chapter) polygamous by nature for some reason that no-one knows, and has the same old "stay away from me or you die-issue".

**** The author takes most of the premise and ideas from I'm Still Here, including directly lifting some scenes and writing them in his own words (pretty sure he mentioned somewhere he got permission for this from kathryn518), except with the edginess meter set all the way to max. Like, Harry was in Azkaban in a dark future ruled by Voldemort, but that wasn't bad enough so Voldemort mounted the severed heads of all of Harry's friends on the wall of his cell. Or, later in the story, it turns out Hermione has been repeatedly raped by some older student so Harry kidnaps him, takes him to the Chamber of Secrets, and graphically tortures him for hours. etc etc. Between the over the top edginess and the lower general quality of writing compared to I'm Still Here I didn't really care for it.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
