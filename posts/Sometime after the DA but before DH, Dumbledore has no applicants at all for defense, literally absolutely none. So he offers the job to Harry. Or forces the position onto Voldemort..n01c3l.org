:FlairText: Prompt/Request
:END:
This is honestly both a prompt and a request. After thinking about the various defense professors Hogwarts has had, I ended up with the conclusion that there's really only two logical extremes it could go to. Either Harry ends up literally just teaching the class, because there's no one better and the DA proved he not only could, but would actually be incredibly good at it. Or Dumbledore somehow ropes Voldemort into the job, using the job application form he submitted for the post fifty years ago but which was never approved, which may be some kind of binding contract, possibly, for the sake of making this work.

Basically, the logical extreme for crazy defense professors is just Harry or Voldemort. Either Dumbledore gets Harry to do it, and all of his friends (and enemies) have to deal with 'Professor Potter,' or Dumbledore goes full Dumbledore and drags Voldemort away from his terrorist army and forces him to teach practical magic to children for a year.

I've never seen either of these done. I think both would be hysterical. If any of you know any fics that did either, I'd love to see them. If you don't, that's fine too.

My thoughts on both sides of this:

- */Harry/*

Dumbledore offers him the job because if you squint and look sideways, he's actually a really solid choice for it. Harry has enormous experience at practical defense. He's fought Voldemort multiple times, both as a wraith and in person. He dueled Voldemort at full power and escaped. He cast a corporeal patronus and drove over a hundred dementors off Hogwarts grounds while evading a rampaging werewolf. He was forced to participate in the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and /won,/ Harry Potter is a Triwizard Champion. He killed a thousand year old basilisk with a sword.

He can cast a corporeal patronus at all, which on it's own is a merit. While I cannot claim he is the youngest person to ever do so, as canon is silent on the matter, he could easily be if you wished to add that to his resume in fanfiction. Or youngest in a century, if you want to moderate it a bit. Either way, the patronus is post-post-NEWT magic, it's canonically among the most difficult and complex magic a wizard can learn.

And, perhaps most importantly of all, he has relevant, practical experience in teaching other people defense and practical magic: the DA is proof of this. We are flat-out told, in canon, that the only people who didn't have dumpster fire OWL grades in Defense that year are the DA members.

In addition to all of that, if anybody could break the curse on the position, it would probably be Harry.

The only thing Harry is actually missing are the actual, literal qualifications for the position. And he may not even be missing that. He got an Outstanding on his Defense OWL, and an Exceeds in Potions, Transfiguration, Charms, and Care. We don't actually know what you need to qualify for professorship at Hogwarts, though considering the school has run through one new Defense professor every year since 1971, and several of them were described as grossly unqualified, I have difficulty imagining you need to score very highly on tests to get in.

It's entirely possible that you need nothing more than the Headmaster's approval for the post, in which case all that would really need to happen is for Dumbledore to convince Harry to accept the position.

Umbridge was also very incompetent, at least in the beginning, and yet she still somehow qualified well enough that the Ministry could put her in the position and claim it was valid. I say in the beginning because Rowling has an awful habit of changing things around and not keeping facts straight. Umbridge was supposedly an unremarkable student and also bad at Defense, but later on in Pottermore and in interviews, Rowling claims that she *invented* blood quills and that she was capable of casting a corporeal patronus without the locket horcrux helping her. Keep in mind, the patronus charm is described as being /post-post-NEWT,/ and more or less THE single most difficult and advanced magic it is possible to learn. Also keep in mind that, according to Rowling, people who are objectively evil at heart cannot cast the charm at all.

In fact, Rowling has stated that anyone who is objectively evil at heart that tries to cast the charm will not only fail to do so, but that their wand will expel a mass of flesh-eating maggots that will swarm over their body and eat them alive. Which is the reason why Death Eaters don't use that spell. So attempting to cast it when you are "unworthy" will literally just kill you. And Rowling has claimed that Umbridge is one such objectively evil person. But she can also still cast a corporeal patronus without help. Supposedly.

So the competence of Delores is... questionable, I think. And the competence of Rowling, honestly. Some days she wants us to believe that the Patronus Charm is just about the most complex bit of magic that exists, and less than 0.01% of wizards can cast it. Some days she wants us to know that everyone who ever had a name in the series can do the charm, and exactly what their animal is. You flip that coin and decide for yourself.

Either way, you could argue that Harry's OWLs alone qualify him for the position. You could also, if you didn't want to do that, have Dumbledore ask him to sit his NEWTs over the summer for just Defense, as a favor to Dumbledore, no strings attached, and if he gets a bad grade on them he doesn't have to keep it. And then Harry does, and gets an Outstanding or an Exceeds, and that's all Dumbledore needs to smile and offer him the contract for the job.

And then Hogwarts has to deal with Harry Potter being simultaneously a student at the school and also a member of the teaching staff. He has to teach classes. To people he knows. He has to attend faculty meetings. He has to put together a lesson plan. People have to call him 'professor.' SNAPE has to call him 'professor.' Harry gets to correct Snape calling him Potter and say "Professor Potter."

"You don't have to call me 'sir,' professor. Professor will do just fine."

- */Voldemort/*

So I think, I 'think,' technically Methods of Rationality did this. I'll be the first to admit I stopped reading it after about 200k in, so I don't know for sure. But I'm pretty certain MoR!Dumbledore knowingly employed Voldemort as a gambit to keep him in the school where the damage he could do was minimal.

I think. MoR was... excessive. And a long time ago.

Either way, the idea with this side of the coin is, as I said, Dumbledore ropes Voldemort into the job as a way to disrupt Voldemort's second rise to power. Obviously Dumbledore would require some sort of hold over Voldemort to accomplish this, and while I'm sure there are a lot of problems with the idea that Hogwarts employment entails some sort of magically binding contract, that exact thing being true would be a very neat and clean way to force the issue. Dumbledore digs out Riddle's old application, approves it for the position Riddle applied for (Defense), and then sends Voldemort an owl with a letter informing him that his application has been accepted and congratulating him on becoming part of the Hogwarts faculty. Done deal, Voldemort is now forced to attend the position and teach Defense at the school, he has no other choice.

This angle actually has some fair potential for lore building as well, if you want to go with the idea that Hogwarts has a history of employing strange or downright exotic people to teach subjects. I've run some D&D campaigns before where a college of magic or a school of wizards employed villains, intelligent monsters, or even outright evil creatures such as demons or vampires as faculty, with binding contracts, a geas, or other means of magical compulsion ensuring loyalty and acceptable behavior. Such a system could easily be said to have been put in place by the founders of Hogwarts, who may perhaps have felt that there was no reason dark lords, intelligent monsters, or wicked spirits could not serve as educational tools, as long as the defenses and enchantments of the castle were prepared to compel obedience and ensure a certain degree of minimum safety.

Dumbledore's reasons for potentially doing this are actually fairly numerous. While the Harry Potter version kind of has to take place in the sixth year/HBP timeline for it to be believable, as that's when he has the DA under his belt and is thus actually a real potential choice for being a professor (though you could still use the "Triwizard made me an adult so now I can do it" argument if you really wanted a 5th year Harry), the Voldemort one is not nearly so constrained. In fact, there's a really GOOD reason for Dumbledore to do such a thing in year 5. Namely, the Ministry is denying Voldemort's return and just tried to railroad Harry Potter into having his wand snapped and either sent to Azkaban or Obliviated for defending himself from Dementors and claiming Voldemort has returned.

So what better way to prove that Voldemort has indeed returned and that people need to begin preparing for a second war than to force Voldemort to appear and openly attend Hogwarts as a member of the faculty? The Ministry tries to assassinate Harry Potter, Dumbledore returns fire by hiring Voldemort to teach Defense.

Doing this disrupts Voldemort's plans. It drags Voldemort out into the open where everyone can see him. If done before the DoM battle, it proves to the world that Voldemort is really back. It forces Voldemort to put his plans on hold and spend two thirds of the year at Hogwarts. It surrounds Voldemort with powerful adult wizards who oppose him, inside a dangerous magical castle he does not control, that's staffed by hundreds of house elves, hundreds of ghosts, and thousands of portraits that would be watching his every move. He would go from being free and under the radar to front page news and under constant surveillance. Voldemort couldn't get away with picking his nose at Hogwarts without it being seen and reported. It would effectively destroy the Daily Prophet, and Fudge, and everyone associated with him. Unless they want to go even further off the deep end and claim it's a fake Voldemort (which they might, that could very well be an arc of the story). And Voldemort being employed to teach Defense would finally break the curse of Defense, meaning after that year Dumbledore could hire whoever he wanted and not be afraid of losing them to some sort of probability-defying clown accident.

What's the Ministry going to do, have Dumbledore removed for hiring Voldemort? When they just claimed Voldemort wasn't real? What's the board of governors doing to do, sack the only man Voldemort ever feared while Voldemort is inside the fucking school? What's Voldemort going to do? Get the Death Eaters to visit him in his office to plan their takeover of the world?

What the Ministry is going to do is damage control for themselves. What the board will do is nothing, because they can do nothing. And what Voldemort will do is teach the subject and try to sway the students into believing in his cause, because he's always wanted to teach the subject and made no secret about it, and because that's all he really /can/ do. And that's where the meat of the story is.

And perhaps most important of all, it's the most Dumbledore thing I could think of Dumbledore doing. Full stop. If employing Harry Potter as a Defense professor is a 9/10 on the Dumbledore scale of Dumbledore things to do, then just straight-up employing Voldemort is a 10/10. Not somebody possessed by Voldemort, not Voldemort in a disguise. Voldemort. That man. Get him in here and put a robe on him. These kid aren't going to teach themselves. Yes Minerva I know exactly what I'm doing, thank you for asking.


** "Mister Potter, could you please cast your Patronus for me? Excellent. Congratulations on achieving an O on your Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test for Defense Against the Dark Arts. Now, it seems you have a gap in your schedule where Defense would be, and I have a gap in my teaching staff where Defense would be."

"Professor, I'm 90% sure this is some sort of gross violation of ethics."

"Don't be silly, Mister Potter. We don't need ethics where we're going."

** He dueled Voldemort at full power and escaped. He cast a corporeal patronus and drove over a hundred dementors off Hogwarts grounds while evading a rampaging werewolf. He was forced to participate in the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and won, Harry Potter is a Triwizard Champion. He killed a thousand year old basilisk with a sword.

He did not duel Voldemort. The only reason he actually survived was because of the brother wand connection. Harry has never managed to beat Voldemort in a duel without having esoteric magic or someone else come to his age. His mother's love saved him in first year, the brother wand did in 4th, Dumbledore did in fifth, and Harry gaining ownership of the wand from Draco by chance did in seventh. The werewolf was nowhere near him when he cast the patronus. He stabbed the basilisk with a sword, but that is a testament to his courage, not his skill since he didn't even use magic to do so. He did manage to win the tournament, but his aptitude at flying got him through the first task, and Moody's suggestion of Gillyweed got him through the second. The only task in which he used a significant amount of magic was in the third task, and even then Moody sabotaged two other competitors and cleared out the more dangerous parts of the maze for Harry. He is certainly very good with the patronus, but that itself does not make him qualified to actually teach DADA. He was unable to do wordless magic, which is NEWT level, and he struggled a bit with the spells he learned in fourth year. He has the leadership skills to teach well as shown during DA meetings, but is not experienced enough to actually teach NEWT level classes. I also don't see how he would manage to break the curse. The curse affected good teachers such as Lupin and Crouch(He was evil, but no one can deny he was competent), so why would it not affect him?

Either way, the patronus is post-post-NEWT magic, it's canonically among the most difficult and complex magic a wizard can learn.

I have a hard time believing that's true, since Harry successfully managed to teach most of the DA how to cast a corporeal one. And there isn't any indication that tremendous magical talent is required to cast the patronus, Lupin only states that the memory must provoke a strong enough good emotion. This is clearly demonstrated when Harry failed to cast the patronus a couple of times during the final battle because he was thinking of the dead. It's not as if he was able to cast a patronus strong enough to repel hundreds of dementors every single time. So how does him being able to cast that somehow make him qualified enough to teach material part of which he himself struggled immensely with and never fully grasped?

*** This. Harry's mediocrity in magic is something of a major theme in HP. That such things as bravery, love and sacrifice overcome superior competence in magic. Harry would also have to abandon his education in other subjects as teaching would be a full time job.

***** Perhaps I should have clarified :

Is Harry a heroic badass? /Absolutely./

Is Harry the best seeker of his generation? /Totally/.

Is Harry a competent Teacher/Leader figure? /Of Course/.

Is Harry a magical genius who could take on a young Riddle or Dumbledore in a duel? /Hell No./

This is what I meant by /"magical mediocrity"/. He is certainly above most of his class by necessity but by no means can he win in a straight fight with a competent adult.The ability to cast a patronus does not depend on magical talent but willpower and mindset. There is a lot more to a wizard than his magical talent.

****** I feel like Harry could have been a magical genius in the right circumstances. It's too bad that JK didn't even take half the bloody prophecy seriously. "He will have power the Dark Lord knows not," last I checked he knew about the Elder Wand. "He will mark him as his equal," in what way is Harry his equal? It ain't magical power, or political power, or even physical power. Where is Harry in any way equal to Voldemort.

******* There are explications for both those parts of the prophecy.

“the power he knows not” is, according to Dumbledore, love. This is supported by the fact that Harry sacrificed himself to Voldemort in DH, which killed the horcrux and made Voldemort's curses have reduced effects. Voldemort would never be able to do that because he loves no one and would never sacrifice himself for anyone.

“He will mark him as his equal” comes from the attack on the Potters. Up until that point, the prophecy could have applied to either Harry or Neville, but Voldemort chose to go after Harry and in doing so conveyed that he thought Harry had the potential the /become/ his equal and defeat him.

That's just my (and Dumbledore's) take though.
