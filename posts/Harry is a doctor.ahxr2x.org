Hello. As the title says (and my previous topics), I'm searching for a particular fanfiction where Harry is a doctor in the US and he cures a little girl, Angela (or Ashley), I think. Some friends of his (I think the girl's parents), aurors in the US, get called to the UK to help solve a case or something. But the OoTP breaks into their rooms and kidnap somebody and Harry is forced to go to Grimmauld Place and rescue that person. Also, Harry is about to propose to his girlfriend/work colleague.


** You should change the tag for this post to "fic search", as you are looking for a particular fic.

"Discussion" tags are meant for talking with people about a topic, not hunting for a fic

As far as this search, I'm interested but can't help. It doesn't sound familiar, sorry :/

** I recognize this story and am pretty sure that I fav'ed it but I don't see it in my favs now. I looked for it recently. I want to say that he worked in a hospital in New York. It might have been an Avengers crossover. His fiancee is also a magical but they didn't know that before proposing or something.

*** That's the spot, they're both magical (again, not 101% sure, more like 99%).

​

In other words, the author might have deleted it?

***** I haven't seen it after my google sleuthing.

If anyone wants to try again I can try to give what I remember the plot to be:

Harry has moved on from the Wizarding world taking a different name (Evans?) and moving out of England (to the US? New York?). The story opens in a hospital when Harry comes out of a surgery that intended to remove cancer from a little girl (I think). Harry heads home before collapsing.

Later on his day off, Harry and his girlfriend go on a date before returning to Harry's flat. Harry proposes to his girlfriend, but says that he wants to talk about something (his fame/origin) before she commits. She expresses the same desire because she wants to tell him that she is a witch before they marry.

The following day (maybe) they confess to each other. Harry's girlfriend (idk her name) confesses that she is a witch, Harry laughs and is partially relived, but it takes time for her to understand that he is also a wizard. When Harry reveals who he is she faints.

Soon it is revealed that the kid in surgery at the beginning has gone into remission and celebrations are had.

Later, Harry's GF invites him to dinner with her parents who take it better than their daughter. The story ends (I think) halfway through dinner (IIRC).
