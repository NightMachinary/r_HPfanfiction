  Not all is as it seems in the life of Harry James Potter. Lily Potter was not the person everyone thought she was and her child pays the price. Some secrets are hidden under a thin layer of lies and sometimes we carry our prison with us.

** Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived: by Agnostics Puppet

Not femHarry/Fleur, but still pretty good fem Harry. Pretty weird premise but if you get past it then the story is pretty solid. Not the greatest ever, but it certainly isn't the worst either.

  Any other solid recommendations of Fem!Harry romances would be welcome as well.

They did provide OP with part of the request. Although, you are right that they didn't link it. Perhaps they simply don't know how?

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4040192/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Lived][here's]] the link: it's literally the very first result on google since OP gave both the title and the autor name with 100% accuracy.
