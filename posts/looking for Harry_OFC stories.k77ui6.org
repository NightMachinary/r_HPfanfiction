** The only two really good ones that I know that haven't been rec'ed already are Behind Blue Eyes and Madley in Love. The former has a Muggle!OC and the latter a Magical one.

Madley in Love is the story of a Ministry Tax Collector meeting, getting intrigued by, and slowly getting more involved with a sad Hermit Harry.

Behind Blue Eyes is one of the bleakest fucking fics I've ever read. It's great, and has some really fun moments within the endless gloominess, but egad I cannot emphasise just how utterly dismal and depressing a tone most of it takes. Definitely worth a read though - just make sure you're in the right headspace for something like that. :)

  Living a frugal life in a small cottage out in the middle of nowhere, is Harry Potter really who he seems? New recruit Laura Madley finds an odd file going through the tax records and begins to investigate. She doesn't know what to think, but something about him keeps pulling her back.

**** Fair. Everyone sees things differently. :)

Thinking about it, bleak is definitely a more appropriate word than depressing. Plus, for me, the bleakness was more of a tonal thing than anything dealt with directly in the narrative itself. Admittedly Harry spends most of the story trying to run away from that, but it very much was a thing I experienced when I read it.

** Well, the poster child of that would be "Grow Young With Me", but you probably already know that one since it gets recced every other thread. Deservedly so.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
