  Regulus Black survives his adventure in the cave and brings the locket to an unlikely ally: his estranged older brother. The ex-Death Eater strikes a bargain with Dumbledore, cooperation in exchange for his family's safety. Sirius Black is faced with his toughest mission yet: managing Walburga and Orion Black---who, to his surprise and dismay, decide they rather enjoy having both of their sons back, and very quickly scheme to make this temporary family reunion permanent.Or: the story of how one night completely changed the course of the war and Sirius's life.[AU of the First Wizarding War in which stealing part of Voldemort's soul brings a broken, dysfunctional family together - Winner of 2018 Shrieking Shack Society Silver Marauders Medal for Best Sirius Characterization]

  Christmas 1979---danger, secrets, lies and their shared history looms large over the Blacks' first Yuletide season as a reunited family. While life as a fugitive proves bleaker (and more boring) than Regulus could have imagined, a botched espionage mission at Malfoy Manor draws Sirius deeper into the Black family web---and his cousin Narcissa's social set.Meanwhile, Walburga hatches a daring scheme to restore her wild firstborn's damaged reputation in the family---finding him a suitable bride---while Orion grapples with the past, and the high price his two sons have paid for his inaction.[Regulus Black Lives/Black Family Witness Protection AU.

** Linkao3(9809804)

This whole series. About 20k with all the works so it isn't that long and I highly recommend to anyone. (I linked the first work) Just wow. It's kind of an open ending but it's hopeful.

Wolfstar fic, kinda smutty and angsty at times but I loved it. The characterization is great the relationships and motives of everyone are just so relatable. Can only recommend!

Basically Sirius Black gets spat out of the veil when Remus and Tonks are already married and this causes an lot of emotional turmoil.

  “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.

** A couple of fics I like: linkffn(9469064) linkao3(11914698) linkao3(13760487)

Innocent is a Sirius-raises-Harry fic that I love.

Renascentia is about both Sirius and Regulus and has chapters from both of their points of view.

The Dogfather is a very cute, fluffy fic, iirc.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.
