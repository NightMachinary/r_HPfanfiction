** If you are going to recommend something it wouldn't be a bad idea to give everyone a reason or two /why/ you are recommending it.

** Hi, this is the fic I've wrote, if you could take a look at give me feedback, that would be awesome. This is an AOC as I've mentionned, so if you liked Alexandra Quick, try mine! I can't promise you'll like it, but you can't know before you tried it!

*** Also, I have trouble understanding why people are downvoting my post. If someone could please explain to me why, that would help. I mean, If I'm breaking a rule of this sub, please tell me. But otherwise, I really don't see why anyone would downvote this.

**** It's a bit unfair for people to be downvoting you so dramatically, but here's my advice as to how you can avoid it happening again.

-This initially felt like a promotion, rather than feedback. If you're looking for feedback it's a good idea to ask for that in the name of the post.

-It's helpful to us if you say /why/ you're looking for feedback. Another thread further up says they're looking for feedback because it's their first piece of original writing. If I was looking for feedback here I might link to my latest fic and say that I was struggling to write a likeable original character. Someone else might say they're not sure they've got the right tone and may be looking for advice on how to improve that. Without any of this, it can feel like you're just trying to promote your own fic.
