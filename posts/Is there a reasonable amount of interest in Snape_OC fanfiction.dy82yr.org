Hi, all! I come to the wonderful HPfanction community as a supplicant (and a longtime lurker), with the hope that you guys might have an answer for me. Here's the dilemma. I've written a monster of a Snape/OC fanfic. It's nearly finished, and I've greatly enjoyed writing it, but I worry that there will be very little interest once I get around to posting it, or that it may attract more ridicule than constructive criticism. It was a labor of self-love. I'm not seeking validation, exactly, but I've used this story to help myself work out the lingering effects of past trauma, and though I'm proud of it, I'm terrified of ebmarrassing myself. I've worked diligently to avoid any traces of mary-sueing and to write both characters in a consistent, believable manner. I just can't shake the feeling that letting it out into the world might be a mistake. If no one really seeks out this type of fic, I'd rather never let it see the light of day. I suppose I'm just trying test the waters, so to speak. Any guidance on the subject would be greatly appreciated.


** I read almost exclusively SS fics. This includes the occasional SS/OC.

I don't read slash, though, meaning that the fics I read usually end up being either gen, LESS, SSHG or (somewhat more rarely since there's not as many fics of this) SSOC.

I could definitely see myself read your fic, depending on what it is more exactly. I do have a habit of paying somewhat close attention to the most recent fic list on FFN filtered by having SS as one of the characters.

** I'd say that in a fandom this big, there's an audience for almost anything. And Snape isn't even a fringe character. So while I don't personally like to read Snape fics, my guess is that there are definitely people out there who'd be interested.

To your point about anxiety regarding putting the fic out there- yes, you might get mean comments. You have to prepare for the possibility when you put anything out there.

But honestly, I'm of the mind that if you put so much work into something, why let it get dusty on your hard drive? If you publish it, there's at least a chance that someone will read and enjoy your work.

And if you're proud of it, who cares what an Internet stranger says about it. Especially one who doesn't have the decency to be respectful in their comments.

The flip side is, you might get great constructive criticism from time to time that'll actually help you improve. Again, your writing isn't gonna get any better hidden in your hard drive.

You can always take it down if the anxiety and pressure of posting is too much for you.

So this whole novella to say, I bet there's an audience out there and I vote that you give it a shot and good luck!

*** Thanks for your kind and very helpful comment! I think you're right about it being a waste to keep it under my hat, especially if I intend to improve, as much as I've been agonizing over it.

** I like Snape character study and I don't like pairing Snape with anyone in canon except maybe Sirius so yes.

You may have better luck with giving your OC a canon character's name where that canon character has no details, such as Aurora Sinistra or whoever fits best with your vision. Someone did this with Daphne Green grass once upon a time and now people seem to think of her as her own character.

I'm sorry to say you're going to get people being mean if you post it, but also people being nice, and the ratio might be down to luck rather than quality.

I say post it, you've already done the hard part.

*** Thanks for the advice! The examination and further development of Snape's character and inner life was the most enjoyable part about writing this fic, so I relate. The OC has her own distinct identity that doesn't align with current canon characters as far as I'm aware, so I'm probably just going to have to bite the bullet and just throw the damn thing out there. Hopefully it won't be too badly received.

*** Thanks! AO3 looks to be the best place for it, I think, given that it will contain some explicit scenes. I'm going to have to take a while to finish editing and have it beta read, but I'll make sure to come by here and promote it when it's finished! :)

** I really enjoy Snape/OC fics. I wish there were more fics about professors lives outside of school. I think because we read from Harry's POV we never hear of professors lives and it's not like they are all consumed by school or the war at all times. I'm sure they have families ambitions friends who are outside of the school. I enjoy snape with oc or any fic that shows professors are more than their job. They are human after all.

** I read Snape/OC occasionally, I'd certainly be interested depending on other features in it. OMC or OFC?

*** OFC. It's heavy on the plot, middling on the smut, and centers around the discovery of some very arcane magic.

** The only way you will know is to post it. Snape is a popular character (not on reddit, but in the wider fandom he is). You will probably do ok but don't build your hopes on it. Be warned: it can hurt if your fic doesn't get any attention. I wish someone had told me that five years ago.

*** That's some very useful insight. It's my first fic, though I've been writing original works for years now. Fandom culture is so hypercritical at times that dipping my toes into writing fanfic (especially with an OC) feels kind of daunting.

** Hi, just came across this post. I would definitely read an SS/OC fanfiction. Can you please post the link of your fic if you decide to share it? Good luck!

** My opinion is based on what I prefer of characters in fanfics. Snape is either s dead man very quickly, or quietly respects the main character (usually Harry). I... dislike... snape ships. That is my opinion, so feel free to rip it to shreds with your righteous "Snape is a redeemable Lily-loving GOD" rants. Lots of love, a casual snape hater.

*** I don't intend to rip your opinion to shreds. I respect it, as you're entitled to that much. To clearify, I'm not laboring under any illusions about Snape being some sort of saint. He's done terrible things. He is a deeply flawed individual, with lots of grey area to his character, but not unredeemable, I think. After all, the author herself redeemed him eventually. It's perfectly fine that you don't like him. I have to admit though, that I'm a little confused as to why you jumped on my post expecting me to attack you. I was just looking for advice.

**** I dont expect attacks, but have met some... avid? No more lusting snarry supporters. /shudders/ Thanks for respecting my opinion, the sentiment is returned. Jkr redeems snape, i know. That doesnt mean i have to like it. He is the curveball. The one character that harry almost hates more than peter or tommy. I like that fanfics have changed how snape is viewed. I like that sometimes he is good, and sometimes bad. Anyway, thanks for the reply, I have enjoyed browsing your corner of reddit a lot. Btw, its clarify not clearify, but that probably makes me a hypocrite with my spelling. Lol

**** Second reply: I am really glad that you wrote your fic. It is something that i know ibwould find very difficult. I can sort of understand the fear of rejection. Dont worry. Put it out there and be proud. Read the hate comments and try to see their PoV. If it is blind hate, ignore and move on. Appreciate your true fans and bask in the knowledge that you are more of a part of the HPU than any passive reader( like me). Despite my dislike for snape fics, and slash in general, i would love the chance to read your fic if you decide to put it out there. Good luck, and whatever you chose to do, i am sure it will be right for you.
