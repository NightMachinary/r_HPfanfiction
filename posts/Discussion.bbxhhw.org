Needing some help for a fic im writing. What do you think happens to a house elf when they die? Would they be buried, like Dobby, is there an elf grave yard? Thinking particularly of Kreacher. Any help appreciated TIA


** Well Kreacher wanted his head mounted on a wall, so I imagine, like humans, there's a lot of variance and preferences when it comes to funerals. Whether the house elf's wishes are taken into consideration or not probably depends on the family they work for.

** Depends on what kind of relationship the owner had with the elf.

Hate -> vanish the remains, burn them in the fireplace, harvest them for potion ingredients

Neutral -> let other / new house elf deal with the remains, just put them out somewhere in nature

Love -> burial à la Dobby, mounted like a stuffed animal (some people do this with pets)

​

For Kreacher: he wanted his head mounted on the wall, so he wants to be part of the family even in death. So you could say his head is mounted on the wall and his body burned on the Black family cemetery and his ashes used on their graves or something.

** Honestly think most wizards would just vanish the remains and go buy another one. Cruelty through indifference was more the status quo amongst the elite purebloods, rather than the extremist brutal cruelty of the Black family or kindness of Harry.
