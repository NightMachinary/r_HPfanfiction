...Basically the snarkiest Harry to ever be seen in fanfic?


** I think I remember this one... Didn't Harry call Draco a troll and then the whole school referred to Draco, Crabbe and Goyle as The Trolls? And everyone called Harry's friends 'Potter's Gang' or something.

*** Mm, I googled that. I found it in Weasley Girl. A really good fic (and its sequel too), but I don't think it's quite it. Thanks for reminding me to re-read it though.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED
