:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello! I have been searching for a fic on and off for over a year without success, I was wondering if anyone here knew what I was talking about and where it is,

It was a marauders era fic. A few of the big moments from it where instead of just Snape going to the Shrieking Shack it was him, Lily, I think two other girls and their boyfriends. Then Remus attacked them. I remember one girl got turned into a werewolf and I think the other lost her hand.

Remus was sent to Azkaban and Potter and Black were expelled. Black had a marriage arranged with some French pureblood witch and was immediately MIA and Potter campaigned to get Remus released and became a professional Quidditch player but kept getting kicked off of every team he joined.

I can find no trace that this fic ever existed and would very much appreciate any help offered. Thank you :)
