The premise was that Harry learned muggle magic tricks before Hogwarts, and when he demonstrates it the wizarding world becomes convinced that Harry is the greatest sorcerer of all time.

  A sickle from behind my ear!? But that violates Gamps Xth Law of elemental conjuration!

Et cetera.

I haven't read any of it yet, but it seems like it might be it.

** I did two searches on ff.net for "muggle magician" and "muggle magic" and filtered for Harry P., 5K+ words, and English language but did not find any fics that seemed to match your description. The first search returned 11 results and the second 254 so they didn't take all that long to comb through, but it's possible I might have missed it on the second set of search parameters.

Do you remember anything else about it? Length? Rating? Pairing (if any)? It sounds like an interesting idea.

** After googling I found this guy: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2620084/willyolioleo]], who posted

"Writing Challenge! I'm putting this idea up because I haven't seen any fanfics that use it and I'll have a hard time incorporating it into the current story I'm working on.

Harry Potter learns muggle magic before attending Hogwarts.

- That's the basic premise. Harry has learned muggle magic tricks, and thinks that Hogwarts itself is just another school for magic where he'll learn some more card tricks and stage magic when he first receives his letter.

Other conditions:

- Harry ran away from home early, abandoning the Dursleys because of the abuse.

- He lived on the streets for a while, learning basics of sleight-of-hand while pickpocketing.

- He learned to earn more honest money by performing magic tricks on the streets in the afternoons and evenings. (not during the day when adults would ask why he's not in school)

- Most of the "magic" he knows is much street magic and table magic: i.e. small tricks with very little setup and equipment required- mostly card, coin, cups-and-balls, that sort of stuff.

- After arriving at Hogwarts, students and professors alike mistake his skills for wandless conjuration/vanishing/transfiguration. He even breaks a few laws of magic by "conjuring" food and money. He ends up accidentally earning a reputation of being the most powerful wizard ever.

- However he defeats Voldemort, it's more through trickery than through actual magic.

- You can ignore the horcruxes if you'd like."

That sounds exactly like the fic OP mentioned, so I PM'd the user who posted the challenge. He hasn't been active since 2011 though, so I'm not sure he'll respond.

This is Lord Voldemort as an illusionist. Not the fic you were looking for, but this one is worth reading.
