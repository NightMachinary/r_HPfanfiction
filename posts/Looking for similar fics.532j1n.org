Hey guys, so i recently finished The First Day ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day]]) and I was wondering if anyone had suggestions for fics that run in a similar vein. i.e. fics that pick up right after the final battle but that deal with Harry and everyone else not immediately finding happiness and having to deal with their emotional problems. Most of the fics I've read have everyone getting back to normal relatively quickly but I enjoyed the darker, more depressed narrative in The first Day and how much longer it takes for Harry to forgive himself. Am also looking for stories with canon pairings preferably having the story focused on Harry/Ginny, no Harry/Hermoine or anything like that. I also prefer longer fics preferably more than 60k words. Thanks Guys

  The Battle of Hogwarts is over. The following day Harry wakes to a changed world, to a future he did not think he would have. This is a story about those first days after the battle. Days of mourning and funerals. Grave Days.

  Harry considers the future of the House of Potter. Andromeda considers the past of the House of Black. Teddy is where they collide. It isn't always pretty. Immediately after Deathly Hallows and continuing through that summer. Complete!
