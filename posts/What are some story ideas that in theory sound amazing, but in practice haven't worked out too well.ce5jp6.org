By this I mean they have a good premise but the whole work itself isn't as good as it was mad out to be, either due to authorial issues, the idea just wasn't expanded on, etc. Stuff like that.


** Peaceful Wizarding World AU's, or the AU where everyone's parents are alive because they haven't spent the last 20 years fighting a war against Death Eaters and Voldemort.

The problem with this is:

- *One* - the author has to figure out what to do with Voldemort. In some, Dumbledore helped him become a less evil person instead of writing him off at age 11. Or Voldemort becomes a politician, Minister for Magic, peaceful revolutionist, or healer. Whatever it is, Voldemort needs a /believable/ backstory to get the premise off the ground, because I can't buy "Oh, Voldemort just fucked off out of Britain and lived in Albania for the rest of his life."

- *Two* - the author has to come up with new personalities of characters who haven't gone through war. Lily and James, who died before we ever saw much of them in canon. Sirius who never went to Azkaban, Remus who never put himself through seclusion, and Peter who never went traitor, and everyone still thinks he's a swell guy. Things start to crack if the author inserts stuff from canon, without it having a justification in the story. It makes no sense for James to doubt Peter if there was no Voldemort threat, but I've seen a lot of fics where Peter's treated like a punching bag because people (authors and readers) just don't like him.

- *Three* - the author has to do their own worldbuilding and introduce their own conflicts. This is where the cracks really start to show. In an Everyone Lives AU, when the story starts to follow the stations of canon, it's your first sign of red flags. Harry speaking Parseltongue (WHY??), Snape working at Hogwarts, Dumbledore hiding the Philosopher's Stone in the castle in first year. A well thought-out alternate universe doesn't follow canon for arbitrary reasons. It should follow a logical sequence of cause and effect. A well-written AU should introduce conflict, tension, and stakes to the story without having to copy-paste the canon stations.

Some authors who just want to write a happy fic where Harry isn't an orphan, but outside of the main characters, the setting itself is full of holes and makes the story hard to enjoy.

This is often my number one reason for dropping AU fics in which the first war never happened or ended differently. It's not plausible to me that anyone in their right mind would keep Snape on as a teacher for young children without the ulterior motives in canon that prevented him from getting a more suitable job elsewhere. "Prince of the Dark Kingdom" springs to mind as a prime example of this fallacy.

I've read a few AU fics that changed his role at Hogwarts to make it more plausible. For example, in one fic he only taught the Newt level students while a different teacher handled the younger years. Another fic had it that his primary reason for being on the Hogwarts staff was for the school to fund and benefit from the prestige of his potion innovations, and his teaching involvement was minnimal.

That's why I hate the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498]["Boy with a Scar"]] series so much. I can't get over how slavishly it follows the stations for inexplicable reasons, even though I know it's well written and I normally like fics with that kind of poignant, emotive prose style.

The mandatory use of stations is so bad that /every single fic/ in the series blends together into one monotonous flavor, with the same ending each time. What's the point of having interesting premises or AU's if the end is just a rehash of canon? For example, in BwaS series, Sirius dies in the DoM in multiple timelines, which in the books was a result of an unfortunate - but /unique/ - set of circumstances involving Kreacher, Snape, Buckbeak, and Umbridge.

**** If the first war doesn't happen, why would he still become his canon unpleasant self? A big part of this is a side effect of his interaction with junion Death Eaters and the Marauder bullying, none of which has reason to have nearly as big of a presence with no Voldemort around.

***** The fic would need to explain that the bullying by the Marauders never happened in the AU world, because it's not something I would assume just because Voldemort never tried to rise to power. Prejudice against muggleborns existed even before a Dark Lord came to stoke the flames, and Sirius and James taunted Snape for plenty of other attributes beyond just thinking he's a junior deatheater.

But even if the bullying never happened, Snape's personality was shaped by many other factors, such as his relationship with his muggle father and pureblood mother, his fascination with the dark arts, and his pride in his skill as a potions master.

I tend to equate having a Potions Mastery to be like having a Doctorate in chemistry. Most doctors of chemistry do not waste their skills teaching chemistry to 11 year old kids. Instead, they would most likely get a higher valued job conducting research for an institute or corporation. Snape clearly thinks his skills are wasted on teaching kids in canon, so an AU fic would need to explain why that aspect of his personality has changed.

*** There's also the matter that a lack of Voldemort would completely change the 1970s dynamics between Gryffindor and Slytherin, completely changing the lives of Sirius (no Voldemort-supporting parents -- will the fact that they're less extreme make Sirius more willing to align with their views, paradoxally making him a bigger blood purist and a Slytherin?), Remus (who is unlikely to still become a werewolf), Peter (who can't turn traitor because Voldemort isn't around), Severus (who isn't going to join any Death Eaters) and Harry (who might not even exist). So a fic set in the 1990s without a Voldemort would need to come up with reasonable backstories for those characters at the very least.

** "Harry raised by [insert crossover character here]" hardly ever goes anywhere interesting.

Mostly these stories just serve as an excuse to rewrite Harry as a "cooler" and more "badass" character, with more advantages than in canon... usually they include quite a bit of Dumbledore-bashing as well, because Harry raised by [insert crossover character here] is much too cool to take any crap or let himself be manipulated.

And the crossover characters are hardly ever used well either. They are in the beginning of the story to show how much better off Harry is than in canon, and then usually vanish when Harry goes to Hogwarts and badly rehashes the canon plots. At most, they show up when he goes home for the holidays or maybe they send a letter or two, but they conveniently don't have any real influence on the actual plot because then the writer would have to actually think up a new plot.

** I completely agree with the 2 others posted here.

The "Harry raised by someone else" does seem to fail fairly consistently, with Sirius Black ones seeming to be the most promising and likable.

And...

The "Peaceful Wizarding World AU's with alive parents", which for some reason always gets hung up on stupid elements and bogged down by its own development. Perhaps they are often just too divergent from the basic structure of the original HP stories? Perhaps the world-building is just too difficult for most casual fan fic writers? I honestly don't know...

--------------

However, I will add a third...

--------------

The "unusual magical world creatures/races" fan fictions.

I am thinking things like fairy worlds, and Fae, and demons, and other unusual creatures and magical worlds. I mean, it's the Wizarding world, right? The Forbidden forest and other places in it hold so many interesting mysteries and we see so much unusual potential in care of magical creatures class and beyond.... and yet...

Somehow the potential for interesting stories dealing with such unusual magical races and creatures and the world they are a part of always seems to fall flat on its face in practice. They often become stupid, silly, annoying, and just downright bad.

** I'm always interested in 'Harry Raised by Someone Else' Trope; either by Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore, or even a random muggle. But I never see one where the execution is exceptional.

There are some good ones; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/1/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic]] shows how Harry's deduction skill grows over time and how it affect his time at Hogwarts, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12276084/1/Faultlines][Faultlines]] explores his relationship with Tony and how it affects Harry's future family, the first part of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4062601/1/The-Wise-One-Book-One-Becoming][The Wise One]] is an amazing story of Harry-Sirius travels around the world. But I never see the one fanfiction which I will recommend to everyone that ask for this trope. I won't hestitate to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]] for post-war and next-gen stuff, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][Sum of Their Parts]] for 'dark'!Harry and trio bonding, or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] for dimensional travel; but I don't think I can recommend any 'Harry Raised by Someone Else' fanfiction without some negative comment.

I understand it's really hard to write. How to keep Harry's character from canon and how much will the new parents influence him? Can the author came up with another interesting group of friends for Harry? If not, can they make the interaction between the trio interesting? Not to mention that the author should came up with an original plot idea because we don't really want to read another 200k word rewrite of canon.

Of course the author must wrap everything up within a reasonable length.

If you have any recommendation, I'm always interested.

It is a really good story with great worldbuilding, characters, and plot. I'm just disappointed that the author haven't explore how Harry interact with his guardian, how his guardian affect him, and how he affect his guardian.

I hardly sees it as Harry Raised by Someone else.
