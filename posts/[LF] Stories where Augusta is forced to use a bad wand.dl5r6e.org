I don't think I have ever seen a story where someone forces Augusta Longbottom to use and/or fight with a mismatched wand, just to hammer home how much she messed up Neville's upbringing..

Does that exist anywhere?


** I write a Neville centric fic and I really want to use this now haha I already know exactly where to put the scene.
