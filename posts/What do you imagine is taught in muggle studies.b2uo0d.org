Not what should be taught, but what is actually taught.


** How muggles have electickety, smelly metal wagons, enjoy throwing balls around, eat pumpkins instead of turning them into juice, and are ruled by a queen. If you have ever taken a foreign language beginner's class where the textbook shows what common foods people in other countries eat, and what kind of hobbies they have, it's like that.

It's seems way more realistic for a school class than teaching the students how to buy an Oyster card and watch Star Wars at the cinema, which is what I've seen in way too many Mugglewank fics.

Exactly. If you really want to hammer the crap out of pureblood pretension, you sneer at what a cultural desert the wizarding world is. The whole of magical britain has one (1) amateur theatre, roughly the provision for a backwater hick town in non-magical Britain. Hardly any art that isn't bog-standard portraiture or the kind of still-life that you set students to let them learn. Opera entirely non-existent. Economically so illierate they're still on the /gold standard/ for crying out loud, who even /does/ that in this day and age? Only to be expected, one supposes, for a people who still think millionaires are truly rich.

tl, dr; you don't put snobs in their place by having better toys than them. Sneer at them where they /live/.

****** I don't think wizards would take insult about where they live, especially not from Harry who lived in a muggle cupboard for 10 years of his life. The Weasleys (and by extension, the Lovegoods and Diggories) live on the outskirts of a rural village in Devon. The Burrow is a literal farmhouse and Molly even grows her own vegetables and chickens.

With magical travel being instantaneous teleportation, distinctions between rural and urban would be meaningless to them. It would probably be a mark of social status in wizard culture to own land with plenty of space and privacy, compared to, say, owning a flat in Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade.

Non-gold based currency might be faked by magic. And they might only have one amateur theatre because the population is so small they only need one (and with magical enhancements, that one theatre might be able to fit a ridiculous number of people inside). And perhaps still life paintings are better suited for the magic at bring them to life.

It would probably be trivial to magic up bank notes.\\
Besides the issues with gold standard came down to quantity and transportation, there are few enough wizards that they clearly have no issues with running out of gold coins and carrying piles of gold is much easier when your bag is bigger on the inside and charmed feather light.

Apparition and the Floo make living in the countryside just as convenient as any city, only in the countryside you can have large gardens, don't have to worry about the neighbours spotting you doing magic and, if you've got the wealth, you can have a proper stately home style mansion and grounds to truly live in luxury.

** I honestly believe that the muggle studies class teaches useful and up to date knowledge of muggles(technology, clothes, difference in behavior and probably some inclusion of muggle arts,music and literature ), and because of what we know of Charity Burbage I also believe that it wasn't even that biased.

I believe the class itself is just not popular when the alternatives are ways to predict the future, caring about cool creatures like Hippogriffs and unicorns, or even something like learning a new language.

Like I believe that Kingsley or most obliviators probably took the class, but Arthur Weasley for example didn't.

***** There's a theory I saw somewhere, where essentially Arthur's muggle love started after he began working at the Ministry, probably when he got transferred/promoted into the Misuse department. Likely after Bill and Charlie's births, and around the same time as Percy or the Twins, but before Ron's, iirc.

Basically the idea is that Arthur was starting his career as 'generic ministry official' while Molly stayed at home. Arthur would bounce between departments, with the goal of getting promotions or moving to more prestigious positions. Misuse of muggle artifacts was just another step- it's small and underfunded, so they'll give department head to a junior colleague, which is a nice feather in his cap for when he wants to move on.

Except Arthur found that he /loved/ it. He wanted to stay in that job forever. He wanted to mess around with muggle stuff all the time, at home. Now, Molly doesn't hate muggles, but she's not a super duper fan, especially when it derails their life plan. But anyway, she'll /mostly/ support Arthur- except that his muggle tinkerings have been banished from the house to the shed. But now Arthur is distant and separated, so Molly becomes overbearing and demanding with the children. It could explain some of the Weasley children's dynamics but I'm not gonna get into that.

I remember reading another theory that when Arthur got placed in the Misuse department was when the muggle-baiting really got kicked up a notch. Since the department was so understaffed he put in a lot of overtime hours. This lead to him becoming the department head and how the Weasley's could be such a large family with only one breadwinner.

The class is only useful if you have a special interest in muggles or plan to regularly interact with muggles, the majority of students probably have neither. Not to mention that most of them live near muggles and have muggle or muggleborn relatives and probably know enough to not to draw to much attention for the few times they would have to interact with muggles.

** Whatever it covers, I think it's reasonably accurate and up to date. I say this because Hermione took the class in third year and never once voiced a complaint about the course material, which I think she absolutely would have if it was significantly wrong or behind the times.

She also scored in excess of 300% on the final exam, but I'm not certain what conclusions can be drawn from that since taking a test on a culture you've had full immersion in for upwards of a decade isn't exactly difficult. Although the fact that she did so despite being only 14 (and thus missing pretty much all the adult life experience) suggests that the third year material, at least, doesn't go into excessive detail.

** Well clearly it isn't the function of a rubber duck.

But really though, it's likely to cover general muggle things, such as:

1.) The currency system (cash, coin, check, and credit), perhaps the concepts of bank differences (You mean they don't have anything guarding their money besides locks and other muggles?!).

2.) Transportation/communication, with the focus on popular methods in Britain like the underground or taxis (Do wizards have taxis since they have equivalent buses?) and communication methods like the telephone/TV.

3.) A bit of muggle history, again Britain focused. I.e. The British Muggle Empire (Was there a magical equivalent?), WW2, the monarchy, etc.

4.) Entertainment! At least muggle plays, records, books. (What if a muggle born or half-blood painter, knowing the restrictions of using electric items in high-magic areas, recreated famous muggle movie scenes via paintings?!)

5.) Muggle foods, like burgers, fries, curry, tacos. Not quite sure what 80s British fast food was like, but something like that that most wizards without muggle contact wouldn't have tried before.

I got a bit carried away, but I think the main thing a Muggle Studies professor would want to stress is that they're all people deserving of respect and that it's a cultural difference just like any other part of the world would be. Perhaps a mention of Amish or Mennonites as an example of different cultures within the muggle world itself.

Either way, this was a fun creative exercise for me, and I'd be interested to read others' thoughts.

(And please excuse any odd typo as I'm using mobile right now. I've had to correct Google keyboard's autocorrect a few times.)

Years 3, 4, and 5 would be geared more towards dispelling bigoted myths about muggles. Simply having such a comprehensive class wouldn't be enough to dispel bigotry among purebloods, because pureblood parents could object to their children taking the class.

Well, that's just not true. The class had an essay on why muggles needed electricity, and as electricity only became widespread in the early 1900s and that even then it wasn't a particular necessity like it was later, that hints they learn about relatively recent things. We really don't know enough about it to say it doesn't teach current muggle culture, technology, politics, etc.
