Every so often, an author will run out of creative names or events and be forced to sub in one from memory. Sometimes, a reader will be familiar with the origin of said people/events and think to himself - hey, I know where he got this from, and laugh. What are yours?

Eg. I once read a quidditch fic where the author had to make up names for players and ended up picking a bunch of German and polish soccer players to make the team sound believable.\\
Volkov - zograf - levski - Lewandowski - Sczezsny - Muller - Klose Or something similar


** One story long ago had the goblins reference Gork and Mork which are Ork gods in the warhammer mythology

** I wrote a Next Gen fic recently and in it I dropped a reference to one of the actors in GoF...by naming their characters son with the actors first name...

Nobody has picked it up yet...

** Considering both Zograf and Levski are not even last names, but rather nicknames, the list seems rather ridiculous.
