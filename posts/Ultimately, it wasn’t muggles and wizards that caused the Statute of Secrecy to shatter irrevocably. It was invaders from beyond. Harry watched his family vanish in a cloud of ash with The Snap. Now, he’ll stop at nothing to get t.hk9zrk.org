#+TITLE: Ultimately, it wasn’t muggles and wizards that caused the Statute of Secrecy to shatter irrevocably. It was invaders from beyond. Harry watched his family vanish in a cloud of ash with The Snap. Now, he’ll stop at nothing to get them back and destroy those that took them from him.

** “Call control; code red.”

“Nick!”

Nick Fury stared at his lieutenant for a second as she evaporated into dust, then ran for the car. He pushed aside another bystander, yanking open the door.

His hands darted into his ready bag, pulling out a scrap of parchment and a green quill.

Staggering against the back of the car, Nick began to scrawl rapidly.

He paused, the quill falling away to the ground. His hand was evaporating. “Oh no.”

Quickly, he used his right hand to smear the ink into the right shape. The last thing he saw was the owl staring at him from atop a nearby streetlight.

The parchment fell.

It fluttered left, then right.

And then the owl caught it.

And went through him.

** Not quite the same (The Snap is ultimately prevented, though other events do happen and do cause Harry to lose his cool), but the prompt /heavily/ reminds me of Heroes Assemble: linkffn(12307781)

Harry moves to New York, where the events of Avengers(2012) cause Harry to become an Avenger. Over time the Statute gets more and more frayed as more threats show up that need Harry's (and later Teddy's) intervention - and Harry loses a fair few members of his chosen family. By the end of what the events of Infinity War/Endgame turn into, the Statute is entirely on its way out.

#+begin_quote
  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.
