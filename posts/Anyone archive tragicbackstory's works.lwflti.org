A few years back there was an author on hpfanficarchive named tragicbackstory. They wrote mostly smut, and pretty strange smut at that. They stopped writing and deleted all their stories, but I enjoyed them and would like the ability to reread them, specifically mind over matter, but I'll take what I can get. Anyone here happen to save a copy when they existed? I tried the internet archive but I couldn't manage to reach the stories on it.
