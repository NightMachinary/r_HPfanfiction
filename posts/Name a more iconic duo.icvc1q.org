***** The same reason that some witches or wizards see themselves as Dark, some even going as far as calling themselves Dark Lords. Realistically, JK came with that because she was writing a children's story where the villains needed to be clearly identified as evil. That she later went back and re-wrote some of the villains for a more mature reader is another story.

My headcanon explanation though, is that the magical community defines Light magic as the healing one and the Dark magic as the harmful one (quite like in folklore). No person that doesn't want to get ostracized by the magical community would call themselves Dark. But if you genuinely think that what you are doing is good and the end justifies the means (like Grindelwald) or claim to do so (like Voldemort), you might use the title of Dark Lord to warn people that you're willing to harm them if they stand in your way.

***** I like to simplify it down in my headcanon. For my fics, you're just born either light or dark. It's genetic, but changes over the course of a decade or so if you go extreme into the opposite.

Makes it a hell of a lot simpler, plus has the added benefit of writing how everyone looks weirdly at the Greengrasses because, with that in the fic, you literally /can't/ be gray.

**** Honestly the ones where Voldemort is the good guy and Dumbledore is evil are the only ones I find are actually typically good. Even when Dumbledore's evil people still portray him as wicked smart and when Voldemort is a MC then authors want him to look good, so we have two very smart actually decent characters. Intelligent evil Voldemort is sooooo hard to find. And I completely get it about how Harry is just an unbeatable god that doesn't do anything special but wins anyway. One of the best stories I read had Harry actually lose his arm in battle. It showed that Voldemort and co was evil and not afraid to torture kids and it showed that Harry wasn't unbeatable and it made him more relatable in a way though that chapter was so hard to read.

*********** Taure just likes to analyze stuff with canon in mind. For some reason, people really don't like discussions on their request posts so I guess that is the cause of hate? Idk I haven't seen others hate on Taure before. I think discussion should totally be allowed on request posts.

But that's just my personal thoughts and nothing to do with you so I'll just leave you in peace. Just didn't want you to have a completely biased first impression.

************ My problem with them is that they come into speculation posts and essentially portray either their own interpretation of things as indisputable fact, or they come into request threads and then list reasons as to why it wouldn't work.

The problem with the first is that your thoughts are /irrelevant/. In a speculation post, you discuss with the OP, not say they are wrong and propose your own headcanon as superior. If you want to do that, then make your own post. It doesn't matter if you have canon sources for parts of your HC, the post is not about you.

The problem with the second is similar: The OP is clearly requesting something specific. It doesn't matter one iota if their request is compliant with canon! If I request Malfoy and Harry as ballerinas then a comment saying "actually Malfoy would never become a ballerina because bla bla bla canon reference" isn't appreciated. /I know/ he would never be a ballerina. But I am requesting it anyway.

In general, the fault in both of these is that he sees himself as some sort of arbiter for what HCs should be acceptable or not, and then lambasts anyone who is contradictory to his interpretation of things in an incredibly arrogant way.

************* I guess I just don't have the same views on the ownership of a post. I consider it just a first message in a conversation while you seem to consider the OP's thoughts and feelings as the ultimate dictator of discussion. If I held the latter view then I can see your arguments but I obviously don't so that doesn't really mean anything. Regardless of what either of us believe though, now any future reader would have both sides of the argument presented and that's enough for me.

About arrogance and tone of a message, I have never felt that way from a Taure post but that's extremely subjective so it again doesn't really mean anything. Hopefully I managed to convey a calm and non-argumentative tone but maybe I didn't and you were reading it in a angry tone. We can all just try our best.

************** About the arrogance - I wrote a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g6uvbm/the_depths_of_transfiguration/][post]] about 3 months ago about the possibilities for transfiguration in stories beyond "and then he brought a statue to life, whoop de doo". It didn't really do all that well, but Taure still made a comment there, read it for yourself.

The entire thing just screams condescension at me. Like he was thinking "heh, what an idiot. Here comes my correct opinion". Then he starts what amounts to a rant about how superior his own opinion is.

The worst thing is that I agree with him. The comment's message is true, but just the way he says it leaves a foul taste in my mouth. Not to mention that he completely misinterprets a few things as "scientific" or "physics and chemistry" (such as Order, Chaos, Structure, Entropy, etc), and implies that the notion of energy, space and reality can't be made magical.

The entire comment serves only to portray his own interpretation of HP magic as the one true way instead of actual speculation or discussion based on what I said, which is why I didn't respond to it.

*************** Here's my quick 1-minute read take on it.

You were explicitly stating "we know" that money and food cannot be transfigured, and the only way for all of us to "know" something is if it came from canon. I don't think pointing that out was unreasonable.

Taure is a writer, and as writers we all learn to read deeper into texts than just the information being conveyed. Taure pointed out an inconsistency in your worldbuilding style. It's not necessary for feeling-related and emotional worldbuilding to be unscientific but there is a certain expectation. The same as the dismay many express over how 'The power of love' isn't very logical. This one I can definitely see your grievance with, though. Even if noticed, you neither asked for it nor was it particularly important to the discussion.

I don't think explaining your way of thinking is antithesis to speculation or discussion. The current discussion we're having is just both of us trying to convey our thoughts on the matter. Just because you're already familiar with Taure's thoughts before the discussion by other means doesn't mean Taure is repeating this information to be condescending. I don't see any attempt to lord Taure's thoughts over everyone else. Its just how Taure considers it should be thought of as, not that it has to be thought of that way.

********* Wait, really? They're so bloody prolific, I thought there was more material by them. I should have probably formatted the comment better so not as to imply all of their (nonexistent) other work was mediocre. It seems like they became an established author incredibly quickly.

Honestly, I'll even say that VP is incredibly well written, the magic and everything is great, but I am not exactly "gripped" by the plot, to put it mildly. I feel like it was shaping up to be just another bland lordship/pureblood culture fic with little variation when I dropped it, even though a lot of the rest was great. It just felt like Taure was putting the actually interesting things on hold constantly, or even glossing over them, to focus on the boring parts instead.

*** First one though is pretty fucking Canon, though I can certainly understand your point. The last is just cliche at this point, also I mean arguably if she is ever shifting could she even have a "base" or "true" form? For all we know, her regular form is a reflection of her personality that her magic subconsciously maintains. Also, I mean I wouldn't be surprised if Seers have different ways instead of just the obvious so you couldn't compare the two. I can see the Gringotts one actually being a thing seeing as it's basically a foreign country, which normally don't take threats or such well. I do think that inheritance tests and such are way too overdone. Especially where you can apparently block off certain types, like "defensive magic." Fucking bullshit you can.

** When it comes to fan fiction those two apparently have about as many titles and appellations as Harry and Dumbledore do in canon. Most of them may not stick but they ARE apparently that well known.
