I've been reading the Slytherin!Harry series by DrizzleWizzle, just caught up with his writing and realised it's on hiatus /heartbreak/

Would really appreciate recommendations for complete Slytherin Harry fics/series'. Cheers.


** The Lionsnake Chronicles By Eria are really good, unfortunately they only go up to 4th year. The fifth book is started but has been updated in at least a year.

*** I found it got kind of rough after Book 3. Book 4 was pretty weak. 1 & 2 are worth a read though.
