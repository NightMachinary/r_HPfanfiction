I've recently been reading Kurinoone's fanfic ‚Äòthe darkness within' and I've gotta say, it's somehow simultaneously amazing and terrible. There's really no other way to describe it.

I mean the prose is stilted, the word choice is iffy, and there are minor grammar problems scattered throughout the text. Magic in this fic has no real boundaries, and its use is bereft of imagination. Quite frankly, magic in ‚Äòthe darkness within' is straight up boring.

But its plot is (mostly) unique and the emotional core of the story is really quite compelling.

I'll try to give a brief summary, while hopefully not spoiling too much in the process:

Pettigrew didn't betray the Potters as he did in cannon, instead he delivered Harry directly to Voldemort, who decided to raise the chosen one as his heir and second in command. 15 years later, Harry gets captured by Dumbledore and co., including the Potters who are still part of the order. Upon finding out that the Voldemort's son is actually Harry, who isn't dead and is still the subject of prophecy, they attempt to get him to turn on Voldemort and ‚Äòredeem himself'. What they don't know is that there's more to this ‚Äòdark prince' than meets the eye.

It should be noted that Harry hates the Potters for reasons that are revealed at around the halfway point of the fic.

There's a lot here that's interesting: will Harry fulfill his destiny, will he reconcile with the Potters, what was living with the dark lord like, why does he hate is parents so much, etc.

And unlike other fics of this type, the characters aren't ridiculous caricatures that only exist to facilitate bashing. That's not to say they're super complex or 100 percent in character or anything, but they're pretty good for what they are. Dumbledore is a fundamentally good person, albeit a manipulative one. The Potters are great people who genuinely love their children. Moody is... different but not to the extent where it ruins your suspension of disbelief. Draco is both the bigoted bully that he was in cannon and kind of likable at the same time! (this part is actually brilliant, cause holy shiznitt I've never seen that done before or since)

Voldemort is a loving father, but in a way that's sort of in line with his character. He loves Harry like he loves his wand or nagini, which is to say he views him as an object albeit a very precious one. That's not to say that he isn't a complete psychopath-he is, beyond a shadow of a doubt- but there's more to him than meets the eye.

Hell even the war is more intriguing due to how the plot is set up. The DEs are clearly the bad guys, but because Harry has ties to them, we see that they're more than just cackling mustache twirlers and even get a bit attached to some of them. Like I said, compelling.

(Note: the characterizations are really brought down by the fact that every single character uses the same words in dialogue. Different characters should speak in different ways, favoring different words and different sentence structures.)

It's just such a shame that it's brought down by the subpar writing.

The (currently incomplete) rewrite is only better by the slimmest of margins, as the aforementioned issues have only barely been addressed. Although in the interest of fairness, I have to say that the new scenes that are in the rewrite are better written than the scenes kept in from the original and are welcome additions to the story that do a decent job of fleshing out the characters of 'the darkness within'.

So, what do you guys think of this fanfic? Do you agree with my assessment, or do you think I'm a moron with no clue what I'm talking about (that's probably closer to the truth than I'd like to admit üòÖ )

And do you guys have any ‚Äúmixed bag‚Äù fics you'd like to recommend? It's doesn't necessarily have to be one with an decent plot and atrocious prose, maybe you know one that's the opposite?


** The most important thing to remember about Kurinoone is that she is a plagiarist who stole the opening parts of the story, including whole sections of dialogue, narrative and action, from Project Dark Overlord's "A Shattered Prophecy".

Originally she refused to acknowledge this and only after a sustained fan effort of spreading the word did she put an acknowledgement in her first chapter. Even then, for a long time she /continued/ to copy story elements straight from A Shattered Prophecy as they updated in parallel. And sadly, because Kurinoone tidied up the prose, her story drew in more followers. Eventually, a dispirited Project Dark Overlord stopped updating his fic whereas Kurinoone went on to become one of the biggest authors in the fandom, with the vast majority of people unaware that it was all built on a foundation of plagiarism.

I believe she has since gone back and rewritten the early chapters to distinguish them from A Shattered Prophecy, but the damage was long since done by that point. The legitimate teller of the story had been beaten into submission and the plagiarist inherited the earth.

*** Well... don't I look stupid for calling the plot unique.

I noticed beforehand that kurinoone kept on putting ‚Äòbased on shattered prophecy' in her author's notes but I assumed that based her fic off another's general premise.

I just took a look over at the first and last official chapter of ‚Äòshattered prophecy' (ch.24, apparently project dark overlord was working on a sequel when he quit) and saw that the beginning was quite similar, but the ending seemed really different. Not that I really understood what was happening without context, but it really seemed like a completely different story by that point.

Still, learning that plagiarism was involved in the creation of this fic left a pretty bad taste in my mouth, especially when I clicked on project dark overlord's ffn page and read his bio. Pretty depressing, honestly.

On a slightly unrelated note, what exactly constitutes plagiarism in fanfiction? I'm new to this whole thing, so I still don't know anything about etiquette in this community (I only started writing fanfiction about 9 months ago, and I don't post all that often). Like, if I use magical cores or whatever in my story (which I won't, but it's a good example) will I need to track down whoever came up with the concept and cite them in an authors note?

I'm asking because a lot of plot/world elements (e.g. wards) and scenarios (e.g. marriage contract fics) seem sort of ubiquitous in hp fanfiction. What's fair game and what isn't?

Anyways, thank you for the comment, even though it did sour my perception of ‚Äòthe darkness within'. What a bummer.
