Do you know of any stories that do subversion's of usual tropes?

Do you have any ideas of the usual tropes being done differently or out of something you wouldn't usually suspect?

Here's one: Slytherin Harry and Manipulative Dumbledore are working with each other, to take down the corruption from the inside. Here's another one:

Harry becomes Over powered not only because of the fact he's an horcrux, but also because one of the deadliest creatures, the basilisk bit him, and Fawkes the Phoenix, a very magical creature healed him.

Or just something like that. That would change things from the usual tropes.

Have any of your own ideas? Or any story suggestions that play with those tropes?

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** I have an idea for a short story where Harry learns Hermione has been giving Ginny a love potion since 6th year because she wants Harry to be happy. It still is Hermione bashing, which is why I'm reluctant, but honestly I think Hermione crossing boundaries like that to make Harry happy seems more IC than the traditional love potion trope.

I'll probably get around to writing it eventually, but if someone wants to take this idea, that's fine with me. If this fic already exists, I'd be interested.

*** Expanding on this: it would be tragic if Harry and Ginny still care deeply about each other as people, but there's just no attraction on her end so their marriage just falls apart. Not to mention it's also a huge boundary violation. The only issue with this expansion is that you'd have to essentially use no-people-skills-Harry from Cursed Child.

*** I'm on the fence about this. On one hand, I could totally see Hermione crossing some moral boundaries to make Harry happy. On the other hand, Hermione is all for equal rights and freedom and to dose someone with love potion is a blatant violation of their free will (yes, I remember her obliviating her parents, but the scenarios are very different there). Plus, the fact the she's a Muggleborn and is likely to see a love potion as many readers see it -- something like a date rape drug.

**** Yeah, my headcanon Hermione wouldn't do this, especially not as an adult. That's part of why I haven't written this yet. But canon doesn't show her as taking love potions very seriously, at least not as a teen. I just think as far as the non-evil main characters go, she would be the most likely candidate for crossing a line like this.

It's more that I find the inversion of a tired, absurd trope interesting than that this is something I would actually see Hermione doing. Though I do think if you're going to have a Light character do boundary crossing, manipulative things for the "Greater Good", Hermione is a strong candidate based on canon. I feel like this potential goes under-explored in fanfiction.

***** I just remembered one fic I read and had an idea. In that fic Harry discovers two things -- 1) he's a love potion baby (meaning he can't feel love), 2) Ginny doses him with love potions. There were more love potions plots going around Weasley bashing, I think? Interesting was the resolution of Harry/Ginny love potion situation -- Harry forgave her and decided to stay with her (he might have even agreed to drink love potion? I don't remember), only demanding that their future kids wouldn't be ‘love potion' kids.

So the idea is -- Harry (or anyone really) is unable to feel love(it could be bcs of a love potion or simply he hadn't met the right person yet) so he decides to ‘try it on' via dosing himself with love potion and he likes the feeling of being in love, so he continues to do it. Unhealthy and angsty but...

** I have an idea where Ron is the loyal one and Hermione is not with the Goblet of Fire. It has a smarter and more pragmatic Harry more interested in Spells than Theory (Like Pre 3rd Task Harry where he was having a LEARN EVERY SPELL moment). More towards how he is when preparing for the First Task, and Ron believes Harry didn't put his name in, and Hermione doesn't believe in Harry because she believes he legitimately found a way past the Protections with insert spell here because she knows how to do it. Cedric not being the Hogwarts Champion and Harry being the Hogwarts Champion just adds to her not believing Harry (as she'd doubt he knows how to Confundus the Goblet to spit out 4 Champions, but believe he's capable of finding a trick to slip past the Age line)

** This might actually be a controversial opinion, but Prince of Slytherin /might/ count. It has all of the tropes, deconstructs them, and also reconstructs them. If you can get past some of the edgy stuff, you might like it.

There's also a mental time travel fic I don't remember the name of that was written almost specifically as a study of Harry Potter tropes. It has Snape x Hermione, but Hermione is much older and kind of losing it, and a scene where Lavender is specifically built up to be kind and compassionate instead of the harsh treatment she gets in other fics.

** I really enjoyed SummerChildWinterFury's subversion of the the time travel trope with their series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1008369][Tripping Through Time]].

Instead of doing the standard tropey OP, battle hardened HP character time traveling to the past to prevent Voldemort's rise, they instead have 11 year old Harry get time traveled to the Marauder's era the moment he passes through the barrier of Platform 9 3/4 on his way to Hogwarts for the first time.

Overall, it's pretty well done, and it still currently updating. The author has also said they plan on explaining how this "missing year" affects the WW in 1991 when Harry was supposed to attend Hogwarts.

** I wrote a oneshot(70K words) in December of 2019 that kind of follows the first idea you have. It's sort of crackish but treated seriously. Basically, Harry is a Slytherin, minds his own business for the most part, and doesn't feel the need to get involved in everything. In the end, around 6th book time, he still works with Dumbles to take down Voldy. There's no real bashing(save for Umbridge) in the fic if you're interested.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2517824]] or linkao3(Deadly Eyes of a Phoenix Reborn) is a good story. It's been a few years since I read it, so I don't remember it very well now, but it's a creature fic based on the basilisk bite and Phoenix tears. There is a short rape scene in the beginning, chapter one or two, but it's mostly skippable and isn't super important.

*** If anyone chooses to read this let me explain myself first.

I was still a depressed teen when I wrote it. I was being attacked on FFN, AO3, and Tumblr over how Harry was a Mary Sue and that the only way to counter that was to put him through trauma. The constant horrible things being sent to me made me stop reading my own reviews after a while because no matter how much trauma I put Harry through it just wasn't enough for people to stop attacking me.

The fic does have to be revamped terribly because me caving to peer pressure made all these ridiculous plot twists that I feel I didn't handle very well.

Also, this was before it was common fact that Dumbles loved Grindles, so Dumbles is not only the bad guy, but the WORST kind of bad guy and man could be. I was told not so nicely that in order for him to be someone worth hating he had to either be a (r/pist) or a (necrophili/c). You can probably see where this is going. Me caving to peer pressure effed the whole story up tbh and it embarrasses me to this day.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
