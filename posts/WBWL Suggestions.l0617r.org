Someone suggested this genre to me, but I haven't really dug into yet. Give me your favorite WBWL fics, my friends. Many thanks!


** linkffn(Prince Of Slytherin) is one of the best ones out there - This line from the story sums it up perfectly: "There are more conspiracies active in this school and in the world outside of it than you or I could fully comprehend in a hundred lifetimes."

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
