I'm looking for fics featuring some of the older women in Harry Potter being complete BAMFs. Bellatrix, Andromeda, Narcissa, Amelia Bones, McGonagall, etc.

These women are (per canon) supposedly some of the brightest and/or most powerful witches of their age!

And yet, consistently both in canon and fanon they're constantly let down.

For example, Sirius is blasted into the veil during a duel where he (arguably) holds his own for awhile against one of the 5 best witches/wizards in Britain. Great ending!

But Bellatrix is defeated via a one-shot kill by Molly Weasley because Molly Weasley is /upset/. It's like a guy with a sword and shield defeating a machine gun platoon. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Sorry Bellatrix, all your 40 years of training in the Dark Arts is no match for some untrained rando getting angry.

So I just want a fic where these women are kicking butt and taking names. Not killed off screen, or victims of stupid plans, or just follow along with whatever Dumbledore or LV say like automatons. And I especially don't want a bunch of teenagers outsmarting any of them.

Relationships (F/M or F/F are fine). Polys and incest aren't.

Fic doesn't necessarily have to be realistic (I'm totally ok with god mode Amelia Bones telling everyone to f right off and take over the ministry), but I'd prefer no straight up crack fics.

Teaming up is fine too. The Black sisters getting together and telling Voldemort and Dumbledore to get stuffed sounds like my cup of tea.

Anyone have any suggestions EXCEPT for the assassin Narcissa one, which I've already read?

John Malcolm Thorpe Fleming Churchill, (16 September 1906 -- 8 March 1996) was a British Army officer who fought in the Second World War with a longbow, bagpipes, and a Scottish broadsword. Nicknamed "Fighting Jack Churchill" and "Mad Jack", he was known for the motto: "Any officer who goes into action without his sword is improperly dressed."

Kinda like Bellatrix Lestrange, lol.

In all fairness, though, it sounds like he fought with modern weapons in addition to his sword, bow, and bagpipes. üòâ

Look, if I were writing DH, I'd give Bellatrix to Hermione, but you have no data to know how skilled Molly Weasly was or wasn't. This notion that it was a one-shot kill isn't even factually accurate, however. It was a fairly lengthy exchange of a large number of rapidly, nonverbally cast spells, something that, for example, late-DH Harry probably couldn't manage:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄòOUT OF MY WAY!' shouted Mrs Weasley to the three girls, and with a swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley's wand slashed and twirled, and Bellatrix Lestrange's smile faltered, and became a snarl. Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around the witches' feet became hot and cracked; both women were fighting to kill.

  ‚ÄòNo!' Mrs Weasley cried, as a few students ran forwards, trying to come to her aid. ‚ÄòGet back! Get back! She is mine!'

  Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights, Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent.

  ‚ÄòWhat will happen to your children when I've killed you?' taunted Bellatrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly's curses danced around her. ‚ÄòWhen Mummy's gone the same way as Freddie?'

  ‚ÄòYou -- will -- never -- touch -- our -- children -- again!' screamed Mrs Weasley.

  Bellatrix laughed, the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backwards through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did.

  Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart.
#+end_quote

So, there you go. Molly could stalemate Bellatrix, then Bellatrix's focus faltered and she died.

What we need in the BAMF Older Women department is more fics showing off Molly.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

** In defense of both the Molly and Sirius situations. There is such a thing as dumb luck and an opponent not taking someone seriously (no pun intended). It's quite possible that Bellatrix did see Molly as nothing more than a housewife so wasn't fighting her at the top of her game. Then add the documented RW fact where a mother has shown incredible feats of strength etc to protect her child. And you could have the situation that in Molly's anger she put way more magic into her spell than she was normally capable of and combine that with Bellatrix not taking the fight seriously and you have Molly with the surprise win.

In Sirius' case he wasn't taking the fight seriously and didn't keep situational awareness and ended up fighting with his "back" to the veil. So once he moved or a spell moved him to touch the veil it was game over.

** With respect to Molly, how do you know she was untrained? The Books are narrated from Harry's very narrow 3rd person POV. He couldn't possibly know what Molly was doing most of her time.

With all her kids at Hogwarts, Molly didn't have much to do at home anyway, and she had *all the time in the world* to practice and train.

Bellatrix rotted for 15 years in Azkaban. She was only broken out in Jan 1996, and was killed about 2.5 years later.

It appears to me that Molly had a lot more time to train than her, and Molly is older.

*** Well, if you want to take that approach, we could say nearly anything in the book is possible as long as it isn't specifically contradicted by the 3rd person limited narration.

However, HP isn't Finnegan's Wake, you know? At some point, we need to have some confidence that the author is presenting the truth unless indicated otherwise.

Sure, maybe Molly Weasley is the Wizarding Equivalent of an MI6 Officer. It's /possible/. Nothing in the text specifically /excludes/ it. It's the sort of thing that's fun for head canon, and might make a great AU fic, but I don't think that's really a good-faith argument.

If the only way we can have something in the text make sense is by coming up with an elaborate backstory for one of the characters that's not even hinted at in the narrative, then 99% of the time, that's a sign of lazy writing, not elaborate subtext, no?

*** This has never stopped getting me angry. If Molly Weasley /must/ kill her, have Bellatrix fending off McGonagall and Kingsley and Molly sneaks around and AK's her in the back.

But a straight up 1 v 1 duel? It's ludicrous, disgusting, and infuriating.

I'm probably angry out of proportion to the offense, but one of my pet peeves is when powerful (usually older) women get completely neutered because the plot suddenly needs them to be stupid/weak. And the main reason it's so infuriating is because they've been built up to be these near-unstoppable BAMFs to begin with. So you really start to like them, and think they're awesome, and then the author decides to take away the very thing you liked because they've become inconvenient to the plot.

Don't get me wrong, there is definitely fiction that deals well with taking these sorts of women down, but it's done through character development and build-up that is present from the beginning. So even though it's tragic, you can see the roots of their eventual defeat starting back when you met the character.

But the far more common approach is to build up these women to be total BAMFs, whose only fatal flaw is plot-driven stupid pills from lazy authors.

Maybe I've completely glossed over this. I don't remember anything like that, but if I missed it, I'd love to have it pointed out to me.

And her surviving the first war is great, but surviving the first war doesn't really give us a sense of her skill beyond some basic level. Not everyone in the Order, or Friends of the Order, were awesome at spell casting or duels.

Whereas Bellatrix is specifically presented as several points in the text as very good at duels, the Dark Arts, spellcasting, etc.

******* Point.

It's fair to say I over-exaggerated for emphasis in my initial post. I made Molly Weasley out to be some boob who didn't know which end of the wand was up. That's not accurate.

I would say a fair evaluation of her level of skill is that she's certainly competent and can hold her own in an attack. But I don't think there's any indication she's at an elite level. Certainly nothing that gives me an indication she'd have a chance in a 1v1 duel with Bellatrix Lestrange.

But anyway, I didn't really start this thread to debate the merits of Molly Weasley so we may be straying a bit far afield.

Any fic recs? I'd certainly love to read an AU fic about covert operations spy Molly Weasley, kicking butt and taking names ;) or anything else you know of that's in-line with the general topic.
