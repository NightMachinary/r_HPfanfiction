He got disowned for being a squib. They obliviated him and confunded him to being obsessed with being normal, so he hates everything related to magic.

Turns out he wasn't a squib, just a late bloomer and he starts to remember.

** I cannot remember its name, nor do I care to look it up, but I did read a story where Marge was the squib and Vernon was an embittered wizard who'd renounced magic after his first wife and kid were murdered by Death Eaters or something. I think their name was originally "Durley" or something and when Marge was kicked out their parents made her change her surname because ahe was a squib, and Vernon changed his to match because he hated magic and his past.

** His sister would need to be obliviated, too otherwise things would be awkward. If Dudley would have a magical child, it would be half blood.

** I vaguely remember a story where Vernon was the squib relative to Delores Umbridge.....which explains a lot about why he would hate magic and think it to be 'unnatural'.

#+begin_quote
  The Lone Traveler arrives on the even of Fudge's election. Instead of pelting Dumbledore for advice, the new Minister listens to a new viewpoint. Much is changed.
