I remember that the blood wards drained his magic, and would have basically killed anybody else but his magic restores really fast. I think it was an HHR fic, because I recall a scene where they are driving around in a car in order to evade the tracking charm

** As others have noted, it's Rocking the Boat. I remember that story mostly because of Dumbledore's "distanciaheadometer." I also remember Bill appareling into Hyde Park, Hermione using a treasured award in a ritual, and Tonks being horrified.
