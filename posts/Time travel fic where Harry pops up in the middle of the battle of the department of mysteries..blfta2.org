:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I'm trying to remember what fic this was and I remember it started off with Harry somehow popping up during the fight with the death eaters in OOTP. The first thing he says is something like " Neville, mate, watch this" then proceeds to kick all their asses. I think he takes Neville under his wing to hunt horcruxes right after too if I'm remembering right. Any ideas?

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED
