Most fics i read nowadays have either ron or hermione being bashed nd turned OOC. I want a fic (that isn't just a canon rehash) where the golden trio still has that friendship from canon. Where ron is kind and compassionate. Where hermione is caring and loving. Please no H/Hr.

All of these have Harry friends with Ron and Hermione, and tell compelling stories as well. These aren't merely slice of life fluff fics. Starfox5 is also commonly recommended for stories fitting this prompt. Of their stories, the only one I recommend is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/Democracy]] (though it is not from any of the trio's perspectives).

  During a publicity stunt, Harry and five others are sent to another world where a well timed Stupefy made all the difference. As Harry looks for his peers and a way home, another Harry investigates the odd arrival of his doppelganger. (Canon, EWE, dimension travel, AU)

** Some of Bobmin356's (RIP) stories [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/777540/Bobmin356]]

I'd recommend "Saying No" which starts serious and becomes crackficcy but no pairings, "The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic" which is canon ships but not canon method of defeating Voldemort, "Dumbledore's Army" and its sequel. Also "Healing Harry" ([[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Healing_Harry/Healing_Harry/]]). Most of these are H/G and R/H pairings.

"Not Dumbledore"--kathryn518 (told from Ron's POV; canon relationships) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13266686/1/Not-Dumbledore]]

  All they wanted was a normal school year and now they're willing to fight for it. An alternative take on the Trio's fourth year.

  Harry'd always had screwed up luck. So when he got dumped and dragged on a forced vacation, he really shouldn't have been too surprised when a Category 5 Hurricane leveled half the country. At least he got trapped in a growling shack with the girl of his dreams. Too bad he doesn't know her name, what she looks like, and is being forced to marry Daphne Greengrass instead. HP/DG
