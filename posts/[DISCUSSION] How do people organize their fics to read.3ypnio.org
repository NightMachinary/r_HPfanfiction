Or do you even organize them at all? Do you read and find fics one at a time?

I've got an overly detailed bookmarks system set up, but lately I've been wondering if this is really the best way. I keep losing fics to the depths of my bookmarks, or it's not easy to find one again.

*** I use some of this method as well. The other day my roommates came over to my computer and went through all the tabs.

They make fun of my fan fiction addiction, but probably only because I keep them overly updated on how my fan fiction reading is going. It works, even if that moment was mildly mortifying. I had a looooot of HG/SS open.

** I'm reading them on my tablet, so I usually download them in epub format and read them in an ebook reader app, which shows the percentage I've read of a book.

Now if I could only find an app with the additional functionality of

- auto-updating stories
- assigning tags and colours to stories for easier sorting

Then I'd be in heaven.

***** Same! Moon+ /does/ actually have tags and "favorites" (which are basically a different kind of tag, tbh). And, if you keep a library locally, you can even have a folder structure to organize, and view specific folders in your library ("My Shelf") as well.

Sadly, there are a few quirks Moon+ has that have bit me a few times, and each time I've emailed the dev his replies (while prompt) have been rather... disappointing, but I've kinda worked out a how to avoid most of them, I think. (One of which is losing the tags and favorite category for a file if it gets reimported...once it reimported my whole library >_>)

I've got a pretty good background in Android app development, so I've thought about creating my own app at some point, it's just a large project get started on (more complicated the more I thought about it)

*** Ugh, I've got this bookmarks folder for stories that have been updated in the past year, and every so often when I'm bored I go through and see if any are finished or seem abandoned. My friends made fun of me so hard when they found out. It works for me, though.

edit: have you checked out the ff.net app? I'm not sure how well it works, but I know you can download stories with it.

** Okay so because I read multiple fics at once, I keep a list of the fics that I am currently reading. I have multiple documents for organization. A word document for the fics that I want/have to read, which is in order of urgency. I have this list organised by type of fic (ex: dark harry, AU, time-travel) as well as pairings. I have a document for the fics that I haven't finished and the fics that are currently being updated. I have a document for the fics that I have read. I usually put a description by these, so if I want to go back and read something I have something to go off of. I also use a rating system, so I know which fics are exceptionally good.

** I created a google doc to organize all the fanfic I read. It started out as a way to record what fics I've finished, but then it tuned into this huge monster. I have each section categorized by ship (Draco Malfoy + Hermione Granger, Reading the Books, Crossovers, etc). Then I have a format for each entry. I'll post an example further down. A few months ago, I added the genre the fic falls under, along with if the fic is considered popular or not (based on how many reviews/hits/favorites etc). I also color code the title, rating, ship, status (complete, incomplete, WIP, abandoned), and an asterisk (*) if a fic was memorable (could be positive or negative. If negative, it means I most likely abandoned reading it).

*Basic Example*

Title: Rating

/Link(s)/

Trope: Summary. Genre. Smut (if applicable), Popular (if applicable). *if particularly memorable (for whatever reason).

Ship(s) Status Chapter count Last update

[Status of reading] *(favorite if applicable)

For fics I've heard about, but haven't checked them out, I put under a separate category at the bottom of my document. For fics that I am interested in reading, I file it into whichever category fits it best, but do not add the [status of reading].

*Here's an actual example from my document:*

Them Boys: T

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8587646/13/Them-Boys]]

Time Turner: Hermione is sent back in time to the Marauders Era. Now she goes to school with people she only knows as being dead, Hogwarts Professors and an Azkaban Escapee. She's stuck in the ‘70s living a life where she is falling in love with a Marauder. And Hermione will do ANYTHING to keep the friends she's made from the fate she knows will befall them without her interference. Albus is acting as Hermione's Godfather. Everyone is at Potter Manor for Christmas. Romance/Humor

[Reading: Chapter 13] *

I do also have some fics I want to read categorized on my phone in folders. The folders are under "Fanfiction", then four folders relating to fics (websites that host fics or have recs, new fics I haven't checked, fics I'm in the middle of reading, and one shots). There are several more folders under the fics I haven't read and I categorize them by ship. For each bookmark I do the following: Title Rating Ship Chapter Count. And * before the title means I enjoyed my skim through and have high hopes for the fic and a * after the chapter count means it is a popular fic.

My /in-progress/ bookmarks is the same, except instead of total character count, I put what chapter I am on. So if a fic has 50 chapters and I've read 12, it would be shown as 12/50.

** I read one fic at a time, and I have bookmark like crazy. I don't even know how deep the folders go, but it's deep. Anything I might want to read again gets bookmarked. The truly excellent get favorited, and I follow anything that I want updates on so that I only have to pay attention to my email inbox.

If I think I might want to read it offline, then I'll download it through the fanfiction.net app, which I really like.

** From ff.net, I download them as epub and keep them in Calibre, tagging them by series, pairing, rating, year and fic type (adventure, PWP, romance, etc.)

That said, my fics are still a mess.

*** I tried Calibre for a while, but I just couldn't get into it. My biggest issue is that there's no user-friendly way to keep my whole library in sync with my devices wirelessly. It has multiple "options" for doing this, but none of them are as simple as "All of your library and metadata always stay in sync, perfectly", or even anywhere close.

** For ongoing stories I follow them on ao3 or ff so they send new chapters to my email. For stories to read I have a huge Fanfiction bookmark folder- no sorting, just any ff that I haven't read yet.

Once I finish reading a fic or it gets completed it gets complicated. I use evernote because I really hate not being able to remember things I've read. I'm way behind but for fics worth recommending I create a note, put the description in as well as anything I want to add and the author and then I have an elaborate tagging system by ship, rating, tropes, type of story, etc. So if I want to find a particular ship I click on that tag but evernote is also searchable by text so I'll just use that too.

** By whatever the original work was (“Harry Potter”, for example, or “Star Wars”), then for each work by whether it's a one-shot, few-shot (up to 5 chapters, no more than 20.000 words total), longer work, or a series (and each series gets its own sub-folder). If needed because of works sharing the same name and being in the same category, I add tags that are as general as possible while still allowing me to differentiate between the two quickly.

Also, if some fan fiction is the only one I care about about a given work, it goes to the “assorted” folder instead because having a whole category for one work is kind of absurd.

** I've bookmarked a few filters for FF.net's HP category and this reddit. I systematically browse through them, bookmark any story that seems interesting, read story, deciding whether to discard or finish within the first few chapters. When I run out of stories I go back to the bookmarked search locations and start over. I tend to edit the names with dates so I don't forget how long I have to look back. I also have mail alerts for any updates to fics I follow on FF.net. Works wonderfully since I get to do it on both my tablet and PC.

** As I scroll through my bookmarked FFN search page (parameters preset, I think I have 3 of these bookmarks saved, sorted different ways; favorite one is the 60k+ words, complete, English, sorted by recently updated) if I find something that seems interesting and I don't /think/ I've read it already, I'll bookmark it. I'll often find 2-3 to bookmark before I actually start reading one. I have like 20 stories in my bookmarks that I have to get around to reading.

I don't organize those bookmarks, I delete a bookmark after I've read it, because if I like it, I'll favorite it on FFN. That's kinda why my favorites list seems to sketchy sometimes Every so often I'll go through my favorites and download onto my Kindle the ones I want to perma-save. Occasionally if one story is absolutely amazing, I'll bookmark it through mobile Chrome instead (which I can easily get to on my desktop) so that it's already in the folder of things to download.

** For fics on supported websites, I use Calibre's FanFicFare plugin, which automatically imports and updates fanfics I am following and pushes them to the e-reader when they update. Once imported, a fic is just another ePub in the Calibre library. It also imports the available tagging information: genres, characters, 'ships, completeness, etc..

The big downside of this approach is that, as a result, I am very bad about leaving reviews, since I am reading a fic off an e-reader, not in a browser, and I often don't get around to coming back, browsing to the fic, and leaving the review.

** I've written a Java app in my spare time to download fics from various sites and turn them into ePubs, I won't claim it's amazing, but I don't have a ton of sites that I read from, and I know exactly how it works and can fix corner cases if I need to. Plus, I like programming anyway, so it's fun for me. (If you want, you can look at it [[https://github.com/bkromhout/FictionDL][here]], I only recently made it public though, so some of the docs aren't finished.)

I'm an Android user, so I use a great app called FolderSync to keep a folder on my Google Drive with all of my books completely in sync with one on my devices, then I have Moon+ reader set up to auto-import from that folder. (Moon+ has some quirks though, so I've entertained the thought of also writing my own reader app, but it would be a big project to begin, so I haven't gotten around to it...I may just make it be a library organizer app at first, and let apps like Moon+ do the reading)

(I know about Calibre and FanFicFare, but Calibre is overkill for me and doesn't have a satisfactory way of keeping everything it tracks (as in, /all/ files in my library plus /all/ of their Calibre metadata) synced between all of my devices, plus FanFicFare point blank refuses to work for me at all, I've tried everything.)
