** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/Unatoned][Unatoned by SeriousScribble]] is probably the singly best written Harry/Daphne fic. It doesn't have a canon tone, but is a perfect example of what I would imagine Harry Potter noir to be like. Writing style, detail-wise and plot wise this could have been published in a pulp magazine alongside Raymond Chandler stories.

*** Help me out, because I'm a little unfamiliar with "noir" style writings. [[/spoiler][I think the Astoria character in this fic is intolerable; I am in chapter 8, but I am about to stop reading because the character is so young and the whole thing with her is kinda grossing me out. Is having a wild character who acts really flamboyant and oozes sexuality a noir trope?]]

edit - because I figured out how to spoiler tag correctly.

**** Think Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, The Lady from Shanghai, Chinatown. [[/spoiler][Astoria in this fic is an homage to Raymond Chandler's story /The Big Sleep/ (also turned into a movie starring Humphrey Bogart), where there is a character who is essentially Astoria. In fact, the whole first chapter is based on the opening scene/chapter of /The Big Sleep/, though I've only seen the movie and read the short story which Chandler expanded into the novel.]]

****** My father is rather big into noir fiction ever since I got him a pulp collection a few years ago, so I've learned a bit about the genre from him. It's an interesting thing. Lots of twists, nooks and crannies in the storytelling, with characters almost larger than life. Femme fatales, weary detectives, dirty cops and ditzy blondes are just some of the colorful characters you'd find.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life is rarely that fair. See how his life fell apart and who was there to pick up the pieces. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant. AU.

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

  Harry Potter is a thief and a lawbreaker long before he gets his letter. Upon discovering he's a wizard, he sets out for the wizarding world - but he's doing things his way. Dumbledore has no idea what his decision to leave Harry with the Dursleys has wrought. Harry/Multi, darkish, some Dumbledore bashing, rating may go up later.
