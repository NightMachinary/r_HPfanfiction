As the title says I have been trying to find some "Reading the Books" series that I read years ago.

- The 1st was a reading of just "Sorcerer's Stone" that was done by only the Heads of Houses during the summer before Harry's first year.

- The 2nd story I'm looking for went from "Sorcerer's Stone" to around half way through "Half-Blood Prince" in 6 separate parts. It takes place at the Weasley's home and Harry is a few years below Hogwarts age. Adult Harry, Ron, and Hermione are there as well. They do things like get Sirius out of jail as things are revealed throughout the books.

I have been trying to find the 2nd set of stories for a long time now and they are what I have mainly been trying to find over the years.


** Sadly, both of those were most likely deleted in the great "characters read the books" purge. I hope someone can get you a copy of them, though!
