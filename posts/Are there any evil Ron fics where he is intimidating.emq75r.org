Ive noticed over the years that when writers bash Ron/ He is never portrayed as really much of a threat......hes either the lackey to someone else or just a big idiot that is disposed of rather quickly. I was wondering are there any fics where he is portrayed as cunning and smart and a genuine threat to the protagonist for the whole story ?


** I don't have any, but I am noticing a small trend where people are wanting more interesting and diverse Rons. Is this the beginning of a new era?

*** don't know about that its just ive read quite a different range of stories and Ive never come across Ron as a competent villain. I think when they make Harry the villian.........he's still portrayed as menacing. Ron dosent seem to have that. Hes usually seen in 1 of 3 ways

*1. A terrible boyfriend and friend but still basically harmless.........*

*2. He's evil but is being controlled by someone else and is really just a minion*

*3. Hes the villian but is too stupid to be a real threat and once people start fighting back hes preety much done for.*

Ive never found a story where he say convinces everyone Hermione is the abuser and gets her locked up and turns almost everyone against through nothing but his own wits or intellect

I'd cheerfully read a story where Hermione's violent tendencies - which she does have - finally go too far in response to one last smartarse remark too many.

**** I feel like this is possible with an evil Ron. Hermione's been shown multiple times to be out of tune with people's feelings, like with Lavender's rabbit. Not that she's a total sociopath, or that Ron's always empathetic, but he seems more easygoing and can more easily gain popularity, so I can see him having the people skills to flip this on her.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** In a related sense people tend to write manipulative Dumbledore and have Harry figure out his scheem right at the start of the fic, Then Dumbledore tries the same thing over and over to get his plan back on track, only for Harry to yell at him until he goes "dart foiled again, but I'll try again for the Greater Good."

That's just so confusing because they're simultaneously making him out out to be this manipulative genious but also incompetent and repeatedly stopped by teenage rage like ???

**** Probably a Ron that wants to live forever, but not because he is afraid of death. In fact, he is bored by it. He was born not just in his brother's shadow but also as a nobody in the grand scheme of things. He hates that. Maybe he hates the end death brings so much that he has a habit of leaving his enemies alive, with the possibility of challenging him again.

******** I imagine it has something to do with the way he was brought up. Upping the disregard of Ron a little bit from canon, his personal needs were never even a consideration. Spending a younger life constantly catering to the needs of others, he has developed an unhealthy dislike against anyone doing anything for others. Of course it's a bit extreme but dark people are a bit extreme, aren't they?

Yeah, he definitely likes to experience many things but not in a methodical way. Say if there was a serial killer going around drilling holes in people's heads(ID:Invaded reference), he wouldn't just drill a hole into someone's head to experience it. Instead he would prod and test the serial killer to reveal the complete nature of it's mind. Why does it do what it do, what does he think, etc.

A flat mate would he really want one? I think it depends which blends more with his psyche

He could want some one separate than him who can challenge and who he can convert proving his way is right but what if they prove him wrong is that too much of a risk

But someone like himself from the start like my Colin idea would also prove he isn't alone. He is not the strange one because here is someone who shares his beliefs proves that he isn't alone
