Basically where Harry is some sort of immortal, would prefer that he goes back in time if he dies like in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter]]

(would also prefer if there is no romantic interest for Harry, don't mind side pairings as long as it isn't incest/pedophila etc)
