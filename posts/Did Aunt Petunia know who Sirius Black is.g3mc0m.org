We are just listening to the audiobook of HPPoA (with absolutely excellent Stephen Fry) and in the second chapter “Aunt Marge's Big Mistake” the story starts with the TV announcement of the escaped convict Black (with his photograph on the screen). I guess they used his whole name somewhere in the report (although it is not mentioned in the book), how is it probable that Aunt Petunia actually knew who he was, and she knew very well why the TV report never mentioned where the convict escaped from (after all, she knew what Azkaban is)? What do you think?


** Well, assuming that Lily's parents were alive when James and Lily got married (I don't think Petunia attended their wedding, but I could be wrong), they could've shown her pictures of the wedding. And since Sirius was presumably James's best man, he would've been right next to James in the pictures. But this would probably be the extent of what she knew about him, outside of him being a murder.

*** Just that I like stories like linkao3(11676102) or linkffn(12551744), where we get the peek behind the caricature which is Petunia in the books.

** Petunia knew about Azkaban, she says something about "That horrible boy talked about it"(Horrible boy as in Snape) in OotP after Harry saves Dudley from the dementors, so it is likely that she knew about Sirius.

*** That's what I was saying. So, the interesting question is why she never told a word about him? When she saw him on TV and she knew who he is? Isn't there at least a small plot hidden there for a one-shot? Perhaps, not all the way to linkffn(On December Something by KathrynElaineDarling), but what if Petunia's life was more interesting than she is letting us know?

  We never learn what was in that letter to Petunia Dursley. Could it have to do with a love gone wrong or were they instructions from Dumbledore? What was Petunia Evans really like? Was she always so cold and clammy? What made Sirius Black attracted to her?
