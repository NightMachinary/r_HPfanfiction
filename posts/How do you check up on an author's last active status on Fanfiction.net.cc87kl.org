** Their profile will indicate when the profile was last changed, and their stories will indicate when they were last updated.

Try sending them a PM, saying how much you like their work and will they write more? Might get a response one way or the other.

But honestly there's not much point. Content gets released when it's released.

** Check the last publish date on the stories in their favourites. This indicates if they are even still following the site.

Try PMing them.

Try searching their username on different websites (spacebattles, sufficient velocity, ao3), quite a few authors just moved on to different places but haven't stopped writing.
