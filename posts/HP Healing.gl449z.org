:END:
Hi I have read this story a few years back...

it's about Harry (could be malfoy/hermoine but pretty sure it was Harry) who has a gift for healing. No spells or potions, its was with his mind/natural ability.

He has to do some kind of test where he heals different people. I believe one was blind and another had scars. Something about a web or strings he (re)connects.

In a later chapter he also heals the longbottoms.

Hope you guys can help me find it.


** I think that's "To Shape and Change"

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** I remembered one but I don't think it fits into your list, I think it was when Harry went with Dumbledore to get the horcrux with inferi and he got either bitten or scratch and can detect dark magic through it.
