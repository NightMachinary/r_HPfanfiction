/Inspired by a response I wrote to another post, which I will expand and elaborate upon here./

Oftentimes you will hear the criticism that Lord Voldemort is just a generic villain character who is not particularly interesting in his own right. That he does bad things because he's the Big Bad in a fantasy series. That as a villain he pales in comparison to, say, Hannibal Lector or even to Dolores Umbridge.

To that I say, yeah, I agree. I admit he's not a particularly captivating or frightening guy compared to some other characters, though I will say the scene in the graveyard in Book Four is pretty fantastic. But what he isn't is a generic villain who does bad things just because. He actually has a pretty consistent characterization.

And that characterization is this: Tom Riddle is monomaniacal in pursuit of his goal of being recognized as the most talented wizard alive.

He is not at his core cruel or sadistic or charming or clever. He can be any of those things, but that isn't what drives him. What drives him is an absolute feeling of superiority to others.

He is not a schemer. In the series he schemes only when he is powerless and has no other choice. Think of him as the brilliant but lazy egotistical student with a challenging piece of homework. If he has to, he can hunker down and knock it out of the park. But he likes it a lot better when he just knows the answer and can rattle it off in front of everyone. Because he's the best. This is why once he returns to his body he kills people indiscriminately even when they might be useful to him.

In Voldemort's mind, all his problems can be solved by he himself becoming more powerful, by acquiring more magical knowledge, and especially magical artifacts. Thus his creation of horcruxes. Thus his obsession with the prophecy after Harry escapes him in the graveyard, and later a similar obsession with the Elder Wand once Harry's wand defeats his borrowed wand in the Battle of the Seven Potters.

Let's run down a list of things that Voldemort is not. If he were truly a generic villain---and he is portrayed as such in many fics---he might indulge in some of these things purely [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz][for the evilz]], but in canon he doesn't.

- Voldemort doesn't torture people just for the pure enjoyment of it. He might derive some temporary catharsis from it, but he'll probably kill the person outright before too long. And it's always physical, never psychological. He is not Jigsaw.

- Voldemort also doesn't take delight in his superiority over others. He takes his superiority for granted. He isn't an abuser or a rapist; I doubt he's sexual at all.

- The younger Voldemort wanted to hurt people who hurt him, but he wasn't the kind of kid who pulled the wings off flies just for his own amusement.

- Voldemort doesn't understand his enemies and try to get into their head and demonstrate the futility of their life philosophy. Why bother understanding other people when he's capable of killing any of them on a whim? He is not the Joker.

- He is also not Napoleon. He has the Bonaparte-like grandiosity, but none of the competent administration. His accrual of power is all personal; it's not about building an empire.

- He institutes a quasi-totalitarian system of government, but he is not Big Brother. He has no desire to subject every facet of people's lives to his political control. Measures like the taboo were put in place to catch Harry Potter and his allies.

To sum up, although there are certainly ways in which Voldemort could be a more dynamic, threatening, or interesting villain, he is not generic. He has a consistent characterization that explain his actions and motivations, and that characterization is not something that has already been done to death in other works.


** While I do agree with most of your points, does Voldemort really need to "be a more dynamic, threatening, or interesting villain" ?\\
The story is not about him, but about Harry and his friends; some fanfictions create a good Voldemort when he is more of a character, and that is good, but in canon he is a good character already.\\
He is competent (he lost the first war because... well, magic; and won the second till basically magic again); he has backup plans to his backup plans (how many decades did it take Dumbledore to find the horcruxes?); he knows how to obtain followers and sow fear in the heart of his opponents; he knows when to be patient and when to act quickly, is not afraid to fight but will retreat when needed.\\
But I don't agree on the torture part : I would say that he does use psychological torture, on his followers. The Malfoys through the mission given to Draco, and all his death eaters through the death of the muggle studies professors, are under a form of psychological torture.

*** Sure but i really think he only got like after the horcruxes , first ones just got him a bit crazy but he was still charismatic enough to collect followers , it was all downhill from there

I still don't think he made all seven before the 1st war

Plus J.K rowling did the intend the book for kids , i guess you can't have a villain with actual reasons behind his eviiiiil acts so he had to be Magic Hitler or maybe she just sucks

** I actually disagree with your characterization. Voldemort does not crave absolute power, or recognition of his power in and of itself. He craves what every orphan does... He craves to /matter/. In his experiences it is only the strong that matter... He grew up with Albus fucking Dumbledore, the dude who beat Grindlewald, teaching him! He grew up being a bully. He knew the result of power, and what power gave him. So he craves power not because he is ambitious, though that is a hardly touched aspect of his character, but because he is /terrified/. Rowling even shows this in the afterlife, and when he is rebirthed. Both times, he is an infant, and Harry is instructed to "Ignore him, for there is nothing you can do." For Tom Riddle, not having anyone pay attention, notice, or recognize him... that would be the worst torture. He would not be Slytherin's Heir, the Dark Lord, the most skilled Hogwarts Student, or even Voldemort... he would be a nobody. It's why he loved not hearing Voldemort, it meant that he was immortalized, and feared. That everyone knew his name but was too respectful of him to say it.

It is also why he marked his followers... he marked them so they would never forget that they were /his/. Even if they defected, they were still his. Even when they died, they were his. Their marks proved it. They would never forget who he was... He was their Lord, and by god they would know it.

when we look at all his actions, it makes voldemort's actions make terrifying sense. He doesn't want to kill Harry just because he makes him look weak. He wants to kill Harry because Harry will make him nothing. For all his attempts, he has not killed that boy... a boy who keeps beating him, lessening his reputation, his image, his legacy, his /identity/ and by Merlin, and Morgana, no half taught, nongraduate is going to take away everything that he has worked for, for 70 years! He is The Dark Lord Voldemort! HE WILL NEVER BE NOTHING.

That is what is Voldemort's driving feature. NOT his craving for absolute power. He craves power because he is afraid. And Dumbledore knew it. It was why he made certain to call him Tom to his face... and everytime Voldemort is called tom? He snaps. He seeks to Erase that which makes him less than Voldemort.. out of fear.

*** He took artifacts that were practically legendary and made it so that they be ultimately associated with him. He immortalized himself at the expense of the memory and lives of everyone else.

** While your arguments are really great, they kind proved that Voldemort was an arch-typical Hollywood cartoon villain. While I agree that Tom Riddle was potentially interesting, JKR never described him in detail and we readers only know that Voldemort from the 2nd War. IMO, he should be probably far less insane and more interesting in the 1st War, but that's of course only speculation.

Once you dig in deep to this, you realize the whole point of him attempting to then 'take control' of Britain is pointless. As is the good versus evil power dynamic. Voldemort's motivations are never made clear, why does he do what he does? What is his end goal? You could tell Rowling had no idea either at the end of DH, when Voldemort won, she had no real idea on what he would say, what would he implement in terms of 'reform'?

In the end, he is the generic villain. He wants power but because the author has no idea what he wants it for, he loses and never comes close to his goal before that.

For Rowling it was not about the conflict, but more about the characters and the world building. Building a world is easy, she took from other mediums and adapted them to her world, almost everything about the Wizarding World is taken from other sources and modified in an insubstantial way and then built upon with newer details.

At its core, Harry Potter is not a good story, not even decent, it's the world that people enjoy and it's the world people buy merchandise for. Fanfiction then has to be something totally original, you need new conflict, you need a new threat. There is no way to 'use' canon Voldemort, as his 'use' was that of the stereotypical Villian who had a destination but no clear goals. It almost makes me cringe looking back at it.

*** I agree with most of this: really, Voldemort had no growth/development or even, as you say, a focused goal. "Rule the world" maybe?

Now Tom Riddle...that's a whole different kit and caboodle. Tom Riddle had all of those things- the motivation and drive and goals and inspiration, all those things that can humanize a villain and really make them into an interesting character. Unfortunately Rowling didn't explore the transition between Riddle and Voldemort more than "horcruxes."

*** Voldemort is basically a shell of Riddle. I doubt he really even knew what to do once he got Britain under his control. I have no doubt he would only focus on improving his personal power.

** I like it when people bring out the villain in Voldemort. Done well, he can be one of the most interesting characters in a fic, even as the villain. One of the things I hate most about the HP fandom is the proliferation of 'Vernon Dursley Voldemorts', ones where he's written as a completely insane person who's spitting mad, does illogical things, screams 'Potter!' all day (along with generous helpings of Cruciatuses) and is basically only there to act as a truly generic bad guy.

** To me, what I find the most frightening/horrifying in terms of Voldemort is his transformation. He's described as being good-looking and handsome in the second (?) and sixth books, yet much description is giving of him during the fourth book and onward. I mean, thinking about the young boy Dumbledore met at Wool's Orphanage to seeing Voldemort in the flesh decades later, and to see how much of him has eroded...I find it fascinating.

It also holds a promising analysis that was never truly explored: Tom Riddle Jr. hated his father because he left him and his mother alone, yet Tom Riddle Sr. is described in book 6 as being extremely handsome (maybe not in those exact words). His son mirrors his looks yet decades of studying into dark magic withers those attractive features he was birthed into from his Muggle father, and instead turns into a snake-like man due to his extensive magical learning and intuition in the wizarding world.

*** From HPatHBP, Chapter 20: "It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become. He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was as pale as the snow glittering on his shoulders."

This is him after he had created the Diadem Horcrux, the last one he made before Harry. In many ways, he was defiling the memory of his father by ruining his own features, maybe?
