I read a fic a while ago, never saved it. I can't remember much of it but Harry ends up living with Snape and Dumbledore.

I believe that Dumbledore became in charge of Snape after the war, they found out about Harry's home life I think and agreed to let him stay with them.

Can't remember much, it's been a year if not longer since I read it, so apologizes for not remembering more of it.

If anyone knows what I'm talking about please tell me the name of the fic. Or if there's another fic where Harry is staying with Snape and Dumbledore let me know, I'm thinking it was Snape and Dumbledore and not just Snape.

Thanks for the help, appreciate it if anyone remembers it.

Thank you heresy23 for finding it! And if anyone is curious it's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5953863/1/A-Patrol-Changes-Everything]]


** Did it involve a house where doors opened to wherever you wanted? Dumbledore and Snape tag team raise an abused Harry and perform legilimens and remove some harmful memories to help him cope?
