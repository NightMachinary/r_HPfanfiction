Instead of siding with the Order, who betrays Harry after Voldemort's defeat and tries to kill him as per Dumbledore's plan, Ron and his entire family sacrifice themselves to save Harry in vain. Ron is rewarded by the gods with the chance to go back in time at the age he died at and under a different identity to prevent Harry's fate and stopping Voldemort as well. His younger self also exists as is the original timeline Ron belonged to.
