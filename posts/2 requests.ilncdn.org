Hey! I'm looking for 2 different types of fics! First of all, both would need to be completed. Anyways, the first fic is where Lily and James never died, but Harry is still the BWL. And he has a sister. The second story is if Sirius (with the help of Remus) raised Harry, and was never accused of betrayal. And I would rather Harry have a sister in this too, or Sirius adopts or something of the sort. You see, I'm in a mood for fics with a sister ðŸ˜‚ If anyone has a suggestion, let me know! Btw, I'm writing this at 1:00 am, so sorry if you can't really understand it...


** It's not /quite/ the same, but Harriet and her "cousin" (Sirius' son) Arcturus have a near-sibling relationship in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense). It's an AU where Tom Riddle did some introspection and decided to pursue politics instead of Horcruxes, so there was never a war, the Potters and all the Marauders are alive and well, but non-purebloods are banned from Hogwarts. And Riddle's aiming to restrict half-blood marriages next.

I avoided reading it for a while because the summary sounded a bit ordinary, but once I started, I quickly found that it's a very original story, weaving a whole new world that's merely inspired by canon rather than retreading it.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
