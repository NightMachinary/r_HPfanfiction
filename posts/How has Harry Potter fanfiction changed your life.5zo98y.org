** It destroyed my social life, but I never liked other people much anyway. Fictional characters that I can relate to, but don't have to actually interact with are much more appealing.

*** I can relate to that. A part of me understands that by falling more and more into fictional worlds I am basically digging my own grave but another part just merrily starts on another 100k+ story. Who needs real people anyway?

** It was there for me during a rough time and gave me a welcome escape, as well as a great way to keep myself stimulated in a boring job.

Now that time has passed and I'm at a happy, exciting point in my life, it's actually having a negative effect and has changed from comforting to stressful. My job is now interesting and challenging and the daydreams about fanfic are becoming an irritating nuisance. I can now fill my evenings with fun, happier things than before so there's no great pull to write- which makes me feel guilty about keeping readers waiting and not fulfilling promises to write a sequel. Not that there's even any time any longer - I don't have those long train journeys I used to have, and I work longer hours with more social commitments. I've turned off email alerts for reviews because, no matter how kindly phrased and well intentioned the constructive criticism is, it no longer feels useful and just gets me down when it's the first thing I read in the morning. It's not so much life getting in the way, but more that life is moving in a direction where fanfic doesn't really fit any more. It might be time for me to step away.

This isn't a flounce post. I'm still hoping suddenly something will kick in and I'll have the urge to write again. But I might start drifting away, I guess.

** It first was a great way to avoid the post book depression that comes with finishing the series. And it has provided hours of enjoyment.

But it definitely has negatively impacted my drive to get personal tasks and goals accomplished. For example, I'm writing a screenplay and fanfic provides an easy and unwelcome distraction from completing it.

It also has made me a bit too obsessive about the HP world. Before finding fanfic, when I did a reread of the series, I'd be sad for a while but then move on with my life. Now it's like I can't go 30 minutes without thinking about a character and fanfic is definitely to blame.

I think the more you read fanfic, the more the characters seem real. You interact with them every single day. It's not that healthy, but fanfic is addictive. There is so much out there that you can read and read and never get through it all.

But I don't think fanfic has negatively affected my life. I think it's a symptom of stagnation in it and unhappiness with certain aspects of my life, particular my boring job. If I had an exciting job or was doing something I was passionate, I doubt I'd have the time/desire to read much.

** An unbelievable timesink when welcome, very effective procrastination when unwelcome.

It cost me way too much time in some situations in my life.

** I have a horribly addictive personality. In middle school and early high school, I was obsessed with maps and with Eastern Europe. Then, with RP-intensive MUDs. These larger phases are generally interspersed with spare months of doing nothing but one thing, including drawing nonstop or writing or running. It's like I can only focus on one thing at a time.

Right now, and since mid last year, it's been HP fanfic. This phase has lasted a lot longer than I thought it would. When I eventually do drop it, I'm sure it'll be cold turkey just like most everything else until I get roped back in like six months later. It's a drain on my time. Yet, so are my other 'hobbies'. I'm used to it.

** Bucking the trend here; I mostly see positives.

I have become much more confident in my writing- I've had to truly consider how an audience will read what I present, and how to pare it down to the essentials. I'm much more at ease with committing to long projects with multiple milestones, as I've proven to myself that a 50 (or 66) chapter epic is not beyond my capabilities. Having an audience has toughened me to criticism and opened my eyes to the difference between criticizing a work vs. criticizing the author.
