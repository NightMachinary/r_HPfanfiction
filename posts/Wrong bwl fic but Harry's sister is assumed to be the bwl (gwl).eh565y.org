:END:
I'm sure this was a fic but I cant find it and am a little worried I'd made it up in my head.

His sister was called Rose or Rosalyn? And Harry was left with the Dursleys in cliche wrong bwl fashion but gets brought back to Hogwarts. Rose (or whatever her name was) is struggling with learning magic and is a brat (and all those other good cliche things) but Harry is doing just fine?

I think there's a scene where they point out that Harry already mastered the patronus while Rose is still barely managing a wisp?

I don't think it was slash but Snape did help mentor at some point and so did Remus.

If you have any clue what this fic is, if it's been deleted or even if you've also read it but don't remember anything else please let me know! Would like to know I'm not imagining it.
