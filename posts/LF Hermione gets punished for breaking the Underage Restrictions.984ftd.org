Hermione's quote when they first meet her "I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me" breaking the Underage Magic rule, are there any fics where she gets a warning, punished, or just given a telling off about it, and it's brought up?


** IIRC, there was a bashfic someone (Rorschach's Blot? Someone from DLP?) posted where Hermione got expelled without warning before she even started Hogwarts for doing that. The actual fic was a dialogue between her leading or representing the Muggles who think they had infiltrated the wizards and Harry leading or representing the wizards, who had in fact stopped them. It's been a decade, perhaps, so I don't recall the name.

  An assortment of Harry Potter one shots. Though listed as "Humor/General," the collection also contains Drama, Horror, Family, and Tragedy, as well as a few experimental fiction stories as I work out my stylist chops. Contain crossovers with several fictional worlds, including the Cthulhu Mythos, Starship Troopers, Star Wars, and James Bond.

*** That was one of the ones i was looking for. I do want to see her getting in trouble and told not to do it again or she WILL be expelled though.
