Tom Marvolo Riddle was a prodigy when it came to magic. A great wizard, prefect and a Head Boy, Award for Special Services to Hogwarts, a feared Dark Lord scant few years after graduating... What he didn't learn, was proper navigation. He just never wanted nor needed to, since all that was needed for apparition was a good image of the destination - not the relative position of places between he travelled. A graph, not a grid. As a result, when he ran away after being disembodied by unusually persistent redhead and her spawn and tried to find some of his followers, he ended up in Albania. He didn't know how - it just happened. In his defence, the Killing Curse is not known for its curative properties in regards to mental capacity.\\
Fortunately for him, he found Quirinus Quirrel, who at the very least knew how to return to Britain. Lord Voldemort was back in business.

After being thwarted yet again, and he was most irritated with the Potter spawn by that time, Lord Voldemort resumed his search for a capable minion - he had thought that Quirrel would be it, but apparently not. Unfortunately, his bad sense of direction had him zooming over the ocean once again, though this time northwards.

If it was just that, it would not bee too bad - unlucky, sure, but he'd find a power hungry fool eventually, and resume his plans with some delay. This was not to be. As he flew, the air suddenly felt chilly and forebonding, a notable feat given he had no body and thus no nerve endings at the time, and Darkness descended.

The shade of Tom Riddle had unknowingly found the one Dementor outside the Azkaban Island. The dread creature had been returning to its home after completing its duties at the Ministry and noticed an errant soul. Since it was not embodied, it was not forbidden to consume it - and there were no witnesses anyway. '/What's the worst that could happen?'/ thought Dementor as it sucked up the struggling, mutilated piece of soul-stuff and continued on its way.

***** Voldemort looked down at his map "Where the heck am I now?"

Harry rubbed the back of his head "you're at Hogwarts mate."

Voldemort jumped not expecting Harry to be right in front of him and threw away his map, brandishing his wand. "AHA So I am! And now I can finally get my revenge!"

*** Funny enough, Rowling actually wrote the confusion into the seventh book. Ron sarcastically agreed to going to Albania to search for a Horcrux on the grounds that "It shouldn't take us more than a day to search a whole country."

**** It's related to Albion, but both forms were used (also Alba):

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alba][As time passed that kingdom incorporated others to the southern territories. It became re-Latinized in the High Medieval period as "Albania" (it is unclear whether it may ultimately share the same etymon as the modern Albania).]]

There is also a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_Albania][third Albania]] in Caucasus.

*** Have you ever breathed in real fast in a forest and got the taste of wet leaf without actually having any leaves in your mouth? That's how I imagine souls tasting (former Soul Eater fan). And as for Moldyshorts' soul, I'd go with "breathing in real fast too close to the city dump"

***** I used to watch Soul Eater while high (entirely legal in my state) and for some reason that idea of souls tasting like "a flavor that's more smell than taste" really stuck with me.

Maybe some super-nice person's soul tastes like "bakery making cinnamon rolls" smell, or Moldyshorts' trashheap soul. Dumbledore's soul probably tasted like lemon drops, he consumed so many of them.

****** I am glad you clarified the legality of weed. Also, that's very interesting. Not the weed part(which also kinda is), the soul part. So what do you think Hermione's soul tastes like? I imagine it would taste like the smell that you get on opening a new book. Harry probably tastes like Treacle tart. Also, this conversation is getting weirder and weirder by the second.

******* I clarify the legality because I've come across some proper psychos online. Most people give not a single shit, but one in a million gets testy about it.

I think Harry's soul would taste like flying: sun-warmed wood and high altitude air, maybe that back-of-the-throat musk that treacle has

Ron, I think, would be Sunday dinner smell and black pepper and just a little bit of bitter

Hermione likely would be book smell and autumn and sugar quills
