** My new fic A Grim Odyssey deals a lot with those two issues, mainly depression. It's part 3 of my [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1221728][Elder Tales trilogy]], but I've added a summary at the start if you want to read this on its own. Hope you're doing ok irl, and if not, that you can find some fics in this thread that can help you a bit!

Its about how life settles back to normal at Hogwarts but nothing is actually normal anymore. Its a bit on the nose for me but its good writing with decently realistic outcomes. Things get a bit OOC but not terribly.

  Hermione Granger returns to Hogwarts to help rebuild the shattered castle the summer after the war. She and the other summer resident - and eventually their friends - have to come to terms with how the war broke more than just the walls of the building. Follows multiple Hogwarts students through '8th year' and one additional year of early adulthood. COMPLETE.
