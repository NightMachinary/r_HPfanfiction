** Linkffn(Resurgence by Arcturus Peverell; The Relucant Champion; Wet Surprise; From Southampton to New York and Beyond; Harry Potter and the Magic of Life; Honour Thy Blood; Runic Animagi; Days to Come by chris400ad; The Amalgamation Agreement; Muggle-Raised Champion; The Merging; Contractual Invalidation by R-Dude; Not Quite so Boring; The Lion Tamer)

The other works of Dorothea Greengrass & James Spookie. There are other decent Harry/Daphne stories but that should keep you going for a while.

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

***** Tracey was trying to set them up? It has been a while since i read it but i remember the complete opposite. Harry has a bit of a crush on Daphne while Tracey had a crush on him and Harry was beginning to notice her. Classic love triangle kind of thong except that Daphne wasn't very interested IIRC but i might have to do a re-read.

Tonks is obviously out of the picture for now and i think i recall an authors note about how she wasn't originally supposed to play that big of a role which is why the author more or less removed her.

******* Alright, I just re-read the last chapter and it seems to me like Daphne and Hermione are working together to set up Harry and Tracey, they both like each other but Harry is still kind of hung up on Tonks.

That's only the last chapter though. I'm no expert on the workings of a teenage girls' mind but i imagine it could very well be that Daphne actually is interested in Harry but knows that Tracey is too and is therefore trying to get over it by setting them up. (This is rather convoluted but i've actually witnessed this before so the possibility exists and i'm unwilling to do a full re-read to find out if it's actually the case :P)

**** The first chapter are harder to read indeed but when he come back to Hogwarts it's really good. Except if you are a Hermione fanatic, in this case you aren't going to like it.

** Linkffn(Contractual Invalidation by R-dude) is what got me into Harry x Daphne in the first place. Taking place post-war, it's a very well written and fun read, with a rather Slytherin-like Harry (though he wasn't) and appropriately snooty but likeable Daphne. It doesn't bash anyone either, which is always a huge plus for me.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

*** Look at the options:

Hermione - Bossy, annoying, tends to have fics where Harry can beat Voldemort if only he would just read more of the Hogwarts library.

Ginny - Fangirl, boring, loves Harry too much to have the conflict a good story needs. Can be done well but often boring.

Slash - Not for everyone's tastes.

Parvati/Lavendar/Katie - Almost no stories.

Susan/Hannah - Through the power of Hufflepuff teamwork we can triumph! /s Although these pairings have great stories available but a lot of boring fluff too.

Ravenclaw pairing - Almost always Seer!Luna who tells Harry what he needs to do to win. Few Cho or Padma stories which is a shame.

Pansy/Milicent - Meant to be nasty, repulsive people in canon. Almost all fics are about them leading secret lives to survive in the Mafia-like world of a boarding school dorm.

Hence people turn to the remaining options for interesting stories and they are Tonks or Fleur or Daphne. Tonks and Fleur are quite a bit older and very attractive so Harry's got slim chances there and it can make for weird stories because no-one wants to read about a relationship based on letters sent while Harry is in boarding school. Hence, Daphne become a major figure for those who have been reading Fanfiction for a while.

*** That's entirely subjective. Filtering for Harry and Daphne as tagged characters on ff.net gets you 1.3k result.

Just as a comparison:

Harry + Hermione: 27.8k

Harry + Ginny: 20.9k

Harry + Draco: 40.7k

Harry + Fleur (something that i see a lot of people complaining about too): 872

Obviously these are only the tagged characters, not necessarily pairings and sometimes people only tag Harry and no one else but it's still a decent indicator about what's popular and Daphne is fairly low on the list.

*** There's a world of people outside Gryffindor. Daphne is Slytherin and not Draco (so not slash) and not +Pansy/Millicent+ /Pansy or Millicent/ (canon unattractive). The Greengrasses are part of the "Sacred Twenty-Eight" which means there's a family history there to be developed.

A good Daphne story should introduce cunning into the plot which is actually on Harry's side (eventually, at least), and also bring into play politics or family history (world development, ancient magics, etc.) giving Harry another or broader playing field (freeing the story from the constraints of canon plot).

Or she's just the fanon default for a Slytherin tsundere which some people enjoy.

*** Because it lends broader perspective to the story than the usual 'Slytherin = evil and untrustworthy'. She represents a fresh character with little to no information about her. We know that her family is pureblood, has a long history, and that her sister married Malfoy and had some ancient curse on her. Its a nice blank slate that can be taken in so many directions.

It is NOT common pairing or character in any way or form. The only way it can be considered so is if you are thinking of the recent increase. Overall it is very rare. By comparison there are thousands of stories featuring Hermione(yuck) or Draco(#/%^{%}/)or Severus(^{*#^{+%!!!)}} and not necessarily paired with Harry.

Its a refreshing change to see someone uncommon in a story rather than the same old characters for the millionth time.

*** Why do you care? I'll never really get why people complain about other people's preferences when it comes to fics, unless it involves pedophilia or something. You don't have to read these, you know? Just don't open the comments up, it's not hard.
