I read a story a while ago where in order to cast spells you needed to use certain components which were consumed in the casting of the spell, i.e., feathers, powders, and the like. Things which are typically associated with potion making. I think Harry might have been one of the few in the story that was able to cast without using the components. It's been quite a long time since I saw the story and it may have since been deleted from ff.net, but if anyone has anything that might help me find it, it would me much appreciated.


** It irritates me that I know the fic you're talking about but can remember no more than you can haha. There's just one other thing - did it perhaps have a medieval AU setting? One where McGonagall arrives to take Harry into the wizarding world by carriage? I may be mixing it up in my mind with another fic.

*** It's been awhile since I read it, but I think linkffn(6390709) uses material requirements for spellcasting, in the same vein as D&D. I definitely remember Hermione using components for cantrips.

*** I don't believe so, but it's been such a long time since I read it that I might be mistaken. If the medieval part rings any bells posting that would be awesome.

** I'm not sure what fic in particular that is, but that spellcasting system sounds very consistent with the mechanics of the Wizard class from D&D, so that might be a direction in which to look.
