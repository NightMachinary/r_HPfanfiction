There are other ways of gaining power and accomplishing ambitious projects. Like creating a successful business.

*** I'd love to read a story about the broom industry and everything that goes on there. Pesky new government regulations on safety, corporate espionage aided by magic to steal the latest developments in hover charms and questionable business methods of +bribery+ lobbying to keep the flying carpet competition out.

** I guess the main characters in HP and the Secret of Atlantis are ambitious: they are magical archaeologists on the trail of ancient magic. They're not anything like dark lords, though they do battle at least one.

  Harry feels that it's stupid to alienate those who control your money. See how a bunch of first years treat the goblins and what comes of it. These kids are going to cause quite a storm. Should be fun. A fast paced, happy, story about changing their destiny. It all starts at Gringotts.
