Ignoring any non-canon information(Like the house-elf bond being symbiotic), what is your ideal solution to house elves?

For me, it is not blanket "Free the elves."

1. Make abuse of house elves illegal. Full stop. This includes things like beating house elves, berating house elves, and forcing house elves to punish themselves.(Neither Sirius Black nor Lucius Malfoy would be allowed to keep elves, thanks to their treatment of Kreacher and Dobby respectively).
2. Legally require any elf to be provided clothes(released from their bond), upon request.
3. Ensure House Elves are educated on their right to be freed from their bond at any time.

This may result in all elves eventually being freed, but it would hopefully avoid most of them suffering the same way Winky did when she was given clothes.(I'm not sure as to her ultimate fate in the books, but the way she was going, she likely would have drank herself to an early death).


** I think that step one is to limit how far elves can be compelled. As things stand, with the right set of orders, an elf could be forced to beg for continued slavery against their true will. That shouldn't happen. They should be free to think and say what they choose.

Step two would probably be to give elves the right to request freedom. Since their service is so one-sided, I think it's fair for them to be able to stop at any time if they so choose. Most would not, at least not in the current generation, but the right should be there.

Further steps would largely depend on what the elves actually want once they have the freedom to say it. There's no point forcing wands and coin into their hands, just leave open the doors of the shops and banks.

*** They need the right to refuse orders. Maybe something based on Asimov's three laws of robotics?

*** This, but also I am just [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister/_build/html/13_family_everything.html][working on it]] ... it seems to me that their relationship with humans is the desire to be part of a family is superior to anything else. See the discussion between Hermione and Dobby, I put there. All comments and objections are more than welcome.

(the story is being published on linkao3(Brother and Sister by mcepl), but this chapter is not ready yet)

  This starts somewhere in between chapter 37 and 38 of “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix” by J. K. Rowling. Harry just learnt about the Prophecy and wrecked Professor Dumbledore's office, but wounded members of the Dumbledore Army are still in the hospital wing of Hogwarts. He thought that the mysterious prophecy is the last surprise of that summer. How wrong one can get? One of those stories of “the summer between the fifth and sixth year, Harry gets his issues together”, but hopefully less tropey and with a twist.Response to my own challenge at Reddit.This is very much Work in Progress, so you can expect changes even to the published chapters. Comments, review, objections and accusations are all welcome.

*** For what it's worth, I think it's the best answer I can give with the information provided. It addresses the worst excesses of wizards, and technically gives elves their freedom without breaking their bonds in a fashion they'd find traumatic.

** Yeah, I think prosecuting abusers of house elves is the most urgent thing. I hadn't thought of ensuring house elves know their rights as a step but it seems obvious now.
