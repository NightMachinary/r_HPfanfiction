So I've been searching time traveling stories but nothing nice came up. So here i am.

Some requirements i want to say before:

/A long story/

/Please NO Snarry and please to don't put Harry with Ginny./

/Harry must have changed somewhat, He just went threw a war, we can't expect him to be all dandy and flowers and stuff/

/If one of main characters dies before Harry time traveled, have him at least be affected when seeing them again/

/I, for one hate Snape no matter what he did in the war, he hated a child that didn't even know his parents or Remus and Sirius wasn't even in the picture , he saw them instead of Harry, who is just a child people put their burdens on. So even if Harry has a grudging respect, there will always be a small part of him that will forever resent him/

/A good plot with good spelling and grammar/

So that's it , any ship is welcomed here!


** Well, I mean, I have one but Harry isn't the time-traveling character... linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them).

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours.

** My favorites have Harry/Ginny. Sorry!

(The age thing is handled differently; one sends her back too, another doesn't actually have them officially in a relationship, just close friends who know that more might develop.)
