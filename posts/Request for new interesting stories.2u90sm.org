Looking for good Harry/Severus stories. where severus is either harrys dad or adopts him. preferably with no Harry/Draco. I just can't stand reading about a gay Harry. No offense to those who like that. Im just tired of sifting through the many badly written stories on ff.net.

*** Can confirm. A Year Like None Other and sequels are quite awesome. Also, I recommend the [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/notevenhere/LC.html][Lily's Charm]] series

#+begin_quote
  In a story that spans two decades, Lily and Severus attempt to dispel the power of the Dark Mark after her life is threatened by Eileen Prince. Seventeen years later, Harry uncovers a long-buried truth which changes the course of his life. AU.

and [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/gatewaygirl/BM.html][Blood Magic]]

#+begin_quote
  Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry safe, but his relatives are expendable. Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry looking like his adoptive father, but it's wearing off. Blood is a bond, but so is the memory of hate -- or love.
