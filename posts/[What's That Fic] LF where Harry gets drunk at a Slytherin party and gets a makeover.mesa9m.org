Read only part of this one, what I remember is: A later-year Hogwarts fic, maybe fifth/sixth year? Voldemort was already defeated, I think; in any case, things are fairly relaxed between the houses. Draco has been trying to get Harry to come to a Slytherin party held on a regular basis in their common room. Upper years only, lots of drinking and general obnoxiousness. Harry finally agrees, gets drunk, and then gets a makeover from several Slytherin girls who often do this at the parties for fun. Some gender feels emerge for Harry as a result. Draco thought he might be attracted to Harry, then realizes Harry isn't his type, and ends up getting together with a more-confident Neville.
