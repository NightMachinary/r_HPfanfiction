I've read a handful of fictions now where Harry is sorted into Ravenclaw instead of Gryffindor, but all have given him a considerable intelligence boost. Ravenclaw isn't necessarily all about extreme natural intelligence, it's also lateral thinking, creativity, putting what you have to the most effective use. House placements are also about what the individual most values. Fictions already often give Harry a boost in skill and raw power and honestly, the canon Harry has enough shiny things to last a dozen lifetimes. So I would like to read a fiction about a Ravenclaw Harry without that boosted intelligence, or at least only a slightly boosted intelligence. Does anybody know of any?


** Linkffn(Hallowed) has a Ravenclaw Harry who's exceptional enough to be picked as a legitimate Triwizard champion in his 6th (7th? Don't remember) year, but he seems fairly down to earth, just a Ravenclaw who works hard and likes to study.

  For a thousand years the Sorting Hat has put students where they fit best. Only a handful of times throughout history has it ever been said the Hat picked wrongly. In the year of 1991, that's the only thing people were saying. On the one-thousandth-and-one year of Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat decided to change things around. Pity it didn't tell anyone beforehand.

Definitely not the main focus of the work and it has not aged particularly well over 14 (!) years because many of its ideas were overused in the last decade, but it has a Ravenclaw Harry and spans 7 years.

** The Harry in my fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12706296/1/The-Resident-Spy][*The Resident Spy*]] linkffn(12706296) fits, and doesn't. Initially what gets him into Ravenclaw isn't that he's exceptionally smart, it's that the way he processes information and views the world gives him access to magic that most wouldn't think about. He gets buffed throughout the story because [plot] but he's far from being The God of All Intelligence and Wisdom. I took some pains to show that there's more to Ravenclaw than just reading a bunch of books and being an intelligence munchkin.

  It is our choices that show who we are, much more than our abilities. Of course, your abilities are what prevent you from being killed. The choices you make with those abilities are what Dumbledore was probably going for when he left Harry with the Black Widow. Hopefully no one was paying attention.

If you're reading this comment, avid Harry Potter fanfiction connoisseur, stop. Read this story, instead.

It's... brilliant. It's absolutely brilliant. I love this story's Harry. This story's Natasha has raised him in a such a beutiful way.

  "The day you came into my life," she continued, curling her legs up underneath her, "I had just picked you up because I needed to leave the safe house I was in as quickly as possible. The only protections we had were an assurance by a man I did not fully trust. You were waking up and I was trying to think of what I needed to say to calm you. Instead of crying when you opened your eyes, you smiled at me."

  [... ]

  "That is who you will always be to me, no matter where life takes you. You'll always be that little child who looked at me and smiled."

It's just so beautiful, and the Harry in this story is an understanding, caring child. I'm honestly running out of things to say because I want to jump back into the story but, seriously - /read it/.

***** Theoretically, more or less anything has at least a miniscule probability of it being true. Both in our world and in the magical world. Perhaps the moon landings /were/ faked, and there is a hugely elaborate conspiracy to cover it up! I certainly wouldn't bet money on it, and I wouldn't, on basis of available evidence, take it seriously as a viable theory. The latter part (i.e. the evidence) is key here; there is a threshold above which the theory can be considered viable. The threshold might be lower for the magical world than it is for ours, but it definitely does exist. Luna Lovegood's theories, for the most part, do not meet even this lowered threshold. No theory should be taken seriously on the basis that it /might/ just be true.

I should say, I don't think the belief in unknown creature X is inherently ridiculous. I also don't think I would take this theory seriously (without /really/ credible evidence) from someone who maintains the Rotfang conspiracy, believes that Fudge bakes Goblins in pies, etc. If (say) Minerva McGonagall believes that creature X might possibly exist because of reasons Y and Z, then I'm all ears.

As an aside, Luna scorns all those who don't believe in her flimsy theories as narrow-minded herself. Bullying aside, and leaving out the fact that Luna's theories are /actually/ absurd, how is she any different from those that mock her beliefs?
