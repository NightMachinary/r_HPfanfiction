Would you buy the idea of reincarnation in a fic?


** I write a lot of reincarnation fics and it usually works well if you found it well.

** I've seen it done well in several fics. I enjoy reading "Master of Death" stories that explore how a person might develop to be the same or different in a second life.

** I've seen it done well a few times, not so well in others, just depends on how the author does it.

** As long as it doesn't involve angst.. I hate the broody reincarnation trope. "Oh my god, Ginny and my kids, bubububu". To be fair, it can be used well and i've seen it used well in fanfiction before, it's just that when the fanfiction is 50k words long and Harry complains and broods for 30k words it get's annoying..

​

I would like it if the main character was reincarnated in another part of the world or in another universe, I think that opens up alot of interesting options.

​

If you were asking if i think reincarnation would be plausable in the HP universe i would say yes. considering that souls are affected by magic in the HP universe and Voldemort went as far as splitting his soul. I would think that spells involving reincarnation would be possible.

** Completely. Souls are shown to exist, so I don't see why reincarnation can't.

**** Habit mostly. I have started to do it a bit less, and if asked I won't reply that way in a conversation with said person. Itt's just how I am though.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
