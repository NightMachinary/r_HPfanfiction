*** Wdym?

I want Harry acting like a normal teenager, not a fucking warrior with infinite money.

While they have a place in the fanfiction eco system, I would much rather there be an over abundance of normal teenage fics.

*** Yes and no. Arrogant, definitely; pleased to find himself famous, yes, because it's useful; treats rules as guidelines, neither breaking them for fun nor obeying them for the sake of it; but he isn't all that mediocre. He'll either bring about a utopia or a giant smoking crater. He isn't much like James Potter, either (he may bear some resemblance to his adoptive father, but that certainly isn't whom Snape was describing). He isn't a jock (loves flying, but hates Quidditch), nor a bully at heart (and when he sees signs of heading in that direction, he's quite repentant), and is quite a good friend to people he actually respects, although he doesn't necessarily respect the general population.
