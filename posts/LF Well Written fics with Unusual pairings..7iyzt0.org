I recently got into Hermione/Thorfinn Rowle, and loved them. I've read all the completed, long chapter ed ones on FF.net, so please don't recommend those.

I'd like very long, well written, no slash, preferably with a Hermione pairing, but unusual pairings, especially with Death Eaters. I've read the "The ____ Mage Captive" all versions, but any with Dolohov, Rowle, Lucius, LeStrange, or any other dark rare pairs I'll take. Just as long as they are lengthy. Thanks!


** If you like Death Eater pairings, I wrote a Thorfinn/Ginny. Although if you're in the DEE FB group you've probably already seen it. As to whether or not it's well written, you can be the judge of that. Rated M but hasn't gotten to the sexy bits yet. It's a Voldemort wins AU. (It's still a WIP, sorry)
