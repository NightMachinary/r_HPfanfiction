Someone asked me for DeadWoodPecker's stories so I've uploaded all that I have and am posting it here. This should contain all of the stories she had posted on ff.net and ao3 before she deleted them. I didn't organize them, though, so there might be doubles from between the two sites and one copy may be more complete than the other. There are at least two file types for each story.

**** You realize fictionhunt's archive system is what cause the issues to begin with right? It's posts stories without authors permission.

**** Probably should do so before broadcasting a link to her stories. They are “her” stories after all.

******** That's very rude. Since she took her stories down due to emotional and mental distress. You should create a conscience for yourself.

If she asks will you delete your post?

*********** Thank you, bonesda, but there's no real way to stop people sharing fic, and since I've used stuff like that before to download my own illicit copies of stuff, i can't be toooooo hypocritical. It's too bad it's been shared by an asshole, though.
