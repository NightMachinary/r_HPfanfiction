what it says on the title. It could be Harry turns his arm to a prosthetic arm with magical devices inside or something like that. Or maybe Harry creates redundant organs and operates on himself. Rituals, nanomachines, potions. It doesn't matter as long as he does something. I have read madness at the gate and I'm looking for something like that.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** Just want to say, this is an incredibly good fic. It's called *Normalcy, by notadryeye*. Another link is [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=204407][here]].

I've read this twice now, and imo it's a very well-written fic. It's long, dark, sweet, and has all sorts of ups and downs.

It's a totally AU Harry/Tonks story where Harry is quite of a mad scientist who is experimenting with his own body. I do remember he augments it at some point.
