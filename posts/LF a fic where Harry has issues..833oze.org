Fanfiction where Harry is depressed, suicidal, abused, has an eating disorder or where he self harms. Basically anything along those lines. Actual suicide attempts (successful or not) are appreciated.


** I actually had a fic like this planned out a while ago. I ended up dropping it because it got too much for me mentally. The fic just exhausted me because a lot of it hit home. It also got insanely realistic because I was able to pull experiences and use them inside of it. It was also slash, so I couldn't really ask for help here because most people here despise slash.

Anyway, the plotline was rather simple, if you desire it.

Voldemort didn't start any war until Harry was around eight or nine, he never died or made any Horcrux. Tom Riddle was the DADA professor, while his alter ego, Voldemort, begun a terrible reign. Harry developed some kind of hero-worship/one-sided attraction to the professor.

Skipping a few things, the attraction continues and Harry ends up admitting he loves Tom Riddle, despite the age and that they were both males. He falls head over heels and gets manipulated by Riddle, handing his brother to the man, who ends up murdered. Despite it all, Harry takes the blame and says he killed his brother. He ends up in Azkaban and kills himself, devastated that Riddle didn't save him.

It seems so simple when I put it like that, but that was what I had planned out to happen. I can start writing it if you desire, but it'd take a while.

  Waiting. He was always waiting. He'd already buried one best friend and now the other will follow. There was nothing he could do or say. There was no Harry without Hermione. Ron witnessed the beginning and now he must accept the end. HHr. 4parts Complete!

*** Thank you! Normally dislike harmony cause I've always seen then more like siblings, but definitely seems like the kind of fic I'm looking for. I'll have to give it a shot.

*** Yes please! I honestly don't understand why a lot of people on this sub are so adverse to it. It seems to be dominated by harmony shippers, which was weird when I first came to this sub cause I read most of my Fan fiction on Ao3 which is mostly slash. Sorry bout the lil rant, but this genuinely confuses me. Anyway, give me all the gayness /grabby hands/ :)

**** Here's allll my gay recs! If you haven't already, you could crosspost to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/][HPSlashFic]], they might be able to help too. :)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682349/1/A-Reckless-Frame-of-Mind][A Reckless Frame of Mind]] deals with Harry attempting suicide. It has a sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3759027/1/A-Determined-Frame-of-Mind][A Determined Frame of Mind]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2721089/1/Draco-s-Boy][Draco's Boy]] deals with a Harry who's being abused and his frame of mind as a result. This one really brought a lot of feels.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10289053/1/None-of-that-mattered][None of that Mattered]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10559372/1/Human-Touch][Human Touch]] both deal with self harm. (It's a shameless self plug, since Human Touch is my own fic, but it fits your request!)
