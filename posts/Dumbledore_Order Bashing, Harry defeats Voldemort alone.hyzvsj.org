I like a good Dumbles bashing... stealing from vaults, illegal marriage contract, paying friends to spy/be friends, etc. but;

Instead of being a good little pawn Harry finds out about and hunts down the horcruxes (or the fic bypasses this trope altogether) and defeats Voldemort by himself throwing all of Dumbledore's plans into the toilet leading to Dumbledore scrambling trying to find a way to get Harry under his thumb, in the grave, or in Azkaban.

Basically i'm just looking for a fic where Harry breaks free and kills Voldemort with some Dumbles bashing like the title says... the rest is just me rambling wishful thinking.
