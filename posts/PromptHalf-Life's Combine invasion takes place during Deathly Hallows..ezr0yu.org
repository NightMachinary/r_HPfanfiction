ANYWHO~

The combine manatee-spiders (official terminology btw) either get too close to a MacUSA magical area, and or injure/kidnap/kill/etc a MacUSA citizen. Aurors are called. "The fuck is this!?" insert BOMBARDA! spam here. Then here comes the Manatee-bine death call.

Some guy in charge runs to the ICW for help. This is clearly a magical experiment gone wrong and we need help to contain this incident to keep the statute of secrecy from being broken.

They win. While obliviating everybody along the way.

They still think it was a magical experiment.

​

Anywho, some government bigwig was digging through research grants and finds something about Black Mesa "Hey, didn't we give them money for this?" (it was covered up after the first incident) "Well, let's give them some money and start it up!".

On the day of the Resonance Cascade 2.0 (patent pending), The Gman appears, ready to drop off our mute crowbar wielding psychopath. "Wait, what? Weren't there supposed to be combine here? Oh well, Gordon, you already did this once, time to do this again!" And then he dumps Gordon there.

Rinse, Reuse, Repeat.

*** Actually, this is the Combine invasion. They have troops from across time and space. The Wizarding World stands no chance. They defeated muggles in seven hours. Maybe the wizards last eight. Remember, spells don't work unless you actually hit the damned things. The Combine would just send their quickest troops.
