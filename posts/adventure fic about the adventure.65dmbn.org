are there any good fics about the adventure and not the destination. ever since I was a kid I always loved books and movies where the character may not have an obvious goal or that goal may be so far away that the story becomes about the characters journey rather than the objective. ever since it came out I loved one piece because it wasn't about getting the one piece but about the journey to get there. I personally find it irritating how the adventure genre gets used interchangeably with action.

so my point is are there any fics that bring you into the journey of the characters and the adventure rather than the standard "must kill moldyshorts" or "my parents hate me and dumbledork is a bad goatfucker that I must kill" or "draco/Snape/Voldemort/whoeverthefuck oh Draco/Snape/Voldemort/whoeverthefuck wherefore art thou Draco/Snape/Voldemort/whoeverthefuck" etc. but about the adventure, the journey, the wonder, the sprinkle of danger but not to much, the sprinkle of romance but not unrealistic smut harem nonsense, the whatever it think I have my point across.


** linkffn(House of Potter Rebuilt) was kind of like this, I mean he was learning new stuff, and learning adventure spells but its abandoned, and sadly i haven't found any other fics with adventure.
