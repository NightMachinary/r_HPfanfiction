Please read it all so you know what I like and don't like:

Ones that have bashing written in the summary or whatever, I end up ignoring, but sometimes the warning bashing won't be written and it'll come out of nowhere.

No 11, 12 13 year old politics either please. I could see 14 or older become more interested (though it has to be somewhat believable), but not 13 or below.

No kid romance please. That's just a no on my end. 17 or older is fine, since that's suppose to be legal age in the Wizarding World.

No OP Harry, No Harem Harry, No Lord Potter. Only way I'd be okay with Lord Potter is if he was using it to help people or whatever, otherwise it's not my thing, to be honest.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing).

Can be on any site, anyone can be the main character, can have any warnings.

Would like for it to be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** Amber and Emerald or in spite of obstinate men/in spite of appearances. Both dont bash anyone. Sadly A&E and appearances havent been finished

  Over fifty people died at the Battle of Hogwarts. There are dozens of stories of loss, betrayal, heroism and sacrifice. These are some of those stories.
