After I read the information on the Potter family I couldn't help but notice that when Ralston Potter was in the Wizengamot the English Civil war was raging... and when Harvey was on the body the First World War was happening.

I've got the idea to do a pseudo-Historical fiction series on the Potter family during these important events, the Civil war, WW1, WW2 and finally finishing with a Marauder story. Just wondering if anyone would read my journey through Magical History and how the Potter family blundering through it.


** Absolutely! I would read the heck out of that, whether it is short vignettes or a long multi-chapter story. There aren't a whole lot of historical-fiction stories out there and I'd like to see more. These two come to mind linkffn(8596476;2948443) I'm not a fan of the Pottermore announcement because it is boring, and none of the information had any effect on the books. But I am a fan of people taking that new information and making it interesting! Go for it.

****** Fair enough. Good luck trying to avoid the endless minefield of cliches and tropes that has been growing over the years. Personally, as long you don't refer to anyone's eyes as 'orbs' and I'll be happy.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

** It would be tricky to do well, because canon HP is so lacking in a sense of having a believable history, but I'd love to read it if you pulled it off!
