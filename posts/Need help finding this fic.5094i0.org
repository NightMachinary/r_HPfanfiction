Few weeks back I read a story where Harry is reincarnation of Salazar Slytherin but the way he remembers it is by touch an artifact left by Salazar.

  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...

**** I will read this but again not quite. What I forgot to mention is that Harry 'remembers' that he is Salazar by touching an orb that Voldemort thought would grant him power.
