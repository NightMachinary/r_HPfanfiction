In my time travel fic ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28119780/chapters/68898909][Hbi Hr At]]), Harry buys a sculpture of a grim that can grow and animate into an actual grim-like dog when he wants it to. Originally, I was going to name him Grim, but now I'm thinking on naming him Mischief instead.

** Argos was the hound of Odysseus that was so loyal that he refused to die until he saw his master home again.

Shuck or Black Shuck is a grim-like dog that haunts the coastline of Eastern England.

Laelaps was the immortal hound the always caught its prey fated to chase the uncatchable Teumessian fox forever.

Hope these help.
