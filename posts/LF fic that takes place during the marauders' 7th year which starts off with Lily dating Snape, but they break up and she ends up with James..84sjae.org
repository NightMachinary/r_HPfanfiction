I read this fic a while ago on ff, but I can't seem to find it now. I think it was called "youth" or something along those lines. Lily is dating Snape in private and then they break up and she ends up sleeping with James. I think there was a sub plot about 2 gay death eater Slytherins, but I don't remember. If anyone has any idea about what I'm talking about I would be very grateful!


** it was 'youth' by olivieblake. she took it down because she used parts of it to publish original work, as she explained [[http://olivieblake.tumblr.com/post/160657856574/i-do-have-a-question-why-is-it-a-problem-to-have][here]]. you can ask her for a copy

  Lily Evans has spent years despising James Potter. He has spent just as long worshiping her. When seventh year pairs them Head Boy and Girl, each comes to realize that their judgment isn't quite what they thought it was. This is the same story that was over on Checkmated, but I completed it here. Prequel to Heroes for Ghosts. Warning: this story is a strong M rating.
