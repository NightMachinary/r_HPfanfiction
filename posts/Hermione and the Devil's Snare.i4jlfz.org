Hey there, made a little fanfiction based on these pictures: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Ninjartist/comments/ezv79v/hermione_and_that_devils_snare]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Ninjartist/comments/fqufz0/clothed_version_but_still_hot]]

This is my first attempt on something like this and I would love to hear some feedback. For those who are not interested in story, I marked the beginning of the lemon in CAPS.

Have fun ;)

--------------

Hermione Granger fell over. It was just moments ago that she heard a weird, slurping sound out of a corridor, while she was walking through the building.

All her friends were on the quidditch field, the Gryffindors were training for their next big match. Hermione however didn't want to be forced to see her friends playing this dangerous game. "C'mon mione, it'll be fun", "You're going to miss the training again", ... All that nonsense meant nothing to her. When she first got to Hogwarts she hated that game already, it was the one thing she wasn't able to teach herself by reading books and writing essays. After Harry became seeker in his first year by helping out Neville she at least watched the games, however still not approving of the sport. Now, years later, she began to distance herself again. The only time appropriate to visit the field for her were big matches, most commonly Gryffindor vs. Slytherin. But the training? Never again.

"Gotta study" was her usual excuse. Of course everyone immediately believed her, this was Hermione Granger after all. And so it became conventional for everybody to just leave her alone in the castle - To her own benefit, she thought. That way she could actually use the time to study. Of course she wasn't alone in the library, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Slytherin and even some Gryffindors weren't allowed at the training or simply didn't care.

Today was a bit different. Hermione got up late, she didn't hear the other girls leaving the dorm. She had already woken up but didn't realize it was morning already. Still not opening her eyes, she cuddled into her covers. She didn't get much sleep last night. For a change it wasn't the studying that kept her awake, however it did have something to do with the library. A few days ago Hermione requested a permit for the restricted section. To knock up her grades a bit she volunteered to write an essay about a dangerous creature from the woods. She didn't remember it's name anymore because that evening, when she got into the restricted section, her mind was distracted by something else. Walking through the library a book caught her eye. It was "The encyclopedia of spells and charms for the lonely maiden". Usually she didn't even pay attention to those kinds of books but thinking about it her body curiously began to move towards it by itself. Excited about the content of the book the girl looked around, quietly took the book out of the shelf and began to read. Of course she didn't plan to use one of the described spells anytime soon but reading about the pleasure and satisfaction one would experience by doing so Hermione started to feel a bit... weird. She had never felt like this before but it wasn't bad in any way. It was a great feeling, a different kind of joy...

While keeping on reading page after page another thing happened. By reading about many different kinds of those spells the girl started to feel that she was getting wet. Not just wet, she was so full of lust her skirt felt like a barrier. Just as the student began to undress herself a noise ripped her out of her trance. Steps started to get louder, someone was slowly walking towards her. Hermione quickly closed the book and tried to put it back into the shelf as Madam Pince, the librarian, suddenly stood right next to her. "What are you doing here miss Granger? The book you were looking for is this way." She pointed down the wall of bookshelves and looked at Hermione. "Oh, ahem... Uuuh, I just saw this... This book lying around and wanted to... To put it back into its... Uhm... Shelf..." The young student was stuttering, her mind was still fixed on a few pages she saw in the book. Madam Pince looked her in the eye with a strict look. Hermione clinched to the book and looked down. "Well then, just give me that book and go study for your essay. You haven't got all the time in the world." Reluctantly Hermione gave the book to Madam Pince, trying to casually turn it around, so that the librarian wouldn't see the cover. Madam Pince took it, turned it around, looked at the cover for a few seconds and then put it back into the shelf. Hermione was already around the corner and ten steps ahead of Madam Pince, who turned her head and gave Hermione's back a concerned look. "Wasn't it in the shelf an hour ago?" She mumbled to herself, "No, no... I'm probably thinking about some other encyclopedia..."

Now, after the essay was finished and almost forgotten Hermione still couldn't get the thought of some of the described spells out of her mind. Under the covers her hand slowly began to move down her body. Just as she was about to slide it under her panties she opened her eyes to see if everyone else was sleeping. She immediately realised that the sun was already up and everyone else left. For a moment Hermione bounced the thought of staying in bed and having some fun with herself around her head but then decided to go study, as planned.

With a swift look out the window, to see whether the quidditch field was already in use, the young student half nakedly rushed to her clothes, got dressed, picked up a few pieces of parchment paper and her quill & inc and stormed out the dorm. Downstairs in the common room, she saw a couple of students sitting by the fire, however she couldn't recognize them. One jump out the door, a quick "Thank youuu!" to the fat lady, a couple of stairs down to the corridor, sprinting around a corner she directly ran into Professor McGonagall. "Watch out, miss Granger, would you?!" Hermione just let out a quiet "Sorry Professor" and kept walking. Professor McGonagall, barely able to hear her student, paused a bit, turned her head and started to ask "Aren't you a bit late for...", but Hermione was already around another corner.

After her little incident at the corner Hermione started to walk extra slow. If it had been Snape instead of Professor McGonagall she would have already lost at least 50 points from Gryffindor.

Turning around into another corridor she heard a weird sound. She looked around to see where it came from but the corridor was completely empty. No student, teacher or house-elf who could have made that sound.

Again. This time Hermione was able to locate the direction from were it came from. It was a weird sound, but something she has already heard before. She just couldn't make out what it was exactly... Oh yes! Now she remembered. Curious if her memory was correct the young student slowly walked towards the direction from which the weird noise came from. The origin of it led her into a smaller, colder corridor. There was no windows, nor any torches in it. The further she walked, the colder it got. Eventually the corridor led up to a heavy wooden door. Hermione slowly put her hand on the doorknob and started to push. The lock was opened and the door itself seemed to be only leaned into its frame.

Behind the door was a dark, circular room. On one of the walls was a tiny window with a lot of dirt on it. The little light that was able to shine through helped Hermione see where she was. Even though she could barely spot anything she was able to make out the rough shape of the room. Right in the middle was some sort of pit, the walls were full of bookshelves. Without paying attention to the 'pit' the curious student began to walk alongside the wall. It was too dark to see every single book in detail but there was one that caught Hermione's eye: "The encyclopedia of spells and charms for the lonely maiden". Could it be? Did she find a secret entrance to the forbidden section? No, the room looked different, there was only one door and the corridor didn't seem to be well hidden. Unless... It must have been weeks ago when she read about it, but Hermione recently learned that there are ways to hide doors from the common eye. "There must be a spell on this room" she mumbled silently.

Lost in thought Hermione didn't realize what was happening behind her, in the pit she didn't pay any attention to. Something seemed to move towards her. Suddenly the young woman started to hear the noise again. She completely forgot about that. She tried to remember what she figured out the origin of the sound was. When she slowly came out of her trance and remembered what she thought it would be it already slung itself around her right ankle.

LEMON STARTS HERE (kind of...) -> Skip ~15 paragraphs to get to the juicy stuff

Hermione startled. She didn't expect it to be this close. A look down her leg told her that she was right - and filled with shock simultaneously. Screaming in fear Hermione tried to loosen the grip of the tentacle-shaped thing around her ankle - both of which turned out to be unsuccessful. If this room really was under a spell it would be futile to call for help because no sound would be able to leave the room. Trying to loosen the grip of the tentacle-shaped thing around her leg would also be vain as she learned in her first year at this school. What was holding her was a devil's snare. Trying to resist it would only cause it to kill you faster.

Hermione panicked. She didn't know what to do. Resisting wasn't an option, not reacting would just slower the process because this time there was cold hard stone under her. What could she do? Another tentacle started to wrap around her left leg. This time around the knee. Even if she tried she couldn't run away now.

But didn't she beat the devil's snare in her first year? Oh yes, now she remembered... "It likes the dark and the damp", lighting a fire would help. Trying not to upset the plant-monster Hermione slowly reached for her wand.

A third tentacle started to surround her body. This time it was a much bigger one than the other two. It seemed to be as thick as Hermione's own arm. Slowly the larger tentacle began to wrap around her abdomen.

The witch was able to pull out her wand just before her arm would have been trapped. She aligned her wand, aimed for the devil's snare and in the exact moment when she would have spoken the spell she was snatched by the plant-monster and pulled into the pit. The sudden impact had caused her hand to open for a brief moment and her wand flew across the room. She heard the impact on the stone floor and was relieved that it didn't fall into the devil's snare.

Her feeling of relief quickly vanished as she impacted herself. Both happy about the cushion and anxious about what would follow she realized that she, unlike her wand, fell directly into the devil's snare.

Rapidly the devil's snare began to wrap one tentacle after the other around the young students body. Both legs were now strapped to the ground by bigger tentacles. The one around her abdomen let loose but was quickly replaced by one for either arm. Through the sudden snatch of the plant Hermione's left arm, wich was vainly trying to hold on to something on the wall before, flew up and was now captured above her head.

Next to Hermione's extreme fear she was also confused. This wasn't tipical behavior for a devil's snare. Usually it would wrap around your body and squeeze you to death but this one just seemed to capture her. Some of the tentacles even seemed to be useless and let loose of her body.

The young girl was now lying on her back, captured at either arms and legs. Unable to move or cast a spell for that matter. The plant seemed to calm. Neither of both moved now.

In this moment of rest Hermione tried to think of a solution. How would she get out of this? Judging by the spell that seemed to protect the room she and the plant would be left alone. Her wand was lying somewhere on the edge of the room. Maybe there was a way she could be saved without magic and without moving... But how?

Hermione's thoughts were interrupted by a sudden noise under her feet. She was still able to turn her head so she looked down her body and tried to detect any movement.

All the chaos in the last minutes had caused her not to notice that her skirt must have been ripped by some of the tentacles. She was now laying there, stretched and captured by a devil's snare, alone in a dark room. Her skirt was probably thrown somewhere to the wall. Some buttons of her shirt were torn apart and nothing could save her now. The devil's snare would probably decide to strangle her any moment and there was no way out.

And then... Nothing happened. Complete silence. Hermione was on the edge of crying but it would probably wake up the monster that captured her. The young witch was laying there in silence for a few minutes.

Something didn't add up here... Why was the devil's snare behaving like this? Why would-

Suddenly there was movement again. Under her legs, Hermione felt something in motion. She looked down her body but wasn't able to see anything. Her legs blocked the view. As if the devil's snare could read the girls mind it slowly began to move her legs apart. Hermione now had an open view on what was going on. The tentacles under her seemed to spread apart, just like her legs. From the gap that was now created a large tentacle began to emerge. It was twisting, twitching and slowly moving towards the young students body.

The tentacle slowly started to touch Hermione's inner thighs. She didn't understand what it was doing or why it was doing it but being touched in this area weirdly felt a little arousing. It was difficult to keep her head up. For a moment she forgot that she was trapped by a devil's snare. All she could concentrate on was the tender feeling of the snare, which was now gradually moving up her leg. While the tentacle around her right arm loosened its grip another one started to emerge from under her shoulder, slowly moving past her neck and towards her chest. The tentacle stroking Hermione's thighs now arrived at her crotch. The skirt not being there would have allowed her to see what it was doing but she wasn't able to lift her head.

Slowly but surely the tentacle began to move suspiciously close to Hermione's panties. With its tip it carefully slid them down by a little. In combination with the upper snare, now moving under her shirt and loosening her bra Hermione got back to questioning. What was happening to her right now? What was the devil's snare doing? Was it trying to make her feel good before choking her? The young witch decided to just go with it, there wasn't much to do about it after all.

The snare with its tip under her panties was now gently touching Hermione's private parts. With caution, it started to pet her womanhood. The sheere touch of the snares tip flooded her body with lust. Every little bit of fear vanished immediately. The only thought on her mind was that of the satisfaction the tentacles could give her.

Now she remembered. One of the spells in “The encyclopedia of spells and charms for the lonely maiden” described how to enchant a devil's snare. According to the book this spell is used for “limitless satisfaction” when applied correctly. Soothed by the fact that the plant wouldn't do any harm to her, on the contrary, Hermione completely let go of her fear.

The upper tentacle now successfully removed her bra. It just ripped it apart and drew it away. With Hermione's chest now only being covered by a loose shirt her extensive breasts were now fully exposed to the snare. Her nipples were extremely hard and pierced through the white shirt of her school uniform. The tentacle under it gently curled around one of Hermione's elastic breasts and then slightly tightened its grip. The tip started to play with her nipple.

Bathing in satisfaction Hermione already forgot that she actually wanted to go study in the library. Just as she thought she couldn't take it anymore the snare stopped teasing her and began to fully undress her. A few smaller tentacles began undoing the rest of her shirt. The snare ripped it apart and moved it over her arms.

The bigger tentacle further down reached for her panties and tenderly slides them down her thighs and over her ankles.

The teenage students body, twisting in anticipation, was now fully exposed except for the loosened tie around her neck and her thigh-highs from the school uniform. While the upper snare was still stimulating Hermione's breasts another tentacle rose up between her legs. This one however was different. The tip of this particular tentacle wasn't as sharp as the others. This one was rather blunt. Just like the one before it slowly began to shift towards Hermione's crotch. Only this time Hermione knew exactly where it was going and her body was unprotected. The tentacles around her ankles began to rip apart her legs, fully revealing her young pussy to the snare moving towards it.

A mix of curiosity, lust and fear started to build up in Hermione. She had never done something like this. Not with a person, nor a snare for that matter. She raised her head and looked down her naked body. Was she ready? Will it be gentle? Little by little the fear started to prevail.

The snare moved slow enough to make Hermione feel extremely lustful. She didn't understand why but the only thing she wanted right now was that tentacle making a jump forward. Hermione again was left on the edge, she felt like she couldn't take it anymore. She wanted that tentacle to move faster so badly it hurt. In that exact moment it reached her pussy. It settled with its tip directly on the girls entry, performing a subtle pressure on her sensitive spot.

Almost as if waiting for approval the snare didn't make a move until Hermione tried to push down her own body as far as possible. The snare reacted in an instant.

Slow and steady the tentacle pushed itself directly against the young students pussy. Spreading the girl wide open the rock hard snare entered her. Hermione let out a loud sigh. She had never experienced anything like this before. It felt like pure pleasure would spread from the point where the snare entered her tight body. The excitement forced her to lay down her head again. She tried lifting it multiple times to see the snare entering her but she was completely filled with ecstasy so that her muscles gave up.

After sliding in the tip the snare paused for a moment. Hermione prepared herself and the tentacle began to shove itself up her warm insides inch by inch. The young witch started to scream in a combination of excitement and pain. This was her first time after all. Knowing nobody would be able to hear her scream she didn't have to hold anything back, which made it a lot easier for her. Now the tentacle began to pull back. It moved out of the young teenager until only the tip remained inside. Hermione let out a few heavy breaths. This may have been a painful experience, however it simultaneously felt better than anything she has ever felt before. Ready for the next thrust she moved her hips downward again, the snare immediately responded. This time it wasn't as gentle as before. It began to push Hermione's Insides apart slowly, retracting again but with every thrust it built up more speed. Meanwhile the young witch was wet enough for the tentacle to comfortably slide in and out of her faster and faster.

With every thrust Hermione felt a wave of pleasure conquering her body. She was long past slight moans and sighs, the room was filled with her screams of pleasure. What little pain she felt at the beginning has already faded away.

One of the tentacles next to her began gripping her other breast, bouncing from the thrust down her body. It joined the other one in squeezing Hermione's breasts and pleasuring her nipples.

A second tentacle, just like the one stimulating her pussy started to emerge between her now widely spread legs again. She wasn't able to see it because her head was now tilted alongside her neck but at the very latest she felt it tingeling her thighs. The new tentacle worked its way up her legs, almost like the other one before. Hermione already felt extreme satisfaction from the snare handling her breasts and the tentacle penetrating her tight pussy deeply but suddenly the new tentacle began teasing the outsides of her ass and the girls arousal grew significantly.

Before anything else could happen Hermione suddenly felt like her entire body was melting. The pleasure she had experienced for the last minutes from the snares thrusts unexpectedly started to gather itself in her pussy, Her arousal and excitement began to rise. The snare realized what happened and first began to slow down, keeping Hermione right on the edge, but then started to penetrate the young girls warm insides deeper and faster than before. Hermione felt like she would explode. The satisfaction that gathered inside her pussy suddenly spread all across her lustful body and caused her to twist around. She felt more pleasure at once than she could take. Her screams were now so full of lust and so loud that without the protecting spell the entire castle would have heard her.

Hermione's orgasm lasted for almost a minute before she broke down into the devil's snare, panting and unable to move. This time not because she was trapped, but because after this experience her body felt as weak as it could get.

The young woman was laying there, fully exposed, wheezing. After a few minutes of heavy breathing Hermione made a first attempt to move her head. She barely could lift it, to see what the devil's snare was doing now. Just like Hermione it hadn't moved. Now that she started to move it slowly pulled back its tentacles. The feeling of the rock hard snare leaving her insides, still hot and throbbing wet, was one last sensation that caused her head to fall back on the ground.

Slowly but surely Hermione began to stand up. Now she had a problem... Half her clothes were torn apart in the heat of battle. Fortunately her skirt was still lying at the wall, without any big traces of her little adventure.

Her shirt was lying on the other side of the room. A few buttons were violently ripped out of it. “I can change before I go studying” Hermione said to herself. She looked around for her panties but didn't see them, even though her eyes have already gotten used to the dim light. After a few minutes of searching she finally gave up and got dressed with everything she had. Her bra was torn apart by the snare, so she didn't even have to try and find it.

She picked up her wand, turned around one last time, thought about coming back later and then left with bouncy steps.

Hope you enjoyed it, let me know.


** Well, that was something. Can we call this pairing Devil Snarmione now?
