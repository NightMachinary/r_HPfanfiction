Hi, I was wondering, does anyone have a copy of Freefall by LadyofLilacs? I've been wanting to read it for a while now but the author took it down.


** If the author took it down (as opposed to the fanfic originally being on an old-time blog that got lost in the black hole of the internet), I'd advice you respect their wish and don't look for a left-over copy.

But that's my personal opinion, I know it's a debate in the community.

*** She only reposted the first two chapters of her fic. I want the whole book, and it doesn't seem like LadyofLilacs is going to finish publishing it again any time soon.

**** Oh interesting. Looking at the ao3 comments, she was reposting little by little, but none recently.
