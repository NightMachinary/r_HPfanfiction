Is there any good fics where Bellatrix and Rudolphus have a daughter? Preferably they are not in Azkaban but I'm not picky. Also please don't make Voldemort the biological father I don't like those.(No offense to people who do though.)


** People like Jack Thorne, playwright of The Cursed Child? Sod that play!

** I've read a few of these, but probably not as many as some others. With that being said, by far the best one that I have read is linkffn(Harry Potter and the ashes of chaos) It's a WIP but updates every weekend. The author seems to post 8-12k word chapters without fail at this point in the story, and it is very well done overall, if a bit heavy on tropes. In saying that, he does a lot of unique stuff with said tropes. Probably my favourite ongoing story at the moment.
