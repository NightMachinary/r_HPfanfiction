I'm not sure how common this is. I imagine Harry would start off as an antagonist in the same vein as Draco but he could have an arc where he grows to be a better person.


** I could also see an angle where they hate magic but maybe Vernon thinks he could exploit it somehow. Maybe some sort of magic circus/sideshow type thing like we see in Fantastic Beasts II, or use magic to become master criminals or rich (Vernon wants to mind control customers to buy more drills or something like that).

*** I vaguely remember an abandoned fic where instead of hating magic Vernon tries to exploit it and has Harry brew potions for him that he uses to drug businesspeople to agree to deals that benefit him. He eventually gets into big trouble with the magical government, but not before getting the Finch Fletchleys to work with him.

** I don't remember the name of it unfortunately but I'm pretty sure there's a story out there where Dumbledore comes to take Harry to Hogwarts and it turns out he's just like Dudley.
