:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's this one particular scene that I remember from it, it basically had Sirius and Regulus (the order and the death eaters) on opposite sides in *trenches*. And it was christmas and Sirius and Regulus had this tradition of celebrating christmas together (as kids) and so they stop fighting, and start singing instead and they sing that one particular christmas song /god rest ye merry hippogriffs/ -

Anyone know which fic I'm talking about?


** Trenches? What?

I mean, I understand if somebody want to rewrite [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce][the Christmas Truce]] into HP universe (although it seems to me like a silly idea), but why do you want to do it in the Marauders' time? Go to the Grindelwald's War and make Tom Riddle be drafted and singing carols together with the Viktor Krum's grandfather (while [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria_during_World_War_II][Bulgaria was still on the Axis side]]) or the Blaise Zabini's one, but in the Voldemorts' wars there were no trenches and no battlelines, because those wars (if they were wars at all, but that's another discussion) were most Guerilla style small group ambushes and quick retreat, not trenches and long sieges.
