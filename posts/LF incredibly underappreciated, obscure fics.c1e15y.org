Basically any fic that you find *brilliant*, but that inexplicably hasn't attracted many readers?

Thank you! :)

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Worth of the Soul) is a fairly obscure eventual Harry/Susan which takes an alternate view on many of the things that happen in HBP and DH. It's not perfectly written but it's decent, and interesting. It includes a good Ron, which isn't common enough, and a good Dumbledore. It also has an awesome final battle, and it's not one where everything goes well.

  As his sixth year begins, Harry is forced to take up his destiny earlier that anticipated. With Voldemort slowly taking over, everyone looks to Harry to lead them, all while Juggling school, friends, the seach for the Horcruxes, and teenage love. In the process, Harry slowly learns about not only himself, but the true worth of the soul! Harry/Susan

** Linkffn(A Wizard's guide to 'Banking')

Making more muggleborns by breaking into sperm banks and replacing samples to topple pureblood supremacy. Unfortunately abandoned just as it gets interesting.

Linkffn(A pound of flesh)

Messing around with a Horcrux to get some information out of it can't really be that good of an idea, can it?

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the girl who walked on water)

Harry, Ron and Hermione survived the war. Many of their friends didn't. Voldemort did. Featuring a Voldemort/Bismarck ship.

Linkffn(Heap Coals of Fire on his Head)

Everything went to hell when the war was lost. But Hermione doesn't give up so easily.

Linkffn(Democracy by Starfox5)

The war was won. But they won't accept a return to the status quo. Peaceful political drama.

Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died)

AU with Malfoy as +tyrannical dictator+ belovenent minister, Harry, Dumbledore and Ron in french exile, Hermione as +brainwashed soldier+ dutiful wand of Britain, and Voldemort as half-naga.

Linkffn(Realignment)

Harry as time traveling dark lord trying to kill a schoolkid, Tom Riddle as schoolkid mentored by Dumbledore on how to avoid getting killed by a dark lord. Somehow the roles have switched.

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no one is perfect.

** These are all small-scale stories rather than epic plotlines, so YMMV.

The first one is a fairly short satire of an entire generation, patterned after Evelyn Waugh's class-conscious misanthropic novels. The summary makes it sound like a portrait of Snape, but it's not; it's a brilliant takedown of pureblood wizardkind and their hangers-on (such as Snape), their snobbery, vacuity, and self-infatuation. It draws on parallels to the British upper classes prior to WWII whose own complacency and meanness of spirit made some of them sympathetic to Hitler. It's an elegant piss-take, and the only character who comes out of it looking like a decent human being is Lily Evans.

linkao3(Romance of the Age by nimmieamee)

Another short but devastating fic depicting Snape's last visit home while still a student. It's in Eileen's POV, and the gradual revelation of the family secret and its consequences is amazingly well-written and horrifying. It fits neatly into canon and would certainly help to explain why Snape is so emotionally fucked up.

linkao3(Playing for Keeps by vissy)

This is a quiet but absorbing short fic set during the war against Grindelwald. McGonagall is recruited by Dumbledore and sent on a mission with Alastor Moody.The wartime atmosphere that permeates the story is nicely evoked, full of constant low-level tension.

linkao3(Being expendable by redsnake05)

The next two recs include slash pairings, although one is actually a threesome and not explicit. I'd urge you to try them anyway, even if they're not your usual fare.

Snape after his first year of teaching gets invited to McGonagall's summer cottage; it turns out Moody is already in residence, convalescing after a Death Eater ambush. Snape ends up sleeping with each of them, with an extra dollop of violence in Moody's case. This is a character study of young Snape, too damaged to change for the better, incapable of understanding himself or others, and literally haunted. It's a brilliant portrait, and one of my favorite fics.

linkao3(In Memory of Sigmund Freud by Delphi)

The last one is acerbic and humane and dryly comic, told from Aberforth's POV in the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts. He resumes a relationship with McGonagall as she runs herself ragged preparing the school to re-open; he also gets embroiled in McGonagall's own personal "saving people" thing. Again, mostly plotless. The pleasure lies in the dialogue and the sharp-tongued, unsentimental, pragmatic characters. The story is sympathetic to Snape, so if that's not your cuppa you might not enjoy it as much as I did. It's also buried on LiveJournal in an exchange community, so you have to keep clicking onward to the next part.

** I really like this fic, Patchwork Wishes, it's a kid fic that takes place in Harry's childhood, but with a twist! It's seriously underrated:

If you think that was rude, you need to grow up.

  and there's no reason to link two things, neither pf which is what I said to look for. If you had searched "midnight run by momotwins" it would have popped right up.
#+end_quote

 

Links were manifestation of passive agressive sarcasm. If you recommend something and can´t be bothered to link it, at least mention where to find them. This is not ok:

/there was this great story called "mundungus and something or other". It was written by termo or was it hermsy anyway great story. Oh btw you can find it with wayback machine or that great luxemburgian archive site or was it austrian, don´t really remember but man it was good story/

  I won't bother in the future, sorry
