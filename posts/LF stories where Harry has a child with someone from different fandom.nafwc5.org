The title says it all. I just like seeing effect of Harry being in another world with a child.

Don't ask me why, I don't know.

  Elia Martell expected to die in King's Landing, but through some force found herself in the home of a war-weary Harry Potter. She just wants to return to Westeros; wants to see her family, wants the sandy dunes of Dorne and the peace of the Water Gardens. Aegon and Rhaenys are all she has, and for their sake she might have to reclaim a throne that nearly cost them everything.Harry Potter had died in his war and returned to a Wizarding World hell-bent on remaining in the throes of war-time politics. He was tired of Magical Britain, tired of fighting a useless war, but he has a son to care for and no force on earth would stop him from doing so.Raising three kids is hard, raising two of them to eventually rule a kingdom even harder, especially when you're trying to find a way to Westeros.
