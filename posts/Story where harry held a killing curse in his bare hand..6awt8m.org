As the title says, but it was thrown by a deatheater first than either anither one he caught maybe by voldermort. This all happened in front of hogwarts with voldermort, and his army there. I think he also went back into the castle via secret entrance i think the castle created.

That's about the best i can remember,any stories that sound similer i would greatly appreciate if anyone could link them.

Thanks, warryn.

Edit: i should have put this in earlier, but he can catch all magic in his hands if he wants, i also remember he was juggling two or three or more killing curses in front of the castle.


** This has happened in a lot of stories, but chances are this is one of the Harry/Daphne stories. I believe it starts out like this, then has either a massive timeskip/flashback sequence.

[[/spoiler][some spoilerI know it happens quite a bit in this story, the Catching bit. The Bellatrix part happens in graveyard, and Voldie in tournament arena, but I'm pretty sure it happens with Dumbles in Hogwarts in the Great Hall.]]

Blah, I give up on spoiler! It's all a lie!

Somebody save me from murdering that spoiler tag anymore.

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.
