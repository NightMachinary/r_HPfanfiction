Any updates in the past few months I, or anyone else that has been taking a hiatus, should get excited about?

I know Grow Young With Me is one of them.


** Grow Young with Me was an awesome surprise - taliesin19 has been posting some drabbles pretty frequently on her Tumblr about Abby/Harry lately too.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.
