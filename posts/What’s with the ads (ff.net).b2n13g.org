These are terrible on mobile. I have the drop down one, one on the bottom. One on the top of the story, several embedded in the story and then all the suggested authors with their profile pictures on the bottom. What the hell!

**** I've been using it for a year or so, it's easier to search stories, and you can download them to a library, but also sort them into folders so they're more organized(not that I do that lol). But that's all I use it for. There are options for private messaging and posting stories, and following writers, but I don't use those options. So maybe there are others idk about lol, also you can sync your library across your devices. And read on the go I guess

Edit: I haven't used ffnet ever since so I didn't know about this ads problem ðŸ˜…

**** you can find that fic you read 2 months ago that you can't find cuz its in your reading history, you can also download fics to read offline. it has the same sort/search feature that is on the computer as well, and it has a text to speech feature that can be use offline(as long as its downloaded). I've been using the (various) mobile apps for around 2-3 years after about a month of using the mobile site so i can say in my case that it's way better. on a final note you can sign in with your ffn account and have all your favs and followed communities there waiting

**** The two biggest reasons I use the app instead of opening it in the browser is because the app has dark mode, and it also has a decent audio option and will read the story to you. Sometimes when I'm in the middle of something and can't really sit down and read, but I'm in the middle of a good story and don't want to stop, I will turn on the reader so that it will read it to me.

****** It always makes me wonder, how does FFN manage to be so dysfunctional? Between mass purgings and very little updates to the site's code, FFN is in a very bad place. Personally I want to see FFN die, or at least modernise themselves, but I certainly don't want their death to be fast, but rather gradual enough that authors don't find themselves jarred and can instead make a more natural transition to AO3 or whatever site comes along.
