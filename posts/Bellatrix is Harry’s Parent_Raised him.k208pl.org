I've read a couple of fics based around this lately and have been enjoying them. Submissions of fics would be appreciated :D


** The only fic that I have read that is even a little close to this is called Watching Over Harry by Jerrway69

  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point.Skylar is the boy who lived, that's why he's important. I'm not Skylar.Going to Hogwarts is part of the plan, waking the basilisk is part of the plan, taking potions, learning spells, being tortured, murdering others, watching people di-   I'm going to tell you a story, although it's a bit long. I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?

** linkffn(The Lord of House Potter by TheyWhoWrites) Bellatrix adopts baby Harry. It hasn't updated in a while, so I don't remember many details.

linkffn(Clan Potter by Numbuh10-4) has James marry Bellatrix instead of Lily, and both are alive. I dropped this one at some point, but I don't remember why.

  Bellatrix goes with Voldemort that fateful night in 1981 as her final task before the Dark Lord allows her into his inner circle. Things do not go as planned, and Bella gets away with something she thought she would never have. Decent!Bella Greyish!Harry Some Bashing. Rated M for adult-like reasons.

  What if Bellatrix Black was Harry's mother and how could that happen? Skipping to the quidditch world cup will include changes to cannon. Will be flashbacks, spontaneous updates, some Dumbledore and Snape bashing. HPxKB, JPxBB
