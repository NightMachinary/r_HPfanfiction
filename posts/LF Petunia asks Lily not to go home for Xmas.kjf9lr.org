:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A marauders era jily fic in which Lily gets a letter from home and James sees her holding the letter and teases her, asking if that's her family telling her they no longer want her home for Christmas. Lily bursts into tears and skips classes all day. James feels guilty and uses the map to find her in an abandoned classroom, red eyed from crying. James asks her what's wrong and when she doesn't answer reads the letter from earlier that's lying on the table. It's from Petunia asking Lily, despite what their mum said, to stay at school over Christmas because they are planning Petunia's wedding and Lily will just ruin everything. James comforts Lily and hugs her.


** This might be The Life and Times, by Jewels5. Not too sure though--- I read it a long time ago, but I think I remember this scene.
