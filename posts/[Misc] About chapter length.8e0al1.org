How do I write chapters that are long but also still good? I'm not very good at that type of writing. Maybe a voice dictation app?


** I'm kind of having trouble with that myself. I always consider chapters to be a set of contained section of story.

I always write too concisely and don't give enough details to bring the reader into the story. For me, I'm going to model my chapter outline into something similar to Tom Clancy. In his novels, he tends to have two or three scenes in a shorter chapter (8,000 words?)

As a reader I dislike extremely short chapters (2,000) and looooooong chapters (15,000+)

Try to be longer than shorter, but be careful and don't have several completely disconnected stories within the chapter.

*** I don't consider 2000 "extremely short". It's on the short side, but I would say a chapter of over 3000 is of decent size, over 2000 is somewhat short, and less than 1000, now /that/ is extremely short. (Anything above 3000 is fair game as long as it doesn't mean you only update once every two months.)

*** I've kind of solved my situation:I'm aborting the AO3 version of my fic and posting on Wattpad. At least /they/ only count chapters,which gives me a sense of real progress.

**** I can obviously not stop you in doing it, but few people use wattapad as it's impossible to actually search on that site. You can't filter by fandom or characters. And the chapters are honestly like reading a script. So dialogue heavy with little action here and there, maybe two or three in a chapter.

** When my co-writer and I started writing our current series, we had trouble making a chapter more than 3k. Neither of us are good with brevity as a rule, but for some reason, we still couldn't get it to what we felt was a reasonable length (generally, 5-8k is what I prefer).

As we started to go forward, we ended up employing a few techniques that meant most of our chapters fell between 7-12k depending on chapter. The first was deciding on POVs - some characters are big internal narrators and others aren't.

The second was blocking. We'd decide what goal we had for this chapter, what scenes fit best with it and shape around it. For example, we had a chapter at the Department of Mysteries so we knew it'd be scene 1 (set up why they're going), scene 2 and 3 (what happened there from 2 POVs) and scene 4 (direct aftermath). We generally do 4 scenes. The main chapter goal was to explore circumstances which would cause the prophecy not to be smashed and what the battle looked like from an Order rather than DA perspective. Setting these goals meant that something plot meaningful happened, something character driven happened and things to explore in the aftermath were set up ready to be explored in future chapters. As such, it was long (because it had a lot to do) but it was also satisfying and lead into the next part. We will often begin to block chapter scenes a few chapters in advance so we can also drop in foreshadowing, set up what we need to to get a scene we want in a future blck and try to be flexible about moving scenes around if an unexpected, but interesting tangent occurs to us.

In terms of chapters that are less cohesive than that, we try to set character driven or plot goals. Aftermath introspection and interaction chapter: What do you want to showcase for the characters? What is this chapter adding to the characterisations and relationships? Basically, always having a goal or two to work around does wonders and allows you to add a good narrative flow in linking one bit to the next.

Finally, introspection. Having a character sort through their thoughts on what's happening generally takes up a lot of space but also adds to the characterisation and development.

Hope this helped!

** For me, I have a general written outline for what I want to do with my story. It includes the overall plot and some noteworthy events I wish to occur and scenes I consider to be important. Because of this, individual chapters for me are exercises in fleshing out those scenes and events (dialogue/dramatics) and then linking them together so that the push the plot forward according to plan (narrative).

So planning helps a /lot/ and having a general idea of the /purpose/ of a chapter content-wise can assist in determining the length. Once the content is covered, try and make sure it wraps up and hopefully lays the ground for the next chapter.

It's because of this that I've never really experience writers block with my HP story. Really, my issue is just finding time putting pen to paper. The chapters just seem to flow for me as long as I know what I planned to do next. My length for my first 2 chapters was about 6K and the third and fourth jumped to just under 10K, which was about the limit of what I felt comfortable doing in one chapter

Simple: you write your story in its entirety before posting the first chapter. Then you get confirmation from your betas and early readers that the story is indeed good and worthy of being released into the wild. Then you divide it into longer blocks, post each new chapter every two weeks, and go from there.

And if your readers say it's not good enough, you work on it until it is--before posting that first chapter.

** I struggle to write at least 1000 words for some of the chapters then others can go past 1000.
