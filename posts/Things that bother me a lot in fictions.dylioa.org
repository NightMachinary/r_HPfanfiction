- Harry is not a Potter. I read fanfiction of 'Harry Potter' stories, not of Harry Snape or Harry Malfoy. Stories where James or Lily aren't his parents, don't make sense.

- Harry is pureblood. This is pretty much nonsense to me. Lily Evans is his mother - is one of the focal points of the series.

- Hermione is pureblood/half-blood. Again why? A 'pureblood' Hermione is not a Hermione. When you make her pureblood, her characteristics are completely gone.

- After a couple of years at Hogwarts, Harry doesn't know the name of all his classmates. I have seen lots of Harry and less known characters say Daphne fiction where Harry doesn't even know her name. Just because Harry regularly interacts with 10 people, doesn't mean he only know them. I bet after 6th year, he at least knew the name and face of his all classmates. (Edit: please remember that Hogwarts is a boarding school. He may not know all the names but should recognize the faces. But many pointed out its a canon thing he doesn't.)

******* It says in chapter 15 of PoA that 200 people wear green to the quidditch match. Assuming that there are probably more slytherins than any other house, since death eaters targeted children while the other side presumably did not, I would estimate that there are around 700-750 students in hogwarts. Harry's year is obviously very small due to the war. The problem is, one teacher for each subject could never work for 700 kids. So my actual conclusion is that JKR can't do maths, and for some reason never thought that through.

** 1. It can be an interesting point of divergence - I'm more firm on Harry being Harry, and not as much on Potter.

2. Lily being a pureblood (secretly) isn't necessarily terrible if there's a plot reason behind it that's interesting. Won't affect how she was brought up, of course, but it can be a fine inclusion.

3. I believe there's a wizarding house mentioned with "Granger" in the name, so Hermione being related to those can be inserted in. Depending on the fic, it can be a way to give her some more say in society if using a super pureblood dominated world.

4. It's canon actually. As for knowing every face, I don't know - depends on the size you make Hogwarts.

She's deliberately not supposed to be Book Hermione. Book Hermione is overbearing, socially awkward, and self-righteous against those who don't share her opinions/moral standards. Pureblood Hermione has none of those flaws, and really, outside of the name, shares more in common with Movie Hermione than Book Hermione.

Harry didn't notice that Blaise Zabini wasn't a sexy Italian dame until Book 6, where he was revealed to be a black guy. Sally-Anne Perks dropped off the face of the earth. He doesn't know anyone outside his house except for a handful of people. He doesn't even know all the people /in/ his house, which would be like ~10-15 people per year. Like Cormac McLaggen: the guy shares a common room with Harry, and is a massive show-off braggart who ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet, and would have loved to be in with The-Boy-Who-Lived.

*** Does Harry not know about Blaise, or just the audience? I honestly don't even remember the canon Blaise passage, or if Harry expresses surprise to meet (spy on?) Blaise, if the exposition is just for the sake of the scene, etc.

There are absolutely huge swathes of time that are just skipped over in the books. I don't necessarily think that means Harry was making friends with other Gryffindors in that time, let along people from other houses.

But not knowing the names of the people in your own class of ~60, at a boarding school, over the course of 6 years seems unlikely. Rowling's notes with the class listing, whether the "original" ones from the 2001 BBC interview or the later one on Pottermore, say that there are more Gryffindors in Harry's year than are named in the books. Harry never interacts with them in the books, but that doesn't mean that Harry doesn't know their names. His classes are all joint with another house from his year, so even for students from other houses, he should know everyone in his year in passing. And that's not even getting into whether Gryffindor is supposed to have ~10 students per year or ~30+.

I don't trust JKR's word of God anymore. In past interviews, she said that McGonagall was in her seventies and retconned it to ~120 to fit into the Fantastic Beasts timeline, which makes the "teaching for thirtynine years this December" line nonsensical. She said that the Slytherins came back to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts when this was directly contradicted in the books. She also said Ron and Hermione's relationship was purely wish fulfillment.😂

***** Which is perfectly fair. I'm saying that regardless of her wavy counting and math, it's pretty likely that Harry knows the names of the people he goes to school with. It's iffier if the number of Hogwarts students is ~1000, but he definitely knows the student in his year if there are only ~300 Hogwarts students. Because of her wavy numbers, there are plenty of other worldbuilding/population issues - Rowling is fantastic at scene texture, not so much at worldbuilding.

***** I don't think you know what "retcon" means, though most people never seem to either. Rowling's statement in a very early interview about McGonagall beng in her 70s was never canon; McGonagall's actual age in the books was never mentioned. The only point you have is about the "thirty-nine years this December" line but that isn't so much a retcon as its Rowling's terrible maths skills. Even she herself admits this given the "missing 24 hours" plothole regarding the events of PS. Especially since McGonagall's line in question isn't even relevant to the actual plot of the books; Rowling really should have just had McGonagall say she had been teaching for over three decades (or anything to that effect), since it would be vague enough to allow McGonagall to be older. Almost all of the so-called retcons can be attributed to maths errors and/or the added information never being outright contradicted by canon in the first place.

The Slytherin thing sounds more like bad writing than a retcon, given that she wrote Slughorn coming back and also wrote that the underaged students went with Slughorn to escape. Even in the actual books themselves, the only person who ever contradicted the Slytherin's loyalties was Voldemort, who claimed they all joined him... a statement that is not only impossible to prove but comes from an unreliable source. Voldemort might have been bluffing given he speaking to Lucius, who was very worried about Draco's whereabouts, OR perhaps he was telling the truth. Its impossible to prove or deny either way, and comes down to a simple "do you trust Voldemort to be honest to his Death Eaters".

As for Ron and Hermione being wish-fulfillment, that is irrelevant since she still wrote it and still hinted it since Goblet of Fire (if not as early as CoS). I don't see how Ron/Hermione being wish fulfillment is relevant to Rowling's trust given that its a meaningless statement. All it shows is that Rowling wrote the Ron/Hermione romance because she wanted it to happen, rather than being concerned with how likely or unlikely that romance was to happen.

Hell, the only arguable retcon in the entire series would be Nagini's status as a former human being. I say arguable because even in the books, Nagini was implied to be special numerous times. The obvious answer is that Nagini's specialness came from being a Horcux, and a living one at that. However because Dumbledore was merely speculating and nothing was ever explained, the books were so vague that Nagini being formerly a human wouldn't contradict canon. Either way, Nagini would have lost any humanity she had by the final Fantastic Beast movie so she wouldn't have her human memories or feelings by the time she meets Voldemort. This would explain how Voldemort never comments on her ex-human status, since Nagini wouldn't be able to tell Voldemort that. As far as Voldemort would see, Nagini is a venomous snake who can be a useful tool to him, and that is all that matters to him.

Again, many don't get the difference between worldbuilding (e.g. Rowling revealing Dumbledore's sexuality *in 2007*, interviews, and any Pottermore articles that Rowling herself wrote) compared to actual retcons. A retcon would be if Rowling said something that was explictly and objectively contradicted by the canon of the seven books. For example, if Rowling were to ever state that Voldemort was the same age as Dumbledore, something like THAT would be an actual retcon since such a thing couldn't possibly happen in canon (given the fact that Dumbledore was a professor even before he met Riddle at the orphanage from the HBP pensieve memories).

My main gripe is when people take things she said over a decade ago and act like its a recent statement. People lost their minds when she said Dumbledore was gay during the lead-up to Crimes of Grindelwald, forgetting that she first mentioned Dumbledore's sexuality in a *2007* interview. Dumbledore's sexuality is NOT a retcon since that would imply Dumbledore was confirmed to be straight in canon, which wasn't true. Even the whole "wizards shitting where they stood" was never actually stated. The actual context was that in a Pottermore article about the actual Chamber of Secrets from 2013, Rowling mentioned the shitting thing as a SINGLE THROW-AWAY LINE and never elaborated. The only reason people made a meme out of it was because they are too ignorant to realise that not only was that line from 2013, but that it was one-line out of several paragraphs. Yet people act like Rowling herself tweets out random shit. I wouldn't be surprised that if the Pottermore twitter account tweeted a random line or two from Rowling's article on Draco/Lupin/Umbridge, people would act like Rowling just published it today.

*TL;DR: People in this fandom largely are too stupid to know what a retcon even is or isn't. Most so-called retcons are either maths mistakes and/or was never explicitly contradicted by canon. The Rowling memes are just people exposing their absolute media illiteracy by thinking shit she said 5-10 years or more ago was said yesterday.*

** This all boils down to personal choices.

1. Doesn't bother me as long as it's a well written story. From my personal experience, percentage of good stories with this little change is slightly better than the percentage of good ones with normal Harry Potter. Your past experience may be different though.
2. I've not seen this done that much. I wouldn't mind a Potter heir from other woman though. Lily dying for Harry isn't something that special unless you believe that she was the only mother who died for her children. The only thing that can affect plot is lack of motivation for Snape protect Harry. Even that can be bent back into shape if Lily is victim of Voldemort some other way and Snape wants to avenge her by supporting the only person that can defeat Voldemort.
3. Doesn't bother me. It's fanon, for a reason. People want to see different scenarios. This particular one doesn't bother me. Hermione's muggle heritage isn't an active part of any plot element. It doesn't add anything to canon hermione that couldn't be added to pure blood and half-blood Hermione.
4. It's canon though. Harry doesn't know names of many people. He was severely limited in his contact outside his immediate circle that is pretty much anything Weasely or friend of Weasely. This is probably one of the many reason that manipulative Weasely trope has survived this long. It's easy to describe isolation of canon Harry to careful manipulation of his meetings with people. Do remember that Hagrid and Weasely family were his gateway to canon magical world and he pretty much acquired their version of everything and practically stood up against a stranger, Malfoy, for a boy that he barely met, Weasely.

​

TBH everything depends on preference. It's okay to have your personal preference. Things only go bad when people with one kind of preference look down, berate, malign or abuse people with preference different then their own. Have fun with fics that you like, and let people who enjoy these kinds of things have their fun in their own safe space.

*** Harry being identical to James Potter at the same age (except for the eyes) is a pretty good indication that James is his father, and unless Dumbledore is a liar or an idiot then the 'blood wards' that keep Harry safe as long as he lives with his Aunt indicate that Lily is his mother. I have to believe the wards are real though, there were several years where Voldemort was active and would have had no trouble taking out a couple of muggles and a lone guard to get to him if there were no protections on the property.

**** "...unless Dumbledore is a liar or an idiot then the 'blood wards' that keep Harry safe as long as he lives with his Aunt indicate that Lily is his mother."

I wouldn't say that Albus is dumb, but he does tend to assume things without checking...things which I know I've yelled at my books over the years.

I would love to read a frantic where Petunia was adopted, knows it, and resents the heck out of Lily for the death of her parents before they could share any info about Petunia's blood parents. Also, I always figured that Lord had better things to do than track down Harry over the summer, especially since Albus could be counted on to make Harry miserable, wherever he was housed.

** surely he would at least recognise the name of everyone in his year. Perhaps not a name to a face but don they not take attendance for each class or notice when someone is called on for six years. The fics where he doesn't even know someone called Greengrass exists in his year are rediculous
