After reading Summer of Change and Son of Potter Daughter of Black, I came up with following question:

Is there fan fics where Harry has Black as half-sister? eq. Lily Potter had daughter with Sirius Black or something similar.


** There are a few stories where that happens through adoption (Sirius adopts Harry's friends for some reason, making them Black siblings.

The best example of this is "The silent World of Cassandra Evans", a cracky OP FemHarry story which starts out dark and badly written but ends up being fluffly comedy after chapter 8 (including random Taylor Swift dance scenes and Anime references which don't even disturb the reading flow because it is pure comedy and not Japan wank or author inserts).

*** Specific pop culture references always feel so garish. I distinctly remember feeling that way even in book one when JK name drops Mars bars for some reason.

**** I agree on principle, but there are some stories which are the exception to that rule. For example, Call Me does a masterful job of depicting 90s youth culture in the UK. And Silent World works because it does not take itself seriously, which is the trademark of good crack.

** I had this idea for writing a fic myself but I never actually got anywhere and gave up quickly. Seeing as I'm not the only person with this idea, maybe I'll revisit it

*** The question is what would change and if it is worth writing.

If you just want to turn it into a "here comes the most overpowered and noble House of Black, prepare your anus", there is arguably little reason to write it because that has been done to death (unless you can come up with a unique twist).

If you want to have them grow up together, you have to rewrite most of the series because the butterfly effect is a bitch and walls of exposition are horrible.

I think the best thing would be them meeting either during the fourth or fifth year if you want the more traditional "Blacked" way to write her or a sixth/seventh year encounter where you can have her reasonably powerful (Durmstrang Education, private tutoring organised by the mother) and impact the plot directly without having to worry about the Order, Dumbledore and the Ministry sticking their nose into things. After all, an unholy amount of bloody vengence flys better during a civil war than when the good guys are still bound by laws because the government isn't completly evil yet.

**** That's why I gave up on it. I didn't want her to be some super witch and I wanted to have her as a figure in Harry's life, but I kept writing her as able to do things a witch far older than her couldn't. I might take another shot at it and hopefully write an actually interesting character.
