I have been trying to find some good fanfictions where harry (it doesn't have to be JUST harry) gets summoned or time travels to the past or another dimension, BUT he tells his parents, the order, or just everybody in general who he actually is. I know that I won't find a lot with the time travel but I know I have read some somewhere I would just like to find more, thank you.ðŸ™‚

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)
