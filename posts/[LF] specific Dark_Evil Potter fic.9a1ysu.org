** I don't know about the eyes bit, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771/38/Partially-Kissed-Hero][Chapter 38 of Partially Kissed Hero]] has the rest. 100% recommend reading it ironically. It's hilariously bad.

*** Fuck me.

I remember unironically reading it and liking it when I was about 11 or 12 years old, in 6th grade I think? It was before smartphones were a thing, so I'd print pages of fanfics out and read them in my binder in class. My uncle found one of these lying around the house, he looked at it and said "partially kissed hero? partially fucked hero lol".

Retrospectively one of the most cringe moments of my life.

*** Clearly, my memory combined two different stories in one, but that's definitely half of it! I remember reading ALOT OF angsty/ Evil Potter fics in my teens and wanted to see of they were as bad as I remembered. Now to find the one where they are blinded, turned immortal and given a magical orb / eye to fight over for eternity... from what I recall, Petunia sees a beautiful young version of herself, and vernon / Dudley get to see scantily clad women, so that they'd fight over the orb as an escape from their misery, forever.
