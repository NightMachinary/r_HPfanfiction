It's a time travel storyline. The weird bit is mostly in the "they chose those characters as the centre of a romance plot". I mean, it's not like Drapple or Draco/Grawp (Graco? Grawco?).

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.
