While the story in question doesn't need to end up as some emotional car crash, or devolve into a Domestic Girlfriend tier clusterfuck of soap-opera worthy spicy drama; it would be nice at the very least if the partners in question are all rather adamant on wanting exclusivity with Harry, and are not perfectly okay with the idea of running a time-share scheme for his dick.


** Harry Potter and International Triwizard Tournament do something like this where Harry ends up with three girls.

Of course, it's much more complicated than that, but each of them has their own reasons as to why they would accept such a relationship.

**** The manga in general and the finale in particular. It's a soap opera for 267 chapters. There was an endgame in sight, and then it just went out the window in the last 6 in favor of something...weird, frankly

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.
