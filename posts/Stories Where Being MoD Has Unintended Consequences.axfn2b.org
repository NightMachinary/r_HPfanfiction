Maybe Harry is constantly being pestered by needy thestrals (basically like dogs), or Hela from Asgard keeps showing up demanding some attention and being devilishly seductive or something. Preferably funny consequences instead of grim ones. I need levity ðŸ™ƒ


** Immediately thought of this: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637]]

It isn't like outright funny, but it is a quick, light-hearted read that has Harry dealing with the side effects of being MOD and kinda just being like huh whatever.

** linkffn [Nitimur in Vetitum by Quatermass]

Basically, deadpool immortality in that he doesn't stay dead when you kill him. I don't see many humorous takes on this type of "curse", but the few are funny.

There was one that was about dementors acting like dogs but I can't recall it's title, but there was a response fix as well about "dementors are not dogs!"

  Master of Death? Pfft. More like Death's lackey. Cast into another world, immortal, and still hurt from his friends and family's demise, Harry Potter is brought into Eruyt Village. There, he will become Jote's spy in Ivalice...and something more to Mjrn. Insanity, adventure, and pathos ensues, but can Harry help save Ivalice from the Undying Ones? Helps that he is immortal too...

** Whispers in the corners by Esama ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255]]) I adore it. It's Harry in Sherlock AU, with Harry having the ability of seeing ghosts because MOD. He just rolls with it. It's slash btw (Harry/Mycroft), but it's so well done that even if it's not your thing you may like it. And I mean, Esama is awesome no matter what she writes.

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?
