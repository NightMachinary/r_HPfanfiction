Throw out a few fanfiction titles. I'll read everyone that gets posted. Favorites, embarrassing indulgences, crossovers, all good. I prefer non slash, but not a deal breaker. Little bashing is fine but gets me down when that's the whole story.


** I'm so tempted to dump all 71 stories on my alerts list on you just to see if you'll make good on your "I'll read every one that gets posted" talk :)

Here's one I don't think I've ever mentioned before: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here][I'm Still Here]]. It starts with song lyrics, so that's a pretty big early red flag, and it's moderately-to-very angst-y, but I remember liking chunks of this.

** I'm going to assume you've already read all the big name fics that I have in my [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NkGVr2UUmX3AkexY8P9GZkQFMVfLsxVHckcwW2FzDSA/edit][Favourites]] document.

So I'll try to recommend some lesser-known fics. Warning: these are all pretty much abandoned, but many of them are still substantial.

*** Back Again, Harry? was the first story that I read completely without realizing it had been abandoned (despite the fact that Jedi Buttercup insists it has not). In my never ending quest of masochism I wound up reading Perfect Lionheart's Partially Kissed Hero right after, and I damn near quit the whole fandom after I discovered nearly 300k words in that the weird keeps going up and the quality keeps going down AND it's not even close to being finished. It's still an interesting story to steal ideas from though.

*** I don't know whether to be thankful to you for recommending Back Again, Harry? or annoyed because now I'm gonna go crazy, as it hasn't been updated in 2 1/2 years. I guess you provided a warning, so thanks, I guess?
