I know this is a odd duo but in stories where Draco ends up befriending Harry and his friends i feel like he has something in common with Sirius. Namely that he was raised in this bigoted family but chose to run away and be close to his friends instead. I guess Draco represents what Sirius could have been if he had met more bigoted friends first at least to me.

So basically any fic that focuses on a friendship between these two I would love. i remember reading one story where Sirius escaped earlier from Azkaban and in his dog form was adopted by the Malfoys and only like Draco knew he was really human or something ( its been a while) but apart from that I've never seen a fic focused on these two and id like to.

There's a sequel to it as well. I LOVE this fic and it breaks my heart that it never got completed, but it's still worth reading.

** Draco and Sirius are covered in linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9323225/chapters/21128351]]) but not in the first book (it's a four part series).

I'd reccomend giving the whole series a read anyhow, it's my number one favourite.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/hd_erised_2017/works/12823128?view_adult=true][Adventures in Solitude (Are You There Sirius? It's Me Draco)]] features a friendship between Draco and Sirius' portrait. I thought it was well done and I'd love to read other friendship stories between these two!
