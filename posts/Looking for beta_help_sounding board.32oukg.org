Hi everyone! I saw someone post a similar thread a few nights ago, and seemed to have luck finding interested people to beta.

I have a story, probably considered to be heavily AU at this point (though it happens after canon) involving the end of the modern world and what the world would look like if everyone suddenly had magic. I'd like to think of myself as a strong developer of plot and story. I struggle with the actual montony of writing though. I'd be interested in having someone make sure I'm taking time to build the story completely with an eye towards painting a whole and vivid image. I'm more than happy to discuss details of my story. If you're interested, please let me know.

Any amount of help, whether a single message or a joint venture is very much appreciated.
