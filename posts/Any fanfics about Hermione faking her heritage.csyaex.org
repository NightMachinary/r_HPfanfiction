I'm looking for anything that shows people mistaking Hermione for a Pure-blood rather than realising that she is, in fact, muggle-born. I'd be interested to see how life would be different for Hermione if people had treated her differently than what we've seen/read. I'd also think this would work best if she had been sorted into Slytherin, but whatever you can recommend me is fine. Thanks!


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1401373][Harry Potter Without Harry Potter]] is a great series with this as a major plot point. For Hermione, she's pulled out of Hogwarts after the troll incident and cons her ways into Durmstrang by pretending to be a pureblood relation to the Nott family.

#+begin_quote
  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

** Unfortunately, I've never seen one about /Hermione/, but there are a few series where other female characters do the same that comes to mind, if you're looking to scratch that itch. T[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][he Pureblood Pretense]] is set in an AU world where only purebloods can attend Hogwarts, so half-blood femHarry with parents that are alive and no prophecy attached to her name switches places with Sirius Black's son, pretending to be a boy so she can go to school under his name. Fantastic series.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12664453/1/A-Name-Is-An-Enigma][A Name is an Enigm]]a is a pretty good Sirius/OC series where OC has a common pureblood surname, is sorted in Slytherin, and decides to run with everyone's assumption on who her family is rather than admitting she's muggleborn. Which is a problem when a lot of her friends and classmates are deatheater recruits.
