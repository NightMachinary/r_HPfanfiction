** Hermione, Harry and Ronnie were three perfectly happy children. Of course, in exactly ten and three-quarter minutes this would no longer be the case, but in general, the three children had exquisite lives. Hermione loved the family library, filled with ancient Potter tomes, magical textbooks and surprisingly, a good deal of Muggle romance novels. Harry loved the backyard quidditch pitch and his robes always seemed to have more grass stains than a frequent cleaning charm could manage. And Ronnie, though only two years old, had shown a surprising adeptness for wizard chess, and could proudly report that not once had her pieces refused to listen to her commands.

Blessed with such smart - and in Harry's case, extremely energetic - children, James and Lily Potter had done all they could to encourage their children' unique talents. But most important of all, they spent time with their children. Whether it was Lily teaching Hermione her own personal charms, James racing Harry around the Godric's Hollow, or the two of them together doing their best to overcome Ronnie's strategic defenses, the children never wanted for their parent's affection.

Of course, there are certain adventures that cannot be had under parental supervision, so right now Hermione, Harry and Ronnie were playing a rather intense game of hide-and-go-seek in the neighborhood graveyard. The ancient graveyard was perfect for such an activity, what with its large tombs and tombstones, and trees old enough that two children could easily hide behind the trunks. One might be worried that it would disturb the dead, but all the ghosts who resided in the area were reported to enjoy the sight of the children playing. Though Procella Peverell did seem to smirk a bit too much when one of the children ran over her late husband's grave.

‚ÄúAre you sure she won't be able to see us?‚Äù whispered Harry.

‚ÄúMostly.‚Äù replied Hermione biting her lip. ‚ÄúMother at least didn't seem to see me when I sneaked a bit of the toffee pudding she was making for tonight.‚Äù

Harry grinned at the new information. In his opinion, his mother's sticky toffee pudding was one of the great wonders of the world.

Leaves crackled, and the two children quieted and pressed their backs against the large oak tree they were both hiding behind. Holding their breaths, they watched as a shadow to their left grew larger and larger, until Ronnie came into view and slowly made her way past the tree. In her arms she was holding a large number of acorns, though Hermione and Harry couldn't figure out their purpose. Ronnie stopped about ten paces from the tree and slowly scanned the area. Her eyes slid over the place where Harry and Hermione were hiding in plain view, clearly not able to see them. Hermione and Harry relaxed, feeling pretty confident that their plan had worked.'

Only for Hermione to find herself being pelted by a steady stream of acorns.

‚ÄúOuch!‚Äù the two of them cried. Though Harry more as a result of Hermione jerking backwards and bruising his nose.

‚ÄúFound you!‚Äù Ronnie cried gleefully.

‚ÄúHow'd you figure it out Ronnie? The glamour worked didn't it?‚Äù Harry asked sourly, rubbing his nose.

‚ÄúNot hide there.‚Äù Ronnie replied smugly, which Hermione and Harry understood to mean they hadn't picked the spot behind the tree yet, and as a result Ronnie had deduced it was the most logical place for them to hide.

‚ÄúWell good job Ronnie. And sorry Harry.‚Äù said Hermione as she stood and brushed twigs and leaves off the back of her robes. ‚ÄúI suppose it's my turn now.‚Äù

‚ÄúHem, hem.‚Äù

The three children turned at the sound of the high pitched cough. A toadish woman wearing an outrageous amount of pink stood before them.

‚ÄúHello Ms. Umbridge. How are you today?‚Äù asked Hermione politely. The three children were familiar with Ms, Umbridge given that she worked at the Ministry like their Mother and Father, though none could say they liked her that much.

‚ÄúOh dreadful.‚Äù Said Ms. Umbridge in a sweet tone that was at odds with her words. ‚ÄúJust dreadful. I've come to bring you children to the ministry.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? Were Mother and Father needed there?‚Äù asked Harry.

‚ÄúJust the opposite.‚Äù Said Ms. Umbridge saccharinely. ‚ÄúI'm afraid your parents have been killed in a very suspicious manner.‚Äù

Hermione, Harry and Ronnie looked at each other in alarm. Yes these three had been exceptionally happy children. And as a result of a very unfortunate series of events, they never would be again.

***** Same. A Count Olaf comparison popped up in another thread here like a week ago and I'm really inspired to try writing a crossover like this. I'm just trying to figure out how to make everything fit.

And when it comes to similarities between the two series the absolute best bit is: The second book in each of them features an Incredibly Deadly Snake.

****** Ah yes that would be wicked! Seeing as how sunny got all bestie with the snake perhaps the same could be done with the basilisk? You should give it a shot though! It would be interesting where they would be sorted. I think that hermione and klaus would be best mates which would be a fun dynamic could make them a relation of a pure blood family that went squib? And one of Olaf's plans traps them like in the elevator and they use magic instead of vi's inventions and accidentally apparate or something.

*** It's super tempting, but I'm conflicted between writing Harry Potter characters with ASoUE plotlines, or using more ASoUE-ish characters within the Hogwarts stories. Basically, I'm trying to figure out which framework to make the primary one.

** There's actually a story which fits your request, a crossover where the Baudelaires go to Hogwarts. It's more of an /ASoUE/ fic with a /Harry Potter/ setting, though, being written in the style of an /ASoUE/ book that just happens to be set at Hogwarts; and is more mindful of /ASoUE/ than /HP/ canon. But here it is: /[[http://asoue.proboards.com/thread/29564/arcane-academy][The Arcane Academy]]/.

*** Count Olaf is the main antagonist of Lemony Snicket's /A Series of Unfortunate Events/, a villain whose gimmick is that he keeps menacing the kid heroes in a new design every book which is absurdly paper-tin but which only the children ever seem to see through.

In the theatrical movie he was played by Jim Carey, and more recently Neil Patrick Harris portrayed him in the three-seasons Netflix series.
