The Troubles in NI, while calmer, was still raging on during Harry's time in Hogwarts.

This topic has always interested me and I can't help but wonder whether or not wizards in Northern Ireland would've been involved in the conflict.

I believe the only mention J.K. Rowling gives to Northern Ireland is a popular Quidditch team the "Ballycastle Bats".

Any fics which acknowlege the conflict?


** I've never seen one do it well, it's always horrifically offensive and stereotypes Seamus to be some nutter terrorist.

** This dedicates a subplot to it. It seems oddly grafted on, like the author decided it had to be included because it's historic, even though it didn't really fit with the rest of the plot. Pretty good story otherwise though.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
