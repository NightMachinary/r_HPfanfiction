:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry is mega depressed after Sirius' death, more so than in canon. When Voldemort sends him another vision, this time of the Death Chamber, he goes even though he knows it's a trap. There, he and Voldemort have a chat about the nature of the Veil and some of the things that Voldemort has learned about it. Harry ends up walking through the Veil voluntarily.

At the other end of it, Harry encounters a very strange house-elf that helps Harry understand what he needs to do now. Harry must travel through the multiverse, alternatively assisting and taking the place of the Harry Potters who need help with their Voldemort. In the first universe he lands in, he finds HIS Sirius in Grimmauld Place; the native Sirius was killed in that universe's PoA. The native Potters are all alive, but the native Harry is a total ponce, a typical spoiled rich kid who is friends with Draco and Pansy. Harry Prime shares a moment of commiseration with Snape.
