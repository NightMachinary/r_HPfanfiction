*** linkffn(11858167) is the sorta obvious one here, but its not a romantic pairing in the slightest but rather a trio pushed to their limits.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

***** It isn't a romantic pairing. Call them platonic life partners if you need to file them in a category.

** There's a light (Dark)HarryxBellatrix one-shot called "From The Shadows" on FFN; it's by Nicodemusshadow. I know it's not Harry and Hermione, but it's pretty good. Here's the summary and link:

Harry is in the Department of Mysteries, when he stops to ask Bellatrix a question. Why? The answers given reveal the mind of a tortured woman, and a plot is hatched.

  While Harry waits for his girlfriend to return from her 'camping trip' he gets an unexpected visit that changes everything. Rating because of some language and I'm paranoid.
