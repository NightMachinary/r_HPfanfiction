** Got a rough estimate of length? Like, 20k words? Or more likely to be 100k+?

*** I have a tendency for longer fics, so I wouldn't at all be surprised if it on the long (or very, very long) end of things. If I had to ballpark it, I'd say 100k+ almost for sure.

**** Well, a quick look through them with filters that should fit, has turned up nothing that sounds like what you describe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Avengers-Crossovers/224/9786/?&srt=3&lan=1&r=10&len=100]]

HPxCaptain America had nothing either. Same for HPxElder Scrolls.

Wish you luck finding it, but since I never heard of it, this is all that came to mind to find it.

***** I've also not found anything through filter searches, which is why I turned to reddit. Hoping that someone might know of the story and be able to definitively say it's "this fic", deleted, etc...oh well. Thanks for your time anyways!
