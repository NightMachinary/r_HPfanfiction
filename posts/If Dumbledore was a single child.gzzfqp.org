As the title suggests, I am interred in a history/present fic with the underlying premise been that Dumbledore /didn't/ have any siblings to hold him down.

You could either have Dumbledore /realise/ early on that Gellert's a bad apple (Unlikely) And have some form of canon come about. (A Dumbledore without the baggage is /bad, bad, bad/ news for Voldie) Or you could go strait into the Grindelwald+Dumbledore pro world.


** If Albus were an only child, then a lot of things would have been different.

His father would not have been sent to Azkaban, because there would have been no Arianna to be injured by Muggle boys, and therefore no Muggle boys to take revenge on.

Percival not dying in Azkaban and Kendra not dying by one of Arianna's outbursts means that the Dumbledore family, while not affluent, may not in such a precarious situation. Albus could go on his world tour, maybe with Ephilias Doge, maybe not.

There would be no need to have to relocate to Godric's Hollow either. And that means no direct connection to Bathilda Bagshot.

Maybe Albus encounters Gellert, maybe he doesn't, but Albus won't be "trapped" by the responsibility of caring for Abeforth and Arianna in this timeline.

*** Would that, presuming he didn't encounter Grindelwald but still stopped him, make him less prepared to deal with Voldemort? I imagine having no connection to Grindelwald would mean Dumbledore wouldn't hold anything back.

Or would it make Voldemort more cautious?

**** I would argue Tom would never become Voldemort. Taking away Arianna and Aberforth affects the story drastically.

  maybe with Ephilias Doge, maybe not.

From what I remember, Albus friendship with Ephilias is at least partly due to the fact that they were both social pariah when they started Hogwarts (Albus because of his father, and Ephilias because he was just healing from the dragonpox et was still a bit green).

Without his father going to Azkaban, people would not wait for Albus to show his genius before approaching him and maybe he would have made another friends at school.

** I doubt he would become Hogwarts' headmaster, or even a teacher there.

** Best case scenario is that he stands up to Grindlewald much sooner than he did canonically. Like, if Dumbles bodies him in 1935 instead of 1945 then that's 10 years of peace that otherwise wouldn't exist.

Worst case scenario is that, since he didn't learn from his dalliance with Grindy that he absolutely cannot handle even a small bit of political power, he wouldn't have resisted taking the post of Minister when offered it and he becomes the tyrant that he feared that he canonically (? Is this fanon? I don't fucking know anymore.) feared he would be.
