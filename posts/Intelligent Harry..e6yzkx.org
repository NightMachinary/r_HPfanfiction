Looking for a fanfiction with an hardworking intelligent Harry.

The same Harry we have in canon, a hard worker instead of being a natural genius.

In canon, Harry could've probably been in the Tom Riddle's league as a student. The only problem is that he didn't put enough effort in his studies. And didn't have that drive like Tom did of succeeding.

If he was driven and hardworking. It's not hard to imagine he would have made Hermione red from jealousy.


** The Mind Arts has a Harry with a preternatural talent for Legilimency but, other than that, he busts his ass non-stop studying to be peerless. On mobile or I'd link you. My only complaint is it sticks along general canon lines for about 10 chapters but zooms through the years.

*** I read the first chapter. The only problem I have with it, it's how easy wandless magic came easily towards Harry. The legilimency I understand, but the Apparatition was just a bit too much.

**** Oh yeah, the Apparition. I'm like 13 chapters in and he's used it sooo sparingly, it felt like he could have added that skill much later with no change to the story.

** Hmm, I think you may be looking at Harry through rose-tinted glasses. In canon, Harry is talented, undeniably. He has potential and if he were more studious he could have been somewhat better. But what Harry is "specialized." Most wizards/witches appear to have innate leanings towards specific magics - Harry with Protection/Defense, Voldemort with Dark Magic, Snape with Potions, James and Lily with Transfiguration and Charms. The truly exceptional wizards/witches are those who despite their leanings are prodigious in all branches of magic, something akin to "generalists" as it were (there is a decent explanation of this idea in Ch. 4 of What You Leave Behind).

The thing is Tom Riddle (and Albus Dumbledore) was a once in a lifetime prodigy and likely close to what we would call a genius. They had a spark for creativity, instinctive understanding of magic, and intellect that only happened once in a lifetime (at least in Britain from what we see). For context, I see Hermione as more akin to Snape in canon (obviously not in behavior or beliefs). Both are fairly academic, have a drive to learn and improve, but they lack the sort of innate grasp of magic people like TR and AD have. Harry perhaps has such a capability (maybe), but I admit I am skeptical.

Now, I can supply you with fics that show Harry as "working for it," though its down to you whether you think its sufficient:

- linkffn(On the Way to Greatness): canon Harry in Slytherin, without the more warm and supporting environment he received as a Gryffindor, Harry is forced to be more proactive, even straying into darker territory (at one point a Death Eater notes "you fight like us").
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived): probably read this, but this is a fic where a more academic Harry had that "spark" I mentioned but wants to get out of his brothers shadow.
- linkffn(What You Leave Behind): Harry is much more interested in magic and learning than he is in canon, though still retains certain vestiges of his canon personality.
- linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): this one starts a bit rocky, but changes to 4th year make Harry eager to increase his knowledge and skill base (throughout the fic too), and Dumbledore certainly obliges him.
- linkffn(Forging the Sword): long story short, a change in CoS makes Harry realize he needs to be better if he wants to prevent anymore tragedies. Slow but great worldbuilding and magical exploration.
- linkffn(By the Divining Light): has Harry who really works to be as skilled as he is (he even points this out to Ron in the sequel that he got so good at magic because he put in the time and effort).

*** Wow did you low ball Snape here. I despise him as much as the next person, but /he/ is a generalist and probably the 3rd best wandholder in the series. Snape at 16/17 outpaced Hermione by a lot.

Just because you specialize in a branch doesn't mean you can't be really good at other branches. Harry and Snape were really good at curses, Lily was good at potions, Slughorn seemed to be good at transfiguration.

And while Harry is no prodigy, the second half of DH is him grasping magic in ways Voldemort couldn't.

[[/u/MegaMindAuthor][u/MegaMindAuthor]] check out Enembee's other stories when/if you read By the Divining Light. Victoria Potter and Tales of Three by AutumnSouls are studious girl Harry's.

*** Yes, Harry has more talent towards Defense related Magic. But I just wondered if he had been studious and hard worker like Hermione, then probably he could be better in other magics too. Probably close but not in Dumbledore's league.

*** What You Leave Behind.

This was nice to read, but you can actually see that some of the characters are OOC. Instead of being their canonical selves. They are like an extension of the author who seems to want fix the usual problems us readers have with Harry Potter.

** linkffn(13352687)

Only eight chapters in and starts pretty compliant to cannon, though it will divulge more and more as the story progresses and I already have the entire first year written, just not posted. Harry is quite intelligent, but he does bust his ass for the skill he will gain, and he is going to reach very prodigious levels, but not be god like (meaning he will not be unchallenged) I am actually quite excited for the story to play out, though it does start a bit slow.

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater.

** Self promotion aside, I second The Mind Arts, though would STRONGLY RECOMMEND A Cadmean Victory by DarknessEnthroned.

linkffn(11446957)

He starts out pretty much as he did in cannon, just very motivated as a result of Pettigrew's escape. Honestly a top 3 favourite of mine, and I'm not even a huge fan of Harry/Fleur stories.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
