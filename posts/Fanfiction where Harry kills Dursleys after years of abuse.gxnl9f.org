** You know, I think I've read more fanfics where Harry ended up killed by the Dursley's abuse and neglect than fanfics where he kills the Dursleys. In fact, I don't think I've read /any/ fanfiction where Harry actually kills the Dursley, but then I avoid Dark!Harry fanfics, where that is most likely to happen.

I've seen a few where they wound up dead either through their own actions, or from someone trying to get at Harry, but I've never actually read any where Harry was directly responsible, that I can remember.

  Only the strong may rule, this was the way of the Dark Side, and Darth Millennial was about to prove to his master that he was worthy of the title Dark Lord of the Sith, but first a tremor in the Force draws him to the Unknown Regions of space... I do not own the picture

** There was one where he completely loses it, and slaughters the whole family. The Aurors arrive, and I think he offed a couple of them too. And then he goes to Hogwarts as if he wasn't a psychotic murderer.

I can't remember the name.

  Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.
