I've been reading fanfics for quite some time, but along the way I started to get into a habit of checking to see if the "Complete" tag was on stories or jumping to the final chapters and trying to see if there was an author's note about the story finally finishing.

So many times I'll read through a story only to find out that it's been abandoned and forgotten and so many times I've been burned by that. Unfortunately, it seems like I'm in the majority here, I've clicked through so many redditors' recommendations and started reading only to find out that they're either unfinished or ongoing... especially since most of the authors are doing this as just a little side thing and hobby, updates aren't frequent, consistent or reliable so that's just as bad as it being unfinished cause I don't have the patience.

So how do you guys deal with it?


** I suppose it's about what you're in it for. I've long since scratched my itch to see Harry and his friends in certain specific situations, to see JKR's world stretched to its limits. At this point, as a reader, I'm in it for good writing, for that feeling of immersion, for the sense that I'm in capible hands and being told a good story.

I'd compare it to, say, listening to a song I love. You don't need to hear the whole song to get a sense of its style, its soul. It would be great to hear the complete song, but there's just so much enjoyment to be had in individual beats and moments. A song doesn't need to end to sweep you up, to make you feel something, to make you think something.

I'd absolutely love it if every fic I enjoyed were finished, but I'd never not read something that looked interesting and/or well-written just because it doesn't have an ending.

** A lot of fics are trash and some of the unfinished ones are considered amongst the best we have. Harry Potter and the boy who lived, forging the sword etc. Unfinished fics are only frustrating when they're good and even then the whole better to have loved and had it incomplete than to have never loved at all.

** People can't write endings. You'll read a lot of completed fics and before long you'll probably find that the best bit is around the middle somewhere, and that the endings are rushed/poorly planned/dull/over simple or just bad. Then you start to read fics that are great but don't have endings and realise you still get plenty of enjoyment to make it worth your while.

** So, here's the sad truth: most fics suck. There was once a day where I had no filter and I could read pretty much anything all the way through without caring, as long as it was HP words. But still, it got tiring reading the same retread ideas over and over, magical cores, ice queen, inheritance, same shit over and over just with a different title. So, it takes a really good story to actually hold my attention, Chances are, even if a story is complete, it's going to have to be really good for me to even finish it. So, the fact that a story is unfinished to me doesn't matter, since by raw statistics alone, I'm unlikely to make it far enough for it to matter.

Out of curiosity do you avoid OCs? Cause if you do then that might well contribute to the same-old-same-old. If everyone starts in the same place yeah a lot of journeys will end up being similar.

** Honestly, half of the value of FF to me is giving me material to daydream about, so while I prefer finished fics, an unfinished fic does much the same thing.

Even with finished fics I end up daydreaming about what could have been done differently.

** I'm fine with reading things that have recently been updated, reviewing can be fun when you get into conversations with authors and sometime even influence the story. Its a nice surprise to see a fic you like update when you are not expecting it.

That said, I do steer clear of things that have been abandoned for months or years.

**** It's not the most precise method, but you can estimate update rate by when reviews have been posted for each chapter of the story. You just have to go through the oldest reviews first and take note of when the first review for each particular chapter gets written.

**** I have a pretty good memory, that certainly helps. Another thing is with fanfiction your working with familiar characters so even if I don't remember the details you can guess based in the characters.

If a particularly complicated story updates or a story has been on a particularly long hiatus I usually just see it as an excuse to reread the story.

** I prefer complete stories too, but in the past few months it's bothered me less and less, to the point where I'm quite good with reading unfinished fics, as the enjoyment I get from them isn't diminished by not having an end. [[/u/Lane_Anasazi][u/Lane_Anasazi]] put it beautifully into words.

The strange thing is, nowadays, I much prefer abandoned fics to WIPs. At least these ones I know that this is as much as I get, well, it isn't complete so move on. WIPs give me issues, especially the good ones.

** I'm with you here, 100%. Too many times I followed a story to have it end up abandoned or not updated for so long that I completely forgot what was going on in the story. Now I check that a story is complete before I even start to read. If someone recs a WIP and it looks good, I mark it to read later and check back to see if it's done from time to time but I won't read it until it's done.

*** What do you consider "active"? Or I suppose what's the best way to know if a story is active? On FF, it only says the date of the most recent update, but I've never found anything about when the chapters were published, so even if someone was updated this past November, we don't know if it was after a 2 year break or not. I know that this is completely on the author's own time and its unreasonable to ask for a consistent schedule, but I've read some good stories and it irks me to find out that they're unfinished.

** Pick a story length that works for you. If it gets finished, great. If it doesn't, you get to see a good amount of the story and situation. That's what I do now. The unfinished fics that really disappoint me are 1-5 awesome chapters setting up an interesting idea with absolutely no follow through. Reading 20-30 chapters can bring you deep into a good story. Imagination fills up the rest. Plus, there are some fics that should end but the author drags it on past making sense. In that case, you make some point your headfanon ending, and it's like a complete story.

** I do almost the same. If a fic is not been finished, or if it hasn't been updated in the last 2 months, I usually don't bother with it, save for some exceptions, like Starfox5's fics. His latest has a weekly update rate. (sorry if I got the name wrong!)

** What's the point of a finished fic over an unfinished one? You know they're going to defeat Voldemort and live happily ever after 99% of the time. I'd personally take a fic with good writing and some new ideas and interesting situations and emotions over a mediocre finished fic, or even over a good finished fic with a bad or sad ending.

** Personally, I'd rather read an unfinished fic than a 200k monster of a rambling mess (which I consider most 200k+ fics to be). For me, it's about quality. It is indeed frustrating to really love a story and then have it cut off without an ending, but does that change the fact that I really enjoyed what was there? If I limited myself to only completed fics, I wouldn't have much of anything to read.

** I'm usually in the same boat, so I go after finished or established stories. The last one is harder to identify, but last update date together with number of words per year usually gives me a good idea of what to expect. A fic that has under 100k words per year will probably be to slow for me (or point to greater non posting periods or hiatus from the author).

I also skim A/N fir the 3 newest chapters. Any mention of "I'm back" or similar gets the fic put on a "maybe later" list that I can come back to after 2-3 months to see how many new chapters were written, to avoid the typical one chapter post and then disappears again.

** Don't start reading uncompleted fics in the first place for starters. To me, a terrible fic with an ending is still better than a good fic that just dangles on, without an end because at least for the shitty fic, there's some closure. You can put it aside and forget it, whereas with a good but unfinished fic, the "what-if" question of unrealised potential can be agonising and i just do not want to deal with that.

Really, it's true that 90% of fics are crap, but even so, considering that Harry Potter has like hundreds of thousands of fics spread across dozen of sites, there must be still hundreds or thousands of solid, completed fics out there. Worse, come to worse, read one-shots, because really they cut down on the exposition a lot and leave you just reading the character's feelings.

Yet, let's say you are a masochist and you love getting the metaphorical cockblock. The most important thing then is to check that at least the author updates regularly. See their bios, check their fic to see if the author's notes give some indication of an update schedule. Look at the status of their other fics to see their habits if they have any. Sometimes the best indication of a completed fic is the author having done so before. If you see the author having multiple fics, but only one or no completed indicators between them, then you might need to be wary that the author probably has a lot of ideas but is prone to abandoning them regularly.

Maybe the author is more private or doesnt want to write long-ass author notes, so you dont get any dates. What then? First thing i check is the last updated date. Dont expect any new updates for one if the fic hasnt been touched this year. I mostly avoid these fics unless the premise is extra compelling, otherwise i go on to the next step.

Then, i check the date published and the number of chapters. Do some basic math to see the average periods between chapters posted. If you see a 10 chapter fic for example, just updated last week, but was first published June 2007, you know this guy has issues putting his ideas down to words. Generally, a good update period is about 20 chapters per year, 12-15 if the story is really addictive. Give the author abour 2 weeks between updates to account for the fact that fanfic-writing is a hobby. That said an author that updates weakly like Starfox5 or White Squirrel are the best people and you know you will get a story every week on the dot. Philosophize is another author who has recently completed a trilogy of a Fem!harry/Hermione series and her profile is nothing but completed fics with an author-note that she updates twice a week, which is quite frankly insane and she deserves more views and like for her work ethic

Lastly of course is fic length. It's best to get some meat when starting a fic. It sucks stumbling upon an interesting premise in the summary, only to discover upon later reading the author's only got 3 chapters, 8000 words that have just barely diverged from canon yet you can see the potential direction where the author is taking the fic. It bums me out whenever i start such fics and it ends so abruptly. Also if the fic starts Year one when Harry wants to be badass and punch the Dursleys or something, i better get at least a 100 k of content that has covered the first year or so. I frankly wouldnt start HPMOR today because even Rational!Harry doesn't sound like that when he's only 11 years old
