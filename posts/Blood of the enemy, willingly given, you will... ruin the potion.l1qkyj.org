I've always wondered about the Voldemort baby-body resurrection ritual that canonically appears at the end of Triwizard Tournament.

*"Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son! Flesh of the servant, willingly given, you will revive your master. Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your foe."*

Forcibly taken implies a struggle, but what if Harry willingly gave up his blood? Would that have been sufficient to ruin the potion?

It would be pretty funny to watch Baby Voldie and Pettigrew just stand around looking at each other thinking, /Damn it, what now?/


** I don't think Harry could really 'willingly' give up his blood to resurrect Voldemort. Just not struggling doesn't make it willing--he would actually have to want his blood to resurrect Voldemort.

For the record, I've also seen an OP Harry levitate grass and other random ingredients into the cauldron when Wormtail's not looking. All those cauldrons he watched Neville explode (and his own sabotaged ones) gave him the idea.

** Oddly i'm working on one of these right now. Sneak peek

​

*Harry Potter and the Importance of Intent.*

/Because it's a loophole, but everything has it's risks./

Harry and Cedric nodded to one another “A Hogwarts victory!” they agreed and grasped the Tri-Wizard cup. Harry felt a tugging sensation behind his navel, as if he'd been caught by a giant hook, and the maze vanished into a swirling rainbow of light. Oh.. a portkey.

Harry fell to the ground when the portkey ended... on a wet grass in ... a graveyard.

This didn't seem right. And the stabbing headache in his scar boded poorly.

“Kill the spare” said a childish voice, someone chanted the incantation for a killing curse and a bolt of Green light hit Cedric Diggory, and he fell, his eyes open... and unseeing.

Harry tried to rise to his feet, but the pain in his head from his scar, the pain in his leg from the acromantula venom... Harry fainted.

Harry woke, to a hard poke in the stomach, tied upright on a ... grave. Harry twisted his head; he'd been tied to a statue of an angel of death. And the stabbing pain in his scar wasn't helping.

There was a huge... massive cauldron on a fire with something silvery-white in it. A short wizard in robes was stirring it.

“Last stir Peter, then the final ingredients” said the childish voice from nearby.

Harry looked over at the voice; it came from a tiny baby-sized bundle. A bundle he suspected was giving him a splitting headache.

Next to the cauldron, on a gravestone, lay a knife and a strip of cloth. And Harry's wand, next to another wand.

“Bone of the father, taken without asking, you shall restore your son” said the wizard... who looked like a thinner, lined Peter Pettigrew. He waved his wand, and below Harry's feet, the slab cracked, and a trickle of dust flew across the air into the cauldron.

“Flesh of the servant, freely given, you shall restore you master” said Pettigrew, picking up a knife from the nearby gravestone and ... cutting his whole hand off and dropping it in the cauldron, where it landed with a splosh. Pettigrew, white-faced and shuddering, bound the stump of his wrist in the cloth, and using his teeth and remaining hand tied it off.

As Pettigrew staggered towards Harry, holding the knife, the cloth wrapped around his stump stained red with blood he said fairly clearly “Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken, you shall restore my master.

Pettigrew pulled Harry's sleeve up and stabbed into Harry's arm with the knife.

Harry had an idea... not a great idea but he'd always thought well on his feet, as it were.

“Here... have it” said Harry, trying to relax as the knife cut his arm and the blood pooled on the knife-blade. When Pettigrew turned and headed for the cauldron without cutting Harry's hand off, Harry breathed a sigh of slight relief. Now... to see if he was right in his guess.

Peter dripped Harry's blood from the knife into the cauldron, and the liquid flared with a white light, bubbling and roiling. Then Pettigrew dropped the knife, and picked up the bundle, clumsily removing the wrapping from a hideous red baby “Quickly Peter” hissed the baby, and Peter dropped the baby into the cauldron, which continued to bubble. Harry's headache flared and faded. The light in the liquid faded, and a great cloud of steam billowed out of the cauldron. Peter stood, clutching his stump. Waiting.

When the steam dissipated, the cauldron was full of liquid.

“My Lord?” croaked Peter, his stump dripping blood now. Harry wondered how long you could go without healing if you cut your own hand off. There were a lot of large blood vessels after all.

When Peter resorted to using the stirring spoon to search the cauldron, Harry started to feel hope. He'd stood within eyeline of Neville in potions for years, and this looked like a potions-stuff-up.

Peter panicked for some reason ... and pulled the spoon out, the end having melted.

That was about when the cauldron exploded.

Harry woke up, lying painfully on a pile of rocks, the ropes wrapped around him a lot looser. His glasses were missing, his breath sounded strange, and he had a dizzy feeling that he had lost a lot of blood. And it was getting dark. Squinting, Harry determined that he was lying on the ruin of the statue he'd been tied to. He crawled out, still partly wrapped in ropes, that seemed to be partly shredded. In the distance, Harry squinted, he could see the cup glittering.

When Harry touched the cup, he was whisked off by portkey magic, landing in a very painful thud into the ground. Time must have passed, or something, because the sky was dark now.

Harry rolled painfully onto his back.

--==0==--

Harry woke up in an infirmary bed. The smell told him that if nothing else. Harry opened his eyes to the light, the white arched ceiling. Hogwarts infirmary.

“He's woken up” said Madam Pomfrey.

She blurrily fed Harry a bad-tasting potion. Then another. And then another. All the while talking about the weather and Harry's last quidditch match.

“Um” croaked Harry “I'm not well am I” he just managed.

“The explosion, whatever that was, did a lot of damage” said Madam Pomfrey.

“A lot?” croaked Harry.

“We can re-grow all the lost body parts. It's going to take a little while” said Madam Pomfrey.

Harry fell asleep.

Days of swallowing potions and eating small portions of food hand fed, and Harry squinted at his bandaged hands and arms “Madam Pomfrey, I'm burnt all over?” he asked.

“It's... cuts from pieces of cauldron and er... a dark potion.” said Madam Pomfrey.

Ron and Hermione came in around the cloth barricade, looked and tried not to look upset.

The way they avoided mentioning how hurt Harry was told him a lot.

A week later, with new eye-glasses Harry got out of bed, pulled on a dressing gown and took the crutches and went to the bathroom. The mirror told a tale. No hair, and his skin was a mass of burn scars that showed no sign of healing. Harry grinned to himself, his teeth very white and his eyes bottle-green “But you should see the other fellow” he said reassuringly to his own reflection.

His bits were growing back, so at least going to the loo wasn't too awkward.

Although Madam Pomfrey didn't want Harry to, he limped on crutches to the last day of term, in school robes. His hands and face looked terrible, but as he kept telling himself, the other guy looked worse.

The Great hall was full of talking students, but that all stopped when Harry limped in.

“Hello everyone, I'm not dead. Just badly burnt.” said Harry “Don't enter the Tri-Wizard tournament” he joked.

** Would it ruin the potion... probably not. In fact, it would probably help.

The main theme of the ritual was "Dark Lord takes what he wants". Flesh of servant, bone of father, blood of enemy. Domination.

If the blood is willingly given, then the theme changes a bit.

A bit like with unicorn blood. If taken by force, it will still be a potent healing agent, it will just carry an equally potent curse. Thus, willingly offered blood would still provide power - and potentially also control over the donor, since blood in magic is usually "sacrifice/life/power". The act would translate to "I give my life/existence/power/essence to you" - very bad for Harry.

Now, contamination (even dirt) or swap (one fic had a small sack of assorted liquids harvested from Arcomantula glued to the wrist and disguised) would work, because the rituals are supposed to be pretty unforgiving of mstakes, and not providing the agreed upon payment (blood of enemy).

*My headcanon* is that you could fuck Voldemort over if you added granite dust at the same time as 'blood of the enemy' - as blood of the earth, it could result in Voldemort basically declaring enmity with the planet, which in turn is often considered the source of magic. Fun times!

1. It weakens the potion, so Voldemort "isn't as powerful" as he could have been - and inevitably, it's not explored exactly what that means.

2. They stop, just move a few steps to the left, and take the very dead Cedric's blood instead. "The Enemy" is pretty much any non-Death-Eater, after all.

I remember one fic where Winky, directed by Barty Junior, was the one to get the blood - while Harry was in the hospital wing and hopped up enough on something to believe it's for Poppy to examine it. That had Outcome Number One, from what I remember.

** I am greatly enjoying the examples given in this discussion to attempt to subvert the ritual. Thank you for putting forth this post.

I've been contemplating this myself. I'm writing a fic where Snape gets caught up in magic gone wrong breaking the space/time compendium for him. He gets thrown into Nov of Harry's early school career. He's deaged and practically on Death's doorstep to top it off, but Madame Pomphrey is a badass and brings him around. He poses as his own bastard son, no one being wiser than Pomphrey and 'older' Snape. 'Older' Snape gets cozy with Quirrellmort in hopes of preventing everything. It doesn't, but it makes Voldie trust him to help during the tournament. They replace the bones of the father with bones of random animals. 'Young' Snape also hijacks the cup so he, disguised as Harry, donates his blood instead. He /is/ an enemy, but his premeditation makes the donation voluntary rather than forcibly. Hopefully all the alterations will hinder Voldy from successfully returning... but maintains 'older' Snape's viability as a spy if Voldy returns anyway. I'm having fun with it.

** /"Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken, will resurrect your foe," said Wormtail as he stabbed Harry in the arm, before the blood dripped into the vial./

/"Help yourself, Wormtail, by all means, take my blood," hissed Harry and Wormtail froze, unsure what to do, but the blood had to be added now for the ritual to go on right. The blood bubbled as Wormtail turned back towards the cauldron. The servant moved forward, before he collapsed to the ground and just managed to dump the stolen blood in the cauldron./

​

​

/"You're bumbling with the ritual has caused me to return at a fractured state, I'm required to take further steps to rectify it, thus distracting myself from my plans" said Voldemort as he looked in Wormtail's eyes, which were wide with absolute fear in them. Voldemort forced his way into Wormtail's simple mind and found what had happened. Potter's flippant remark about telling Wormtail to take his blood had botched the ritual. Magic had its strange way of leading a life of its own and one simple word could change an entire ritual. Voldemort thought Wormtail was a fool not to gag Potter./

** By this point, Harry has been attacked, disarmed, tied up, has seen his friend murdered, and has a deadly weapon pointing at him. I think that qualifies as forcibly, no matter what he says. In fact he arguably /cannot/ consent in that scenario (the "arguably" is only because the rules of magic may be different).

*** I think that might be the only situation that it could work. That said, it could still depend - we're never told the full ritual, just the major component. For all we know, Harry's desire to kill voldie could fully satisfy the enemy requirement. The fact that he did not set put that day to give his blood means that it might still be forcibly taken. This might just come from my love of fics where magic is semi- or fully-sentient, just in ways that are hard for humans to understand.

**** There's a question, does it have to be blood of an enemy, forcibly taken? Could it be blood of an enemy, willingly given? Or blood of an ally, forcibly taken? This doesn't feel clear. There are too many variables!
