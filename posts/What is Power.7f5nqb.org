When your Hogwart's letter arrived in the mail, you could not believe your eyes. The professor who came with it showed you things, impossible things, /wondrous/ things, things you suddenly realized you wanted to be able to do more than anything else in the world. Your first trip down Diagon Alley was a revelation of a different kind, showing you that for all its trappings the Wizarding world was not so very different from the Mundane one; they still had jobs and shops and put their knowledge on paper to be passed on to the next generation. A trace of the shine was lost, perhaps, but you hardly had time to notice it as you got your books and potions kits and your wand!

You went to school, and the hat put you in Hufflepuff. It was a bit of a surprise; you thought you would be a sure thing for Ravenclaw. You didn't mind. Then classes started; then you read your books all the way through. Then you read the next year's books, and the next year's. Then you watched your peers, watched them use magic to pick their teeth and do their laundry, and all the little mundane things people do. You watched them walk through the ever changing halls of the castle with a grumble at the inconvenience, rather than awe at the skill necessary to make such a thing. You watched them 'settle' for a passing grade, learning only what was required to pass the tests rather than trying to understand the /magic/. You watched them struggle with even simple spells, not because of a lack of talent, but because of a lack of practice, a lack on /interest/.

Where were the flying castles, monoliths of stone drifting amongst the clouds, invisible to mundane senses? Where were the men made of wind and the women made of fire, bodies reshaped from base material to something more? Where was the joy, the appreciation, the acknowledgment that you were all learning /mother fucking magic/!?

You watched your peers, your teachers, your new world...

And all you could think was...

[[https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/56294360/this-is-fucking-weak.jpg][Weak.]]

So. You are an eleven year old muggleborn who has just started their Hogwart's education. You are relatively smart, though not excessively so. You have decent hand-eye coordination, and can speak a little of a couple languages so your pronunciation is good. Your family is comfortably middle class, so while you won't be buying one of every book in Flourish and Blotts you can afford an extra dozen or so used books each year. You don't mind merely getting decently solid EEs on your course work if your interests lie elsewhere. Your stated goal in life is to do something blatantly impossible and/or reality breaking, like building your own version of Hogwarts from scratch in a single afternoon, or opening a stable wormhole to every planet in the solar system.

How long will it take for such actions to be placed on the 'things I can do' list using only what is shown in canon?


** Magic, as depicted in canon, is difficult to learn.

Harry, someone with considerable talent, had spent weeks just learning Accio. Most in the Ministy couldn't cast a decent shield spell, even fewer could manage a corporeal Patronus.

Even Dumbledore and Voldemort, who were the best in centuries and had decades pushing the limit of Magic, didn't even come close in what you were trying to do here with a few books available to the public.

Actually, Harry buying a few books and suddenly becoming the most powerful wizard of all time is a trademark cliche in badly written indy!Harry fics.

*** There are two ways to learn powerful magic in the HP universe. Read about it in a book, or invent it yourself.

Inventing spells is easy; Snape invents several spells by his sixth year.

Books are all over the place; Secrets of the Darkest Arte was stored in the Hogwarts library for decades before Dumbledore removed it.

The founders were not super-human. They were four talented wizards working together in order to make a castle which bordered on sentient. How did they get there, then? Did they invent the spells themselves? Was it four people working together that made them so much more powerful? Did they write down any of their knowledge?

Your assertion that magic takes practice (as in Harry's case learning the summoning charm) is already accepted in the premise. But Hermione learned the protean charm in, what, a month? And that was material considered NEWT standard. People in the ministry suck at basic defense because they considered that class as being like PE; something you had to take to get through school, but not something which matters in real life. Defense magic is only one branch of magical application, and our hypothetical muggleborn is interested in all of them. Wizards who are bad at magic are bad because they didn't bother to learn, the same way most kids in schools don't sink a lot of time into classes, particularly ones they find boring. We could all learn to be expert hackers and martial artists, but we don't, because we don't think about it or we don't consider it worth it.

No one is powerful just because. They are powerful because they spent time and effort practicing and learning new magic. And based on Voldemort's rise to power, this might not even take very long.

**** I could see your premise work, but best as a post Hogwart fic. A Muggleborn kid wronged by the Magical World and disappointed in Shacklebolt/Potter/Granger regime might just decide to take on the system by himself/herself.

Heck, you might as well use Harry and Hermione as your protagonists in this postwar AU.

***** I think that it would work well as a "shadow war" (books 5 and 6) vigilante story with the main character (Penelope Clearwater would work well, or just go OC) finishing Hogwarts before OotP and struggling to find a magical job while watching Fudge's powerplays with rising frustration and anger before saying

***** Oh!

No, I'm just trying to get a feel for what people think becoming 'strong' requires. Within canon.

How long should it take? A lot of the wizards we see are 'weak' because they just don't bother to put in the effort. How long would it take for someone who was genuinely interested in becoming strong to get there?

What made Voldemort and Dumbeldore strong? How long did it take them to get there? How long would it take a more average, but dedicate, person? If we don't care about 'combat strength', which is a bit different, what is necessary to do those amazing feats of magic? Is there a specific spell in a book somewhere, creatus hogwartus, which is just really tricky to cast right? Does mastery of the theory eventually grant some sort of meta-strength; ie, learning all of the basic transfigurations eventually gives you more freeform ability?

If there is no such thing as 'magic power', like some people just having larger batteries inside to power spells, then what do 'dark' or dark rituals /do/ to make Voldemort more powerful?

This feels so like what Tom Riddle must have felt.

** I think studying magic is bit like studying physics. Sure you can read about quarks and quantum theory but do you really *understand*?

Except instead of studying from a book I think that the most advanced magics take advantage of these principles but they are never written down anywhere and you have to infer sort of unconscious understanding of reality and magic from how things /feel/. Sure there are people like Dumbledore and Voldemort, Einstein and Isaac Newton.

So basically an analogous situation might be something like trying to understand what gravity *really* is when you everything reads world to be flat and you know that things fall when dropped.

That's my take on how advanced magic could be difficult.

Well. That's my ramble on nature of magic. Does that make any sense to anyone?

** IMO it is incredible people that perform incredible magic, as long as you have the determination and imagination you can do anything you want.

** Power is the having the maturity in magical knowledge to realise that something being big or flashy doesn't make it impressive. I have no doubt that HP magic could be used to make a floating castle. But I doubt wizards would be impressed by it. Levitation is a simple spell and its application to thousands of bricks is just a matter of time, not magical skill. Most wizards would likely consider such an undertaking a sign of great stupidity, not something impressive. Like the "Cauldron made of cheese" guy.

This does indirectly propose a more interesting premise though: the idea that one of the reasons pure-bloods look down on Muggleborns is that so many of them come to Hogwarts obsessed with "magical bling" of exactly the kind you propose. It mirrors nicely the IRL situation where old money looks down on the eye-wateringly crude displays of wealth of the nouveau riche.

*** That sounds like Lucius Malfoy's excuse for why he doesn't have a floating castle. If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, did it make a sound? If a man has magic, but never uses it for anything, is he still a wizard? There is a difference between understated elegance and over-the-top showing off, but nothing about how wizards behave is /actually magical/. And besides that, a floating castle isn't just ostentatious, it has immense practical value, as would a system of portals around the solar system. We're not talking about a mansion full of infinite rooms here, were talking about building something impressive, difficult, and useful. It isn't about showing off, it's about reminding your fellow wizards that magic is amazing.

I also think you might be forgetting just how much wizards like to show off too; remember the Quidditch World Cup?
