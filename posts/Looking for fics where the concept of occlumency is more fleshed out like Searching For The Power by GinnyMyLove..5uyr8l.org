I like the concept of occlumency being something you build and that it is as strong as the person can imagine it to be or like in some fics where Harry uses a computer type defense because wizards don't understand computers.

Are there any good fics like this where occlumency is a big part of the fic?

Edit:

Also i am only interested in completed fics


** linkffn(Lessons With Hagrid by NothingPretentious) is a hilarious take on your request. Essentially, Harry is sent to Hagrid to practice his Occlumency and he uses animals (And a brick) to protect his mind.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

** There is Pureblood Pretense where the author goes quite a lot into detail of magical theory, including Mind Arts. In fact, oclumency, although not a main topic of the story, appears very often. It is complete, but there are three more sequels and the last one is still ongoing. linkffn(7613196)

*** Ooh, yes, Harriet's 'mindscape' and mental relationship with her magic is a huge part of the story. The climax of the first book is entirely about Harriet using her experimental occlumency practice to save a lot of students' lives, and not only does Harriet continue to work on her occlumency throughout the story (constructing traps and experimenting with false memories and mental constructs), she also assists others in building their occlumency, so we get to see others' minds and how they construct mental barriers similarly and differently.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
