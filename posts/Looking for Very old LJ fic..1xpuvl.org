Sorry, I've posted this here before but am hoping some new eyes might be able to help me out!

What I remember about this fic: James is pretty angsty in this one. He has a little sister who died. If I recall correctly, she was twirling in front of the fireplace in her mother's robe. Caught fire and James was unable to save her. (There may have been a spell put on him by someone so he couldn't perform magic over break?) I would've read this fic sometime between 2000-2009, but most likely around 2006.

The fic is generally about Lily getting James to open up. (Simliar to When Dawn Breaks the Night.)

I'm sorry, that's really all I remember about the fic. My computer from high school died, so I no longer have the word document with all of my favorites saved...any help would be wonderful!
