Even if it's not the main plot of the story, I just wanted to see if anyone's done a good WWW scene with this idea.


** Not quite what you were looking for, but ...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9489238/1/Passports-Required][Passports Required]]. One-shot, Completed.

Another that has George dealing with Fred's death is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5314422/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Amulet-of-the-Moon][Harry Potter and the Amulet of the Moon]]. Its the second of a two story series. I found both stories to be good, but a bit slow at times. Actually, come to think about it, I think Fred's ghost does make an appearance in the first book. I don't think he does in the second.

*** Passports Required is a good laugh. I'll tackle the longer series next week. Thanks!
