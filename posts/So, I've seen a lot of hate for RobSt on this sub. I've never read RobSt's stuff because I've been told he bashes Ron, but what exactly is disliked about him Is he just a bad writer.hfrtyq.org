** His fics can be summed up by saying "twelve year old, 6'4 ripped as fuck Harry "Chad Thundercock" Potter makes everyone's panties drop"

In all seriousness though, RobSt is the epitome of all cliches. All of his fics are mostly wish fulfilment with very little plot, dumb as fuck enemies who basically knock themselves out (Umbridge's idea of revenge was trying to kick a muggle. She slipped and fell. I'm not kidding.), tons of subplots that have basically no purpose (such as Harry getting into arguments with everyone he isn't shagging over petty stuff), and extreme length bloat.

Cliche bashing, two-dimensional characters that are either perfect or completely awful and coincidentally dumb.

Which is a darn shame because the quality of the writing itself (unsure of what the english term for this is) is good. His sentences are wonderful, the language feels alive, flawless grammar and good descriptions. It's just that his plots are ridiculously bland.

  Vernon was in a foul mood. He'd walked up and down Charring Cross Road at least a dozen times and all he had to show for it was sore feet. That wasn't exactly true, his left arm was numb from the weight of the child he had resting there. Vernon had seen plenty of what he would consider 'freakish' people walking up and down too, but they all seemed to disappear the instant he took his eyes of them. He had resorted to staring but something always seemed to catch his attention just before they disappeared.

  The child was starting to girn again but Vernon had the Dursley patented answer for that, his mother swore by it and it had worked on his own son. One of Dudley's old dummy tits dipped into a tiny pot of honey soon quietened the child, the boy liked it so much his little hand closed over Vernon's meaty finger.

#+begin_quote
  He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying
#+end_quote

Which is better? Perhaps this is unfair, after all, this is from a professional published work.

What about this?

#+begin_quote
  Victoria woke to the sound of Uncle Vernon shouting for her, and he didn't sound happy. Rubbing sleep from her eyes, she sat up with a jolt when she remembered what day it was. Heavy footsteps made their way up the stairs and her door swung open.

  "Downstairs," Vernon growled, his face an interesting shade of purple. "Now."

  Victoria leapt out of bed and threw on a dressing gown---she wasn't about to meet her first magician in pyjamas! She then followed Vernon downstairs and into the sitting room, where a middle-aged woman was sitting primly in one of the armchairs.

“He didn't sound happy” is just as tell-y as “Vernon was in a foul mood.” The fact that Vernon is angry can easily be inferred from the shouting and heavy footsteps.

***** On the other hand, you have "his face an interesting shade of purple".

I'm going to be honest, I provided an example from Victoria Potter simply because I had it open at the time.

My point about Robst's writing still stands. Hell, I even picked one of his better passages. Try this:

Harry made sure his mouth was empty of toast before replying, "That bad huh?"

"The Hufflepuffs think you stole their thunder, Cho is Cedric's girlfriend and turned Ravenclaw against you while the Slytherins would rather see anyone win but Harry\\
Potter. All of Gryffindor is fully behind you though, well nearly all."

"Yeah but every one of them thinks I cheated my way into the competition, especially Ron"

"Harry, one look at your face last night and I knew you didn't put your name in that goblet, and anyway you know you can't keep secrets from me Potter. I've already started work on a training schedule, researching what spells could be useful..."

Harry banished what was left of his juice, leaving his hands free so he could throw his arms around Hermione, this had the effect of silencing the young witch. Harry leaned in slowly for a kiss, giving Hermione plenty of time to object but found her leaning in as well while her arms reached up to his shoulders to ensure he wasn't going anywhere.

With Harry Crow I could at least somewhat get into the plot and thus paid rather close attention to everything (although I still couldn't force myself to keep reading before even hitting the halfway point). HPMOR felt like it literally didn't have a plot, just Harry being an asshole to everyone because 'muh smarts', so I ended up skimming over /a lot/ of it.

** He is one of the most frustrating authors around. First of all, all those clichés? Yes, but unfortunately he invented most of them, so they were not that much clichés, when he wrote them. Now it is mostly unreadable. Also, he is not bad writer, he has actually some great ideas, but they are always grounded down into horrible indy!Harry, evil!Dumbledore mache.

See for example linkffn(6439871). The idea is ... at least interesting. It could be nice supersweet teeth rotting Harmony story and after some three and half chapters (when Tom didn't read fine print) it should stop. Except it is twenty chapters numbingly stupid Ron/Dumbledore/etc-bashing orgy with absolutely no plot and no story.

** I personally don't mind the cliches, the overused tropes, whatever. I quite enjoy most of them, actually. But But Robst's writing just kinda rubs me the wrong way.

The pacing of his stories are way too slow, for one thing. He stretches what could be written - and written well - in two sentences into multiple paragraphs sometimes.

But the part that I don't like the most, and this might just be me being fucking delusional, is that his writing has this subtle undertone of smug superiority, I think? Like, I have no idea how to explain it, and I might just be projecting, but it annoyes me a lot.

**** I can understand feeling that about HPMoR (haven't read far enough in a robst work to really say, but I can see what you're talking about). Something to bear in mind, though, is that the author doesn't always agree with the protagonist. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres does give off that vibe of smug superiority at times, definitely, but if you step back and look at the story as a whole, you find that it keeps coming back to bite him. He pranks Neville on the platform, and it drives a wedge between them (not an insurmountable one, but an unnecessary one). He defies Professor Snape, and has a very painful lesson about picking your battles. He thinks he's going to overturn all those traditional hidebound assumptions about how spellcasting works, plans out a whole string of experiments, and then discovers at the first step that he was wrong and those previous experts may have been on to something. He dismisses Ron as being too unintelligent to matter, and then Ron is key to his humiliating defeat. And, of course, he considers Professor Quirrell to be one of the few people smart enough to be worth talking to, the smartest he knows, and then eventually finds out he's Voldemort.

** IMO, it's generally pretty well-written fics, and usually a really interesting starting point. The problems are that it's generally a very cliched indie!Harry and the plots can drag on longer than feels neccesary (i.e. Harry Crow). It's also super quickly developing Harmony romance, to the extent that some find it jarring. There is almost ubiquitous Ron and Dumbledore bashing common to indie!Harry fics.

That said, they're a good writer, and has good ideas. Harry Crow is the 4th most-liked complete fic on FFN. This sub tends towards the contrarian in a lot of ways, and you should definitely still give Robst a try before deciding he is or isn't for you, just like HPMOR.

*** Seconding this, Robstfic is where good ideas go to die.

Consider /You are My Density/. Harry is convicted by the Wizengamot and obliviated of his magic. He is then returned to the Dursleys, who are brainwashed into treating him like a loving family. Five years later, he is living as a Muggle. Meanwhile, slowly but surely, Voldemort conquers the wizarding Britain. As as his regime consolidates its power, Hermione, one of the last surviving members of the resistance, collects Harry and undertakes a desperate gamble to send them both back in time, in the hope that perhaps this time through, things will be better.

As far as time-travel premises go, it's a pretty original one, and it promises to pair a trigger-happy veteran Hermione with a Muggle-educated Harry, both in 11-year-old bodies, and trying to figure out what went wrong the last time and how to fix it. Unfortunately, the premise had the misfortune to have been written by Robst. Therefore...

- Harry is HINO. Rather than try to extrapolate a Muggle personality and hobbies for him, the author (as is his habit) makes him a generic gentleman and a bookworm.

- Hermione has no real personality; nor does she appear to have any thoughts but about Harry. She's all about Harry and love and Harry and running away and Harry. She spent her whole OotP year being rescued by Dobby from Draco's rape attempts, then went to Beauxbatons and had been hiding in France ever since.

- They are instantly lovey-dovey.

  - They have sex (before going back in time), and they are, naturally, both virgins. Of course, as virgins, they end up fumbling a lot, right? Of course not! Their perfect love is just so perfectly perfect.

- The author appears to go out of his way to avoid and avert conflict and eliminate any tension.

  - Harry is being hunted by Voldemort once again and does not know it (or anything about magic). Hermione, now a magicyborg like Moody and no less paranoid, picks him up to take him back in time, tracking him down at the same time as a party of Snatchers, and a running magical battle ensues, with our protagonists managing to lose the Snatchers for just long enough to perform the time-travel ritual?

    Of course not! She gets at him by sitting at a bar for half an hour before his buddies convince him to hit on her, then takes him back to a hotel where she gives him the rundown. There is no tension, no urgency, no paranoia, no "Come with me if you want to live." [1]

  - Once they go back in time, Snape uses Legilimency on Harry, discovering their time-travel, right?

    Of course not! Conveniently, that's precisely when Harry touches his wand (again) for the first time, and a burst of accidental magic knocks Snape back. (Because, as Hermione constantly reminds us, Harry is Very Powerful.)

  - Apparently, the scarcrux is gone.

- By the way, Harry isn't just a gentleman and a bookworm. He's also a badass bookworm: he can box, and we are treated to a lovingly described scene of a 19-year-old Harry (albeit in an 11-year-old body) beating up 11-year-old Draco for using the word "mudblood" (I think).

[1] Seriously, he wrote a setup like that, and didn't use the "Come with me if you want to live" line. What's wrong with this guy?!

** Devil's Advocate Time!

The biggest thing I tended to enjoy in his fics was that most or all of them had elements (admittedly often minor or peripheral elements) that I'd never seen before and in many cases haven't seen since despite them making good sense.

Aside from that, I enjoyed the fact that (outside of his sillier stuff) rarely does anybody pick up the Idiot Ball or act OOC to serve the plot - they act according to (his depiction of) their character. When villains/antagonists do something stupid, particularly in Harry Crow, it's generally due to hubris/arrogance and/or blind anger. The example somebody else brought up was described as:

#+begin_quote
  "Umbridge's idea of revenge was trying to kick a muggle. She slipped and fell. I'm not kidding."
#+end_quote

In the story, it was at a Ministry ball. She saw a Muggle that embodied much of what she envied (pretty, influential) and jealousy added to bigotry and her general anger at the direction the country was taking (more rights and equality for non-Purebloods) and her general attitude of "I'm untouchable". She'd intended to just subtly trip the woman, but let herself get carried away in her anger and kicked hard at her ankles, only for the woman's dance partner (Harry) to spot the kick and lift her over it, so with her target suddenly vanishing Umbridge's overswing caused her to fall over. There's a clear path from cause to effect, drawn in line with the character's personality.

I'll also say that a couple of times in Harry Crow, it pulled me in enough to legitimately get my heart pounding from the tension, and that's not something I've experienced often from written works.

** IMO Harry Crow was a brilliant original idea with a decent plot through the first maybe 100k words. After that it just dragged on. His writing is good although nowhere near professional standard but then no one expects that. You're my density was ok too but again a bit of a cliche. Yeah there are a lot of cliches but if you are new to hp fanfic they are decent starting fics to get to grips with like 70% of fics. I didnt mind his fics 3 years ago but now I prefer quality of quantity.
