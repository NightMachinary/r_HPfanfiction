** My full "best HP fics" document is [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NkGVr2UUmX3AkexY8P9GZkQFMVfLsxVHckcwW2FzDSA/edit?usp=sharing][here]], and my "best HP smut document" is [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-w-bt80EWqTHL8VdrANYU1QStEVBh87ahPiIqLHC41c/edit?usp=sharing][here]]. To pick out the absolute best:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging_the_Sword][*Forging the Sword*]]

::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.

/Truly great fic, all about the characterisation of Harry, Ron and Hermione. Believable growth, fantastic exploration of magic. Only problem is its slow updates!/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][*On the Way to Greatness*]]

As per the Hat's decision, Harry gets Sorted into Slytherin upon his arrival in Hogwarts---and suddenly, the future isn't what it used to be.

/Best Slytherin Harry AU in the fandom, hands down./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer][*Ectomancer*]]

Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time? Post-OotP.

/My favourite fic in the fandom. Great adventure elements, with a badass Harry who is nonetheless in-canon, as the fic really plays to his strengths of thinking under pressure, improvisation and practical learning./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][*Strangers at Drakeshaugh*]]

The locals in a sleepy corner of the Cheviot Hills are surprised to discover that they have new neighbours. Who are the strangers at Drakeshaugh?

/Wonderful post-Hogwarts fic in which we get to see a very middle-class Harry and Ginny from an outsider's perspective. The is obviously very well acquainted with the life of the young parent and it really shows./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][*What You Leave Behind*]]

The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

/The best new fanfic of the last couple of years, this fic follows a talented Harry in an AU world, taking him through his 7 years at Hogwarts at a good pace. The first year is a good old fashioned mystery, so to say more would be to spoil it. Highly recommended. Great characterisation, dialogue, magical theory, setting and mystery./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][*A Long Journey Home*]]

In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

/A fem!Harry story with great characterisation, humour, and a superb exploration of wizarding history via time travel./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Boy_Who_Lived][*Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived*]]

Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

/Possibly the most popular fic in the fandom, this shows an AU genius Harry at Durmstrang. It manages to avoid all the pitfalls of the “Other BWL” genre, avoiding bashing. But the real draw of this fic is the depiction of the development of a magical heavyweight, and the Durmstrang worldbuilding. N.B. Chapters 12-16 of this story can only be found on DarkLordPotter.Net./

Top Smut:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5445767/1/Whatever-Happened-to-Bromance][*Whatever Happened to Bromance?*]]

Cormac McLaggen explains a few simple truths to Harry, with profound consequences. Harry/Romilda. Smut.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5446275/1/It-Could-Only-Happen-to-Harry][*It Could Only Happen to Harry*]]

After defeating Voldemort in his final year, Harry requires a rare ritual to save his life. Luckily, he has friends who are willing to help him. H/Hr, H/Parv, H/Luna, H/Tonks, H/Fleur. Canon personalities. WARNING: comic smut. Not for younger audiences.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10100723/1/Parkinson-s-Knickers-Or-Lack-Thereof][*Parkinson's Knickers (Or Lack Thereof)*]]

Harry always knew the monthly budget meetings were boring, but he didn't realize just how boring until Pansy Parkinson offered to show him something a little more interesting.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4884595/1/Tease][*Tease*]]

After Quidditch practice, Harry receives some unexpected attention. 5th Year AU! PWP SMUT/MYSTERY. NON-CONSENT! FEMME---DOM!

*** Ectomancer is also my favourite. I only read it recently and have to say that it's a sterling example of top notch action and fight scene writing. My theory is that the author had these great ideas for battle scenarios like the troll fight and the fake dumble fight at the start but didn't have the entire plot thought out and so he/she abandoned it.

If you're interested, I'm working on a fic in a similar action vein that takes place during Albus Potter's 7th year.

**** The story has a great premise and good fight scenes, but (kinda Spoilers) Harry's refusal to talk to anyone about what is happening to him drives me nuts. I hate fics where Harry loses out on so much opportunity because he refuses to tell people about the crazy shit that's happening to him.

** Hoo, boy.

I'm aiming for this list to be complementary rather than to supplant, so I've scraped my less-mentioned folder for really good reads. Only two of these have been mentioned so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]]

#+begin_quote
  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/][Reign of the Serpent]]

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]

#+begin_quote
  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused. Funny and utterly non-serious, but ultimately sort of sweet too.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8337871/1/The-Wizard-from-Earth][The Wizard From Earth]]

#+begin_quote
  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future. This is great. Mystery, worldbuilding, and enough of an AU that it doesn't feel anything like canon. /Warning! */Abandoned***
#+end_quote

[[http://copperbadge.fanficauthors.net/The_Uncle/The_Uncle/][The Uncle]] Wherein Remus Lupin is a crime lord. Short and kind of dubious quality-wise (not exactly high-class literature, and I'm not sure it actually merits being on this list), but amusing enough to overlook it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]]

#+begin_quote
  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time. Extreme Time Travel AU. But the writing and the imaginative departures from HP canon are phenomenal. The author went on write professionally, and it shows. Atlantis, mysterious dark magic, Fleur Delacour, and stereotypical mysterious persecution combine to produce a wild time-travel romp that definitely won't make sense until you're halfway through. Highly recommended. Complete, has a sequel.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6663972/1/][Secret Steps]]

#+begin_quote
  Extreme AU. In a world where contact between muggles and wizards is strictly forbidden, where love blinds, and power is corrupt... an orphaned Hermione Granger struggles to make things right with the help of some unlikely allies.

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late? In which Harry comes back late to his body at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts. Has a depth of politics and layered build-up of the government and the wizarding world around it that I haven't seen anywhere else. H/Hr One of the first fics I read, and still one of my favorites. Has Evil!Ginny, which you might not like.

  Harry James Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, the Defeater of Voldemort, Chief Auror, Master of Death, finds that he is five years old. It should not surprise anyone that things in Magical Britain immediately become rather strange. Harry goes to bed and wakes up in the past ... age five. Lots and lots of humor. More fleshing out and better use of future knowledge than almost any 'serious' fics of this genre. Good writing.

This is, honestly, the best piece of fan work I have ever read. /No/ complaints, and I complain about everything.

Though the fic was pretty similar in tone to the episode, so if you didnt enjoy the fic then your milage on "blink" may vary

linkffn(5490079) The Little Veela That Could. Definite favorite and a unique take on Veela.

linkffn(8233291) Princess of the Blacks. Fem!Harry, but damn if it isn't the best one I've ever read. Silently Watches is always a treat to read. Also has legitimate White and Black magic, which I NEVER see.

linkffn(8848598) Allure Immune Harry. Most adorable Harry/Fleur pairing I've read. Also linkffn(9469775) Escapologist Harry by the same author. Pure crack.

linkffn(8197451) Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them. Harry's an elf, and you're not talking him out of it.

linkffn(7145549) Duality. Harry starts smoking cigarettes. That's all that matters. Really.

linkffn(2889350) Bungle in the Jungle. An exciting story uniquely told in the second person. Can be difficult to get into, but worth it if you do.

linkffn(6781360) The First Step is Fatal. Harry goes to Hogwarts! Too bad he died long before he got there. Ghost!Harry.

linkffn(9036071) With Strength of Steel Wings. Harry gets a tattoo, with (if you're magical) predictable results.

linkffn(3389525) Stronger Than Hope. A Legilimency fic done right.

linkffn(9911469) Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus. If you're looking to be confused, look no further. A true surrealist fic.

That's all for now, I think. I've got plenty more, if anyone wants to know. Not even counting crossovers, either.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

Still i have to agree the first few chapters are a bit sad, but its a good story and the OCs are nicely written.

**** Junior Inquisitor should come with massive warnings for bashing, cliches and manipulative and evil/incompetent Dumbledore/Order. Like, it mentions it, but nowhere near enough - that is the story, basically. Harry loses his horcrux after a healer takes it out, Harry's being drugged endlessly, and so on.

I think it's the worst story I've ever read, though I've had the privilege of coming late enough into the fandom that I can skip most of the duds.

** Try linkffn(11487602) and linkffn(2980054) Both are wonderful fics, and the first one is rather new. Novel length and complete aswell, so no waiting for updates or risk of abandonment. Resurrexit was mentioned here a bit back, however, due to its recent release and the fact all of it was released at once, it does not have too many reviews and things, a shame, really. Resistance has some grammar mistakes at times, but its easily forgivable.

Thorn Circle is the first in an ongoing series - all are novel-length, and the 5th is set to come out sometime this year or next year (if Inverarity gets a move on). They're /truly/ in a class of their own, quality-wise.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]] is absolutely hilarious - a fantastically funny and clever fic. Basically a Peggy Sue fic, and the love interest is Tonks, but it's not a shipping fic by any means.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7118223/1/Elsewhere-but-not-Elsewhen][Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen]], by the same author as Jamie Evans, is a dimensional-travel fic that has a rather dark side, but has many moments of clever gallows humour. Unfortunately, the fic seems to be either dormant or dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]] had me on the edge of my seat the entire damn time; /this fic alone/ made Bellatrix/Hermione one of my favourite pairings. Lots of wonderful scenes and lots of angst. There's a few short sequels by the author that follow up the events of the main story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] is the single best Slytherin!Ginny fic out there, and perhaps even the best Ginny's-perspective fic ever written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11118152/1/The-Scientist][The Scientist]] is an ongoing Hermione/Narcissa slow-burn fic. It's been really good so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]] is a great, if very angsty, Harmony fic without any of the usual accompanying Harmonian bullshit (i.e. Weasley-bashing, Dumbledore-bashing, et cetera). Dimensional travel plays a large part, as does Luna.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2006636/1/Catechism][Catechism]] is perhaps one of the most terrifying fics I've ever read, and it explores an unusual concept in astounding depth.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5906518/1/Ron-El-Greco][Ron El Greco]] explores the "mature" side of Ron/Hermione, and involves Ron being a diplomatic Auror in a rogue Middle Eastern city-state. Very adventurous, but ultimately down-to-earth.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3894793/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Distaff-Side][Harry Potter and the Distaff Side]] is also a really detailed delving into a concept that, unlike with Catechism, has been done a few times before, but NEVER to the degree that Distaff does it. Sadly, it's either dormant or dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10402749/1/War-Paint][War Paint]] is the only HG/TR fic I'll ever read, and for good reason.

** "Faith and Understanding" is a very well-written "Missing Moments" fic of much of the series. Ginny Weasely meets Luna Lovegood and slowly the two girls become very close friends. This is one of my all-time favorite fanfictions across any fandom. Luna is written beautifully, insightful and kind and blunt and eccentric. Ginny's got a spark to her that you don't often see. This story is heartfelt and funny and real. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3821794/1/Faith-and-UnderstandingThis]]

"Dinner with the Weasleys" is just what it says on the tin. A summer evening at the Burrow set shortly after the War, told from Luna's perspective. This fic is like a nice Sunday dinner that you'd have, going to your grandparents' house after church.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7227719/1/Dinner-With-the-Weasleys]]

And I love the stories that tell of Neville, Luna and Ginny becoming the Silver Trio. Three very different people who need each other. What more can I say?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8543006/1/The-Silver-Trio-Beginnings]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9092764/1/The-Silver-Trio-Lightning-Struck]]

Oh, and this one is just straight up hilarious. Severus Snape becomes a ghost and is forced by the Universe to haunt Harry. Neither one of them is the least bit happy about it. And Ginny is a terrible baby-name giver. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The_Wendell_That_Wasnt]]

*** Some general advice:

First, this is a recommendation thread. If you want to promote your own work, make another thread with [promotion] or [feedback] at the beginning of the title.

Second, don't spam. Don't repost the same content several times in a row. Once should be enough.

In case there might be a misunderstanding, I'm not trying to mini-mod or anything. Rather, I'm trying to help you out :P

Now, as for the actual feedback: I'll be honest with you, since I found that brute honesty is the best sort of feedback that'll help your writing. I tried reading your story, but I couldn't get past chapter one. There were various mistakes in your technical writing (grammar, sentence structure, character voice, etc) and the plot wasn't interesting. What I would recommend is that you go through your story again and edit it. Also, it would probably help you if you get a beta to give you more feedback in grammar, plot, etc.

I'm not trying to make you feel bad or discourage you from writing. When I started my first story, I probably was worse when it came to plot, technical writing, character voice, etc. What I would advise you is to keep on practicing, and you'll get better as time goes on. Also, have someone help you and give you advice on writing.

**** Only just read that post today. I think the plot interesting. Their are now 20 chapters to the story, if you want to it try again. I know that I'm not the best at spelling or grammar but I plan to fix all that when the story is finished or at least halfway through. I don't want to be writing the last few chapters and having to think about the first ones.

The first chapter is meant to set the plot, the main character and cause curiosity for the rest of the story. Which is solved in the last chapter. I mean what were your first impression when you read the first chapter of Harry Potter for the first time. I personally dislike the books (I've only read the first two and attempted the other 5) but I love the films. Please read again. Please Reply MD XX

**** Here are all the reviews I have got on my story (on a different website to Inkitt.com)

Chapter: 1 Omg this is so cool! I love this.

Chapter: 2 i understood this alot more. i like how your adapting it :D

It's pretty complicated but that does give you a degree of freedom on choosing where it's to go next. have to say spelling errors are a distraction. Nearly stopped reading it because of the cruelty seen in Narcissa and Lucius, written well enough that I wanted to erase the whole thing from my emotional reaction. Hoping Magie rebels, with Draco's help perhaps, and make her own way in the world.

Chapter: 4

Erm...hurry up and write that next chapter...im so into this right now! Few spelling mistakes but their not major :)

Chapter: 5 Proper loving it. Its coming on great :) I only spotted one spelling mistake which was, mouth, instead of month. I do it alot so it doesn't really matter

Hiya! I love this story! It's a bit dark, but that's OK

Chapter: 6 Omg this is really good :D i know im only reviewing on this chapter but ill read the rest later. I never thought charlie, bill and percy would be that critical and cruel towards their own family. I like how've youve adapted them so far, but i still find it strange to see them criticising although i understand as it is the Malfoy's and Draco's old self. However, i really am enjoying this fic. Couple of spelling and grammer mistakes in random places but can be sorted. Like my fics. Keep going im looking foward to the rest of it :) -A xx

Chapter: 7 I liked the story line. Some spelling mistakes though. I'm eagerly awaiting for the next chapters.

Chapter: 18

Really enjoying it

I'm glad you updated and I hope the end isn't soon

Chapter: 20 So happy you updated! can't wait for more!

I am your bestest fan ever ! I enjoy this story and when I get my computer back I will log on and post using my actual user which is (I'm not telling you her/his name). I love your YouTube ! It's cool that you actually have a YouTube account called Slytherin Forever ! :)

So my story can't be as bad as you say it is if I'm getting reviews like that can it? Can't say anything nice don't saying anything at all I'll only take consecutive criticism and you're basically saying my story is a load of shit. Well **** (I actually typed the stars so I technically haven't broken any rules) you.

#+end_quote

You'll come to realize, sooner or later, that reviews don't really matter that much, especially those that do not offer constructive criticism. There are tons of stories on FFN that have 1000+ reviews (most of them highly praising the work), but are objectively bad. Reviews are never indicators of whether a story is good or bad, and seeing your attitude makes me lose all interest, however little, I had on re-reading your story.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Did you actually read my post? I haven't called your story anything of that sort. Actually, I've offered ways you could really improve your writing. You say you want "constructive criticism", but when you are given concrit, you say "fuck you". You notice a problem here?

In case you can't figure it out on your own, I'll spell it out for you. You're arrogant, and quite frankly, you have no right to be, seeing your writing skills. I myself have recently written a oneshot that wasn't very good, and when people gave me criticism, I accepted them because I knew that I needed to step out of my comfort zone in order to become a better writer. If you truly want to improve, swallow up your pride and accept that your story needs real improvement.

But then again, seeing how you've responded until now, I'm probably wasting my time with you, and you'll probably begin cussing at me for trying to actually help you out.

#+begin_quote
  AU, first in the main Dangerverse series, now complete. Lone wolf. Dream-seer. Bright child. Scarred child. Singer. Prisoner. Dancer child. Dragon child. Eight semi-ordinary people. One extraordinary family, and how they became one. Pre-Hogwarts story. Pre-Hogwarts, the sequels cover all of Harry's Hogwarts years. A lot of foreshadowing, nothing is what it seems. If you're going to read everything it will be a looooong read, but definitely worth it! Living with Danger itself, excluding all the sequels, one-shots and AU's (yes, AU's within an AU!), has a higher word count than any of the Harry Potter books with the exception of OotP. The main stories are all completed.

***** Quantity of reviews in no way reflects the quality of a story. Look at Twilight as a prime example of this in the real world, and it's not surprising to see that sort of doctrine trickle down into FF as well. I'd almost go so far as to say the exact opposite is true - the more popular a fic is, the more likely it is actually going to be quite bad (MoR, Poison Pen, Partially Kiss Hero...)
