I am looking for fics which focus on harry improving his skills over time. Something like mother of learning would be awesome. BUT without any kind of ridiculous bashing. Thanks in advance.


** My recommendation is /The Many Deaths of Harry Potter/. Its conceit bears great similarities to /Mother of Learning/ (a personal favorite of mine), following Harry in a time-loop scenario reminiscent of Re:Zero with all the psychological trauma such a thing would entail on a young child.

The Voldemort/Death Eater faction here is played with extreme intelligence, forcing Harry to grow up fast in order to survive. As such, it starts with quite a bleak tone, but as Harry grows in power, so too does the hopefulness of the piece. Best of all, it introduces no ridiculous original concepts or bashing.

*** I absolutely loved this story right uptil Voldemort also gained the rewind power. I know why the author did it and it's a good reason, but it just let all the air out of it for me for some reason.

*** I have read it. Thanks for the recommendation though, by the way it doesn't have to be a time loop based skill progression. If you have any more recommendations.

** Perhaps linkffn(So How Can I Weaponize This by longherin)? Someone sits down with magic and builds an arsenal of spells based on getting the most bang for their buck with each cast.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy
