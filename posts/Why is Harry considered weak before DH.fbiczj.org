I can see why the Harry in DH would be considered weak. What I do not get is why HBP and younger Harry is considered weak. I will talk about the last battle in HBP the Battle of Astronomy tower and compare Harry against the Order, DA and DE's.

The DE had six death eaters aside from Snape and Draco namely Yaxley, the Carrow twins, Gibbons, Rowle and Fenir Greyback. The Order and the DA had the Bill, Remus, Tonks, McGonagall, Hagrid and the Ministry Six. Flitwick(a former dueling champion in canon) and an unnamed auror were also present.

Before we get started it should be noted that both the Order and the DA were told to be alert and the Order was not afraid of using lethal force canonically while the DA had the benefit of Marauder's Map and more importantly Felix Felicis the OP potion of luck. Harry is shown to be reluctant to use lethal force in canon again and again.

When it was discovered that death eaters were in the school Flitwick went to Snape to get help and got stunned immediately(You can say he was surprised and yes he was but note this anyway). The unnamed auror did not even know the castle was under attack and was blown away while his back was turned during the escape.

Let us get started when Harry finally enters the fight.

As soon as he escaped the Paralysis Harry promptly paralyzed Yaxley. He was then ambushed by Fenir Greyback (who had mauled Bill and). Harry quickly dealt with him with a full body bind curse(comparison with Flitwick).

Then he came across Ginny(under the influence of Felix Felicis) who was dueling one of the Carrow twins and not doing too hot, barely keeping herself from being Crucioed. Harry slammed Carrow into a wall forcing him to fall back.

Now he comes upon the duel between Remus, Tonks, McGonagall and Ron(under Felix Felicis) and the remaining 3 (4 if you count the one Harry just faced) Death Eaters. You would not be wrong if you thought of it as 5v3 as Neville(under Felix Felicis) was already incapacitated and on the ground by the time Harry came. It should also be noted that Hermione and Luna did not fight when under the effects of Felix Felicis and given its powers this might be because they would have died if they fought.

Rowle accidentally killed Gibbons with an AK at some point and was entirely focused on Tonks till Harry forced him to retreat. McGonagall also forced the Carrow twins to retreat.

Harry reached the grounds and saw Hagrid trying to stop Rowle from fleeing. He was then hit in the back(compare with auror) with a spell from the twins who he knocked over with an Imperdiment Jinx. They later managed to escape Hogwarts in the end somehow.

Rowle also managed to flee after setting Hagrid's hut on fire.

Harry then engaged Snape and was defeated.

Yep neither the Order who knew about the possible attack and were prepared and capable of using lethal force nor the DA running on Felix Felicis and having Marauders map could take out a single death eater. Harry however after having a draining experience in the cave, having just suffered the loss of his mentor and being half mad with fury took out 2 presumably 4 death eaters in his mad dash to get to Snape and Draco. 3 of them had initiated the fight with him and despite having surprise on their side were taken out quickly by Harry.

So why is pre DH version of Harry considered weak?

(About the fight with Snape. By the point Harry reached Snape he was under a lot of fatigue. He had to deal with the cave which was a really high stress situation and taxing. Then there was the death of his mentor and the multiple fights he got into and the spells he took on the way there. Add in that he was doing this in a dead sprint to catch up to Snape who had not gotten into single fight and was left to flee unimpeded. That fight was already stacked against him. Not saying that he could have taken Snape if he was fresh but that the fight was far from fair and Harry was far from weak.)


** It's that people say he's weak compared to Dumbledore and Voldemort, which I can't argue against. He also has a lot of potential that is squandered by his mentality of laziness and non-inquisitiveness. So saying he's weak compared to what he could or should be is justified in my opinion. And comparing him to the weak Death Eaters he fought or caught by surprise is not a big deal when you consider that they are like ants and Voldemort and Dumbledore are like lions.

*** When I said weak I was talking about him as a fighter.

Of course he is weak when compared to the likes of Dumbledore, every other character is. But I mostly see him being compared to the lesser characters.

Till HBP I don't think he could have done better. Maybe if instead of teaching DA he focused on himself he would have been stronger but other that I don't think he could have done anything different.

In HBP I agree with you that he would have been stronger by the end if he applied himself like he did in the previous years. I think he just gave up after Sirius' death.

The death eaters he defeated were not weak in anyway. They managed to hold off Remus Lupin (a Marauder), Bill Weasley (he got 12 OWLs, Hermione got 10) Tonks (the only Auror recruit in years) and finally McGonagall (an Animagi herself) plus the members of Ministry Six who were under the infuence of Felix Felicis and yet none of them were able to take out a single Death Eater. And it was the death eaters getting the drop on him not the other way around. It is also worth noting that Harry was chastised by Order members for using non lethal spells and took them out non lethally.

If we say that the DE were ants than the defenders listed above would be even weaker than ants as they had every advantage over DE and they still could not beat them. And Harry would be Ant-Eater.

Don't necessarily agree with this. A lot of times one of the best ways to learn is to teach. All that time spent teaching/preparing for DA meetings is time he wouldn't have necessarily otherwise used to improve himself.

***** I can see where you are coming from. And yeah if he did not have to do it for the DA he might not have spent so much time on improving himself. It was a really stressful year after all and I am surprised he did not burn out.

He would definitely have had more time available to himself so he could have used it to prepare, as the prior years suggest. It would likely have been just him, Hermione and Ron so they would have been able to progress much faster.

What do you think actually happened to make Harry a lot less proactive in HBP? I think he just gave up after Sirius' death. Or he could have been burnt out. What do you think?

** In HBP he's shown to struggle with non-verbal magic and is no longer as proactive as he was in OOTP where he forms the DA or GOF where he researches spells to use in the tournament.

I wouldn't classify Harry as weak, given the Patronus achievement at 13, the fight in HBP you mentioned and the fight in Tottenham Court Road where the trio manages to out duel Dolohov and Rowle, but other character's feats do outshine him imo. The Marauders became Animagi at Hogwarts and created the Marauders Map while Snape created his own spells and altered textbook instructions to brew better potions.

*** When I said weak I was talking about him as a fighter.

Yeah he is not as talented as the Marauders or Snape or Dumbledore or any other person. They could be considered much better wizards as they are capable of more advanced magic.

He is not the most talented in his own generation as when he taught the DA the Patronus they learned it in less time than Harry did. Being less talented does not make you weak.

Fleur was the best that Beauxbaton had to offer. She knew more spells and more advanced spell than Harry did. But when in the second task the two of them encountered Grindylows Fleur was defeated whereas Harry managed to send the hostages he had with him to the surface, fight them off and get out of the lake. The Gillyweed had run out around the point he sent the hostages up.

He was still taking out people several times his age even when they get the drop on him when the rest of the defenders were not able to take out a single one of them. The defenders included as I already said Remus Lupin (a Marauder), Bill Weasley (he got 12 OWLs, Hermione got 10) Tonks (the only Auror recruit in years) and finally McGonagall (an Animagi herself). The members of Ministry Six were also present and were under the infuence of Felix Felicis and yet none of them were able to take out a single Death Eater.

All the characters that were more talented than him were not taking out enemies many times their age when they were 15 or 16.

**** As a combatant I don't know where to rank him tbh. Yes he takes out Death Eaters in HBP as you said and Dolohov in DH, but he didn't beat them straight up. The other Death Eaters were preoccupied with Aurors/Order members and Harry had the element of surprise. Which is not a knock on him, anything goes in a fight after all but we don't really see Harry overpower anyone in a straight duel aside from Draco.

Contrast Harry to Bellatrix who beats Tonks, Sirius and Kingsley in straight one on one duels with no interference. Kingsley duelled two Death Eaters simultaneously in the battle of the DOM and likely took them out. Dolohov beat Moody in a straight duel as well. Against Kingsley, Bellatrix, Dolohov in a one on one duel without the element of surprise I think Harry lasts about as long as a premature ejaculation. But thats not to say Harry is a weak fighter because he's going up against more experienced opponents, but its hard to classify if Harry as strong or weak because we can't really compare him with other duellists his age.

****** For me its still hard to rank Harry's combat abilities because of the element of surprise aspect. All the Death Eaters were engaged in HBP after Dumbledore died, and the element of surprise counts for a lot in HP. Ron was able to disarm Bellatrix in Malfoy Manor and Snape was taken out by the trio in PoA.

Unless were talking Cursed Child, in which case Harry is weak. A trained Auror stalemates with Draco and needed backup against a 14 year old.

I'd rate him to be above average then, since he did manage to take down the Carrows and Greyback. With his Patronus at 13 showing Harry does have the potential to be powerful as an adult(unfortunately since Cursed Child is canon we don't get to see Harry flex his talent)

********* Yeah that is why I asked about before DH. DH Harry was disappointing in the books and let us not even mention cursed child.

I would rate pre DH Harry a top tier fighter.

As you have said surprise matters a lot in Harry Potter. This is shown by the trio taking down Snape in PoA, Moody being taken down in GOF(or he might be so far from his prime that he is a pale shadow of his legend) Flitwick being taken down in Battle of Astronomy Tower or the unnamed auror. You might be interested to find that Yaxley became the Head of DMLE so he must be quite good and even he went down when taken by surprise.

Harry's ability to either react fast enough when ambushed, or to keep going even after taking spells in the back is one of the reasons I rank him high.

It also does not hurt that he accomplished more than some of the top fighters of Order(who were okay with lethal force) and DA (who were buffed by Felix Felicis) combined could without using lethal force.

********** DH Harry took on Dolohov and Rowle with Ron and Hermione after they left the wedding. Harry was the one that noticed them, so at least he's got good situational awareness. He also noticed that Luna wasn't at Xenophilus' place and deduces that its a trap.

Unfortunately he forgets that Ron told him that Voldemort placed a taboo on his name, leading them to be captured.

But I still think his showing in Battle of Astronomy tower was stronger.

His showing in Battle of Department of Mysteries was also great. I am a little undecided on which was better.

What was Harry's strongest showing in your opinion?

************ The Dolohov/Rowle fight imo.

The Department of Mysteries was a beat down by the Death Eaters. Every member of the DA got taken out and while Harry got some good licks in he was uninjured mostly because he had the prophecy.

Astronomy Tower was good, he used the element of surprise to his advantage to turn the tide.

Battle in the cafe stands out to me because Harry and co don't have the element of surprise or needed to be unharmed. They were panicking and just forced on the run and Harry manages to detect that they were being tracked and managed to outfight Dolohov who defeated Moody and killed Lupin. Granted Dolohov was preoccupied with tying up Ron, giving Harry the chance to hit him with a Body Bind, but given that the trio were caught unaware initially I'd say this battle is Harry's best showing.

** I feel like the HBP sequence is a poor example as pretty much all the Death Eaters Harry takes out are via sucker punch pot shots rather than actually defeating them in duels.

People consider him weak (by which they mean weaker than he should be) because the narrative throughout HBP repeatedly emphasises how difficult he is finding magic/his classes, and in the HP system how good you are at magic is the single greatest factor in combat ability.

E.g. just abandoning all attempts at occlumency, struggling with non-verbal magic (in spite of his ability to throw off the Imperius). Both of which are then rubbed in the reader's face when it turns out that without skill in those areas, you can't even cast a single spell against a wizard like Snape.

** It is an interesting question. Sadly one I don't think we can have a conclusive answer to. The canon writing is somewhat inconsistent and at times I feel it is more plot armour that protects Harry, than his own innate skill. There is also the fact that JKR wished Harry to be a normal, average boy who is against seemingly impossible odds.

Magically and academically speaking - Harry is depressingly average. His only claim to fame is his Patronus. However I must point out that he is good with few other simple (?) charms such as expelliarmus. In the world where knowledge of magic literally equals power, Harry is a disappointment.

However Harry does have some admirable qualities: he is quick thinker, doesn't loose his head in high stress situation, his magic while simple tends to be surprisingly effective, doesn't get sidetracked once he is on the trail.

Ultimately I think - in a fight - Harry is someone who doesn't have any impressive moves, but is stubborn, quick and what moves he does have, while not deadly, are effective.

** I think Harry was best among his generation in combat. He faced against Voldemort and lived to tell the tale which I think not many can boast of. He is very strong-willed person as we seen in graveyard where he overpowered priori incantem even after fighting creatures in the maze then watching his fellow student killed, blood loss and taking couple of crucios, which all of them takes a huge toll in his mental and physical strength.

But what many of us failed recognise was Harry was not a single person. Harry was package that includes Hermione and Ron. Hermione was the brains while Ron is backup wand. Together they had the potential to become next Dumbledore or Voldemort. Individually, Hermione was just another intelligent girl, Ron was average guy without much ambition and Harry was just another good auror.

It's just that he didn't performed any great feats of magic or rare show of his poweress except Patronus and all his other feats were forgotten. So many people think he was weak, but Harry was nowhere near the weak.

** It's about him squandering his potential The first three years are for the most part an adjustment period of sorts for him to get settled in and figure out his place at hog warts and we are shown how powerful he could be by his patronus but after that he is shown to not be bothered by becoming more powerful or train or even give his all to learning what is taught in class Take the second task for example even after he knows that the tasks are dangerous and potentially lethal he still procrastinated figuring out the second tasks preferring to simply be lazy He trains for the third task properly and should have continued to train like that throughout his fifth and sixth years The only truly productive thing he did the next 2 years was teach the da and get slug horns memory when he should have been asking for advice from people he knows on how to train himself after the lessons from dumbledore turned out not to be on battle As for the death eaters he “beat” how many were under orders to capture and not kill? Or were ambushed? He is skilled for his age due to the amount of battles he has survived rather than through training and considering how powerful he could have been, not on dumbledore or toms level they are titans who have decades of experience but he should have been better than almost everyone else by a noticeable margin with a few of the best fighters that surpass him

*** The thing is, he tried to figure out what the second task was, he really did. He just could not. When Cedric gave him the hint Harry resented him. When he had to lie to Hagrid and tell him that he had figured out the task he felt extremely guilty and finally used the hint that Cedric had given him and hated himself for doing it. He tried very hard to figure out a way to breathe underwater but failed. It's not like was unprepared for the dangers he could encounter under water seeing as he managed to fight off the Grindylows when Fleur could not.

In fifth year he taught the DA defense. DA also had 5th 6th and 7th year students whom he taught. He had to know his stuff to teach them for OWL's and NEWT's. You can argue that he might have been better off not training the DA as that way he could have focused on just himself and Ron and Hermione. You also have to remember that the OWL year is really stressful for normal students because of the ridiculous amount of homework that teachers give. Add on top of that teaching NEWT level classes, detentions with Umbridge, Remedial lessons with potions and you would be wondering how Harry even managed to teach the DA.

In HBP I agree with you that he would have been stronger by the end if he applied himself like he did in the previous years. I think he just gave up after Sirius' death or got burned out due to how much constant stress he was under in previous years.

3 out of the 4 death eaters he beat ambushed Harry not the other way around. The first one was Fenir Greyback (the one who beat Bill Weasley who got 12 OWLs compared to Hermione's 10). The next two were the Carrow twins who cursed him in the back before he was aware of their presence. He then managed to turn around and take them both out with a single spell. In the fights I mentioned Harry did not beat them in straight up fight. Harry was ambushed by them and he still managed to beat them. This speaks of great ability as the one Death Eater he did take out by surprise became the Head of DMLE and he could not do anything. Even Flitwick was taken by surprise and he could not do anything.

Does it really matter if the death eaters were ordered not to use lethal force against him when he himself only used non lethal spells against everyone I mentioned and defeated them even though most of them ambushed him?

He was a better fighter than every member of the Order and DA present in this battle by a noticeable margin. Neither the Order who knew about the possible attack and were prepared and capable of using lethal force nor the DA running on Felix Felicis and having Marauders map could take out a single death eater. Harry however after having a draining experience in the cave, having just suffered the loss of his mentor and being half mad with fury took out 4 death eaters in his mad dash to get to Snape and Draco. 3 of them had initiated the fight with him and despite having surprise on their side were taken out quickly by Harry.

Now that I have answered all of your points one by one I want to know something. I am not trying to be mean or having a go at you; I really want to know.

Do people just read the title of the post and give their answers? Do they not read the actual post? I am asking because I spent a lot of time reading then analyzing the fight before finally putting my thoughts down. Even then I had to check the books again and again to ensure I wrote everything correctly and made no mistakes.

It's just that you are not the first person to suggest or ask about how many of the death eaters Harry beat by ambushing them even though I clearly stated more than once in my post about the death eaters ambushing Harry and then directly compared him to other characters who were taken by surprise or ambushed in this battle.

So do most people just read the title and not bother with the actual post?

Even if it was, I wouldn't take offence. Everyone's prerogative to upvote or downvote as they please. It's more interesting than anything else, trying to work out what got a downvote or what got an upvote.

And huh. I honestly hadn't noticed, but I am quite new to this aspect of fandom (I've read for years, but only recently got into the 'community' bit). I've seen moronic and lazy and listless, but not weak as of yet. This thread has been interesting reading in that regard, actually, so thanks for making it!

I guess it's another aspect of Rowling's inconsistency, like you said. If he's weak one day and strong the next, then there's room in canon to argue for both sides. And this fandom doesn't agree on anything ever, so there's always people arguing for both sides of everything. :D
