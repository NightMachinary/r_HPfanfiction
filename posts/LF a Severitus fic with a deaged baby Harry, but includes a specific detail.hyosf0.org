:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A typical deaging fic where Harry gets turned into a baby by some mistake and Severus is unfortunately tasked with the job of caretaker. Dumbledore sets up Snape's room for him, ruining his well-placed and orderly dungeons and adding an additional room for Baby Harry as well as adding a bunch of baby paraphernalia including a “giant squishy monstrosity” that seems to be a baby rug laid out in the middle of his floor which was “nauseating to look at” and wouldn't dare to step on lest he start “sinking into it” just by looking at it.

I must've read this fic years ago, but I've been trying to find it ever since, especially the part about the rug. I've searched my bookmarks hundreds of times and Google has been no help. Any kind of help would be appreciated, it would be a miracle if it were to be found. Though it's likely it may have been deleted :( I wish I could finally stop longing and put my heart to rest.
