:END:
Looking for a fic I read fairly recently that I've completely forgotten the name and author of. Here's what I recall:

- Harry needs or wants to change his identity, and Dumbledore recruits Tonks to teach him how/make sure he can handle it.
- Tonks gives him the Auror 'being undercover crash course' which he takes to like a fish to water; his Gryffindor-ness turns out to be an act
- Tonks transfigures Harry into a girl and goes on a 'date' through Muggle London to see if Harry can handle it; it goes very well
- They invent a cover identity as Snape's daughter by an OC witch who recently died; this identity is partially magic-raised, and kinda a British street punk
- Snape is extremely impressed by Harry's deceptiveness and goes along with it, and they keep their cover very tightly, only speaking out of character when things are absolutely secure

Does this ring a bell for anyone?


** Shedding Lionskin by Beaconhill, on spacebattles. Interesting fic, would love to see it continued!
