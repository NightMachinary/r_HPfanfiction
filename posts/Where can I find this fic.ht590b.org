:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi , I am looking for a particular fanfic that I have read before. In the fanfic, Harry was severely abused by the Dursleys and Severus snape rescued him and heal him. Harry was later adopted by Snape and during breaks they live together at Spinner's End while they live in the hogwarts dungeon during the school time before Harry turned 11. The story also shows that draco, snape's godson, became friends with Harry. Do you know what this fanfic is? Please let me know. Thank you.


** You'll probably need to give more detail for someone to uniquely identify this, because the plot points you gave are common to a lot of Severitus (father-figure Snape) stories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Potions-and-Snitches/182/]] probably includes this story; if you remember it being famous, it's probably on the front page! Check and see if one of the titles rings a bell!
