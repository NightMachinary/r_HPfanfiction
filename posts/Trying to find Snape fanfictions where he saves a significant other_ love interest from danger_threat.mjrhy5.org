Hey, I've trying to find Snape fanfictions with angsty and dramatic content like that, if you have any suggestion I would be delighted to read them.

Also I remember a fic that I read a long time a go with lily and snape being a couple, I think it was a long one, and at some point James tried to r*pe and molest lily tied her up and stuff (I'm not weird or anything but that was a chapter) and snape found her and saved her. Something like that, so if you rember which fic was, please tell cause I think it was a nice one.

Thank you in advance ðŸ˜Š


** linkffn(Guilt by heqhoistomriddle) has Snape die when he discovers wormtail is going to betray the secret and kills him

Tbh most Snape romance has him doing anything for them. I'll have to recommend almost all romance xD
