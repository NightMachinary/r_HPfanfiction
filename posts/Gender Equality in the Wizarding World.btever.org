Disclaimer: Yes, I realize that this is a fictional world, and that there has to be a suspension of disbelief for much of it.

For quite a while, I've imagined the wizarding world to be very similar to real-life societies of the past. Be it the 17th century, the 18th century, or the 19th century, I thought that the wizards probably share many of the beliefs from that time. It therefore followed that the wizarding world has gender inequality (seeing how equality was a very recent thing).

Over the past year, I've come to think that I may be completely wrong. The main argument is: isn't a wand a very good sex equalizer? Everything that a man can do, a woman can do just as well. Magic---be it spells or transportation---removes the factor of physical strength.

While that may be true, a wand does not remove the fact that biological women give birth to children, and historically provide the only source of food for babies (breastmilk). As such, if wizards were the same---biologically---as humans, much of the women's time would be taken up by children.

But that brings up another point: generally, poor and uneducated people have lots of children. This was indeed the case in the ancient/medieval world. The only reason the human population did not increase dramatically is that the mortality rate was equal to the high birth rate. People didn't live for long. Um... I don't know about you, but I don't think that would be particularly true for wizards.

Wizards are canonically hardier than muggles. They have advanced potions and spells for curing diseases or fixing injuries. The can live to an older age. Evolutionarily, wizards should have thrived. So why is the population so low, comparatively? It could be that wizards were better educated, for some reason, decided that they wanted to remain a minority, and was able to foresee the problem of overpopulation. Mmm... a bit far fetched. /It could potentially explain pureblood dogma ("We spent millennia keeping the human population low and in decades, the muggles have ruined everything!"). Hmm.../ I find a more likely explanation is that witches /cannot/ have children as frequently as their muggle counterparts. Longer lifespan + stronger children + better medicine + cleaner living conditions = lower population? Something doesn't add up. Assuming that this is true, women both have more time, and are also more valuable. (A group can recover with the male population decimated. The opposite? Not so much. Hence why men hunt, fight, got war, etc). So... matriarchal society?

That could be possible, except the canonical actions don't really support that. Take how Wulburga Black was unable to strip Sirius's status. Of course, this could potentially be explained away by the fact that education was more accessible (consider Hogwarts vs typical peasant education in the medieval era). More education = more promotion if gender equality.

So which is it? Is it a patriarchy? A matriarchy? Neither?


** I'm pretty sure that women have as much power as men. Amelia Bones occupie an important position and so do Dolores. There even was a female minister of magic during Voldemort's first war if I recall correctly. The reason why Wulburga Black couldn't strip Sirius' status is an easy one: She just doesn't have the right. Imagine if your crazy aunt tried to disown someone of the familly, how would the rest of the family react? Even if she is right, she wouldn't have been listened too. And the reason why wizards doesn't have much children is the same as ours nowadays, we just don't want too. I don't plan on having more than three children. We used to have tons of children cause half of them would die. I think that despite racism against muggleborn (and halfbloods), the wizarding society doesn't have a problem with race (even Draco never made a racist comment, or Flint against Angelica, plus Schackelbot had an important position) or gender.

** Quality of life has a strong negative correlation with birth rate. Families like the Weasleys are rarities, not the norm. Wizards would have had a modern-equivalent quality of life for centuries, so it makes sense their population has stayed small.

Discrimination in general, outside of blood purity, would likely be done away with for similar reasons. There's a reason that, say, Uganda is orders of magnitude more homophobic than France or Germany.

** The most affluent societies have the lowest birth rates. Strange but true. Look at birth rates in various countries. Malthus was wrong. The wizarding world could just be another affluent society.

I've always assumed the sexes are more equal in the wizarding world, since wands are equalizers, but pureblood women of childbearing age face restrictions because of the obsession with blood purity. There would be exaggerated jealousy, defending witches' honor, witches ostentatiously defending their reputations for purity and virtue, etc.

*** Canonically, the wizarding world might as well be post-scarcity in terms of affluence. Gamp's Law doesn't allow for conjuring food out of nothing, but apparently you /can/ duplicate food.

Still doesn't exactly explain the Weasleys. They're "poor", but they've never seemed like they go hungry (except when Ron got the wrong sandwich). So did they just have 7 kids because they were trying for a girl or something?

** Pretty sure that all the fanfics that go on about pureblood women being property of their families are just written by retards.

During Voldemort's first rise to power, the Minister for Magic was Millicent Bagnold - a woman. A woman was holding the highest office in Britain's wizarding government. You cannot get much more egalitarian than that.

The whole thing about robes, candles, quills and rest of the stuff to make it seem like Britain is somehow "backwards" is purely cosmetic.

The only place where there should be an imbalance is in sports, where physical prowess is the only factor, but the way Rowling wrote her books somehow has 12 year old girls going toe to toe against 17 year old guys in Quidditch, so...

I don't think physical prowess is that big of a deal when you are flying on brooms. I think on average men would make better beaters because of the strength required. But on the rest of the positions I don't think gender is an issue.

**** Chasers do throw the Quaffle, not use spells to propel it forward. That's physical strength.

Even the simple activity of clinging on to a broom that is going at 100kph or more (Harry's Firebolt has a top speed of 150 or something - can't remember) subjects the flier to very high inertial forces. Flying isn't as simple as simply sitting on a broom and doing whatever. It's definitely physical.

There would be no contest between 17/18 year olds and 12 year olds. There's a reason why we have brackets like U18, U16, U14 and U12, and why those brackets are split between boys and girls.

***** I doubt Rowling thought about it that far considering she herself has stated how little thought she put into magical sports (as a result of not caring for sports in general herself).

Your interpretation could work, but considering the age variations we see at Hogwarts I'm not sure if I'd buy it entirely.

Harry being as good as he is at 11/12 and pretty much being the best seeker in the school from day one is kind of absurd if magic doesn't play a massive part.

And I'm fairly sure we see a number of younger-ish, 14/15 and under, playing Quidditich for the school team.

You can't really start taking the numbers seriously though because then the whole sport falls apart.

Can you imagine trying to throw a ball around whilst zipping at 100 mph? Even general mental processing of images and actions at those speeds would be damn impressive.

** There's at least some sexism in the Wizarding World, as evidenced by Molly's treatment of Hermione after Rita's article in the 4th year, but on the whole, there seems to be much more gender equality compared to muggles. And in spite of the pervasive fanon of "proper Victorian pureblood women", I think that muggleborns and some muggle-raised halfbloods were much more sexist until quite recently, bacause magical world had women in power and in all areas of life for much longer. Dilys Derwent was the Headmistress and a presumably renowned Healer before in 18th century, Millicent Bagnold was the Minister for Magic in 1980s, Amelia Bones is the head of the DMLE. Umbridge climbed quite high up the career ladder. There are quite a lot of female Aurors (Tonks, Hestia Jones, Alice Longbottom, probably Amelia Bones back in the days). Bellatrix Lestrange, pureblood fanatic, doesn't feel the need to sit at home and wait for her her husbund to return from the Death Eater raid, she is a high-ranking Death Eater herself.

So all in all, the vaguely Victorian feeling is there probably because many wizards and witches of those times are still alive, and it doesn't reflect the mores of the society.

As for Walburga, maybe she did have the right to disown/disinherit Sirius, but reinstated him after Regulus' death. Or maybe she just blasted Sirius from the tapestry, but never actually went through with anything legally. She did, after all, keep Sirius' childhood bedroom intact for many years. Humans are complicated.

**** Women aren't as prone to violence as men, even if they agree with the ideology? Riddle recruited primarily from wizards because of his own prejudices ingrained in him in the muggle orphanage in the 30s and 40s or simply because he knew how to appeal to them better? We see him converting young men using their insecurities and anger like a cult leader he was, as evidenced by Crouch Jr., Snape and maybe Quirrell, but the few female DEs, Bellatrix and Alecto, seem to be in the organisation mostly because of their own sadistic inclinations. Umbridge could have easily been a Death Eater because of her own beliefs and sadism, but she isn't.

** There seem to be at least some kind of gender equality in the Wizarding world.

You have women in position of power, both in Magical schools (Mrs Maxime, Mc Gonagall . . .), and in the Ministry (Amelia Bones, Ex Minister Bagshot, maybe even Umbridge . . .). I have sometimes read the arguments that the Wizarding World is sexist because women have to choose between careers and children, but to be fair, it is not necessarely true (we don't know if Bagshot has a family or not for exemple), and even there is seems to apply to the men too (Dumbledore, or Snape has no wives or children).

There is also the argument that the Pureblood society only see the women as potential mothers since neither Narcissa nor Molly work (the 2 exemples of pureblood mothers), but I think it's because we only see the world from Harry's (limited) vision. Molly doesn't work because of her children, but she has 7, which is considered abnormal in their society. And Narcissa doesn't work because she doesn't have to, from what we know, Lucius doesn't work too (unless going to the minister from time to time to give him money count as work).

**** Exactly! Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister in Britain in the 1980s, but does that mean men and women had full equality in Britain? Of course not!

Granted, the fact that there are women in the stories with careers and power means that they aren't completely second-class citizens, but that's not exactly a high bar, is it? Just because they could be a lot worse doesn't mean they couldn't be a lot better, too.

** It's an oligarchy, where reputation for wisdom and clear thought is most respected. The rest of the society is mostly interested in trading comforts and entertainments. The ruling bodies are mostly populated by people well-past the child rearing stage.

There's no indication that witches can have children well beyond the normal range, which sort of figures; they have the same 400 or so potential ova of a normal human being produced each month from menses to menopause. A woman still bearing children probably is discounted opinion-wise as being affected by hormones, so many witches may rush through having children at an early age so that they can move on to the 'good part' of life, where their voice can be heard without prejudgment.

** Im not sure if its patriarchy or matriatchy but it does seem to have biases about men vs women. There are still sterotypes.

And certain moments like how Hermione can go into the boys dorms but Harry and Ron can't go into a girl.

Or how love potion is dismissed as this harmless thing girls use but it can literally brainwash people. Why isnt this considered as dangerous as imperio? And why is it treated as a girl thing?

** The idea that men and woman must be equal in magical society is popular, but evidence of it is thin on the ground. There's a simple test that reveals that what we actually see in Rowling's books doesn't live up to what it should probably be: how many female characters can you name who have important roles, plenty of time "on screen," have careers, are mothers, and are married? Next, how many male characters have important roles, plenty of time on screen, have careers, are fathers, and are married?

If men and women are equal, then we should see equality here as well, for this is a good test for how equal a society really is. Women with strong careers and roles is good, but if they are all unmarried and childless, that isn't equality and they aren't as good as role models as women with careers and families - especially when they are depicted alongside men who haven't had to make such sacrifices.

Now, to be fair, we don't have a ton of examples of either of those. We spend most of our time in a boarding school where none of the staff appears to be married (probably because that would complicate things - let's be honest, here, what are the chances that no one on staff in a school is married?). But in the two clear-cut examples of families, the Dursleys and the Weasleys, both fathers have careers and both mothers don't. Coincidence? Perhaps, but it's still evidence against equality.

And what kinds of careers do we see among women? Teachers and nurses, traditional female careers. Amelia Bones is in law enforcement, it's true, but she doesn't have enough of a role to matter. Fudge's predecessor was a woman, but she has no role at all (also, she served at the same time as Thatcher, and would anyone really like to argue that Thatcher was proof that women were equal to men in Britain in the 80s??). The two most powerful women with the biggest roles and who don't have traditionally female jobs are Bellatrix Lestrange and Dolores Umbridge. Villains! Again, not role models. Coincidence? Again, perhaps, but it's still evidence against male and female roles being equal in the books. And let's not forget that Bellatrix seems to be unusual - she's the only main Death Eater who is female (aside from the Carrow sister, who has barely any role).

We can add here the fact that while Hermione is a strong female character, there are still plenty of instances where she is relegated to more traditional female roles. When going after the Philosopher's Stone, her contribution is to solve an intellectual puzzle while the boys do things that are very physical and action-oriented. In the Chamber of Secrets, her contribution is research while the boys go out and have physical adventures. This is persistent and recurring problem in children's literature: boys charge out to have physical adventures and take risks while girls stay home and do safe, supportive things.

All in all, while I believe Rowling did a better job than most, I also think she probably still had a lot of unconscious assumptions about male and female roles which influenced her while she was writing. This is normal - we all have such assumptions, and sometimes they aren't clear unless someone else can step back and point them out.

And that's why I'm posting this answer. By recognizing where Rowling fell short, fan fiction writers will know where they can improve on things. Don't simply imitate and repeat her mistakes. Write stories where girls go out and takes risks while boys hang back and play supportive roles. Write stories where an adult witch has a family and a career while the wizard stays home to tend the house.
