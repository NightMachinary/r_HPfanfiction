It started with a story idea "What if James, Sirius, Remus & Peter weren't the first generation of Marauders?" That sat in my head for a while needing another spark. I got that spark after finding/watching a movie I hadn't seen since my junior year of highschool Codename: Kids Next Door Operation: Z.E.R.O. which has the book of K.N.D. as a mcguffin.

So heres the idea; instead of the map the twins find 'The Tome of the Marauders' a book of spells/pranks/stories/ect. from generations of Maurauders with the cannon 4 being the latest (possibly having their page act like the map, or maybe shoved in the pages) in this long line. Fred George & Lee would become the next generation (possibly eventually recruiting the Golden trio).

So what do you think of this idea? I feel I need more of a plot, maybe I could make it episodic or set it during OOTP? Any ideas to add on?


** I love the idea but I can't think of anything to add, sorry

** This would change a lot, but to make this work better you could have Harry be in Fred and George's year. He could be the brother of the boy who lived or Neville could be BWL. It could also start with like a very whimsical/devil may care attitude that develops into a more business focused mindset, since if the main trio is Fred George and Harry, you have a lot of time spent on the development of WWW products and the selling of them throughout hogwarts in addition to the sneaking around and pranking. Not dissuading you from sticking with the canon year and friends, but it wouldn't mesh very well with this unless you totally reworked hermiones character and ignored the Harry and Voldemort conflict. fully committing to Harry and the twins opens up a lot of possibilities.
