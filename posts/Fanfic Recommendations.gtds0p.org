I'm a whumper and am looking for fics where one of the kids loose control of their magic, whether a one time thing due to emotions or because they have trouble in general. I guess my ideal fic would involve Harry struggling, Sirius being there, someone getting hurt/comfort, and little or no Harry and Snape interactions. Also I know it's uncommon but I'm only a Canon shipper. Thanks to all who reply.


** The fanfic I'm currently co-writing is whump/hurtcomfort, has Harry suffering unaddressed PTSD, and heavily features Snape (it's eventual mentor!Snape). However, it does not include alive Sirius, and though there are currently no ships, it will not feature any canon relationships down the line either. Romance will be only a sideplot though-- Our genre is more Gen Angst/Tragedy than anything else.

If it sounds like something you might want to check out, you can find it here: ao3(A Lamb Before the Slaughter)
