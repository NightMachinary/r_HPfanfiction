** I would very strongly recommend linkao3(Put Your Guns Away, It's Tea Time by frombluetored) and its sequel linkao3(Put Your Curse in Reverse by frombluetored). They are post-Cursed Child canon compliant fics. Even for people that disliked CC (I maintain that it has potential !) it's still very well-written and CC doesn't impact much on the story apart from a reference here and there. And added bonus, it updates quite frequently (every 8-12 days approximately) !

#+begin_quote
  Scorpius Malfoy knew his fifth year would be challenging-- but he hadn't expected this. Between his impending O.W.L.s, his new relationship, Quidditch tryouts, the public eye, and the Slug Club, he can hardly catch his breath. Meanwhile, Harry Potter discovers that being a professor at Hogwarts is very different from being a student there-- especially when you've got three mischievous children and a handful of students who can't seem to do more than ogle at you.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

** I haven't read many but I really like the stuff by frombluetored that was already rec'd. Also I liked [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4605858][Summer Boys]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/115114][Irradiance]] . Irradiance is beautifully written but a little depressing while Sunmer Boys is more or less a angsty summer romance fic. You have to be logged in to ao3 to see irradiance. Linkao3(4605858)

** I'll preface this by saying I haven't read any of these /yet/, so I can't vouch for how good they are, but these are the stories in A03 that I have bookmarked for later with this pairing:

Quietly series: linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/series/556723]])

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (novel form): linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7666957]])

Out of the Woods: linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7226932]])

Time and Other Flaws of Human Perception: linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7580875]])

Greater Expectations: linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5831689]])

The Perfect Match: linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/657254]])

Not all of these are completed yet (but seem to be actively updated at least), so be sure to check that if you prefer finished works.

  When Scorpius is thirteen, time stops making sense. The ensuing seven years show him that nothing else does, either.

  Albus Potter has always tried his hardest to live up to his family's name, whereas Scorpius Malfoy has always tried his hardest not to. When they arrive at Hogwarts, they are determined to have nothing to do with one another. What happens when these two opposites collide and realise they may not be so different from each other after all?

  Albus and Scorpius are in their sixth year at school. Albus is popular, famous both for his surname as well as his skill on the quidditch pitch. Scorpius is the quiet, bookish Ravenclaw that Albus doesn't really know or think about much. A chance encounter makes him realise that Scorpius may be the most interesting person he's ever met... Draco Malfoy is the Potions Master at Hogwarts while Harry Potter is the reluctant Head Auror. Draco is one of the best teachers at Hogwarts and he's pretty content with his life until Harry starts coming to him for help with his cases and stirs up long buried feelings. They slowly become friends and there is hope for more as Harry's marriage, which has been in trouble for a long time now, comes to an end. The first few chapters are entirely Albus/Scorpius, but there is a plenty of Draco/Harry from chapter 11 onward.

  This is Harry Potter and the Cursed Child as a novel. From the perspective of Albus Severus Potter and sometimes Scorpius Malfoy. Dialogue and directions the same (except for one scene ahem). With added novel-ish character stuff.

#+begin_quote
  The Wizarding World is a changed society after the death of the Dark Lord Voldemort. Two decades after Britain's liberation and witches and wizards are free to pursue the lives they choose, the boundaries upon ideals and expectations unravelling. One of magic can be whatever they want to be.Such is the case for most witches and wizards, anyway. Albus is not one of them. Not really, anyway. Being a Potter means he's not really supposed to be anything but what the world wants him to be. Fighting against the unspoken demands of society, Albus strives to pull free of such bindings and become exactly who he wants to be. It is a feat far harder than he could have anticipated.Funnily enough, he isn't the only one who thinks so.

  From the moment Scorpius and Albus get on the Hogwarts Express for their fifth year, things start to change. Albus starts to gain confidence both in the classroom and out of it, and Scorpius' realization that he has greater feelings for his best friend threatens to leave him more alone than he'd ever imagined. (Prequel to ‘Quietly')
