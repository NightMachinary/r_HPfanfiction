:END:
I'm new to this so forgive any posting mistakes.

Can anyone recall or help me find a specific fanfiction where Harry has some fanatically loyal house elves. Some specific points are:

Kidnap and brainwash Narcissa and FemDraco

Have hilarious little team squads that rob Harry's enemies

Blow up malfoy manor

Act like little pirates and rob ships while also cleaning them as an apology

Are generally berserk little crazies

One elf has wonderful ideas but the boss elf smack talks him

Harry is bad ass.

OMG, I would love to see this in a fic. Not even necessarily literal pirates on a ship: they could be stealing food while the trio is on the run and leaving behind a cooked meal and spotless kitchen, stealing evidence from the DMLE and tidying the filing cabinets, etc.

*** Literally all these points are in a single story. It was a great read. I hope to find it again

****** Some suggestions:

- You should edit it to change the flair to "What's that fic?" That tells people you're looking for a specific story. "Request" means you want stories /similar to/ this.
- If you have any idea what site you might have read it on, that might help jog people's memories.
- Add in all the details you can remember. I saw one recently where they put in that the author's name might have used the xx______xx format. Even the tiniest detail might have stuck in somebody else's mind, too.

** I don't think I've read this though I do very much enjoy when the elves are allowed to gleefully sow chaos.

In the meantime, linkao3(Dobby's Deceit) the elves are really great, so you might also enjoy it. I hope someone knows the one you're talking about so I can read it!
