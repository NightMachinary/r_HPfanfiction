I've read a lot of fics where harry is a gray or dark wizard. But I've not seen many where he is a true light wizard. I know people might think this is what happened in canon, but I don't think canon harry was truly a light wizard. He was manipulated by Dumbledore imo. If he was more aware of what was going on he might've chosen a different way. Basically I'd like a more independent harry who is a light wizard with truly pure intentions, instead of following Dumbledores greater good nonsense


** The best way to achieve a truly "light" Harry is for good adult guys to become competent and prevent throwing kids to the wolves.

Examples of such fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): Hermione time travel to her two years old self. She tells Dumbledore the necessary intel, who takes things from there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]], linkffn(4740107): 21 years old Ginny time travels back 10 years, fixes up things efficiently and almost painlessly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978): Competent UK government and allied wizards shot up Death Eaters, Umbridge Ministry, and Voldemort. The Trio only has to help a little on the Horcrux hunt.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467): Dumbledore takes the Basilisk more seriously, and solved the canon plot with Amelia Bones. It's very refreshing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): Harry is raised by his loving, BAMF archeologist aunt, Dr Evans. Although Harry has to pitch in a few times, Petunia, Sirius, Bill, Fleur, and Dumbledore have done most of the heavy lifting against Voldemort.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  What if the war was over, but the only ones left were Ginny and a paralyzed friend? When Ginny finds a ritual that will send her back to an earlier point in the timeline, how will she change things to come out for the better? HP/GW

  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** Canon Harry cast two out of three Unforgivables, and I suspect he would have been quite capable of casting the third, better than he was with the torture curse.

What about Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres? He's not everyone's favourite person, certainly, but he tries very hard to live ethically, stands firmly against bullying, would never cast Unforgivables, and wants to make the whole world better.
