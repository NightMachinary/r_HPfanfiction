:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember that harry(maybe others aswell) travels back in time to Hogwarts and meets the founders, he finds out that they are struggling against Dementors and the Patronus hasn't been invented yet. Harry teaches them how to perform the Patronus and they practice it on a Boggart that's in Hogwarts.

That's all I can remember from reading it. Any help finding it is appreciated


** I think that happened in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/519887/chapters/918771][Strange Visitors From Another Century]]

*** It is thank you, I actually checked that story before asking, but I thought the Dementor bit happened a lot nearer the beginning of the story than it does so I missed it.
