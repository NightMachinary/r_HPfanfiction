TLDR: A goal = need + desire + values + ambition. It can be short-term and longterm, and it can change during the story.

This post would probably go better in the [[/r/Fanfiction]], rather than a niche such as HPfanfiction, but this is my favorite fandom and I love you guys, so you'll profit from my own musings before anyone else.

I've read a couple of fanfictions (scratch that, must be over a hundred by now, finished, dropped, abandoned or not). And I noticed that most, while the premise had a lot of potential, eventually dragged on without any, seemingly advancement in either internal or external development. Words were stringed next to each other, but the story had slowed to a crawl.

Thinking back on it, I wondered why, and came to the following conclusion: There was no goal involved.

An author with so much potential, incredible writing and well-conceived characters could lose everything by simply not - or badly - setting out goals for his character. A lack of planning or forethought, maybe. But it's in my belief that it has rather more to do with the fact that people misunderstand what a goal is.

A goal is what will drive your story, it should be one of the first thing that comes to mind when planning your work, as trying to shoe-horn a character in a plot will often result in blank and bland moments of your story where the plot will not match with the protagonist's role. And what worse that telling the story of a character which does not match said character?

So back to our goal, what is it exactly? A need? A value? A desire? an ambition? It's both none and all of these things.

Let's define a few terms first:\\
We have a need:\\
"Something that is wanted or required."\\
"Important or essential requirement."

Examples? Let's refer ourselves to the Maslow Pyramid:\\
* We have physiological needs: The first, basic requirements for human survival: Food, shelter, clothing.\\
* We have safety needs: Pertining to security, usually, either financially, personal security, Health, well-being.\\
* We have Love and belonging: Friendship, intimacy, family.\\
* We have esteem needs: the need for self-respect, self-esteem, to be accepted and valued as important.\\
* And then we have the last, the self-actualization need: The realization of his full potential, only available after the subsequent mastery of all previous needs.

A need is mutable, but only proactively. The need is usually the basis of the goal, what reminds behind a motivation, even though it is not apparent. Without a need, a character has no desires, no reason for even living.

We know, then, that finding a need for our character is mandatory, and one of the first thing required to shape our goal, as without needs, a character's existence is quite pointless.

Once we have our need, what happens?

values happens:\\
"Principles or standards of behaviour."\\
"One's judgment of what is important in life."\\
"A set of moral codes."

Values are usually internalized and uncounscious, they dictate how our character will achieve his goal, and, unless extreme circumstances, they usually do not change much in life. A deeply seated belief that will usually tell how our character will answer or resolve his need.

There are really a lot... like over 400, easily. But here's a few:\\
Loyalty, love, respect, determination, stability, success, wealth.

We have our need, what our character is required to resolve in order to progress, or simply continue living. And now, we also have a value. A filter through which our character will be able to dictate and decide how he will approach and resolve his need.

A character whose value is selflessness, respect and justice will probably not try to answer his need through murder and stealing, and may even put others before himself.\\
A character whose values are more in line with determination, success, ruthlessness and selfishness may be more prompt in using selfish means to answer his needs.

With these twos, we can make a goal. Usually short-term, but it can work. Our character will find a shelter, that's a goal. But let's admit it, it's pretty bland for a whole story. Resolving needs is interesting for making character development and is often necessary, so yes. Need + Value = goal, but not the story's.

But let's not stop here. We're authors, we want MORE. Remember that a character is a human (or at least en entity with a personality). Protagonist, like us, will usually want to follow the Maslow Pyramid in order to become enlightened and progress as individuals up to the self-actualization point. The higher you are, the more abstract your needs becomes, the better place there is for our next point: Desires.

Desire:\\
* "A strong feeling of wanting to possess, or have something."\\
* "A wish for something to happen."

It's not a need, it's a want. Character have needs, but needs do not have to be the be-all end-all of their world. They can wants and wish for things too. Do you stop at your needs? Don't you also wish for things? Of course you do.\\
Where does that leave us?\\
Your character is homeless, he needs a shelter. He wants a home.\\
Uh yeah, maybe not now, but great. He has something else to look forward to! Desires are subjective, abstract things that a character wishes to obtain. They may not easily obtainable, (A character may wish to win at lotery, fat chance happening, but still). But they can offer great variety in how your character progress if you make them either mid-term goal, or even conflict with your needs.

How? If we take, again, our Maslow Pyramid example, put his desire higher than his need. Someone living a more expensive life than what his expense permits is often such individual who puts his desire before his need. Usually, he come to a hard crash to reality by becoming so indebted he cannot go on anymore. His desires, therefore, becomes a source of conflict that he must work to change.\\
But it does not mean he has to put away his desire, instead, he can transform it into /ambition/.

Ambition:\\
* "A strong desire to achieve something, typically requiring determination and hard-work."\\
* "Desire and determination to achieve success."

Ambition is a desire put on a long-term basis. It's the abstract form of a goal.

When an author says:\\
* My character wants to be wealthy\\
* My character wants to be famous\\
* My character wants to be powerful

He is stating the ambition of his character. To make it a goal, he must define wealthy in term of his character needs, desires and values.

My character values material possession, flamboyant demonstration of luxure and three cats has being wealthy. Okay, we have a goal, great!!

How do you make a story interesting? By creating a starting point with his need, making them conflict with his desire and making your charactor decide on a path to follow based on his value in order to accomplish his ambition. To do so, he must resolve the goal, which is only a concrete, defined form of his ambition based on values + desire.

Comment, insult, reply, question, do what you want with this. But that's my take on making a story, and a character, interesting and goal-driven.


** Thank you very much for the excellent post. It reminds me of one of my favourite Vonnegut quotes:

#+begin_quote
  “Make your characters want something right away even if it's only a glass of water. Characters paralyzed by the meaninglessness of modern life still have to drink water from time to time.”
#+end_quote

Your final point is great advice.

I wholeheartedly agree with this and believe that most fanfic authors fail to assign any meaningful ambitions to their protagonists other than 'falling in twoo wuv with their Soul Bond mate,' 'escape manipulations,' or 'become a badass through a last minute deus ex machina.' This results in thin characterisations which drag down even the most engaging plots. Even if authors manage to impart a nebulous desire to 'survive encounter with Voldemort' or 'change the magical world for the better,' they often fail to tie that ambition into the character's immediate thought processes or desires.

I have a question for you: do you think there is any 'best' method (e.g. dialogue, narration, or description) to accomplish this in third-person limited stories where the reader is somewhat separated from the protagonist's mindset (compared to first-person)?

*** You make fair points all around. It was exactly stories like you mentioned that prompted me to write this. People can also notice that the most popular stories are those where the goal is more defined.

As for your question, I'll try to answer to the best of my abilities.\\
Say your character's goal is to become chief warlock of the wizengamot.

Well maybe at eleven year old he'll only have the vague feeling of wanting to be powerful, but because he's evolving and malleable, shoe-horning him in the finite decision of becoming head of W wouldn't be realist or interesting. He could start by wanting to become an auror, but then realize he has no talent in duelling. Through his friend, school, talent that he will discover alongside the reader, your protagonist will slowly narrow his choice. I am good in history of magic, I have friends with connection, I am a talented speaker with charisma, but I suck at any form of magical battle. Yet I want to make an impact on the wizarding world, how can I?\\
His goal, then, could be to discover himself. How? Reading, finding summer jobs asking people, experiencing things that happens without his own prodding (external events). Why? To find myself.

Through this, with others friends, he discovers his talent finds itself in politics. So he want to go in politic. He may immediately sets the goal to become minister, as it's something any young knows and relates to. It's powerful.\\
His next goal is to get the best grade possible, he then graduate, manage to find a small job related to politics, maybe secretary or pen-pusher or something.\\
Using his connections, and talents, he can come to the realization that minister does not have so much power after all, despite being famous. But your character does not care so much about fame. He wants power. He realize that the real power is in legislation (because values that's why), who is responsible of the legislation? Wizengamot. And at the head is the chief warlock. He then realize that his goal is to become chief warlock. This should be the last arc, the completion of the ambition that was vaguely hinted at at the start of the book. And every goals that he went through only served to push him toward his realization.

But how did Iamage to keep track and make understand the reader what my character wanted?\\
By the following.\\
First, always always keep three questions at the forefront of your mind : why, how and what. What is my character doing, or what does he hope to gain by doing this. (goal) How is he doing it. (values) Why is he doing it (motivation : need + desire)

But then, to pinpoint more precisely on your question, how can you make your reader understand that? By keeping out of his head and making your character /feel/.\\
All of what I keep hammering creates feelings. Need may create desperation, ruthlessness, restlessness. Respecting ones value create the feeling g that "this is righr" while going against them can create strong feeling of guilt, anxiety and uneasiness. Desire can be expressed through longing, wishing, hoping. Ambition is through determination.

Through narration, dialogue and description, you will express your protagonist feelings about particular things, people and actions. The more the story progress, the more completed and accomplished your character should feel, until the point where he feels complete.\\
Or dead. It happens too.

But still, story should focus on the development of your character, the way he perceive reality and how this perception changes through time and space by making him pursue a goal.

Do I answer your question? I'm on the train and I'm prone to ramble don't feel bad to say no if I didnt, I tend to lose myself in explanations on my cell.

**** Okay, I'm seated with a laptop, so I considered elaborating my explanation with Voldemort (only because it's the character I most understand, as I spent a lot of time analyzing him.).

So we have our Voldemort, Megalomaniac, psychopath, narcissistic dark lord.

What is his long term goal?\\
Immortality. I don't think anyone will deny that, every action he ensure in his last arc of existence and previously with the creation of his horcruxes. But it wasn't always the case, wasn't it? He did not happened into world thinking, I am /so/ going to be immortal, you watch it.

What other goals did he have?\\
Stealing and harming people in the orphanage.\\
Becoming a teacher\\
Getting the Thestral wand\\
Opening the chamber of secret\\
Making his horcruxes\\
Fooling teachers and students by being charming outstanding. Learning about Dark Arts.\\
Vanquishing Dumbledore\\
Vanquishing Harry Potter\\
Controlling the Wizarding World\\
And others...

So if we put them in order we have the following: Stealing and harming people in the orphanage, Fooling teachers and students by being charming and outstanding Learning about Dark Arts. Opening the chamber of secrets\\
Making his horcruxes\\
Becoming DADA teachers\\
Controlling the Wizarding World,\\
Vanquishing Dumbledore\\
Vanquishing Harry Potter,\\
Getting the Elder wand.

Many of these overlaps, and the all-encompassing immortality only becomes clear when he started making horcruxes. Does that mean he did not want to be immortal before then? no, but it was not his goal. It was more abstract, an /ambition/

What ambition? What is the common point behind all of these goals. Fame?\\
Our first thought my be this, but it does not quite add up. Fame is not everlasting, it's short, fleeting. Which contradicts with his immortality. If he wanted fame, why would he care about Immortality?

Power? Again, if power was what he wanted, why seek Immortality? To make a point? Wouldn't just making his goal of vanquishing Dumbledore and getting the Elder Wand be the culmining point of this ambition?

Family?\\
Yeah let's not got there.

So what abstract concept did Voldemort seek through his life goals? What did he hope to gain by bullying, murdering, maiming, learning all those spells and trying to kill muggles and take over the Wizarding World? What did he want to be? He wanted to be different, he wanted to be better than others. Most importantly, he wanted to be recognized as someone different and better (hence why he did not keep his father's name, why he only seeked famous objects for his horcruxes, why he wanted to be a teacher). So his ambition behind his goal would be recognition, that is what he seeks to accomplish throughout all his life, by trying different goals. Recognition.

We have his ultimate goal: Immortality We have his ambition behind his goal: Recognition. We have the need behind his ambition: Esteem. We also established his desire: To be different, to be better.

Okay, now we have that, how does he go about getting it: He usually goes by putting himself above others, he is a man who does not hesitate in sacrificing everyone to achieve his goal, or to use people to get what he wants.\\
He manipulates, cheats, lies, but also seeks knowledge and works very hard to achieve. What does that say about values?

Lying, cheating, selfishness, greed, determination, ruthlessness, knowledge, hard-working, authority.

Voldemort's desire does not work against his need, but his perception of his reality, based on his knowledge and evolution will affect the range and reach of his goal. One of the most effective filter of this reality are emotions. The whole spectrum range of feelings, and are also how an author will show how the character approach and progress in his story.\\
How did he get from bullying, or teaching, to immortality? By experiencing and feeling things.

And there is one particular feeling that Voldemort experienced throughout his life, and that Dumbledore took great time in repeating: Fear.\\
Voldemort is afraid. That's one of the main feelings we need to focus here.

What is he afraid of? Death. He is utterly frightened by death, but what in death scares him?\\
The same thing that makes him want pursue recognition rather than fame. Death, to him, implies forgetting. Voldemort, through his disorder, does not comprehend human emotions, he does not comprehend that love can exist outside of physical visibility, hence why he constantly need his Death Eater to prove themselves to him, to prostrate to him, because he does not understand that emotions goes further than a fleeting moment. So by dying, Voldemort is afraid of being forgotten.\\
Death is the utmost representation of his failure at accomplishing his need. He tries to circumvent that by achieving immortality.

To summarize (OR TL;DR because why not): The starting point of Voldemort is his esteem need. This do not conflict with his desire to be better or different, but the latter rather act as a fuel through which he act in accord with his values, eventually defining his ambition of being recognized. Yet, Rowling makes a strong emphasize upon his fear of death, and through a mix of all that, Voldemort arrive at the conclusion that his ambition can only be fulfilled through immortality.

How does Rowlin goes about expressing these points? She never explicitely states his need, or his ambition. She does emphasize his goal, but mostly put her focus upon his desire to be better and different, his values, in how he acts, and his feelings, to construct our view of the character.

***** I don't actually think that a desire for recognition lies behind Voldemort's fear of death. Most people are afraid of death; they just come to terms with it eventually. They're afraid of vanishing from existence. Sure, some people might strive to do great deeds so their name lives on, but that's a paltry form of immortality and no real substitute for everlasting life.

I agree that Voldemort wants his name on everyone's lips, but I don't think that drives his primal fear of death.

I'd qualify voldemort's as a literal phobia, as his boggart would be his death self. In that sense, I think therein lies more substance and reasons behind his fear than any other average individuals.

He made it a literal obsession and goes way further than normal. So, in that case, one must stop and think about what lies in death that makes him so scared, because it goes much MUCH further than simply being scared of dying.

******* I would argue that his main drive is the desire to be known, and not just known, but respected by all. He started out life as an orphan, not having anyone to hold him or love him, no friends to get along with or learn social cues from.

He wants what any kid wants: Attention.

Coming from a place completely devoid of attention that wasn't negative, he wanted attention, and that attention to be positive. In the orphanage it seemed he was not given any positive attention, no friends, just fellow orphans, during WW2. Ultimate goal in that environment: Survive.

After a decade of that, he is told that he is special, he Belongs, he belongs to a Group, a group of people who can do what ever they want because they are special.

mhm, and that's why i think it's interesting and fitting that harry associates voldemort's movements with that of a child at the end of DH, and that he's stuck as a monstrous foetus in limbo for eternity. voldemort was, ultimately, a creepy manchild. i likened him to littlefinger and walter white in the other thread and i think the comparison holds up- he has a colossal ego that perpetually needs feeding, and the idea that he's considered anything but the Greatest gnaws at his soul

******** Exactly! But it's important to mention that voldemort is in no way a balanced individual. He suffers from incredibly debilitating personality disorder that prevents him to understand the spectrum of human emotions.\\
He cannot relate, as such, he cannot understand how, if he is not seen, alive or /there/, people can still feel the impact of his presence. Moreover, he is also unable to consider other humans as his equal, he views himself as inherently superior. Being defeated, or suffering any cause that would categorize him as Human or normal is si my preposterous

***** I think that most of the goals and ambitions you've listed aren't really the driving force of his life. What Voldemort wants is power, or more specifically, to not feel powerless. He was raised being ignored and then hated and eventually realized that he deserved better. He found ways to defeat and overwhelm his tormentors, using abilities beyond their control. Things were going swimmingly until Dumbledore showed up and tore away all his preconceptions about the control he'd achieved in his life. Here was a person who was more powerful than him, able to rob him of the security of his secrets and bringing the message that 'you are not the exception- you're just one of many in an exclusive group'.

He went to Hogwarts because his frame of reference where control was concerned had widened to include the Wizarding world and in particular, his nemesis and personal devil, Albus Dumbledore. His passion was in learning more than Dumbledore, to be more influential and otherwise dominate all who could possibly take away his power. Finding out that he was the Heir of Slytherin and therefore rare and exceptional was a vindication of his cause- he really was greater than all others, he just had to fulfill the promise of his lineage. Also, it put him in the position of wanting to exceed Slytherin's accomplishments.

The last relevant aspect of his primary passion is the one force it seemed all were powerless against: death. He had heard of ways to extend life, and he sought to find them, take them, and exceed them. Not one horcrux but seven, and with the youth and economic power of the Philosopher's stone as well, he could be greater even than Herpo the Foul, who had created these apex magics that few others had truly attained.

When the Philosopher's Stone was destroyed it frustrated him, but the fact that no one else would have it either probably helped him get over that particular loss.

Just my thoughts on the matter.

** Thank you, nothing drives me crazier then stories where there is no goal, no focus. Well, baring small slice of life one shots of course. Almost as bad are stories where the character has a goal... but then does the exact opposite.

A classic example is Harry Potter in fanfiction wanting to be average, but then signing up for all the classes in the world, training every hour of every day, actively seeking out danger, and most horrendously show boating.

**** The only time it's acceptable is if it happens subtly or for a few chapters before someone calls him on it, or he realizes on his own. He doesn't really want to be average, he just dislikes all the scrutiny and fame for things he didn't do.

I would absolutely love a story where Harry realizes that he loves the fame and adoration for his actions. It would be a nice small twist and really help set up a long term goal.

** I'd make explicit that all of this applies to the protagonist /and/ the antagonist.

The opposition figure needs the same care and making sure their sheet is incompatible in parts with the protagonist.

Peril is what makes a story interesting, and a cartoon villain that exists solely to let the protagonist show how clever they are isn't enough to really make a reader think they might win.

And an antagonist with no chance of winning is no antagonist at all.

(I'd also quibble about the shoe-horning in characters issue. The problem only arises when you fail to revise your character to make them fit the new plot you've put them in.

Admittedly, it's not as efficient as knowing where you're going from the start, but sometimes I find that having a starting point sparks more interesting options to take. As long as you remove the false-starts, no-one should ever know.)
