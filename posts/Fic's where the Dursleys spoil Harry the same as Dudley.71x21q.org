I found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10617650/1/Harry-Dursley][this one]] but all the others I have found consist of the Dursleys being good people.

*** It's not really that probable. They spoil Dudley because he's their only child. Meanwhile they hate Harry because he's an unwanted burden and a reminder of a world they want to distance themselves from.

**** Now that's an interesting thing to think about- why they spoil Dudley. I don't just think it's an only child thing. I've always thought a lot of parents spoil their kids because they're lazy, or because they're so narcissistic that they see themselves in their kids and so can't see the bad. For me, I think that it's a little strange that they treated Harry so badly, because they are all about appearances. Even though Petunia hate Lily, i think it would have been somewhat logical for her to decide to adapt him to THEIR way of life and fitting in, putting Harry and Dudley on more equal footing, for the sake of appearances if nothing else.

***** Either notice could work honestly. I'm tempted to try writing that.

** This might be the closest you're going to get and it's really just Petunia doing it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4113087/1/A-Different-Fate]]

And you might like this, again just Petunia really, although sadly it's not finished. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2196609/1/An-Aunt-s-Love]]

** There are a few where the Dursleys eventually start treating Harry well, The Tinkerer and to a lesser extent Perfectly normal come to mind. I can't think of too many where he is actually spoiled though.

Has a Petunia that treats the boys the same. Takes some real twists and has excellent plot and world building. Still being updated sporadically.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
