[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12171601/1/Scarlet-Fox][Scarlet Fox]] is a Miraculous Ladybug/Harry Potter crossover, but you don't need to have watched ML to understand it since as it goes along, you learn about that side of things with Harry as well.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8173730/chapters/18727943][l also have it cross-posted on AO3.]]

*Official Summary:* After an encounter with Master Fu in London, Harry receives his own Miraculous. Using it to become Scarlet Fox, a hero who takes Magical Britain by storm, he discovers that this is what was meant by "the power he knows not", becoming a game changer in his struggle against Voldemort.

Basically, Harry acquires a magical gemstone that's bound to a fox-like being, which, when he uses it to transform, turns him into a fox-themed superhero with enhanced physical abilities and the ability to create illusions.

It's rated T, so nothing too graphic is in it.

I would appreciate the feedback. My main concern is making him /too/ powerful, what with the power of the Miraculous, as well as his regular magic, but general feedback is always appreciated.


** I wasn't able to do much more than skim the first chapter, I'll sit down and give it a read later. What I did notice though is your paragraphs are all uniformly very short, and that makes the flow rather choppy. I am not suggesting utilising purple prose to pad them up, but maybe go over them to see if anything can be fleshed out a bit? Some of them actually look as if they could be combined, really. Maybe expand on why Harry was so unusually confrontational when he came downstairs and saw his uncle?

*** I've been told that I have some problems with describing things, so I suppose I see your point, especially in regards to Harry vs Vernon. It was because the events of Book 5 were still raw to Harry and he wasn't in the mood for anyone's nonsense.

Clearly, it wasn't as clear as I thought it was.
