Not just a Ron POV story or Ron as part of the trio. Are there any good stories with Ron as the main protagonist?


** A very promising one is [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/red-hair-green-tie-hp.334067/][/Red Hair, Green Tie/ by Kevin Vacit]], a fic whose point of divergence is that Ron --- who, as we know from the Mirror of Erised, more than anything else wants to be respected and admired --- is sorted into Slytherin.

*** this is starting out great! Nobody is going through "sudden personality reassignment" just because of being in different houses than canon. People still are themselves. - I am looking forward to continuing reading this one. :)

** For novel-length tales, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7467796/1/Choices][Choices]] is pretty decent (given how few stories there are of this type out there). It's 180k words and updated a month and change ago.

#+begin_quote
  Ron has the ability to see the future and he has the choice to either let it happen or change it for the better. Not Powerful!Ron. Pairings undecided as of the moment.

For one-shots not named /Number Games/:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2221913/1/Chess][Chess]] by opalish is not bad.

Also, my story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/12/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Ickle Ronnikins]] has him being pretty darned heroic.

*** Ickle Ronnikins. I smiled at the last line.

Choices is interesting. Good characterization for the most part and I love all the Ron/Daphne interactions. It's just missing that little bit of agency. The pace is quick enough to make it feel like it's not just a rehash, but it just lacks a certain urgency

*** If you like a well written Ron, you might try reading anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2944739/1/][Solstice Muse]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2944739/1/][Within these Walls]] is a pretty good story with a rather original plot. It's basically a hostage situation fic, where bunch of desperate Death Eaters, after losing their master, kidnap 18 aurors and the DEs announce that they'll be executing a hostage each day, until all Death Eaters are released from Azkaban. Ron is one of the hostages. Been a while since I read it, but I remember it being quite good.

The author has posted a toatal of 84 stories, most of which are Ron centric. Check them out if you want to. I haven't read most of them, but the few I read are pretty decent.

**** There aren't any pairings in this story (dunno about the sequel), and it's not a canon rehash. The author changed smaller things about Ron's character which changed some interactions, and things snowballed, leading to the first year taking a pretty different course.

***** No pairings in the sequal yet, either. The author had a fun poll to see who readers thought should be paired, but made it clear they won't necceasrily follow the most popular choices, that any pairings will happen far later in the story and that romance never will be the focus of it.

** If you can somehow find a copy (she removed all her 'fic from the web in 2008, but The Internet Never Forgets), Maya's /Flame and Shadow/ was wonderful. It's a Ron/Pansy post-Hogwarts oneshot.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10305062/1/Speed][Speed]] by Clell65619, great fic. Ron gets saved by the Flash, along with his innate magic, from a lightning strike, which turns Ron into another Flash.

Still a bit dim, still has moments of great stupidity, but he becomes a much truer hero than in cannon.

*** Ron has plenty good qualities. He's kind, brave, funny, loyal, a good strategist, and many other things. Just because he made bad choices sometimes and was overshafowed by Harry and Hermione most of the others it doesn't mean he lacks in good qualities

***** Yes, because he's human. Do the mistakes you make invalidate your good qualities? Of course not. Everyone has moments of wrong judgement, and yet because Ron isn't perfect and made a couple of mistakes, like any kid would (because this is a story about kids, you can't always expect them to make the best of choices) you say there's no merit to his character. I respectfully disagree.

******* Why not? There's HUGE POTENTIAL, and that's what makes a good protagonist. A good protagonists learns and changes and grows up, and Ron has shown that he can do all that, that he owns up to his mistakes, that he makes mistakes (that can drive a plot forward), that he has issues (that can be resolved in the plot for character growth) etc etc etc. A protagonist doesn't need to be perfect, he needs to be someone that can drive a plot forward, and Ron definitely can.

*** That's kind of disappointing. I had two ideas which really caught my interest:

- Harry dies early on in the Horcux hunt and Ron and Hermione have to find a way to destroy the Horcuxes

- Somewhere in 5th or 6th year, Ron realizes that Harry is going dark and tries to stop him from becoming the next LV.

**** I feel like both of these ideas when written in fic tend to be more about removing Harry as the main protagonist. In which case, it really doesn't make sense not to focus on Ron AND Hermione (a Horcrux hunt plot would naturally be driven more by Hermione than Ron, for instance), instead of just Ron himself, so it'll still feel like Trio-fic or maybe just Ron/Hermione shipping.

Also a good Ron voice is pretty difficult to pull off in general, IMHO.

**** Dunno man, Hermione would take over in the first one, and Harry would effectively still be the most important character in the second one.

There really is a good reason people don't write Ron fics, it's not an unexploited niche. Good luck anyway, maybe you can manage it.
