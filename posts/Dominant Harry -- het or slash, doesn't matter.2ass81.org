I've been reading a lot of Snape/Harry fanfiction where Harry is the more submissive partner. Now I'm in the mood for something different. Any pairing is ok with me, except for Snape/Harry. Since I've been reading so much slash, I am particularly interested in het, but I'll read both. The only requirements are that Harry is the more assertive and/or dominant partner, and please no Harem!Harry or otherwise polyamorous relationships. I would prefer mature content, but if you have non-explicit recommendations, have at it!

Thanks in advance, you lovely people.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8648528/1/Mirrored][Mirrored]] is a Harrymort one that comes to mind but it's a very odd dominance. [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewuser.php?uid=163][Meri]] writes a bit of top!Harry snarry. [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/HecatesKiss/pseuds/HecatesKiss][HecatesKiss]] writes a bit of dominant!Harry but her writing is both excellent and very mechanical if that makes sense. I have some more slash based ficts if you want more.

The former's more explicit. The latter's more explicit about the power balance in the bedroom (or, as it were, the captain's quarters). Both are Harry/Hermione.
