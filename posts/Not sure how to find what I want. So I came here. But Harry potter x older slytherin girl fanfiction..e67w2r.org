So I read a fanfiction awhile ago, where harry had to find a date for the yule ball and he ends up accepting invitations from a ton of girls. And then he gets confronted by a older or taller slytherin girl who asks him to the ball but more demands it I guess. And Snape shows up judging him.

POINT IS!, I'm looking for romance fanfictions regarding a young harry potter say like 4th year x a older slytherin girl, stronger, older, taller. Point is she must be older
