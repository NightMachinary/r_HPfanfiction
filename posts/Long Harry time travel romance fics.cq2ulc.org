** Linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down)

Linkao3(face death in the hope by LullabyKnell)

They're both mostly plotty and 'face death in the hope' doesn't even have much in the way of romantic undertone so far but they're very good.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  The fiasco at the Department of Mysteries had many consequences. One accident with a time-turner sent Harry to a faraway past. But who can really he rely on in this farce of home? And should he really trust Albus Dumbledore to have his best interests at heart?Harry was going to go back to his time. Back to 1996. He was going to go back to the Department of Mysteries. He was going to save his friends, and everybody in his time whose existence is being threatened.But how? At what price?And what will be left of him in the end?

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  “Tell me Harry, if I were to tell you that you could go back in time and prevent one event of your choice from ever occurring would you do so?”Go back in time? A chance to change the past for a better future? “If such were possible, Sir, I think it's safe to say most people would.”“Would you be an exception?” Harry shook his head. “What would you change?”His immediate knee jerk reaction was that he'd go back to that horrible night in Godrick's Hollow and prevent the murder of his parents, but when he opened his mouth to speak he stopped abruptly. The Head Master was staring at him from behind his half-moon glasses in a way that made him think that this question was in itself a sort of test. And with more examination the prospect seemed a bit selfish.At once Harry knew what he would do. “I would stop Tom Riddle from ever becoming Voldemort.”
