Looking for fics where Sirius and the Death Eaters that are freed from Azkaban are pretty much worthless. Depending on the character they spent from 10-20 years in Azkaban. They should be pretty much worthless and insane at this point. When I say insane i don't mean a functioning insane person. I mean an "are you my mommy" insane person.


** Sirius can't be fully insane though because he transformed into Padfoot and he knew that he was innocent. I'm looking for fics where he has a hard time functioning after Azkaban with depression, PTSD and the effect of the dementors. Trying to fit in after 12 years. Like damaged in his brain but not insane as in /insane/ insane.

*** Funnily enough I am currently working on a story with Sirius staying aboard for medical treatment during GoF while he has Andromeda take care of Harry.

******* Thanks. I'll start publishing when I get past the world cup (that will be at least 30k words in) but it takes time to establish the Tonks family.

I love Andromeda and I hope you flesh her out!

********* That was certainly my intention although Harry will be closer to Nymphadora since she'll be more of an adopted big sister and because Auror Academy has summer holidays but Andromeda (and Edward) have to work.

Andromeda will train Harry for the Triwizard Tournament since she can take time off more easily working for a private company and not the government but I really want to avoid the "hey let's become magical gods within the summer holidays by reading two books and practice five spells" trope and teaching a fourteen-year-old the curses she learned during her childhood as a Black does not seem very responsible.

I also want to avoid making the Tonks into substitute parents. Family that cares for each other yes, but Andi will not become Lily 2.0.

I /think/ I'm good at writing. My teachers say I am but I always have doubts. My problem is that I can't for the life of me come up with a good plot.

************* According to my teachers, I either completely sucked at English or aced the subject. My biggest issue is using commas correctly since my native language (German) uses them a lot more.

And if you want to write I can certainly give you some plot ideas for oneshots that I never wrote more than the outline of.

************** English isn't my native tongue, too! Teachers can be truthful, they can sugarcoat things or they're just completely jealous because you're better than them at their own subject.

Thank you for offering to give me your ideas but I don't want to write for fanfiction. I only want to write for myself and come up with plot. I'm also too lazy and procrastinate haaaaaard. Thanks anyway!

Again, good luck and thanks for the third time! =)

*** I'm kind of with you in this. It's the only aspect of the books which ever inspired me to write a fanfiction. But it's tricky when it comes to getting readers. It's car crash fiction really when you already know how badly it's going to end - though I definitely think it's worth exploring Sirius's state of mind at the time. But I think a lot of readers don't like to have that foreknowledge.

**** It is one of the aspects that led me to adore Sirius. He's my fav. I also love him for his flaws and not just strengths. Like, a member of the Black family had such amazing views on people at such a young age when he could've been Draco Malfoy. I admire him.

I've descended to the depths of fanfiction.net to find a story that explores Sirius's state of mind but I haven't found any yet. Any good ones after Azkaban when he isn't /whining/ to Remus or cracking a joke every second. Or being such a child. Ugh. Or always drunk or always on sugar high or always calling Harry pup or prongslet. Few fics do Sirius justice because he is truly an amazing, complex character.

Edit: or always /not/ have his face with stuffed with food and that's it or when he's completely stupid. He was described as very bright and he /was/ very bright.

** I could see some of them remaining somewhat sane. Sirius held on to the belief that he was innocent. It wasn't a happy thought so the dementors couldn't take it. It's possible that some of the prisoners knew Voldemort would come back and held onto that thought.

**** Not really - Voldemort might fight for their cause, but being his servant (they basically are cattle!) isn't all glorious either, so many of them would not be happy...hell, especially since they kind of let him down (getting captured - not to mention being unable to look for him and kind of lettling him get defeated in the first place!)

** My headcanon is that dementors exude dark magic, so so practitioners of the dark arts have some degree of resistance to their influence.

 

This also ties into the ministry being generally worthless, well.

"This person practiced dark arts, an addictive form of magic. To teach them a lesson, we'll send them to an island infested with dark creatures. That'll teach them a lesson, being bathed in dark magic for a year or two. Straighten them right out into law abiding, not-dark-arts-practicing citizens."

** Hm...in the HP world thinking oneself innocent (you don't really have to be IMHO, because the DEs were all guilty of assault, murder, terrorism...hell, you could say they should all be found guilty of treason and executed!) probably helps with that...I mean Sirius is pretty much innocent (you could at best accuse him of neglect because he put his revenge ahead taking care of Harry!) and he's perfectly sane (ok: As sane as before he was sent to Azkaban...not judging how sane Padfoot really was, he tried to kill a fellow student (Snape!) after all!) and the DEs aren't worse off it seems (and it's not like potions can't do freaking miracles! Re-growing a vanished bone in a night? Healing broken bones within hours? - Yeah, we don't have that kind of medicine, so who's to say there aren't potions to fix all the damage from Azkaban? The only thing left would be the mind, but the DEs thought their crimes were justified, so they don't feel guilty (!) and that will probably help, too!)
