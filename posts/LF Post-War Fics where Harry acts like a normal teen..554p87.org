Looking for something like that, read A Game of Style and Brutality and really liked that element of it.


** Well, canon Harry was not a normal teen to begin with, and after going through such traumatizing experiences, he would have matured decades beyond his years.

Your story has to be significantly AU and a Harry that is quite different from the canon version.

*** Then ignore the normal teen part, and just have him after Hogwarts whilst still a teen.

*** I don't know why you're being down voted, you're right about Harry having to grow up fast and never actually getting the chance to be a child/teen.

**** I mean...the request is for a specific kind of fanfic. Responding by saying that their request is AU is bit odd? It'd be the exact same as someone requesting a harry/fleur fic and the first response being about bill marrying fleu and the request is for an AU.

** This isn't post-war, but it's a pretty great teen-Harry learning to be self sufficient (summer job, etc) and the plot doesn't revolve around Voldemort/Hogwarts much. linkffn(1260679)

And I know what you mean, half of the post-war Harry fics read like a guy in his 20s. Defeating a dark lord doesn't automatically give you the knowledge of how to build a post-Hogwarts social life, or find an okay apartment, or set a budget, or figure out how to work under your first boss. There's a lot involved in becoming self sufficient, and most post-war fics skip over it.

It is difficult to get used to having to make an effort to see your friends instead of just walking to their dorm room after classes to hang out. Most college graduates go through that adjustment- socializing outside of an educational institution is very different from socializing at college/boarding school. Dinner parties versus hanging out in the school library, etc. Plus working is different from schoolwork. There's a lot of material to mine there, and the transition from being a fugitive to being a normal contributing member of society- all as a teenager- is a big one.

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help? Additional Story Notes FYI: a. AU Summer before Fifth Year Fic, b. Not particularly fast paced.
