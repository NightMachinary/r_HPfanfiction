Okay. So. HP is great, but, because of the way JK chose to write it, there are a few tiny inconsistencies. Philosopher's and Chamber are written in a style of a classic children's adventure story. Prisoner and Goblet are more 'high' drama, big betrayals, stunning reveals, etc. Bit more complicated. Then lastly, Order, Prince, and Hallows are very gritty and more realistic.

Unfortunately, this means that some stuff just sort of stops making sense.

I like to go back and listen to the books on tape every once in a while since it's been so long, and I was astounded by something which cropped up in OotP. Harry is arriving at Grimauld Place and asks Remus why he was at the Dursley's at all. Remus says it was to keep Harry safe. Harry reasonably points out that he /wasn't/ safe, as he was almost eaten by a dementor, and asks Remus why *specifically* Dumbledore thought the Dursley's was safer than a building under the fidelius, to which Remus replies with... awkward silence. Not even kidding here. He literally says /nothing/ in response to Harry's question.

Now some people might read way into this with things like 'Dumbledore was manipulating Harry; by limiting his access to information and ensuring his questions went unanswered he could make Harry angry and irrational so that when he swooped in all calm and collected to save the day Harry's blind loyalty would only increase.' I /understand/ this explanation, but canon Dumbles isn't evil. This then begs the question of why Remus didn't simply tell Harry 'Dumbledore did a trciky bit of magic to reinforce the protection your mother left you but it requires you spend a certain amount of time actually living at the Drusley's house each year; it isn't perfect but it makes their house a sort of last ditch hidey-hole against Volemort'. Boom. Issue resolved. Harry is probably left slightly grumpy, but mollified and willing to stay at the Dursley's without too much complaining.

I suppose what I'm looking for is a fic where canon is still held to be true, but where people react more logically to whats happening. For example: Hermione's suggestion (again in book 5) that they need to start taking their own well-being into their own hands should have arrived in book 3, at the latest; by that point they had all nearly died at the hands of Voldie /twice/ and now they were informed that a nutjob massmurderer had escaped and was trying to kill Harry. That seems like the sort of thing that would prompt, at the least, learning how to cast a permanent shield charm or /something/, maybe a simple alarm ward to inform you that the crazy murderer is stalking your bed. Something. Instead of just... keeping on like everything is normal. Harry asks for instruction on the Patronus even after being informed that it is likely to advanced for him, why doesn't he ask for more offensive or defensive magic?

Now, I know this sort of theme has been explored before, but I'm not looking for a super confident/op/godmode Harry here, rather I am looking for one that actually takes events seriously, as in 'If I am not a competent wizard /right now/ then my friends will be tortured and murdered and it will be my fault so I need to start hitting the books'. I don't expect him to be learning advanced magic in kindergarten, but some indication that he is cognizant of the severity of the situation /and is taking steps to address it/ would be much appreciated.


** You may want to read [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. It's set in a non-magical, sci-fi AU, the story is very well written, the characters are nicely developed, and the plot is excellent.

Riddle was a genius scientist bent on aristocratic totalitarianism. He inherited large amount of resources as Lord Gaunt and enjoyed great support in the Ministry. He also developed several technologies that gave him huge advantages over his enemies, such as cloning, memory capsules (horcruxes), energy rifle (killing and torture curses), and mind control discs (imperius curse).

Dumbledore was a brilliant, manipulative, and ruthless strategist who was despised by many Ministry bureaucrats and marginalized due to his sexual orientation (remember [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing][Alan Turin]]). He dumped Harry at the Dursleys so he would not enjoy a comfortable childhood and could become a far more ruthless adult. He groomed the Boy-Who-Lived myth so that Harry could get away with lots of things in the future. He also setup Hermione and Euterpe Spinks (an OC with excellent abilities and connections) to be in Harry's House.

Weasleys (Wellesleys) were not that poor and all-loving big family. In fact, Ron's grandpa was the Duke of Wellington, and his grandma was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Wellesley,_Duchess_of_Wellington][Diane Wellesley]], Duchess of Wellington and a British intelligence officer, who foiled a bombing of her own wedding in 1944. Her portrayal in this story was rather negative. The change in Weasleys' background had a significant impact on Ron/Hermione relationship.

There was no prophecy. The 007 of that time, James Potter, got his hands on crucial Riddle technologies and was hunted down as a result. Pettigrew's treason led Riddle to their hideouts, who were then outgunned by Riddle's energy rifle. James, however, obtained a serum that gave its user immunity against energy rifle. Lily injected this serum into Harry, turning him into a carrier for Riddle's memory capsule, and also caused the energy beam to reflect on Riddle himself. The severely injured Riddle escaped and had to spend the next 13 years in a tank.

The kids in this story were far more intelligent and ruthless, having been trained in spy business from day one. For example, when the tournament took place in Year 4, they took precaution, rescued Harry from a tight spot (although Harry himself contributed a great deal too), and left behind a significant body count. In Year 5, Hermione played Umbridge for fool, lured her into septic tank twice, and got the toad chucked out of Hogwarts half way through the school year. In year 6, they figured out what the deal was between Dumbledore and Snape (the old KGB 'shoot your own spy, gain enemy's trust' trick), and pretty much wiped out the Death Eater attack force. In year 7, they went on multiple ops, blew up one Riddle base after another, and finally lured him into a death trap while using Harry as the bait.

This fic has a total of 200 chapters, with only 58 devoted to first three years, but 97 to last two years. Year 7, which lasted in fact only 5 months, occupies a third of total chapters.

If you drop the requirement that HP fanfics must always involve magic, this is an excellent read.

** I'd like to point out that the last time Remus Lupin had experience with the fidelius charm it failed so spectacularly that he spent twelve years believing that everyone he loved was either a traitor or dead.

*** That's definitely a good point for why /Remus/ would want Harry's safety to not be reliant on the fidelius, but it still doesn't explain why he didn't say anything to Harry about the blood magic wards.
