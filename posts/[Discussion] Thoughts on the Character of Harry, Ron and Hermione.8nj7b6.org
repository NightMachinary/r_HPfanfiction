I have been giving a lot of thought to how to best characterize these three when you want to write a story with canon-like personalities (for my own consideration as well). These thoughts have been organized here, and I would be interested in what you all think, and if any stories you can think of fit with these characterizations.

The way I see it, the Harry, Ron and Hermione can be described roughly with the Myer-Briggs personality types:

HARRY-a combination of ESTP/INFJ (The Doer/The Protector). Harry lives in the moment, and rarely if ever plans out his actions (Doer). He is reactionary, quick-witted, and would rather deal with problems than discuss or debate them (HBP-Draco Malfoy situation). He rarely plans things out, but excels when he needs to improvise or react quickly, as he is in most of the situations he is thrust into (ex. his Patronus at the Lake, the fight in the Graveyard, most of the Battle of the Seven Potters, the Gringotts break-in). ESTP types are also not considerate of the rules when they hinder them, much like Harry (he is breaking curfew as a first-year).

However, he is determined to see things through to the end, and never lets go of his ideas of what is right (Protector). Even when he doubts Dumbledore, both in HBP and DH, he stays the course on what he needs to do. Dumbledore laid this out quite well in HBP, and Harry realized that even without fate playing yo-yo with his life, he would still see things through to the end. He has his own values that he holds dear, and holds to them despite everything telling him that they are a bad idea (read: not killing anyone in his way).

RON-fits neatly into the ESTJ type (The Guardian). He is very traditionally minded and interested more in the practical aspects of knowledge, rather than theory and analysis. He is very interested in competitions and games (chess, Quidditch, etc.) and seems to hold Harry's quidditch talents in the highest regard (and is likely the thing that makes him jealous more than anything else). Ron is loyal, despite what some believe. In the 4th book, Ron never stopped being loyal to Harry: he never believed Harry put his name in the Goblet, he just could not get over the fact that he did not stand out in any way (and possibly was unhappy that Quidditch would not be held so he could try out as keeper too). And during the 7th book, he was wearing a pendant specifically designed to turn the wearer into a meat-puppet, and resented that he could not really offer anything to help the situation either. In short, he does not resent Harry, he resents the fact that he cannot live up to his dreams and protect his friends. He is so loyal that he hates himself for being unable to do more.

I actually think Ron gets a bad rep. He is mostly an average to slightly-above average caliber person working amidst exceptional or infamous people. He cannot really match any of them, or rather he was rarely put into situations where his talents could really shine through (ex. the Shrieking Shack showdown in PoA).

HERMIONE-a classic INTJ type (The Scientist). Hermione values knowledge, structure and planning. When she is in school, where everything is ordered and linear (relatively), she thrives. She is always stopping Harry and Ron, not from acting, but to plan out what happens even if they rarely ever work. Remember this quote in the Deathly Hallows Part II:

"We have to go there, now." "What? We can't do that! We've got to plan! We've got to figure it out..." "Hermione! When have any of our plans ever actually worked? We plan, we get there, all hell breaks loose!"

Hermione is rigid and control-oriented, a planner if you will. She respects knowledge and understanding, but has little regard for things like instinct and "gut-feeling." Normally, this makes her incredibly competent and well above her peers. But when things go sideways, she becomes flustered and somewhat-panicky. In this regard, she is the exact opposite of Harry, who takes things as they come and is more open to possibilities beyond the norm. Unlike Ron, she never truly wavers in her support of Harry. But she is logic oriented, so why would she? Everything she knows about Harry suggests he would never want the fame of the Triwizard Tournament, and she knows roughly how talented he is (not enough to pull that off). She cannot come up with a reason, so she believes him. Likewise, she believes him about Voldemort's resurrection, because she has an immense amount of evidence to back it up (all of Harry's misadventures beforehand, dead Cedric, the Ministry did not question Harry at all or try to prove him wrong). She seems like she wavered more than anywhere else during the Horcrux hunt, because as Ron said "We thought you had some plan."

Anyway, please give me your thoughts and possibly recommendations for fics that showcase similar characterizations.


** I have to point out that characterisation in canon is not consistent. The characters often act out of character for plot reasons. One of the best examples is that Hermione and especially Ron suddenly dismiss Malfoy's plotting in book 6, after years of knowing better. That's blatantly plot railroading, so Malfoy gets away with his plotting, and runs counter to both their characterisation. Or the many, many cases of Dumbledore not acting as a wizard of his power and experience should, so kids can be the heroes.

I generally don't consider HPB and DH, and parts of OotP, when characterising the trio.

** I believe that Ron's loyalty should largely be unquestioned. His two fallouts in books 4 and 7, were results of arguments with Harry. Correct me if I'm wrong (haven't read the books in over a year), but Ron initially said nothing, and then Harry came to confront him. Ron even came to check up on Harry when he was out of bed talking to Sirus. Harry exploded on him again, even resulting to throwing things at him (I think). Ron never wore the ‘Potter Stinks' badges. And in the end, only Ron apologized, when clearly Harry had his stake in the breakup. In book 7, Ron was upset because they didn't have a plan. Dumbledore kept too many cards to his chest and died before he could share with Harry. As a result, they went months or weeks (?) with no leads at all. Ron exploded about that, and they fell into another argument. In the end, Harry yelled at him to leave, and he did. He even wanted to come back soon after, but couldn't due to snatchers.

P.S. I think Ron is easily above average and right up there with Harry and Hermione. He has a quick draw (quicker than Hermione's), can stun a death eater on a broom stick (said to be good by Tonks, an auror) and even was the first to break the silencing spell against Voldemort, and escaped multiple snatchers on his own.

If anything, I'd say that it is Harry who acted worse during their fight. Ron is clearly trying to be happy for Harry. But when Ron repeats Harry's own words back to him, Harry implies that Ron is stupid. It is only after Harry reacts less than positively that Ron gives up trying to actively support his friend. even when they are not talking, Ron is very concerned about Harry. When Harry breaks the conversation off with Sirius, it is Harry who overreacts: he decides he hates everything about Ron, throws a badge at his head and doesn't apologize for it, starts shouting at him, and storms upstairs to the dormitory. Ron just stands there and takes it.

I think it's the thing Ron wants in life simply falling into Harry's lap. Fame, fortune, glory. Ron is a keeper and has no reason to be jealous of any seeker beside Krum, who he was envious of because of his fame seemingly making him a better catch for Hermione, since Ron, like most pure-bloods, values status. I also think Ron is an ESFP/ENFP.

You're underestimating my boy. Ron was incredible, but he lacked the motivation to put forth effort. The boy went on to NEWT level in six subjects, yet being Ron, he probably didn't even study. Ron is the epitome of wasted potential. He's shown several times to be a remarkable wizard, but never saw the value in trying due to thinking he'd constantly be in someone else's shadow.

** Overall, this is pretty spot on, but a couple of errors:

#+begin_quote
  Ron is loyal, despite what some believe. In the 4th book, Ron never stopped being loyal to Harry: he never believed Harry put his name in the Goblet, he just could not get over the fact that he did not stand out in any way
#+end_quote

Ron may not have believed Harry really put his name in (its ambiguous, even Hermione couldn't so for certain), but he was not being loyal when he abandoned his friend who was being put into another life threatening situation against his will. Hermione believed it was jealously. You are right to say it was rooted in her feelings of inadequacy though, but I don't think he gets a special pass with the Locket. Harry dealt with its effects and the pain it induced in his scar as well. It's understandable, but you can't ignore it to safeguard the idea that Ron is unwaveringly loyal.

The bit about Hermione trusting Harry because she is very logic oriented isn't quite right. Her and Harry's mutual trust isn't based on logic per se, just loyalty forged through life risking scenarios, their personal dispositions and their history's (neither had friends before Hogwarts). Hermione says the next morning after his name came out the goblet that she knew Harry hadn't put his name in because he was too shocked by it. Same with the Voldemort resurrection, she starts (in general) assuming Harry is being truthful because he's not the type to lie to friends. She doesn't look for evidence to the contrary first, she accepts it and plans accordingly. Unless it's something Harry isn't reliable on; some criticize her for not immediately accepting Malfoy's suspicious behavior, but it's not totally unreasonable. Harry despises Draco and they had already made the mistake in thinking Draco was the villain in Chamber of Secrets.

Overall, this is mostly right though.

*** I disagree about your assessment of Ron. I don't believe that neither Harry or Ron truly understood the severity of the tournament until it was too late. I also wouldn't have used the term ‘abandoned'. Ron was too quick to conclude the worst, and Harry unloaded on him before really got a chance to sort out his feelings. Ron didn't really voice that he thought Harry did anything. He did the ole silent treatment and Harry let him have it for it. Ron even still looked out for Harry, looking for him when he was out of bed. He unknowingly ended a conversation between Harry and Sirius. Harry yelled at him again, knowing that Ron did not do it on purpose and even resulted to throwing things at him ( I think). Abandonment implies that one person is solely responsible, when this is not the case. Even in year 7, Harry had screamed at him to leave. Hermione never really had this problem with Harry. I think that this is because Harry looks at Hermione like a sister, the motherly kind. The one that tells him to do his homework and wash behind his ears. So, Harry never took any of her ‘nagging' too personally.

Except, unless I'm much mistaken, Hermione had already said the tournament had a history of causing deaths, which is why it had stopped occurring. And Ron was overwhelming at fault there, Harry had his possible death hanging over his head again so he gets a bit of leeway for snapping.

***** “I might go in for it, you know,” Ron said sleepily through the darkness, “if Fred and George find out how to . . . the tournament . . . you never know, do you?”

“S'pose not. . . .”

Harry rolled over in bed, a series of dazzling new pictures forming in his mind's eye. . . . He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was seventeen . . . he had become Hogwarts champion . . . he was standing on the grounds, his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were applauding and screaming . . . he had just won the Triwizard Tournament. . . . Cho's face stood out particularly clearly in the blurred crowd, her face glowing with admiration. . . .

Harry grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad that Ron couldn't see what he could. ( GOB page 192)

Dumbledore had explained the tournament and why it stopped happening the same day as this quote. Harry and Ron are just a little loose in the head. I do agree with you that the fault largely lies with Ron. I just wanted to express that it didn't SOLELY lie with him. I also agree that Harry deserves some leeway. But at the same time, Ron and Hermione gave (Physical and Emotional support) to Harry immensely more than Harry ever gave to them.

****** If you read before that passage on page 190, Hermione had already pointed out entering it meant facing likely lethal tasks:

#+begin_quote
  “People have died, though!” said Hermione in a worried voice as they walked through a door concealed behind a tapestry and started up another, narrower staircase.

  “Yeah,” said Fred airily, “but that was years ago, wasn't it? Any- way, where's the fun without a bit of risk? Hey, Ron, what if we find out how to get 'round Dumbledore? Fancy entering?” “What d'you reckon?” Ron asked Harry. “Be cool to enter, wouldn't it? But I s'pose they might want someone older. . . . Dunno if we've learned enough. . . .”
#+end_quote

Harry even later says that his "desire" to enter "was a joke, really... an idle sort of dream." Even from what I quoted, he wasn't interested in it for the reasons the other are (glory and rule breaking), he just briefly thought of winning Cho over.

And I didn't say Ron offered nothing (Hermione's contributions were arguably the most, so I don't take issue with her), just that in a time he especially needed Ron, he ditched him for weeks (or was it months?) over almost nothing. I just think GoF and DH decrease just how loyal we can say Ron was. As for Harry, eh, it's again a bit asymmetrical. Since the story is from his perspective and features him personally in most of the life threatening situations, expecting more from him seems almost unfair.

******* Hermione is just reiterating what Dumbledore said about a page before. To your point, I had thought Harry and Ron had given the tournament more thought than what was really in text. Harry was more occupied with Sirius. Ron was dealing with his father's negative press and Crouch-Moody. Neither one made any real attempts at getting in, so....yeah. But, I don't think that totally negates my first point about them taking the tournament too lightly. At the point of my quote, it's just a way for glory and Cho. He does want glory at least a little bit (his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were applauding and screaming)

It becomes real to him when his name comes out of the goblet. However for Ron, it does not hit him until Harry's life is in danger with the dragons.

I wasn't accusing you of thinking Ron offered anything. I personally don't think that Hermione's contributions are even arguable. She is flat out the most important of the three. Harry and Ron kind of toss the idiot ball around, while Hermione is off to the side with a book looking at them disapprovingly. Again, I wouldn't use the word ‘ditched'. In both instances ( book 4 and 7), Harry pushed Ron away. I'm not trying to absolve Ron, but Harry has his share of the blame. If both are to blame, can one be more loyal than the other? Harry is an orphan, who was abused by the Dursleys, and then got his life threatened every year of Hogwarts. So, he deserves a break. But lesser people than Hermione and Ron would have long stopped associating with him. And this is something that Harry doesn't really stop to appreciate enough if at all.

******** Some good points. But the examples I mentioned just seem to be ditching, and in book 4 Ron broke off entirely on his own. Both are bad in their own ways. His departure in DH is at least understandable (Horcrux family in danger, deep feelings of inadequacy being around Harry and Hermione and his siblings). But in GoF is was just jealously (okay, I'm probably belaboring this point). He already knew it was lethal. I know they took it lightly before, but that's because they weren't entering.

To be honest, I probably wouldn't let this annoy me so much if JKR hadn't had Ron have a repeat in DH. It was just a terrible time and made the other rushed elements worse ("Hey, now I totally think house elves should be free." /kiss/). If anything should have happened (as I think JKR admitted), Arthur should have died in OoTP and that should have been the impetus for Ron's final development. That would make him better able to function as his role as the heart of the group, and makes him able to relate to Harry more and would cleanly clear up jealousy issues (i.e. "Do I really want to be so jealous of a bloke who has no worthwhile loving relatives and who is always in danger?"). But alas...

********* I agree with your points on how JKR treats Ron's arcs. My guess is that she really wanted to bring home how vital he is to the trio. Which she had largely ignored or minimized post book 4. So now, she has to find some way to make this known in a note able way. I thought Ron really shined in book 7, more than any other because of this. So now, Ron is gone and Harry and Hermione are as useful as chopped liver and then Ron comes back saves Harry, takes out the Horcrux and the show is back on the road. But most people can't get over the fact that he left to begin with. She could of had him kidnapped, mind controlled by a death eater, anything really. But having him leave under equal conditions (outside of his family being in danger) to Harry and Hermione only makes him look weak( I don't think this, but it's not an uncommon opinion). So even with all the good things he did, that was his biggest moment, and it's not a Kodak moment.

I agree with Arthur's death pushing Ron and Harry to an extent even.

*** To be clear, I do not say Ron gets a pass. What I meant was that its his personality. He defines himself by who he aligns with (his family, his friends, his house, etc.). Ron's problem seems to be a massive inferiority complex.

As for Hermione, logic is not quite the right word. I would say she is structurally oriented. She sees things within the lens of evidence and facts. On the one hand she sides with him in the the 4th book, partly out of personal trust but also because she cannot see how or why he would do it and the authority figures believe him. In the 3rd book, Hermione goes to McGonagall about the broom, despite knowing what Harry would have wanted. She did the RIGHT thing, and made the rational choice, but others perceived her actions as betrayal. Even though she did it to keep him safe and unharmed. Loyalty and betrayal, are to put it bluntly, often in the eye of the beholder. She tries to stop Harry from going to the Ministry, but when he refuses to relent she concedes against her own misgivings. Her conflict is with her idea of authority: go to the teachers or find a book for help. She trusts authority, and she is most conflicted when Harry or Ron, or other people, are flaunting these figures.

**** On the Hermione bit. I don't think in the case of Book 4 that she even mentioned authority figures at all. With the exception of Dumbledore, Hermione couldn't see any authority's reaction (save for shock). She says the morning after that "Of course I knew it wasn't you" because Harry was so surprised by it. Like, I think outside of book 1, her deference to authority is a little overstated by some people. I mean, she goes along with a lot of rule breaking. :)

***** True. But she sees Harry afterwards and he seemingly is not being punished. Like with the Ministry, this would suggest that since there is no punishment they don't believe he committed the crime. And as for authority figures, literally in the same conversation she tells him to write to Sirius for help. And I don't mean authority in a literal sense, but in more of "this person knows what there talking about and deserves to be obeyed" sort of manner.

Hermione, to me at least, has the most potential to develop differently out of the three. She somewhat naively starts out seeing the facts and knowledge and the statements of people in positions of power as almost sacrosanct. She breaks the rules reluctantly, but often its when the resident people she would turn to ignore them or refuse to listen (looking at you McGonagall). In the 4th book, and particularly in the 5th book, her trust in sources of authority like the Ministry and the Daily Prophet are eroded by flagrant mismanagement, ineptitude, or outright lying. She begins to question rules and people in power.

Once she does this, there is a distinct uptick in how vindictive and frankly hostile she can become. I have seen similar situations occur with people who have there long held beliefs shattered. She never fully goes through with the complete disintegration of her worldview, but as time passes more insidious or rebellious behavior seems to be acceptable to her. One could consider a downward spiral: if one person in power is lying/untrustworthy/malicious, how many others can be? I suspect its why she still grants Snape or Binns respect when everyone seems to agree they are not particularly good teachers.

On that note, I would love to see an Hermione-based story that explores this sort of shattering of her belief system. You could make an excellent story out of that, with Harry, now an older adult, has to take on and defeat the Dark Lady Hermione Granger. Thats a kickass story.

*** Loyalty according to Ron lovers:

- talking shit behind your friends back

- abandoning them during a deadly tournament

- constantly despising and envying them for their popularity and them stealing the limelight

- abandoning them again during most desperate of times, because you're hungry

I've come to the conclusion that discussing loyalty with people who love Ron is like trying to explain evolution to creationists. "You keep using that word, I don't think it means what you think it means"

**** Fair enough. Ron seems to suffer from something common in large families: an inferiority complex. Whatever he has, its never enough. That his big problem, and honestly it seems to be the real problem with Ron that is rarely portrayed accurately.

To be clear, I am NOT excusing his actions. What I was trying to point out is that its part of his personality to trust somewhat blindly. This is in conflict with his sense of pride (deserved or otherwise) and his sense that he can never live up to "insert-name-here."

Speaking from personal experience, I have had someone I considered my best friend turn against me on some poor excuse, and broke off our friendship. I accepted it, and I did not hate them for it, because I knew he was going through VERY difficult personal times (involving abuse among other things). Three years later, when I was in town, he wrote a long letter to me that apologized in great detail. He wanted to meet up to apologize in person but was afraid I would hate him or spurn him. But I didn't, and I met up with him in person, and we have remained friends since. I knew my friend had an inferiority complex, and he got nothing from apologizing to me and trying to make amends. But he cared enough about our history and friendship in the past that he still wanted to try again.

Loyalty is a catch all word. That's true. But frankly, everyone has a breaking point in terms of what they can take. And more to the point, its easy to judge someone in a clinical manner and say "they betrayed them and should burn for it" when you are on the outside. Ron and Hermione deserve the utmost respect for siding with Harry against everything and almost everyone, considering almost every bad thing that happens to them is related to there friendship with Harry.

Sure! But that's exactly where loyalty is shown. It is easy to be "loyal" when you want to take that course of action anyway (be it out of self preservation, convenience aka not rocking the boat or because there's other potential gains) or when it is no hardship to you. You can only show loyalty when it is actually a hardship and if at that point other considerations are a priority you aren't really all that loyal.

And of course loyalty isn't some kind of all or nothing deal. In fiction often loyalty is tested when someone's life is on the line, which some might consider to be an idealistic standard, but on the other hand there's people who risk their lives for complete strangers. Maybe it isn't such a tall order for a close friend or family member?

Signs of dis-loyalty are things like abandoning friends for petty reasons (like social standing and being slightly uncomfortable).

In case of Hermione I agree.

For Ron though that's complete bullshit. He's involved either way: He's from a family of blood-traitors who are members of Dumbledore's Order. Whether he is friends with Harry or not is completely irrelevant to him having to fight Voldemort (unless he's willing to betray his entire family and run away to Australia). The Horcrux Hunt is probably an enjoyable vacation in comparison to what would have happened to him and his big mouth at Hogwarts when facing the Carrows. Being friends with Harry is extremely beneficial to him and may raise his chances of survival. There's no way for him to just lay back and stay out of the fight - not to mention that his nature wouldn't allow him to do that anyway.

Hermione has no stake in this fight, she could just take her parents and run.

****** Thanks for taking my post seriously.

Before I say anything else, I would point out that I do not disagree with the idea that Ron betrayed Harry (though betrayal is like loyalty in that what counts differs from person to person). My point was never that he did not waver, but that he defines himself by who he aligns with. Thats the meaning of the word loyalty, who you side with or believe. And while he definitely wavers, its worth pointing out that:

1) Ron does not actively go around championing that Harry is a cheater/liar during the 4th book, instead not talking to him and/or ignoring him. Every scene during there fight indicates he wants to reconcile, but is too proud or scared to apologize (possibly both).

2) When Ron leaves in DH, he immediately realizes his screw up and tries to go back. But he can't. He is so ashamed of his disloyalty to his friends that he hides and mopes about it. He breaks for a moment (when combined with an insanely dark object with mind-manipulation abilities), and he mopes and dwells on it for months. He comes back because of his loyalty, even though by all rights he could be completely rejected. Its how he sees himself, and failing to live up to it is where he is the most embarrassed.

Case in point, when explaining the Deluminator to Harry, he states about Dumbledore:

"[Dumbledore] knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn't he? He -- well," Ron's ears turned bright red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he prodded with his toe, "he must've known I'd run out on you." "No," Harry corrected him. "He must've always known you'd always want to come back." (DH, Ch. 20)

And I am not sure you understand the circumstances around Hermione and Ron. She is a muggle-born, and more importantly she is an idealist with regards to rights and status of different groups (not disagreeing with her, but she does not approach the issues pragmatically, which is oddly OOC). Her statement to Griphook in Deathly Hallows is a testament to this, eventually she will be hunted down in some manner, however long that takes. Ron, conversely, is a pureblood. While his family are labeled blood-traitors, the Death Eaters do not immediately liquidate all their opponents once they take over the Ministry and have near unlimited power in Britain. Much like the Nazis or the Imperial Japanese Army, they operated based on ideology and not sound tactical thinking, and it cost them in the end. Since they did not immediately wipeout the Weasley family or seriously interrogate them, its clear the Death Eaters care more about preserving blood than long term stability. Ron could easily claim Harry betrayed him or mind wiped him, and he has seen the error of his ways. They may not believe him, but another hostage at Hogwarts would probably be pretty hard to ignore.

Besides which, the poison wine in HBP, the chess match results in SS, and the acromantula adventure in CoS suggest Ron is put in more danger because of his friendship, not less. In the end, he and Hermione came out as famous because of their role in the war, but they had no idea how any of that would turn out in the end.

When did he do this? As a matter of fact, it was made a point that he wasn't, which is why he never wore the "Potter Stinks" badges.

Not talking to someone is somehow because you're arguing is somehow abandoning them?

He doesn't despise Harry. He despises that the very things he wants out of life fall right into his lap. Never once has he said anything bad about Harry.

#+begin_quote
  abandoning them again during most desperate of times, because you're hungry

More like because his family is in danger because of him choosing to be a good friend while he sits in a tent all day, trying to find a needle in a haystack all the while starving and being manipulated by a piece of Voldemort's soul.

Abandoning is deluding oneself that their best friend entered a life threatening tournament for glory, despite knowing that friend hates his own fame and doesn't like almost being killed annually. It was stated to be jealousy (which was kind of obvious regardless).

I think claiming Harry is "getting ready for his press briefings" before being forced into a deadly tournament is a pretty bad aspersion to cast. I don't think Ron is an awful person, but he's not some ever-loyal friend everytime it counts (e.g. when most of the school turns on you.) And besides which, I don't think it's wrong to be upset at some thngs, but for christ's sake Harry's wealth comes from a family he'll never know and his fame is a constant reminder of what he could never get back. I'm fine with Ron's reactions provided he has to face real consequences, but he never did.

This applied to everyone in the tent. Also, the Weasleys were in danger no matter if he went on the hunt or not. This is not only obvious (since the Weasleys are well known blood traitors and friends of Dumbledore) but the Ministry believed him to be sick with spattergroit at home anyway. His actions in DH are at least more understandable than in GoF, but it was another time where he messes up and we don't actually see him grow from it.
