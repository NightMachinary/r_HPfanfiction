Hello everyone! In November, I discovered the world of HPfanfiction, and ever since then, I've been reading H/Hr fics like a madman. ( Honestly, Jo, WHY RON???) After having ruled out /The Marauder's Plan/ , and /Vox Corporis/, I set my sight on the Paradigm of Uncertainty, and GOD was it hard to find it. Now, I got to know that PoU is the first part of a trilogy; however, to me, it seems nearly impossible to get my hands on a copy of the sequel, notamment " *The Show that never ends* " . I became so desperate, that I fought my insecurities, and came to reddit, asking for help. I'd be immensely grateful if anyone could show me a possibility to read /The Show that never ends/ .

Thank you in advance!


** I'm not familiar enough with it to know if this is the right story, but there's one matching that name on Wattpad: [[https://www.wattpad.com/838753855-the-show-that-never-ends-chapter-1-eyes-without-a]]
