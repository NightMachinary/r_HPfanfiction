** More funny than anything else. Not for the easily offended.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] - The best thing about this fic is a potty-mouth Sorting Hat that acts as Harry James sidekick.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force][The Havoc Side of the Force]] - The greatest Star Wars/ Harry Potter crossover(IMO). Features a sociopathic droid known as HK-47.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] - The leaps in logic that HarryMort makes crack me up. 100% crack.

** Maybe it's just me, but I found the dialogues in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6849022/1/An-Old-and-New-World][An Old and New World]] really funny. It's a crackfic with an arrogant and badass Harry.

** [[http://www.fanfiction-junkies.de/efiction/viewstory.php?sid=2377&warning=1][Practical Solutions]] by Aurette has some great dialogue, and even though most of the HGSS pairing stories make me cringe, this one is just wonderful.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11088406/1/Tea-and-Empathy][Tea and Empathy]] is a conversation between Remus and Sirius that takes place at the end of GOF.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11093597/1/Obligation-is-a-Pain][Obligation is Pain]] has some great dialogue between Harry and Snape's ghost.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/392764/chapters/645041][The Pure and Simple Truth]] has a lot of great dialogue/banter between several characters. The story is pre-slash H/D, and I know that isn't everyone's cup of tea but at least give it a chance, because the conversations and the characterization in this story is incredibly well done.

** Damn, this is gonna be difficult. For some reason, when I think of dialogue in ff, I think more about monologues. Actually back and forth dialogues are rare probably since when there is an argument/debate, it's a strawman opposition to promote a specific ideal (one common criticism of MoR).

Alexandra Quick has good dialogue since the MC's actions do have serious consequences, and her justifications, though morally right, are called out as "the ends justify the means".

** There's some great banter in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9121877/1/Midnight-Blues][Midnight Blues]] between Harry and Hermione in the latest chapter. I'd guess there's a lot more, but I haven't re read it recently.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10932567/1/][Holly Polter]] by wordhammer

Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Holly/Harry/we're not sure what'll happen. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in subject to entanglement).

** Detained by se1ge/ceejay - a brilliant but tragically incomplete Marcus/Katie fic. Their witty banter and clever insults are highly entertaining, and their characters very well-written. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5109606/1/Detained]]
