:END:
Like the title says Harry teaches people parseltongue to people in his first year I think and it pisses Voldemort off. Pretty sure it's a time travel fic. If any one could give me the name of that fic I would appreciate it.


** Does he teach them a spell that's allows anyone to speak it or does he actually teach it. I've read one of the former. I'll look for it. It's midnight right now so I'll look for it when I wake up.

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder.

#+begin_quote
  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...
