  In 1943, Tom Riddle's mentor disappears, only for her to reappear in 1996. For Abigail, little time has passed and her Tom is gone, but a new Tom is on the rise. Harry Potter could so easily be her Tom, with just a small push. Abigail knows the only way to find her again Tom is with this Harry child. Nothing, and no one, will stop her from reaching Tom, not this time. Tom Riddle/Original Character. Warnings: Manipulative!Evil!Dumbledore, Sheep!Order, Darker!Harry, Ron and Hermione bashing, Parkinson bashing Possibly eventual slash?, somewhat sane/reasonable Voldemort, Sane!Tom Riddle, and Draco being less of a prat.

  Second in the Black Queen series. Last year, Jen had to contend with a deadly Tournament, a revived Dark Lord, a meddlesome Headmaster, and worst of all, reconciliation attempts by her parents. Surely her OWL year can't be anywhere near as complicated. Can it? fem!bisexual!Harry/Luna (it's happening this time, I promise!), powerful!dark!Jen, NOT for children!

  If, by chance, someone were to ask about her birth Apollymi would be forced to answer their question with another question. She would counter with a simple if not rehearsed: which birth exactly, did you mean? SI OC-Insert/Tom Riddle Grey!SI. Metamorphmagus!SI-OC

  "The living shudder and the World stills, as the Black Ascension draws near... The One with the Power to Resurrect the Dark Lord will be born as the Seventh Month dies..." Dark AU. The memories of Tom Riddle leak into seven-year-old Harry's mind; thus begins the Black Ascendance of the Dark Lord's Right Hand.
