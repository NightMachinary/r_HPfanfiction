Recently went through some of the threads on here talking about crossover fics and found linkffn(12221534).

It isn't some work of genius but it isn't that bad either, minus the need of running over it grammarly (a lot of mistakes where you can tell the author blanked out and typed the wrong word completely).

I enjoyed it for the most part (after the first 4-5 chapters) and will probably continue to read it as it's updated. However, there were certain parts of the fic that I really enjoyed, making me want to find more like it.

The first element was the older-brother type relationship Percy had with Harry. I thought the dynamic between the two was interesting and it's kind of nice seeing a friendly advice-giving relationship like that.

The second element was the laidback and nonchalance of Percy, always enjoy reading a fic that isn't dramatic.

The third element was that it wasn't afraid to shy away from adult themes, adding some extra realism to the characters which is sorely missing in a lot of fics I read.

I don't need something with all of these but if you recall any fics that have one of these elements then feel free to link it. Thanks.

  There was no way Lily Potter would let her son anywhere near her sister, so she told Dumbledore about her cousin in America. After Halloween 1981, the Fentons gain another son. Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter or Danny Phantom and related media.
