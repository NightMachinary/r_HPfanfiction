So, I don't remember much about this, and there's a good chance it was written by Salazar's Princess (who has since deleted all of their works) but the crux of the story was a potions trip for rare, exotic ingredients. At some point, they went to a river or an ocean and had a fun little jaunt as merpeople? But I think the whole story started with a love potion gone wrong, as most of my favorite fics when I was 14 or so did.
