Harry could see that he was in a badly cell with bars. He felt naked but looking down at himself he noticed that his body was covered in a black cloth-like substance. Shadowcloth he reasoned. He remembered reading about strings of nothing spun on a Night Loom. He also remembered reading that a Night Loom can only be touched by one with sight but has never seen a single ray from the sun.
