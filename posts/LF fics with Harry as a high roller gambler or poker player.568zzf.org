  Nine years after Harry Potter disappears from the Wizarding World, Hermione thinks she found a clue to his location. She travels halfway around the world, but is unprepared for what she finds. Story has been abandoned for a long time, but officially as of 9/22/2016. Rated M for language

** A lot of responses to Bloody Brand(y?)'s Vegas Challenge feature Harry winning big at the casinos the night before the story starts. Most of them are short and kinda lame though. linkao3(Harry Potter and the Golden Ring) was pretty good imo though.

  This is in response to Storylover213's Bloody Brandy's Vegas Vacation Challenge (from Fanfiction.net). Harry and Lupin take a trip to Vegas. Things then take a turn for the strange. He hits it big, then hits the booze hard, then hits his comped hotel room with his new wife in tow. This is Harry Potter done the DC way...sort of. Rated M for sexual situations, language and violence.
