Its kinda like the ship of theseus, if you take out all the parts and replace it with new ones, is it still the same ship? I am truly curious if anyone has a similar experience. Will your enjoyment of a fic be marred if there is too many differences in terms of lore or is it because too many characters seem to have completely different personalities from their canon counterpart? I just thought of this out of the blue an I am simply curious as to what other fans might think. Maybe this is a unique experience or maybe others have felt this before. Who knows? I truly do want to know what you guys think.


** Personally I don't care about canon compliance at all. If a fic is well written with an engaging plot, then I will enjoy it regardless of how little it resembles canon.

**** I'm sorry but I don't think I would enjoy a story were Albus Dumbleodre and Severus Snape are teaching balette or some other dances. And what psychological horror is there gonna be? It will probably not be better than the horror I could read in some published contemporary Horror novel. I read Harry Potter fanfictions because of the general world (Magic with Wands, Hogwarts, The Ministry) and the characters. One of those things seem to be completely butchered in your example.

***** Trust me, I was just as put off by the 'dance school' idea until I eventually tried reading it. The horror is similar in tone and themes to /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan_(film)][Black Swan]]/ but tied into the plot and characters of the Harry Potter series. Instead of '/Swan Lake/' the characters are rehearsing for a world renowned ballet titled 'A Prophecy', and more people than just the main character seem to lose their grasp on reality as the story develops.

** I have no objection to reading all sorts of different versions of the HP universe. However I do get distracted by things happening in Muggle Britain that wouldn't really happen. Harry finding a snake in the garden, for example. We don't live in a tropical climate, and there are only a few species of snake native to Britain, none of which generally live in suburbia. :-) People do keep pet snakes, so if it was explained away as an escaped pet then fair enough. In terms of Harry versions, I tend to turn off from stories where he's either super powerful or willing to commit crimes galore - this just feels too far from the 'correct' Harry.

** I'm fine with the universe and events being altered however the author wants, but characters have to be at least recognizably themselves. I recall one fic which had Harry written as stein from soul eater, but wasn't even labeled as a crossover. I found it unreadable.

** Generally, so long as the plot doesn't mean that characters are dropping the idiot ball or forgetting their internal logic patterns more than canon (eg. tying up a man they know can get smaller by turning into a rat whenever he likes) and actually explains its changes (eg. redemption for Snape/Draco to make them grow into no-longer-reprehensible-bitter/arrogant-Magical-Nazis) then I'm fine with whatever.

Basically, if there's an explanation and it's not too full of people buggering up and making overly unthinking mistakes, then I'll likely be okay with something. So long as it's then interesting or fun to read, I'll probably enjoy it.

For instance, one of my favourite fics is basically absolutely not Harry Potter in any way beyond the names of people and the things they shout at one another while waving wands - Wastelands of Time by Joe - and it has basically no resemblance to the original series whatsoever, but it explains the changes quite well throughout its plot (side note - Some people have reviewed that some of the twists and turns aren't easy to keep up with, so anyone reading this that then goes to read Wastelands, be warned in advance). Equally, a fic I can't remember the name of has Harry basically becoming a Pureblood Bigot with no explanation or growth or change whatsoever. It's the clap-on, clap-off of casual racism. If there'd been growth towards racism (eg. Him developing those feelings of hatred towards the Dursleys and then a Bigot playing off of that to bring him into the fold), it could've been something I'd enjoy.

** As far as Canon Compliancy, I nope out of any "Non Magic AU" or "Squib Harry" fics. "You're a Wizard, Harry" is the point of Hary Potter. I can accept canon being thrown out of the window in some cases, but taking away Magic removes the point of writing a Harry Potter Fanfic.

** In a word, yes.

The way I look at it, fanfic is to canon as canon is to real life.

In "original" fiction like the HP novels, realism and verisimilitude are evaluated relative to real life. In [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/earthfic.shtml]["earthfic"]] in particular, we expect the story to be something that /actually could happen/ in reality as we know it. In sci-fi or fantasy, we expect internal consistency, and for the elements that could not be found in reality as we know it (such as magic wands) to be justified---to contribute to the story. For those elements that aren't explicitly magical, we sill expect realism relative to real life: for example, we expect wizards to act like people.

Now, in fanfic, realism and verisimilitude are evaluated /relative to canon/. Therefore, deviations from canon setting and characters are analogous to "unrealistic" elements in "original" fiction: they need to be justified, either in that they contribute the story or in that they are necessary for internal consistency with deviations that do.

Another way to look at it is that a story has a Suspension of Disbelief Budget, and every inconsistency---internal or external---spends from that budget. In "original" fiction, external consistency is relative to real life, but in fanfic, it's relative to the canon. (If one change logically implies others, there is no double-spending, however.) The bigger the SoD spend, the more it needs to buy for the story to justify itself.

For example, take the premise of Hermione being sorted into Slytherin. Given her character and the traits that Slytherin nominally wants, it's not unbelievable, so there is little SoD cost. But then, if it turns out that the fic also features a Manipulative!Dumbledore or Nice!Accepting!Slytherins or BloodPurist!Bully!Gryffindors, the fic is now taking place in a very different world from canon, and there is a lot of disbelief to suspend.

** My feelings are, if the rules of the universe are consistent from the beginning, I can get on board as long as it's well written. For example, if the first chapter of the story establishes that your version of the HP universe delves into arcane/H.P. Lovecraft style magic and demons, while it's not my cup of tea I'll be on board as long as the story is gripping.

However, if you present the rules of the story's universe as similar to cannon, and then suddenly in chapter 20 we find out Harry is actually part Fae, well then I'm out.

** I don't mind seeing anything as long as it makes sense within the story.i don't mind multiple lordship fanfics and if they are tied up with a harem. They would have to justify it in it's story like keeping lordship lines going and/or weaking Harry's family down the line.(assuming the family drifts further apart through the generations). Basically a big voting block for what 2 generations?( Harry's gen and kids maybe)

For manipulate X and Y stories the story has to make sense also. Manipulate Dumbledore probably wouldn't have a marriage contract signed between Harry and Ginny. A manipulative Molly may create one behind Dumbledores back. If Ron,Molly and Dumbledore are Manipulating Harry I highly doubt it's for the same reason. Ron for example is usually painted as wanting to use Harry to propel himself over his Family. Molly's manipulation of Harry seems to be either acting as stooge for Dumbledore or wanting harry to marry Ginny.(to get his money) Dumbledore usually is the one in charge. He may set the meeting with the Weasley up. This is done for a variety of reasons ranging giving Harry a place to run to in the summer (Weasley family seen generally light and under Dumbledore control) to Dumbledore trying to actually give Harry some stability. Going over the 3 very basic ideas I came up with none of them where able to go well together. Ron wouldn't want Ginny to marry Harry because he may lose his spot as a go to person. If anything this Ron maybe more pro Hermione and Harry. If Harry has a Lordship(s) (if it's one of those fics) Ron is the guy who you talk to for a meeting with Harry. Ron would want that spot to be something important. Ron would probably want Harry to marry a pureblood tied to British wizarding politics.(Maybe a reason he went after the Patalis during Yule ball) Molly usual main focus on these stories is to either being a overstepping mother(I know what's best for them) to someone wanting to enrich her family. Molly's ideas are the most likely not inline with Dumbledore and this case Ron also. In this 3 way triangle of manipulation Molly has the weakest side.(if something goes down it'll probably be a failed dosing attempt) Dumbledore probably wouldn't have to manipulate Harry directly. There could be Manipulative Hermione but only after the troll incident. Dumbledore could give her a "job" of keeping a eye on Harry and Ron. We know even cannon that she followed Dumbledores order for no contact with Harry in order of the Phoenix. She may feel following orders from Dumbledore the right thing to do.

** Wards, Lord Potter, Harry is a Black, "reaching out with his magic," super powerful Harry and weird character behaviour.

When /all/ that stuff is in one fic? I'm out. At least now. I have, after all, read all of HPMOR which is... um, definitely all that stuff except maybe the reaching out with magic (been a while since I read it... not going to re-read it).

I've read some pretty divergent things, if I'm being honest but usually there's something there. Take The Granger Principle and most of the other things I've read by [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]] where there can be very big differences but usually the characters feel mostly the same. And then there's the various other dimension/time travel ones I've looked into... that's usually a pretty big deviation but these fics (in my experience) don't usually dive into all that stuff. Wards, sure, and maybe Dorea/Charlus (instead of Fleamont/Euphemia) but the rest, no? Harry still typically remains mostly ordinary.

I think it mostly comes down to whether or not an idea annoys me. There was this one fic, can't remember which now (and while I hope it was one I finished I suspect it may have been Of a Linear Circle which I clocked out of because it looked like Snarry), where (iirc) the DADA professor asks the class about wards. The pupils then mention that wards are Real and the DADA professor is like "nope! anything you call a ward is just some other kind of spell and none of them do the same sorts of things so why bother talking about wards". I hate wards so I loved that. But wards aren't, alone, a decisive factor.

I will say... if it's canon compliant or offering something I like, I'm much more tolerant of quality problems. But most of the canon compliant stuff I've read is, to my mind, well written.

EDIT: I'm seeing people (in the comments) who don't like non-magical AUs. I'm totally cool with them. Not sure I'd read a muggle Dramione, though. If the character feels like what a muggle Harry Potter is like I'll keep going. Read one the other day actually... Harry was the son of someone famous (in context, it's a spoiler who), Ginny was a (reitired) boxer. Obviously, The Granger Principle has muggle Harry and Ron involved a lot (but still has a lot of magic). There have been others but they've all stuck to canon pairings as far as I remember. So, it's a bit like the same crew, different boat if we're using the Theseus' ship metaphor.

Hell, I was even reading a Ginny loses her magic fic and wishing she didn't get it back at the end. Not to be mean to Ginny, but because I liked her dynamic with Harry. There was another fic which did the same thing with Harry... sort of... and I was interested in seeing where that went too.

** It's an interesting question...for me it's all about the tone that is set near the beginning. If I know what I'm in for within the first few chapters and am enjoying it than I am good to go.

The disappointments for me are fics that set a tone and a world and then scope creep sets in. It then just keeps dialing everything up so the characters and plot development in the final chapters are nothing like the beginning. A good example of this for me is Hope by Jeconais. The characterisations are great and the idea of the veela bond and the Harry/Gabrielle relationship is developed wonderfully. However, as the chapters go on Harry's power seems to grow and grow until by the end he is literally the second coming of Merlin. That and the moustache twirling evilness and incompetence of Dumbledore/Snape/Draco take away from the tone set in the first half of the story. I really love the first 75% of the story but it loses me after that.

** I'm a rarity here, but I prefer to stick pretty closely to canon compliancy. Very occasionally there is an AU fic that will capture my interest for a bit, but I've never really stuck with one and completed it - I just have such a block over "but that didn't happen" or "that would never happen". I do realise that is a very personal preference though and have a great deal of respect for many AU writers who bring so much to the fandom.

** Tbh i don't mind OOC characters with a purpose or AUs, but one thing that really annoys me is when people change years, birthdays and names that are known (like Snape's birthday being in 13 October instead of 9 January). Also when they make Harry too angsty or downright aggressive because i think it's very out of character. Extreme Ron bashing is nasty too because c'mon, he's not THAT bad. Dumbledore being extra manipulative/too nice is a put-off as well.

So i guess i have no problem with AUs but i would prefer the characters to at least resemble their canon selves.. Like i love character growth but you have to keep the essence.
