I just need some info to know if this story is worth it. Is it a slow burn. Is harry too overpowered or weak (if overpowered at least he works for it i hate just pure god-like storys). How closely does it follow canon since sirius is dead and neville is the bwl. And. How good does he get in his chosen field, is it believable or is it one of those "i've read a few books and had a couple months i'm now better than the one with decades of experience". I can understand a prodigidy but never to such a degree like runemaster does while it was enjoyable it could have been better.

*** Thanks for your description. I would consider god-like as a character that cannot be beaten or if he can it is barely and only by a small (less than 5) amount of people. So does he have actual challenges throughout the story from other wizards/witches. And if possible maybe a few challenges academically.

** I started reading it and it was good for a while. The author's take on Harry being a transfiguration prodigy was interesting until Harry got chased away from Hogwarts.

Unfortunately I've found further chapters to be tedious to read. It's almost recommendable if I had to give it a rating I'd say 2 or 3 stars out of 5.

Yeah, I'll bailed a few chapters after that happened. It's updated quite a bit since then, but I've felt zero need to pick it back up. Interesting premise, okay writing, but the direction that the plot went was both boring and irritating. I also really couldn't get over the whole [[/spoiler][hissing Harry thing. I just kept imagining him turning into some anime cat-boy and couldn't take it seriously after that.]]

*** It was interesting up until the part where he began creating animals to be his companions. I think it's such an overused trope that it ruins stories on its own at this point.

Also, the author went through all the trouble of google-translating every single spell, instead of just having 1 Incantation for each field of transfiguration, followed by the latin word for what your transfiguring. Would have been more coherent and easier to understand.

The parts where Harry starts transfiguring himself were all poorly done, I didn't understand the limitations of anything he did, nor was it explained.

**** What point in the story do these start happening. The animals may be a little overused in some aspects, but it is still interesting to see where the story takes it. Does he per chance use wandless (or learn) magic. While i don't like storys where him learning it makes him over-powered if done right it can be all-right plus i just find the point of a wand a little like training wheels it helps you learn the feel of the spells easier and maybe makes the spells more potent but the power is inside you so you should be able to do the same without a wand.

** He's... highly powered but I don't think he is OP. He is ruthless enough to use his highly developed powers in... decisive manner.

He's also a sociopath, due to being deprived of affection by the Dursleys. His moral compass is his awareness of how people he respects/needs will react to his actions. If you want Harry to be a likeable character, you will either regard him as heartlessly practical or unlikeable.

** Yes. It's been a while since I've read it, but I remember enjoying it thoroughly. Give it a shot.

** It's perfectly fine. There are much worse fics out there, but I've gotten to the point where I really just want it to wrap up. I feel like it's been on the cusp of the climax for the last 3 chapters.
