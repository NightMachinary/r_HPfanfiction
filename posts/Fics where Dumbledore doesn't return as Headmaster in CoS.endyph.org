idk if this idea has already been done but I thought depending on whether its a good or evil dumbledore, this could have huge canon divergence.

(He goes into politics properly and crushes Lucius Malfoy faction in the wizenagemot, or starts to track the horcruxes)


** Well, there's linkffn(Harry and Albus' World Trip), but I should probably warm you that updates are pretty slow and that Dumbledore hasn't done much of anything yet.

#+begin_quote
  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
