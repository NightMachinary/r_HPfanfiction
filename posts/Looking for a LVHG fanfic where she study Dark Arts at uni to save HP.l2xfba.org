:END:
Almost a year ago I've read this fanfic in which Hermione was forced by Voldemort to study Dark Arts and other subjects like Arithmancy in exchange of Harry's safety (yeah, I don't remember how though) Lucius Malfoy was Minister of Magic, Ron and Hermione split up, a sort of romance blossomed between Hermione and Voldemort At some point Draco, Harry AND Ron became Voldemort's Horcrux in a messy scene. Draco was also doing uni but he was sh!t with calculus and apparently Ron wasn't and he helped Draco (a lot of drugs were involved) Hermione's university was in Venice and Ginny was extra jelly. Hermione got her mastery in dark arts and at some point went back in time to meet teenage Tom Riddle but something messy happened (again!) and she had to erase his memory. At the end time crumbled because of a lot of memory erasing and Hermione got purple eyes

I think this was on ao3 but I'm not sure

Please, I know this sounds like a bad LSD trip but it was really fun to read and I really want to read it again and I can't find it I'll be forever grateful it someone manages to find it
