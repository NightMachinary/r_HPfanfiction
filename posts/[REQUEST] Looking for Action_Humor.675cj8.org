So, hi guys!

I've finished reading Hail Odysseus yesterday, so I literally have no clue what to read next. This one's been a bit too much for me personally, it had it's great moments, but at times it was too much.

Can someone recommend me a well written Action and/or Humor fanfictions?

I'd really appreciate it.

Oh, I'm looking for a longer fic to read. I guess 15-20k words is good too but only if it's written very well and packed with great story.


** Black Comedy and The Lie I've Lived are what I'd call the "classics" of action/humor fics, nothing too deep, highly entertaining if you enjoy that type of humor.

If you like these I'd also recommend Lens of Sanity's "An Old and New World" which is no longer on FFN but appears on several mirror sites if you google for it.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

*** Already read ABC, and tbh I don't know why I haven't already read The Lie I've Lived already. Every time I bumped into it, I always scrolled past it. I'll read it now, many thanks! ^{_^}

** Well, /Oh God Not Again!/ is pretty funny, though not particularly action packed.

The ever reliable /Stages of Hope/ (is there nothing this fit doesn't have) is filled with action and somewhat dark humor.

*** Well, "Stages of Hope" isn't a fic that particularly made me /laugh/ though most of time, quite the opposite actually.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] has a reasonable amount of action and humour.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613][Ignite]]: It's sequels have more action, but this still has a lot of action. There is also a fair bit of humour.
