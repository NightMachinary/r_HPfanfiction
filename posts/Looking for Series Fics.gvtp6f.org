Could be any pair, any plot, I'm just looking for alternative series fics!

Basically the 7 books still from Harry's perspective, just different outcomes than the original books!

Thanks in advance to all you lovely folks!

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right?

** linkao3(Leo Inter Serpentes) is the first one I thought of. It's a Slytherin! Harry, with Drarry(that happens later), and Severitus. There were a few aspects of the fic I liked, but overall I disliked how it felt like a canon rehash. Harry still acts like a Gryffindor, and doesn't develop any Slytherin traits. After he does something stupid like going after the troll, everyone shakes their head, tells him he's too much of a Gryffindor, and forgets about it. However, if you don't care about that, there are 6 books, and I'm pretty sure they're abandoned at this point.

  A retelling of the original series, but this time, our hero wears green and silver, not red and gold.

** The Totally Realistic Series of Magical Events by WaskeHD and ReverendKilljoy on AO3. So far I've been loving this series. It's at Half-Blood Prince at the moment but it's being updated pretty regularly from what I can tell (Last update was yesterday). I've only gotten to Order of the Phoenix.

#+begin_quote
  This is less of a completely new work and more of a re-write of the first book. Part of it would be directly copied from the original work but will have distinct differences in the psychological profile of the main characters which leads to different outcomes while generally following the canon story-line with sometimes major differences in the personal interactions of people rather than an entirely new story. The reasoning for the major changes in characters is based on an understanding in developmental psychology and how the formative years would have a major effect on the main characters and others around them. As this is the first book there will be less romance then later on as it is highly unlikely that kids at the age of 11 would develop anything more than friendships.
