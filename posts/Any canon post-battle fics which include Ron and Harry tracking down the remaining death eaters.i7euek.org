** This is a short story, so idk if it fits the bill if you're looking for a long fic where they track everyone down. Nevertheless, it's very good (this author's work always is) and it's about Harry, Ron, and other DA-members-turned-Aurors tracking down DE's/DE sympathizers --- it's simply narrow in scope (but with good purpose).
