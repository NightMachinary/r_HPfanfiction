Hey guys! I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13638300/1/Too-old-to-be-this-young][Too old to be this young]]. This fic was so good even though it only had 7 chapters, I loved it so much!! It's a dimension travel fic where Harry takes over the body of his dead counterpart in that world and his interactions with Tom Riddle of that world is honest-to-god delicious. The tension and chemistry in that fic was palpable and so satisfying. Oh, and the side chracters were so awesome.

Right now, I'm looking for other old or new Tomarry fic recs. If you could give me some, I'd really appreciate it!!

My favorite Tomarry fic of all-time is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18232334/chapters/43137359][Kudosed, Bookmarked, Subscribed]].


** linkao3(Full circle; love is touching souls surely you touched mine; Don't Fuck with Florists They'll Fuck You Up)

Try [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] too :)

Also, I hope this isn't creepy but I checked out your profile to see whether you've posted this onto [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] already, and I saw you're on [[/r/wordofhonor][r/wordofhonor]]. Wow I didn't even know there was a subreddit for SHL and this is my first time seeing a fellow fan outside of danmei twitter! And now I'm thinking of WenZhou on a HP subreddit xD

  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.(cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.

Not at all! Thank you for the recommendations <3 I'll try to post this on that subreddit you mentioned. And yepp, there's a subreddit for shl, but it's currently only a small community, I hope more people would join! I also didn't expect to find a fellow fan here,, lmao I still haven't gotten over the concert. 😭

I'm not sure if you know Guardian but that was my gateway into danmei and my true love and I was disappointed but not surprised there's no subreddit for it. I'm just happy there's a SHL sub at all. I hope it keeps growing! I've seen quite a few HP fans into MDZS/Untamed (which I've never read/watched) but not anything else for danmei. Ah the concert, I haven't had a chance to check it out but I saw some clips on twitter. Them singing TYK has me 🤧

***** Yepp, I know Guardian. I haven't gotten the chance to read the novel, but I watched the drama. 😭The drama could've used more work lol but I understand that their budget was cut. I stayed for Zhao Yunlan, Shen Wei, 🥺and our wonderful SID peeps. I've also seen people who like MDZS but not any other danmei. I got into danmei because I was looking for japanese light novels but then fell into the world of chinese bl. I didn't read MXTX's works until later. The day 1 performace of tian ya ke is so iconic. 😌

****** Omg you should read the novel! It's phenomenal and has spoiled me for danmei. Oh the drama minus the main cast was awful LOL. It's like that "look how they massacred my boy" meme - but at least we had Zhu Yilong's Shen Wei and Bai Yu's Zhao Yunlan. I understand the budget and censorship limitations but they butchered the plot and made WeiLan so much weaker 😤 And made it a BE for no reason...as with SHL. They hate priest, I swear. Are you going to watch Winner Is King/Sha Po Lang when it comes out?

My SHL friend got up at 7am to stream and wants to buy some photobooks from the concert. I admire that level of dedication. I really can't get up early xD

******* lmao you really took the words right out of my mouth. 😭 The drama plot was a bit of a trainwreck. Like, what especially bothered me is that scene with the fire user, it's obvious Shen Wei was stronger than him. He's the Black Cloaked Envoy for goodness sake, but somehow that guy was able to get away?? It really didn't make any sense. They kept nerfing Xiao Wei whenever the plot required it, istg if it weren't for those sweet moments like that part where Zhao Yunlan had an alarm for Shen Wei's first class when they went to see a doctor, I probably would've dropped tha drama. Zhu Yilong and Bai Yu are our saviors lol. Love them <3

Definitely! Haven't read spl yeat, but I heard they didn't get through the first round of censorship? Meanwhile 2haists (including me) are still clowning themselves waiting for hyx. 🤡

Applies to everyone yet he keeps getting defeated. Especially with Zhujiu like wtf. I remember when I started watching the drama I asked my friend if he was that annoying in the book too and she said he didn't exist in the book and I was like, that makes so much sense. And Zhao Yunlan is so badass in the book but in the drama he only knows how to shoot a gun...

The alarm moment was 😍 And the look Dr. Cheng gave him, she was so onto them. Zhu Yilong as Yezun is also just phenomenal. Have you seen the deleted scene where he kills Shen Wei's female student (the one who went on that trip with them)?

Oh SPL didn't get through the first round of censorship? Damn. But HYX did, right? I get the feeling it'll be out soon-ish?

Summary: Voldemort survives the Battle of Hogwarts because Harry Potter had not been the one to kill him, as the prophecy demands.

Maybe you saw that comment on [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] subreddit? I also created this post there. It's got the same title and body so maybe you mistook it for this one, that's why you don't see that comment here. 😅
