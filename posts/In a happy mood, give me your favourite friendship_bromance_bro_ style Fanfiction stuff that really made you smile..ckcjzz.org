  Harry Potter was passionate about Quidditch. It was one of the few escapes he had; he found freedom in the air as he chased a small golden ball. Therefore, he wouldn't allow anything to tarnish the game. Not even one of his closest friends.

  The Wizarding War has begun, and all Ed wants is to go home. However, with Hogwarts, Death Eaters, and questionable morals from almost everyone involved, things are... a bit more complicated than expected. (If you haven't read Magic and Mind this will make zero sense) (Pre-Promise Day, HP book 6)

** Most of the latter part of this story is about Snape, but this has always stood out in my memory as an ADORABLE little vignette of Ron trying to do his best for Harry. I can sympathie with your request as I've always wanted more from that portion of the story.

  Severus Snape never wanted to be an Animagus and the only upside to his utterly useless animagus form is that he gets to tell Albus Dumbledore "I told you so."

  However, when Harry Potter foolishly ingests a confectionary offered to him by Fred Weasley, Severus has to employ any and all means at his disposal to avert a disaster.
