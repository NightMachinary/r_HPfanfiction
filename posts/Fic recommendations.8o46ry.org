I recently finished reading "The Sum of Their Parts" by holdmybeer and I have been craving more in the same vein as that. Any recommendations?

(Edit) I specifically enjoyed two aspects of it, firstly, the friendship aspect in which Harry Ron and Hermione stick together no matter what. I find that is oddly rare these days, especially for longer fics as well as the allied bit. Secondly, the "dark lord" aspect, specifically the way it was presented as a way to do good in the end, or as a necessity.

If there are any fics like this I would appreciate the recommendations.


** What did you like specifically about it?

If it's the strong friendship I have always liked Stages of Hope in that regard.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
