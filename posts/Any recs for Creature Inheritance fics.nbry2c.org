Hello all!

So recently I stumbled on two different creature inheritance and both was brilliant - I throughly enjoyed it.

Does anyone have recommendations, preferably completed but I'm ok with regular updates ones if they're brilliant.

I'm also okay with bashing. Just no non con or rape please.

Thanks!

  When Lily's secret is revealed Harry runs away from home and meets a girl unlike any other. But she can never be with him, and he would never even suggest it. Things change drastically when his mother's legacy turns him into something no one expected.

  Response to GoldenSteel's My gf is a what? challenge. GoF: Hermione has a secret. One that even she doesn't know. When she unearths a highly dangerous ritual to help Harry in the first task, the two of them never expected that secret to hit them both and change them into Great Dragons! Are they doomed to be treated as beasts? What does this mean for the TWT? H/Hr; AD/RW/MW putdown.
