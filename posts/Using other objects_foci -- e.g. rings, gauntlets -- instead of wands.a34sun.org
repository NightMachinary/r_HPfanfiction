Are there any (well-written) fics that explore this concept? So, instead of a wand, Harry would have a ring fashioned out of holly and phoenix feather -- it would work in the exact same way, as a focus for his magic.

What do you think of such a concept? I think wands... are overdone in fiction, and it would be nice to see interesting variations. Maybe magical folk in Australia use wrist gauntlets for magical foci.


** It's a minor plot feature, but this sort of thing shows up in linkffn(8831374) by the late Bobmin.

** Since this is flaired as a discussion I'm going to ask, why do you think wands are 'overdone'? Do you mean in bad fics where Harry spends 10K words getting custom trunks and a new wand with help from the sneaky misunderstood goblins or do you just mean wands as a thing in HP? If its the first I'd say the problem isn't the wand but the entire shitty scene and if its the second well I'm confused. Wands are a fundamental part of HP's magic and in my personal opinion, it wouldn't be the same without wands.

*** I think they mean in fiction in general, not just HP or HP fanfic. Like, most stories of witches and wizards have them using wands or staffs to channel their magic, and OP wants to see some more unique ways in which wizards can channel their magic.

** How about none? As far as I remember the Africans (other non-Europeans, too) don't use them (all the time, most seem to have them, but you don't actually seem to need them!) and still do magic!

Hell, Rowling says that every (powerful) wizard can do without tools, so it's not just Voldemort that can fly without a broom etc. :)
