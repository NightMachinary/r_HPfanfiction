  Tired of human stupidity, Death decides to teach those who sought to be Masters of Death a lesson. Thinly veiled as a favor, Death offers Tom Riddle a second chance, the opportunity to be born again and live a new life. Some things are just too good to be true, and Tom soon learns there's a catch. There always is. Rated T for swearing.

** The baby, when born, was bald and pale. Later, there would grow white hair on his head, and he would dive in books because it wasn't just Harry who was disconcerted about the eyes; all the adults who survived Voldemort were, with good reasons, and all the kids were, because they picked up their parents' fear and because red eyes are different and, according to most books in existence, evil or demonic.

And so Thomas Seamus Potter grew up alone and isolated, with no idea what caused it or what to do about it. He wasn't a bad kid at all: kind and gentle and just a little bit too observant for comfort. He drew portraits of what he saw, showing people as they were in his perception: Old Malfoy regretful and sad but guarded, Scorpius a bright white flame, Ginny with a spark of happiness, George with a smile that never reached his eyes and so on and so forth. ‘It's not that he isn't /kind/,' Molly said, who he had drawn while taking over some task despite her age. ‘It's just... does he have to be so, so...'

‘Perceptive?' Harry suggested.

‘Yes! He just goes on baring /my soul/ to all and sundry! It's like he reads minds!'

Harry sighted, looking fondly at his own portrait, which portrayed him as young, wand in hand and sweeping downwards, like he's attacking the observer. Vague shapes in the background make up his friends and family.

‘He's talented,you'll have to give him that,' he said. ‘And he's a good lad. Already he's helping Pomfrey out as much as he can.' He paused.

‘And he likes teaching.'

‘A bit like...'

‘The resemblance is uncanny,' Harry agreed grudgingly. ‘Ginny...'

Ginny had a harder time than most, dealing with Tom. She made a effort to be kind to him, of course, and she never treated him differently from her other grandkids, but she couldn't bear to be in his company for long and she was clearly exhausted at the end of any day when he visited. He looked so much like the old Tom, she had said. Not even in his face or hair but in the expression on his face, the quiet way he reads, even his politeness and genuine care...

Molly's face softened. ‘This must be very hard on her,' she said.

Harry looked at her. ‘The boy must never know,' he told her. ‘He'd never forgive himself for looking like Ginny's old abuser, for reminding her of that miserable bastard. And he really can't help it.'

Several years later, Harry was back in the Chamber, Tom Marvolo Riddle in front of him, commanding the snake to kill him over Ginny's dead body. He knew she was dead, because Tom was completely corporal now, and he knew he was going to die because his arm was too weak to hold the Sword. There was poison dripping from the snake's fangs. It dropped on his lips and suddenly Tom was forcing him to swallow... ‘A creative way to kill me. What, biting wasn't good enough?' He wheezed through the fluid. Tom's answer was lost on him.

**** Pt 2

‘Grandpa,' Tom pleaded. ‘Grandpa, /please/...'

His Grandpa, who had always been genuinely kind to him, who had always stood up for him, that very same Grandpa was now spitting at him, pushing him away. ‘Gramps?'

Harry's head lolled backwards, finally exhausted from the struggle. From under his lidded eyes he was staring at Tom. ‘You killed Ginny,' he whispered. Then, raising his voice to a hoarse half loud speaking level he repeated: ‘you killed Ginny, you bastard!'

His efforts apparently spent, he went back to moaning and muttering.

‘Here, let me.'

Tom turned around. ‘Why does Grandpa think I want to kill him, Grandma?'

With nothing to do but watching Grandma coach some fluid into her husband, soothing him that she was alive (‘is he gone?' ‘Yes, dear, you defeated him. You always do.') watching her tired smile, he suddenly felt lost. ‘He's nothing like this with anyone else,' he insisted. ‘It's just me. Why is it just me?'

Ginny sighed, looking at him. ‘I promised him. He made us all promise. The truth would hurt you too much.' She smiled softly. ‘You have his character,' she told him, gesturing at Grandpa. ‘And he /does/ love you very much. You just wait until he gets lucid. He always asks after you, if you've drawn anything new. Insist you shouldn't draw him like this.' She grins briefly. ‘I think he prefers his glory days.' Her eyes flicker towards the old painting of him, framed on the wall opposite him.

‘This is hurting me too,' Tom insisted, before realizing how whiny he sounds. ‘I am sorry Grandma. I am sure it's just a bad day, eh? One of his nightmares he woke up from in the middle of giving him his medicine and I just happened to be there.'

He paused. ‘He dreamt you were dead. Killed, in fact. Would it help if... next time... I stand behind you while you feed him? So he can see I didn't... ki-‘ he cannot bring himself to finish that sentence.

They've beaten Voldemort and having a victorymeal in front of his dead body. Ginny sits opposite him and feeds him porridge because she thinks it romantic, and he accepts, bemused that the House-elves have already prepared a meal, when suddenly Tom Riddle rises up from Voldemort's body, wand in hand, right behind Ginny. Harry tries to rise, but he is so, so tired and something is forcing him to stay seated as Tom starts laughing, a high and cold laugh that seems to say; /What, did you think it would be/ that /easy?/

******** Pt 3

When Tom next entered, some week later, his Grandpa wore that lazily happy smile that either said ‘/I am awake and lucid and life is great/' or ‘/I am in the midst of a happy dreamworld, do not disturb/'.

‘Hey Tom,' he said and Tom exhaled with relief as he set to work preparing Harry's breakfast.

‘Hey Grandpa,' he said. ‘Had a good night?'

‘Marvelous,' was the reply, but there was a sad undercurrent in his voice that Tom noted despite himself.

There was a pause while Tom sprinkled the oatmeal in the milk and watched it as it simmered.

Harry coughed. ‘I am sorry, Tom,' he said simply.

‘Whatever for?' Tom asked the milk.

‘I thought I did what's best for you when I made them all promise,' Harry said, evenly. ‘I never thought I'd end up in such a state.' He chuckled darkly. Tom stirred the oatmeal and threw in some more, along with raisins. ‘You know about the eyes, of course,' Harry continued.

‘The eyes of Voldemort,' Tom stated.

His Grandpa would be wincing now, Tom thought, but he didn't chance a look. He had to set it a bit lower and keep stirring, or else it would boil over.

‘Yes, well, about that...' Grandpa trailed of.

‘I dreamt a lot about you,' he said suddenly.

‘I noticed,' Tom said dryly, resisting the urge to tell him exactly how much it had hurt him. /It's not his fault,/ he reminded himself as the oatmeal thickened and he decided to add honey.

‘I know,' he said. ‘And I can't tell you how sorry I am for everything I said and did to you back then, while you were making lovely oatmeal and giving me medicine and all that. I-I can't believe ho-how...,' he paused and sniffled. ‘Goddamnit I can't even wipe my own nose!'

Tom looked at him, uneasy. This wasn't at all usual. Grandpa waved his hand dismissively. ‘Don't worry about it,' he said. ‘It'll be over in a few. Anyway, I just can't believe how you just kept putting your whole heart in caring for me while I was being a right bastard. And... actually it's more Ginny's story to tell than mine, but we don't have much time,' he said, pausing to gather his thoughts. ‘You see, when she was twelve, she got this diary from Malfoy's dad.'

‘The Death-Eater?'

‘That's the one,' Grandpa said, nodding. Tom set the oatmeal lower, stirred the medicine in and scooped the oatmeal in a bowl.

‘We didn't notice because it was hidden in other books, and Ginny and I weren't that close, back then. But as it turned out, Voldemort's soul was in that book. Now, Voldemort used to be called Tom Riddle but no-one knew that, so when Ginny saw the inscription, it never occurred to her it was dark magic. And when it wrote back, well, she just thought it was a new type of diary, not at all unusual. By the time she began noticing the book was unsafe, it took all her willpower to throw the book away in a toilet and flush it through.' He smiled grimly. ‘Brave little Ginny. He manipulated her in the most awful way, you know. It wasn't just possession either, though that's bad enough... Told her she had so /loved/ writing in that book... that she had /chosen/ to pour her love and soul into it, and that she would have nobody to blame but herself if he exposed it all to her crush; the Great Harry Potter. So she stole it back from me, because I had stumbled on it and thought it was odd, and naturally twelve-year-old me thought the best way to investigate it was to keep it right next to me in the dorms. Next thing I know, she's taken to the Chamber of Secrets. Turns out, he rose from that diary, grabbed her, and used her life to feed his own and confront me.' He paused and blinked at the spoon that was halfway out of his mouth and smiled as if he wanted to say ‘aren't you a sneaky fellow' in the most fond way possible. ‘Now, the thing is,' he continued while Tom snuck another spoonful in. ‘That while Tom Riddle was dark and handsome, and you're as pale as a Malfoy, you do share certain similarities. Not necessarily in face, but rather in... character and build, I am afraid. Like Riddle, you are bookish, perceptive, clever. You are of similar height and build and according to Ginny, you have the same expression when you concentrate. Of course, the biggest difference is that while Riddle used his knowledge and perceptiveness to hurt and manipulate other people, you use them to /help/ and you would never, /ever/ be anything like Voldemort,' he said, suddenly looking very stern. ‘No, I want you to know that. I myself have wondered as well, because I share the same background and characteristics, but Dumbledore told me -‘

‘It's our choices that make us who we are, rather than our abilities,' Tom recited.

‘Very good!' Grandpa said, beaming toothlessly. ‘Now pick up your spoon.' Tom blinked. Apparently he had dropped it during the story, probably at the point where his Grandpa told him he was a lot like a murderous dictator in behavioral tendencies.

‘Is that why Grandma can't stand to see me draw?' He found himself asking numbly.

‘Fraid so,' Grandpa confirmed. ‘And...' he paused. ‘The reason I have given you hell... is because it kinda tripped me up as well. I was dreaming, but that's no excuse to be a dick. Will you forgive me?'

‘You were always forgiven Grandpa,' Tom said softly.

********* /Grandpa wants to see you,/ the note read. /Bring your drawing stuff./ And then, more worryingly: /come at once./

When he came, he found both his grandparents in bed. Grandpa looked relaxed and lucid, and Grandma had a determined expression on her face.

‘I -we- want you to draw us,' she told him.

‘Are you sure?'

‘Very sure,' she said. ‘Draw us as we are.' She paused. ‘It's not just for him, y'know,' she said softly. ‘Or to prove that I can do it. It's just... I want a memento, a way to remember him old and happy.' There was red around her eyes.

‘And I'd love to be drawn by you,' Grandpa added. Tom had rarely heard his voice this strong in the past months.

‘Very well,' he said.

With soft pencil lines he began to draw the outline: Grandma's hand around Grandpa's waist, her head and shoulders steadying his, the other hand flat on the blanket... ‘Don't move,' he said absentmindedly as it curled into a fist. Grandma inhaled and exhaled deeply as - with great effort, it seemed - she steadied her hand on the blanket again. ‘M sorry,' he muttered automatically, recalling the stolen moments when he had tried to draw her before, before she caught him and looked with that faintly disturbed look. Now he knew why. His hand drew everything that sat still for long enough, it wasn't her in particular, but still... he could see how it might've been disturbing now. The legs he outlined a bit more blurry, so they seemed to be one being. They were under the blanket anyway. Carefully he drew Grandpa' mess of hair (“Were you born a hedgehog or something?” Tom had once asked) trying to shake the memories away of joking and laughing about it. Soft green eyes, beaming with happiness, were next. The face, half-slack half relaxed, with a soft and happy smile, seemed to melt in a pronounced shoulder that led to a warm and freckled face through a half-hidden neck, at one side by a sharp chin and at the other side by long hair, red with streaks of grey in it. He cursed a bit under his breath when the mouth didn't come out right, but thankfully it was salvageable. That was when he remembered the scar, which he carefully added on Grandpa's face, barely visible among the wrinkles. He added details on the clothing and the blankets, drew the nightstands with wands - one on each side of the bed -, and checked if he had forgotten anything. There, a freckle just under her left eye he had forgotten, and a wrinkle he'd missed. When he looked again, Grandpa's eyes were closed and it had grown darker out, he saw the night fall through the window... what, the window?! Crap, he'd forgotten to draw the window! Hastily, he added it and turned the page to start a new drawing, intending to draw his grandfather sleeping, when Grandma spoke.

‘I am sorry, Tom.'

He looked at her face, then at Grandpa, and realized... ‘No. No, it cannot be...' It couldn't be.

‘He's... he's dead, Tom.'

They looked at each other over the bed, and somehow it was no distance at all for two sobbing people.

** Harry was rubbing the shoulders of a terrified James Sirius Potter. "It's alright son. I have utmost faith in Dr Longbottom. Helen is going to be alright."

"But she's screaming, dad! Why... why did I even try..."

"You're asking me?" Harry smirked, "Your dad? About why you decided to make babies?"

James stopped, than blushed. Harry laughed.

"Don't worry about it, we'll soon have a healthy baby."

"But... But George had a baby so quickly. Why does Helen have to---"

"Every baby takes their time, unfortunately. That's something no one can really predict. It's alright James, it's alright."

Helen's scream tore through the corridor for an instant, and then everything turned quiet.

"Do you think...?"

Harry was smiling brightly.

Molly was already turning the baby bag inside out, confirming everything that needed to be there, was. Albus was distracting himself by making and vanishing his Patronus, an octopus.

And in that moment, the doors opened.

A healer, exhausted but smiling, held out a tray, in which was James' son. Sleeping away, not caring about anything in the world.

James just looked at his son, even as everyone around was congratulating him. His eyes were tearing up.

"A healthy baby boy. Helen is also safe, though very exhausted," said Frank Longbottom, smiling ear to ear.

And then the Baby opened it's eyes.

And Harry's heart sank. "I'll... I..."

James turned away from his child. "What happened?"

"Nothing," Harry shook his head. "I'll prepare the house for him. Bring him home, son." He forced a smile.

James looked concerned but nodded anyway.

Harry apparated away.

He entered his study, locked the door, and with unsteady hands, activated the portrait of Ginny.

"Hey Harry!" Ginny's painting came alive, waving at him from beyond a wall he could never breach.

Harry teared up. "Sorry for waking you up, hun. Just need a bit of an advice."

"Happy to help, Harry!" called the painting enthusiastically.

And Harry knew, in his gut, that this wasn't really Ginny, just an imitation.

Regardless he pushed on. "I... I think, Voldemort has reincarnated into this world."

The portrait looked shocked. "What? Did some Death Eaters manage to find another Horcrux? How?"

"No, nothing like that. That Voldemort is dead, I'm sure of it." Harry steadied his breath. "Though, I think, Voldemort's soul now lives in the body of my grandchild."

"Why?"

"He looks too similar. I remember those memories Dumbledore showed me, Ginny."

Harry took a deep breath.

"He has those red eyes."

The portrait looked shocked. "I don't know what to say," it stated. And Harry nodded just the same. It was just a portrait after all.

"Thank you for helping me clear my head." Harry stood up and deactivated the portrait.

******* Unless, of course, one of his sons married a albino. It happens. And when two people love each other very much...

On top of that, with traumatic memories, often you are entirely in that moment. It doesn't obey logic or ‘there is no reason to freak out' or /anything/. Now, combine that with living in the past and dreaming, and you /might/ start to see why Harry freaking out is normal.

** Still like the plot and prompt but I thought Voldemort's eye's changed color because of too much dark magic and the horcruxes. He wasn't born with red eyes. I don't think his eyes were red in the chamber of secrets.

It would make more sense. If an accident happened to Tom Potter that changed his eye color later in life.

True, the red eyes came later - they first appeared some time after his second Horcrux before he stole the locket and the cup from Hepzibah Smith and even then it was only a glint of red that appeared when he was emotional.
