Sirius had been in Azkaban for 16 years when there was a commotion outside his cell. A blinding flash of light preceded Prongs appearing to drive the dementors away. Then the bars opened and, it was impossible, James appeared flanked by a young man and woman. "Sirius Black, traitor." James sneered, "Tell us where your brother hid the locket he stole from Voldemort."

*** Before that fateful day, Sirius Black had only been visited a handful of times.

Ever since he had been imprisoned, he had meticulously kept tract of time. The yearly visits by the Minister of Magic, Bagnold at first, Fudge after her, were punctual and always on the same date. Fudge had given him his newspaper in the last few years he had been in power, a strange ritual.

It was by chance, but completely unknown to Sirius, that Fudge had not left him his paper in 1993. So Sirius Black stayed in Azkaban and was swallowed further and further by his guilt and the eternal despair of the prison. He had become completely resigned he would die there, and never see Harry again. It was only just. It was his fault. He had suggested the rat as Secret-Keeper to James and Lily. It was his fault his brother in all but blood was dead. It was his fault that Harry was an orphan.

He deserved every second he was here. Every moment of endless darkness. When death finally claimed him, it would but mark the next phase of his damnation, of his punishment. He cursed his own name. His wretched ancestors, whose taint was strong in him.

The world darkened again, and Azkaban became more rowdy. Lord Voldemort had returned. His fellow inmates cheered when the time finally came, and Azkaban was breached. Many stopped to gloat at his cell, firmly locked, as they escaped into the sunlight. The Dementors had abandoned Azkaban with the prisoners.

Later that day, Voldemort himself stopped by. He told Sirius he had considered killing him, but as he was, Sirius was no threat to him. None of his old friends would trust him. They had put him in Azkaban after all.

Eventually, the prison began refilling as Voldemort established his regime in the Wizarding World. Muggleborns and Halfbloods unable to prove their ancestry joined him. All of them questioned why the man they knew as Voldemort's right hand man was there, but he never replied. Sirius had long since lost hope. They started assuming his deeds were too dark even for Voldemort himself. They spat at him whenever they could.

He was the most hated man of Britain, by far.

Then came that fateful day. Few dementors now guarded Azkaban, but a bright patronus, Prongs, cleared the few guarding his cell. But that was impossible. Prongs was dead. He had wept at his corpse. Then the bars opened and, it was impossible, James appeared flanked by a young man and woman. "Sirius Black, traitor." James sneered, "Tell us where your brother hid the locket he stole from Voldemort."

The what now ?

''Brother ?''

''Regulus Arcturus Black. Now tell us. Where is the Locket of Slytherin hiding ? Don't let me regret making you talk.'' James spat.

Sirius was truly puzzled. Why would James ask after Regulus ?

''Regulus is dead. Don't you know ?'' He asked. ''Why are you here, James. Am I dead at last ? Is this my hell'' ?

''You will wish it was, traitor, when we are done with you !'' the young man next to James bit back. His pale skin had gone quite red.

James pointed his wand at Sirius.

''Tell us or suffer. Where did your brother hide the locket ?'' ''We want answers, NOW !'' He shouted.

''I don't know what you are talking about. Regulus and I were not close. Cowardly little runt probably got cold feet when he saw what Voldemort was really capable of. He was never very courageous.''

''And betraying my parents to Voldemort, and me ? Blowing apart a street full of muggles was so courageous ? Killing another friend, Peter Pettigrew so that your secret was kept ? I am glad they caught you. This place is perfect for you. Rot in hell, traitor.''

That made Sirius realize something. Those eyes behind the glasses were green. Lily's green.

''Harry ?'' He croaked. ''You are Harry, not James ?'' ''Has it been so long ?''

''I see this is pointless.''

He motioned to the woman, who handed him a clear vial.

Then he pointed his wand at him again.

''Imperio!''

Open your mouth, a foreign presence commanded. And he found himself too weak to resist. Three drops of the fluid inside the vial were dropped onto his parched tongue, and he fell into a calm lull. The foreign presence quickly faded.

''Give us your Marauder name''

''Padfoot'', he responded mindlessly.

''It seems to be working'' the woman said.

''Where did Regulus Black, your brother, hide the Locket of Salazar Slytherin?"

''I don't know'' he replied, and then all three of them cursed.

He did not make out everything they said as they whispered, but Regulus and traitor were words he heard a lot.

It was Harry that spoke next.

''Why did you betray my parents ?''

''I didn't. Peter Pettigrew did.''

''What ?!" Harry and his companions exclaimed.

Feel free to write from here. This is the interesting bit done.
