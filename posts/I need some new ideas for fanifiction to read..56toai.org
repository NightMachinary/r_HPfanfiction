  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725][Forging the Sword]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic that diverges from the end of CoS. Great take on magic system, that's creative and stays close to canon at the same time. Rather slowpaced, with the whole third year being focused mostly on the character- and worldbuilding. Sadly died just when plot was started getting really interesting. Though considering author's earlier hiatuses I still have hope for more updates. In this case the change is in mechanics of the diary - killing Tom would also kill Ginny. But not killing Tom would also mean that Ginny will die. And so Harry is forced to do a hard thing and kill his friends sister. And things spiral out of there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11585823][The Art of Self-Fashioning]] - Non-BWL Harry who specialises in transfiguration. I like some of things it does with magic, don't like some others, but all in all it's interesting read and update often.

[[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ww8zey6s8igoghx/AAAW0Cgm8AGQl2amQOwRat_5a?dl=0&preview=Alexandra+Potter+Original+(Revised][Alexandra Potter]].html) - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in heavily magical Hogwarts. It focus on school life and author's variation on magic system. The first year complete, but theoretically there is a new version planned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358][What You Leave Behind]] - Year older Harry who puts more time in studying magic and looking for secrets of the school. Another canon-ish yet original take on magic. And another dead fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809][Harry Potter]] [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021][and the Boy Who Lived]] - Non-BWL Harry attends Durmstrang. Fic focuses mostly on his magical research. I have some problem with how it often goes into "Harry is so awesome", but it's still very good read. And of course it's dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] - The most famous next-gen fic, and a good one at that, even though it has quite a lot inconsistencies with canon. Focuses strongly on relations between houses, and students conflict with teachers. (Complete, but with sequel hook that probably will never be used)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - This fic is still starting up, but has strong (though slow) worldbuilding. It's about non-BWL Harry in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindewald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. (This one is not 75k+ yet, but give it a week or two and it will be)

Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of neither. Matou Shinji, protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focus on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements or both settings with author original ideas. Ongoing, with currently iregular updates.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] - Heavy AU with a Slytherin Harry who have a twin who was raised with their parents. Contrary to what you my expect it's decent. The fic is held down, by using quite a few bad ideas in worldbuilding (some are the cliches, because author likes to toy with them, some are original), and technical problems with starting chapters but the plot is strong enough to warrant the read. Ongoing with regular updates.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10753296][Lesser Evils]] - AU that diverges in the fifth year (with some earlier details changed). Put bigger focus on politics and supporting adult characters. Ongoing, regular (I think) udpates.

[[https://www.dropbox.com/s/s4ww9xm0o9zsllu/Out%20of%20the%20Night.html][Out of the Night]] - Very AU fic about Harry hiding in Knockturn Alley. Interesting take on wizarding culture and dark magic. Sadly dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815956][The Leapling (prologue to the series)]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739][Weasley Girl]] and [Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past] - "For a want of a nail" type fic with Ron's gender (we have Ronnie here) being the point of divergence. Stays very close to canon in terms of characters, settings and initial plot, but manages to spin in interesting and original direction. Ongoing, rare updates.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469][Lily and the Art of Being Sysiphus]] and its many side stories - An absurdist fanfic with all that it entails. Eleanor (femHarry) is the Death of this world, and so she can't die. With Wizarding Lenin in her head, Uncle Death (of the different world) in the afterlife's waiting room and Rabbit (who is eldricht abomination turned rabbit/Albanian) she lives her rather crazy life.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861][Applied Cultural Anthropology, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus]] - Hermione wanted to be a great witch, and there is a house for those who want to be great - Slytherin. There is just one problem, it may be not the nicest house to be in if you're muggleborn. Nice story about Hermione getting more hardcore thanks to fighting Slytherin bullies. Sadly on hiatus.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
