A friend of mine has recently started writing again, and he did so by using the world of HP. He got fascinated with the trope of Harry becoming a girl, through whatever means - potions, spells, anything you can think about.

We had a discussion about this and realized, of course, that the theme also brings with it a lot of problems.

Not the least of them is the blatant parallels to the life and problems of transgender people. While we both aren't overly concerned that we may or may not offend someone, we do think about avoiding and try to avoid downright insulting the feeling of having the wrong sex to your gender, or the wish to equalize your sex with your gender by treatments. That was the first point of our discussion and we conceded that we simply do not have enough insight into the life of transgender people to come to a conclusion.

The next was a simple discussion about pronouns. When do you change them? Do you even change them, ever, and if yes, when is that point? How would the wizarding society of the 90s react to a +gender+ sex-swapped Harry Potter? In which way would McGonagall, Dumbledore, Umbridge, Remus, Sirius, Hermione, Ron........ address this Harry?

And how would Harry react? There are a few sub-discussion here.

- How would Harry react to becoming a girl as the consequence of an assault (Draco using a potion is a cause in one fic)?

- How would he react to it as a consequence to something done to him in the past (James changing the sex of Harry to fit the prophecy was one I read once)?

- How would his reaction be when the change was completely voluntary? I haven't found an example of the last, with the exception of a crossdressing Harry in "Harveste Addams and the Sorceror's Stone".

One of my answers to the second question I wrote into a short piece was that Harry would develop a persona and eventually an almost split personality, between his desire to fit in and subsequent adherence to societies rules which he projects on his female persona of Agatha, and then his internal desires, drives and wishes which he projects on his original persona of Harry Potter.

But I'd like to talk about this with you wonderful people. We formulated a lot of preferences, no-go's and the like, but we're only 2 guys. Your opinions are asked for.


** The pronoun issue is actually dependant on how Harry ends up a girl. If it's because of a potion/spell accident/assault that changes him against his will, he's unlikely to change his pronouns unless he is actually transgender, in which case she'd probably woop with glee and instantly start using fem-pronouns. Her body would finally match herself; she'll be delighted. Research on trans people should be done, but most of the body issues and identity difficulties she suffered would be /before/ the sex-change. Post-change difficulties will come from dealing with people who think she needs and should want to go back to being a boy, and the inevitable public attention she'll get as the new Girl Who Lived.

If he's not trans, then he's going to insist on sticking with male pronouns. He'd be heavily focused on finding a solution to return him to how he was, and if none is available then he'd basically be a trans man and you'd need to research adequately to properly portray such a person. He might have extreme body issues given that he already knows what it's like to have a male body, and he'll have a lot of trouble adjusting to a fem body--more so than if he was a transwoman because he's going to be resistant and highly distasteful of everything. Boy-Harry will be disgusted when he gets his first period; transgirl-Harry will be delighted. (Probably also a bit digusted because it is gross, but still happy at this definite sign of femininity.)

In the case of past sex-change, especially if it happened before he was old enough to remember, you're looking at slightly different issues. If he identifies as a boy, then finding out he was born female will be weird, and he might wonder what it would have been like to grow up as a girl, but ultimately he's going to shrug it off. He's a boy with a male body and that's all he's satisfied with. There's not going to be much in the way of trans issues to deal with. He'd keep using male pronouns.

If, however, she identifies as a girl, she's going to be furious that she spent her life feeling wrong inside her own body. She'll want to undo what was done and she'll be especially angry at people who have kept it secret from her. In this case, you've got more of the trans issues to cover than the above case. When she choses to start using fem-pronouns would depend on when she wanted to come out. Given her public identity, she might continue using male pronouns until she's able to change her body back to female (if that happens), or she may start transitioning and use them earlier if you want to write it that way.

If the change is entirely voluntary, then his reaction will depend on /why/ he chose to change. If she's a transwoman, then you should research the matter and write it as such, and she'll start using fem-pronouns when she's ready (she may use them mentally earlier than she asks people around her to use them).

If he's doing it to hide his identity or for some kind of sex play, focus will be on physical changes rather than identity--how having a female body feels, how it's different/similar to what he expects. People around him will use fem-pronouns, but he'll still ID as male so he'll think of himself with male-pronouns (and if written in third person you should use them). People that know he's changing may keep using male pronouns, either from habit or at his request, although if it's a sex game then he may ask his lover to use fem-pronouns as part of the play.

How wizarding society views things is up to you. It's not Muggle society, so things like this are really up to the author and how much conflict you want to create from other people's reactions--both society as a whole and friends, family, and arch-enemies. The reasons for the change will also affect how they react--reactions to trans Harry will be different than reaction to Harry being accidentally turned into a girl, but again their reactions will be altered by his identity. e.g. Ron might be amused and sympathetic towards Harry accidently turned into a girl, until he finds out she wants to stay that way because this is actually her true self. In the case of being changed as an infant, some people might take issue with him deciding to stay as he is when they think that he should got back to his "natural" sex.

To conclude, basically there are a lot of issues to handle depending on how the change happens and how Harry actually identifies.

*** That's some well thought out response. I agree, as we also mostly came to the same conclusions.

My question to you would be how you would build up such a story, if given the task? Or, what kind of sex-change Harry story would be the one you thoroughly enjoy reading?

Do you know of a fic that did it especially well, or especially bad?

**** I've never read a sex-change story about anyone, so no recs, I'm afraid. There is a (trans) guy I follow on tumblr who complains about them occasionally and his biggest issue is suddenly-a-girl Harry very abruptly becoming hyper-feminine and attracted to guys when he's previously been attracted to girls. I get the impression that a lot of those kind of stories are written by people who want to ship Harry with Draco (or other male of choice) but don't want to write him as gay.

As for build up, it'd really depend again on the story. If it's trans Harry, there should be something to start with that shows it before the accidental change or revelation of infant-sex-change. It might be a bit jarring or odd to have the accident/revelation and /then/ have Harry going, "well, actually, I always felt like a girl". She doesn't have to be out even to Ron and Hermione, but the readers should at least be made aware of her identity.

After that, for accident/infant change stories, I'd just jump right in at the point of change/revelation. Possibly with infant change, you could have a prologue showing it happening to give an insight into why it's being done. From there, work on Harry's reaction to the news and what (s)he wants to do next.

For trans Harry stories that focus on her transition, I'm not sure where I'd start. Possibly her entry into the wiz world, or around puberty, with her realising that magic might provide a solution to her body problems and going in search of spells or potions that will change her.

For change-to-hide, start with the first time he takes the potion and his reaction to it and then move onto why he's doing it; I'd expect such a story to be focused mostly on plot.

I'd certainly be interested to see a well-written accidental change (with "male-identifies Harry is suddenly a girl" done realistically), but trans Harry handling her transition would be good to see as long as it's done well and respectfully. Infant change is an interesting idea, but I'd want the rest of the plot to be intriguring for me to read it; same with change-to-hide. If I ever write one myself, I'll probably go for trans Harry.

Sex-play change is presumably PWP, so starting point for that one should be obvious and my interest would be dependant on my... /ahem/... mood.

That is a good point. I also started one of these stories myself (just to try it out) and did it like this. I confronted Harry with his body changing from male to female and want to write how he gradually finds that it fit. Though I have seen that I do need some prologue and explanation to it all, especially if he eventually /does/ change to think about himself as "he" to "she".

In my special case he begins by using a plan that would send Harry away from Britain for a year, to also project his new situation on. He creates "Agatha", who is a fake identity Dumbledore, Sirius, Remus and Tonks create with him to escape the regime under Fudge (5th year). But instead of staying as "boyish" as possible like they all expected, Harry projects a lot of what he thinks Agatha should look like on this character, down to using Grimmauld Place's storage and dressing this character/himself in the old clothes of the Black sisters. I work a lot with him talking to Agatha in the mirror, almost as if he has a split personality.

Honestly, I probably write more about sexual repression in this than anything else. The way it progresses, Harry reads a little mad and unstable - or at least heavily unbalanced by the situation. I figured being influenced by the Dursleys can't do ones psyche much good in such a situation.

The aforementioned friend of mine starts in second year, with Harry nicking some polyjuice and using the hair of an anonymous seventh year Ravenclaw girl to "try it out". He then proceeds to write how Harry feels more and more uncomfortable in his own body after the experience, as if he had done the right thing for once, just to go back to doing the wrong thing. Getting no help from Hermione, whom he decides to confine in, he researches Polyjuice Potion failures and deliberately miss-brews it to keep him in the body of a girl.

He isn't much father, but it begins to smell like a tragedy.

*** I disagree about Harry "shrugging it off" (especially if she/he didn't feel "wrong" in the male form/body!) if he was originally female and turned male to hide him (I however agree that mentally he'd stick with being male!), he'd probably start acting out and actively hating the people who knew or even helped doing it (their reasons be damned - note: I might be projecting myself onto Harry, but I'd probably hurt the people who did this to me!)...He'd be angry, distrusting (it would shake his fragile trust in say Dumbledore, Sirius, McGonagall etc. if they they all knew!), hell Harry would be disgusted that they did this!

I agree however that a Harry who felt somehow wrong as a male will also act out etc. in the ways described above!

ps: I'd love a story where he was changed to a boy (so Harry is/was naturally female) and wants to go back to it (despite some people, like say Hermione (after all she's never wrong, isn't she?) and maybe the adults, telling Harry that they won't help etc.)...sadly I've only seen the "hey you are a girl now, isn't it great? No, we can't turn you back, learn to live with it" kind (and Harry gives up of course...just like most forced marriages have him become "happy" in the end (damned, makes me want to PUKE!))

** I've been enjoying just such a fix lately. It's linkao3(To Reach Without by inwardtransience). The author does a good job with Harry turning himself into a girl, maintaining the male pronoun until an epiphany. I think the other background changes in Sirius and the Black family politics definitely shove this into the AU category, but I'm still enjoying the process.

** As [[/u/SilverCookieDust][u/SilverCookieDust]] already wrote a lot and I do agree with most of it (the bits about how Harry would /feel/ I consider to be up to debate instead, as everyone has a different way of reacting to things of whatever kind and sometimes people don't even get what and how they are feeling so it's not always that simple).

That said, I will add that generally people don't change how they perceive themselves, be it in using pronouns or considering their name to change or whatever else, unless there is a reason, some kind of trigger, something that would shake them out of the status quo enough to make them actually do that. That /could/ be the initial change, but does not have to be, and personally I think that the initial change is quite unlikely to be a trigger due to simply being enough of a shock that the status quo snaps ... only to pull itself into a similar but not quite the same status quo before the person can actually react to it and change how they think.

Likewise, the perception that others have of the character is also something that is probably going to change with such triggers, the one difference being that this major change is much likely to possibly be a trigger as the other characters do not have the same ... hmm, let's call it “problem”, as the affectee. On the other side of it, people who feel strongly about the character (such as Snape with hatred/loathing/whatever other emotion it is for him, or possibly Ginny with her early infatuation) might very well need much stronger triggers because their strong feelings entrench them in the status quo that they think they see.

And then there is the already mentioned up above the fact that people sometimes don't know what they feel themselves, and when you add it to the fact that there is a lot to being “trans” as it's a whole umbrella that includes a lot of things that can be hard to emotionally understand if you don't know anyone who is like that (I will personally admit to not emotionally getting the non-binary thing, although I can understand it intellectually) and that the prejudices of the world often cause trans people to try to deny it as hard as possible until they simply break, well ... basically, almost anything is possible. You could have a trans girl Harry who referred to himself with female pronouns since she was 4 but was scared of the change when it actually happened, or you could have a boy Harry who got changed and at some point started referring to himself with female pronouns despite the fact that he dislikes it simply because of the pressure from others and his own lack of hope that he will change back leading him to think that he has to adapt. Obviously, being trans in any way is fairly rare (0,1%, if not less), but then again surviving the killing curse is also unlikely and statistics laughs at our estimation on how something is so unlikely that it is functionally (but not practically) impossible.

Another important thing to note is that, technically, a Harry who wasn't trans most likely would become a trans man after such a change. Obviously he wouldn't have as much emotional baggage of the same kind that trans men tend to do, but if we were to invalidate feelings on the basis of lack of experience with certain things we'd probably have to just nuke ourselves so let us not discount it based on such reasons.

That said, I believe that making the sex/gender/both/whatever change in any way related to power is a bad way to go at it. I do get that there is an overarching danger that has to be dealt with and requires preparation of some kind, but there are enough ways of handling that (make the story more AU to remove that danger; make the story happen after the danger is no more; centre the story on whatever it is you want to explore with it and finish the story before the danger is involved; explore the interactions with the danger realistically and simply don't deviate in the power level if you cannot give a sensible in-story reason for why the change would cause it to happen.

To add to that, male and female characters can behave differently due to the difference in hormones, but it does not apply to everyone and the exact differences also vary from person to person, and that is in addition to the comfort or discomfort of being in what they see as their own body or not their own body, the potential discomfort from the shock of the change itself, and the exact personality of the person. For example, it is said that testosterone makes one more aggressive, but for a person like Harry who pretty much wears his heart on his sleeve it is possible that with nary any testosterone (women do have some, just as men have some oestrogen) he wouldn't mellow because most of his aggression comes from his emotions and female hormones can in turn amplify that to a degree. There is also the fact that any change in behaviour even if the hormones were completely reshuffled probably won't happen until an appropriate trigger happens, so you might get a Harry who is a trans girl and wants to act super-feminine but wouldn't dare wear a skirt unless somehow someone forces her into one, or you might get whatever other situation because there is a lot of possibilities there.

*And now to the fun part where I start rambling:*

Now, if I were to actually try write a story of this kind, I think I'd make Harry a metamorphmagus ... somehow (stray gene from Lily, don't ask), make his gender “something”, make the first change occur as a result of Harry seeing that people treat girls better and wishing really hard that he were a girl, and then make the whole thing about exploration of identity. Obviously, it all hangs on the assumption that metamorphmagic can actually change the body to the degree Polyjuice Potion can, which is not guaranteed but I believe it to be a fair assumption for as long as one does not insist it to be canon.

So you would have a “Harry”, who had a girl's body but could change to a boy's body but didn't know how it mattered /for him/ but only for other people, who “obviously was a boy because people say he is a boy”. And then you could have some people, people he did not know before, actually think that he is a girl because it's obviously a girl, and some other people hear “Harry” and think “Harry? Not for a girl. Is it Harri, or Harriet, or maybe Henrietta?”. Then Harry (or Harriet? Henrietta? Who exactly was she?) would decide that maybe she is allowed to be a girl even if sometimes he has to be a boy too, and at that point she ... he ... they? Let's just say Harry, Harry would hear about the Boy-Who-Lived. Is that him, or her, or is that someone else and people are just mistaken? /Who/ is Harry, for Harry?

Some people would see Harry and think he has to be a boy, others would see Harry and think she has to be a girl, yet others would have no idea. McGonagall would probably be the former if only for the rules, Snape because he would be too entrenched in his own feelings to notice, Draco because obviously Harry Potter cannot be a girl. But then Ron would switch pretty easily because it doesn't matter to him, Ollivander would probably try to humour the person by at least not insulting their feelings, and Dumbledore would try to understand if that could possibly allow Harry to be a child for a bit longer.

And then Harry could come to the conclusion that all of those, a boy, a girl, anything else, he or she is all of that. But if Harry can also change into other people then does that mean that Harry can be other people too? Would that mean that there really is no Harry and it's all just other people? Is anything he can change into actually real?

Harry would obviously stay in the boys' dorm room, because why not, he can be a boy. And then there would come the 4th year and the accusations from his dormmates, after which he, or maybe she, would just pack her things and go ask Hermione if she could spend a few nights there because the boys are getting bloody annoying. Some girls would understand, the others would not, but in all of it ... if Harry is a boy, how did he get the the girls' dorms? So now the others too would ask /who/ Harry is.

And Tom? I have no idea, maybe it would be the same as in the original story, maybe it would go better, or maybe the change would result in Harry unable to actually win and thus in him/her dying. As I wrote, “exploration”.

So yeah, that kind of thing.

** I would make Snape and Malfoy fall in love with and fight over her. From the first page on. And Ron be a fucked up rapist, Hermione the Queen of Knowledge and Dumbledore the Puppeteer who made it all happen because of reasons. Probably the Greater Good. Then I would introduce some never mentioned before side-character as the 'real' love interest. Of course that person has all the answers to end Voldemort (who is probably also in love with her. Can't have weird ships without Voldemort suddenly 'knowing love'.

Oh, no wait. I wouldn't.

**** Honestly, given how obsessed that man is with Lily Potter, a good author may be able to write some believable projecting of feelings from Snape onto Harry.

** I remember reading one, "From the Ashes of Magic" (I think that was the name, but I'm unsure). In OotP, Harry goes through a complete transformation while he's asleep, and wakes up as a girl. Tonks helps him come to terms with what happened.

Would that still fall under the Assault category? It feels like it would, in terms of reaction, only there'd be no single person to blame, it was just some freak magical accident.

Also, this thread is gold for any genderswap stories, and it's going into my fanfiction bookmarks.

** If this were to happen, I wouldn't change his personality (unless I planned doing so from the start), so Harry wouldn't suddenly have the urge to wear a dress or use a purse, color his hair, put in hair-clips etc. etc. (he could do stuff without all that before, this doesn't change especially since he (and mentally he'd stay more or less male IMHO) wasn't raised that way - so no heels, no purses, no dresses or skirts, no handbags, no makeup etc. - hell, in a way I've just described my ideal woman :) as I don't like girly girls much!)

I would also write him as wanting to return to being male and maybe even researching it himself (I am sure most wouldn't want to have gender re-assignment!) and having others (Hermione, Remus, Neville, Dumbledore - hell, even Snape!) look into it and maybe even offering temporary solutions (a glamour charm tied to an object for example, so no simple finite cancels it or a transfiguration that's password locked or something)

If he can't go back (and can't live with the situation) you might have a SUICIDAL Harry on your hand (even if it's stuff like: You were changed to a boy to hide that you aren't or some such trope)...growing up one gender and suddenly being another (natural, accident, attack etc. it doesn't matter!), even if it's your original one would screw you over BADLY!)

If it was an attack, I think Harry would be vicious and demand punishment for the attacker (at least expulsion!), hell he might go for a pound of flesh if the guilty party were getting off lightly (he'd involve Sirius (if he's still alive), Remus etc. in a revenge scheme)...hell, he might demand that the person who did it undergo the same attack ("An eye for an eye" and in wizard britain there might even be laws for that sort of thing, especially since Harry is the last of his name!) or be killed outright (note: That's probably what I'd demand - not that I'd get it, Germany doesn't have the death-penalty anymore!)

I described the "past" thing already ;) (it would fuck our "hero" up badly, hell, he might start hating his parents for what they have done to him! Same for everybody else who knew! He'd resent them all for letting it happen or actively making it happen!)

Voluntary? - He (she?) would be elated probably

If it were to work out, Harry (or whatever name is chosen for the "new" Harry) would probably become a tomboyish girl (no refined "lady" - Hell, he would probably tell you were you can stick your makeup!) sticking with male manners and refusing stuff like chivalry etc. (without being some kind of Feminist)

ps: For me the best female Harry fictions are the ones where Harry is a female from the start (note: The more tomboyish the better however, as I said girly girls aren't my thing!)...I've read very few fictions that pulled off the switch convincingly (nope: Don't know which, I don't save a lot of links I just read too much fanfiction!)

** If you're sticking with the canon timeline change the pronouns at your own peril. Or if you do change how Harry refers to themself, don't change how anyone bar their closest friends refer to them unless you're doing a major AU story. The reason for this is because in the actual real world 1990's trans people weren't well known or accepted, being trans was still a social taboo, and their was still a lot of violence/mistrust/misinformation against the lgbt community in general. Especially because the 90's were coming right on the tail of the HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980's. Add in the pureblood culture and frankly victorian era ideals that HP fandom seems to love and I can't imagine a very accepting wizarding world existing at that time period.
