Okay, bear with me. I realise what I'm asking for is highly unlikely to exist, but what the hell.

1) Okay first of all, a Princess Bride AU, starring Princess Pottercup. It can be fem Harry, or just male and hates being called a princess. With a plot attempting to cause a war between the Kingdom of Hogwarts and the neighbouring Beauxbatons. Harry is rescued from his reluctant marriage to Prince Voldemort by the stable girl Weasley (Westley-->Weasley seems obvious), or a stable boy. I don't mind which Weasley, I don't mind slash. I just need this line to be included: "Hello. My name is Neville Longbottom. You killed (tortured-to-madness) my father. Prepare to die."

2)Something like American Horror Story: Ilvermorny? Don't know where this came from, I haven't actually read any fics set in the school but it's been stuck in my mind since I thought about it. Also if anyone could point out a decent fic which includes this line from Voldemort: "Surprise bitch. I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me."

3)Something set in a culinary school? I started to write a sort of crossover fic with the Great British Bake Off ages ago and it's sort of on hiatus, but was wondering if anyone else has ever attempted anything like it. Lavish and mouth watering depictions of food would be greatly appreciated.

4)Okay so a bit of a weird one. I'm looking for a story which involves a transfiguration spell using Moody's prosthetic leg and a beginner's guide to Apparition which causes someone to be whisked away to a mysterious place where the conversation may go something like this:

"T..t..t..that's... a cow..." Hermione whispered.

"I..i..it's... standing up..." Ron turned even paler as the creature came into full view. "Why is it holding... a battle-axe?"

"Cows don't have opposable thumbs..." Hermione scrunched her eyes shut and shook her head rapidly. "This isn't happening..."

Harry finally managed to click his mouth shut and quickly reached for his friends' arms and gripped them tightly. The bipedal cow was heading straight for them. It opened it's mouth and uttered these most terrifying words, "Moo. Moo, moo moo. MOO!"

"RUN!" Harry screamed, as he dragged Ron and Hermione away from the nightmarish creature.

Points to you if you get the reference. Why oh why did I install it again?

Ahahaha, yes I am slightly drunk right now. Ohh, finally I'll end with a question you could actually answer. Amazon is doing a 3 month Kindle Unlimited trial promotion that I'm about to take advantage of. Not entirely sure what's included in the 'over 1 million books' being advertised, but would appreciate some recommendations nevertheless.

Thank you!!!

*** Oh dear, I was giddy with excitement when I saw there was a reply, but I suppose love is just as good. =)

I honestly thought that the first reply would be to question my sanity (or my level of drunkeness drunkedness drunkness chrome keeps telling me I'm wrong) so it's definitely better than that.

** I know Child of the Storm had Moody's leg used in a ritual to reconstitute Loki, since stealing Mad-Eye's leg would be something Loki would do.

** Okay one more really obscure request. Is there any crossover fic with Fallen London/Sunless Sea? Basically a sort of Victorian/Lovecraftian/Gothic setting with ratcatchers, devils and cannibalistic sailors?
