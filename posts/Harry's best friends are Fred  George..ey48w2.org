Instead of Ron & Hermione, it's Fred & George. I'm specifically looking for fics where they're his best friends instead the original two, not that the twins are added onto the three.

Bonus points if the fic features some [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ctw66v/twinspeak_done_right/][good twinspeak]]. Little/none at all is just fine too though.

Any recommendations?

Harry is raised by Hagrid at Hogwarts. Harry becomes a Weasley children secret passed on from older to younger. Ends just as Harry have been sorted. It's abandoned, but author still write so there's a possibility of more.

*** Very enjoyable short read. Thanks for the rec. While I'd enjoy more if this Harry the fic still feels complete to me as a tiny slice of life.
