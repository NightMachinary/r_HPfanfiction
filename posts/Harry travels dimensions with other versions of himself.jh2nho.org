Looking for a fic that had Harry travel through dimensions and find different versions of himself and take them with him. They ended up with what was basically an army of Harry's divided into groups by their house(I think). There was also a version of Harry from a universe in which magic was exchanged for technology and Voldemort was some kind of Robot/AI. I think they also fought an army of Voldemorts as well.
