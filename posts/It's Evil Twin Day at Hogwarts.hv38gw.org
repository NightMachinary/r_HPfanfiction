After a potion accident in sixth year, Ron is suddenly split into two, his regular canon self and his worst possible fanfic self. They are physically identical, so evil-emotionalAbuser-alcoholic-horny-BadInBed Ron is making a mess for regular Ron all around school. The evil Ron keeps repeating to Harry in every class that his parents are dead and slaps Lavender's butt whenever Hermione is around. The trio is desperate for a solution, as things can't possibly go worse, when suddenly, they do. Evil Ron finds the splitting potion and manages to unleash other evil versions about Hogwarts. So as dark-superedgy-20AnimagusForms Harry goes about collecting snake pets, hearltess-potionMasterSeductress-HyperCondescending Hermione is taking over the school. All is chaos, and no one knows what's evil-Ginny's next plan to sneak a love potion into Harry. The trio needs to hurry up and get rid of the evil versions once and for all, before they unleash the greatest foe they can possibly imagine: Manipulative-MoneyStealer-AllIsASecret Dumbledore!!!


** Hermione would stop hitting people in the arm & face (and stealing their memories) and start beating them to death and just ripping their heads off.

*** "Hermione, you can't do that!"

"Oh for crying out loud, are you daft? I just did it," she sneered, "Besides, it's not like it hasn't been done before, someone ripped a students head off before. YOu would know if you only knew how to read. It's in Hogwarts, A History." she told Ron as she stood up, "Oh, you're pathetic, I'm leaving. Have to find out who has the larger dick... Draco or Snape"

***** evil-Hermione returned, looking relaxed.

Hermione glared at her, "You didn't really... went to them. Malfoy and Professor Snape."

Ron was staring at both Hermiones.

evil-Hermione bit her lip as she giggled, "Of course I did, Draco's dick is smaller. And, Ron, did you know that Snape's pubes are as greasy as the hair on his head?"

"Merlin, why are you telling me this!?"
