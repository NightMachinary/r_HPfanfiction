So I'm currently writing a story where one of the main will end up tortured into submission by Voldemort.\\
I want this to be relatively realistic, in the sense that the MC is not awed, does not have a sudden adoration or stockolm-syndrom for the Dark Lord, but is genuinely terrified and somewhat broken/insane by what has been done and fear reprisal if he disobeys.

But I lack ideas as to how to proceed. I'd like something more psychological than physical, and avoid the crucio, which has been overdone in my opinion and lacks originality, no matter how effective it can be. Nothing sexual, either.

So if some of you have any idea, I'd be insanely grateful

**** I would also like to add that with Magic, you can heal almost anything. So you have instant gratification stick and carrot. Put the character in a /lot/ of pain, and ask them for a small simple thing, and you can make the pain go away immediately. But they know the pain can be back as quickly as it went away. But Theon is a brilliant example to work with.

***** You'll also need to be more thorough. A lot of torture can be psychological, as if a person gets a finger cut off, they know that that finger is never coming back for the rest of their life. I'd crack very very quickly if a torturer started permanently maiming me.

With magic and illusions, you could shake it up even more. Is that pain real, or is it an illusion? Did I really cut your wand hand off this time, or is it another illusion? Did your best friend really just get killed in front of you?

Great, now I want a sadistic illusion master fic.

**** I wouldn't mind helping to edit what you end up writing! I am an editor, mostly for professional items like cover letters and resumes, but I'm also pretty good at fiction. I can highlight areas that sound awkward or clunky and suggest better wording. And of course spelling and grammar! Also I generally like well-done dark fiction so I would probably enjoy the hell out of it too.

** I wouldn't avoid the curcio, its overdone because its canon. Its the best torture spell there is. All I'd suggest is that people, gryffindors or Hufflepuffs especially can probably endue a lot more themselves than they'd be willing to accept done on their friends and family. If you're after a reluctant submission you have an easy way out with family and friends. It also avoids a lot of the potential creepyness and gore that could arise in a detailed torture scene which would make me feel uneasy and I'm sure plenty of others too. There is a fine line between realism and sickening. Torture isn't nice, its never good and should never be glorified. Make sure you aren't sounding sick and twisted yourself. Remember someone with nothing to lose doesn't care what happens to them. You have to provide motivation, something they care enough they would ignore their sense of right and wrong. Something they would be willing to sacrifice their soul over.

*** I fully agree that torture is not nice, I do not plan on glorifying it, but I need it for my plot device. Someone suggested to make the torture off-screen, and I'm actually tempted to go with that.

It's also why I don't want stockolm-syndrom or any form of positive worshipping from my character.

You make very good points, and gave me a new way to see my fic I had no thought what with friends/family. thank you!

**** Yeah, don't over the top. I tend to write about the before and aftermaths of the torture, both physical and sexual. I explore the fear, anticipation of pain and then the issues after like injuries and PTSD and the anger aspect and even feelings of betrayal.

Go for the the fade to black method. It really lets us imagine what could have happened, instead of showing it to us, otherwise it's too gratuitous and the fic ends up existing for shock value and that's something I try to avoid.

Also google medieval torture methods and even modern stuff to give you ideas. Some stuff people invented is absolutely horrifying.

** I've found a combination of dementors and the imerious curse works well. In one of my stories Harry is conditioned to stab Ron and Hermione as he associates murdering his friends with the dementors direct absense. This is also on top of both Voldemort and the Horcrux within Harry possessing him so Harry's flicks between consciousness and their own, so Harry can't follow his own actions.

Not sure which character you're using, but I hope this gives you some inspiration :)

** Is the tortured-to-be (tortee?) responsible? Does it feel great sympathy for others? If so, have the torturer parade in young children and then use sectumsempra on one. "The rest and more will die. Slowly. Painfully. Unless you do as I order." Have the tortee so cowed and fearful for the children it does as told and tells no one else to save the children.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** I read something somewhere (real specific, right?) where when a person is water boraded, they VERY quickly crack, as it is less pain (as in "classical" torture and the Crutacious curse) and more the body's natural instinct of survival at all costs. In the exaple I read, the victim will usually ask for it to stop within 10~15 seconds. Victims can also develop a phobia of water, to the point of be terrified of a shower. Hope that helps.

*** Of course you can ask! My story is a dark and tragic Tokyo Ghoul/ Harry Potter crossover.

Title: On a Twig, Looking Up The Sky.\\
Summary:\\
Survivor of the 24th ward, Akane Watanabe decides to flee japan in haste, right before its lockdown. Her destination? Britain.\\
Little does she know that she left her previous cage for a much smaller one. Although shackled and willfully ignorant of the world she stepped in, Akane will stop at nothing for her freedom, even if she has to eat everyone along the way, including herself.

Both title and summaries are for the work-in-progress I currently have. First Draft summary, too, so it's rough.\\
They will probably change, as not all story is currently planned out. I also won't post it until it's fully finished, so it's not hosted anywhere but on my drive.

It does not have a good/happy ending.

** Hmm...just a thought, based on something very twisted I saw...what if you had your bad guy present the torture happening as the 'merciful' option?

Take your victim, do some testing or preliminary torture, then tell them they'll be executed. Then subject them to crucifixion, bury them alive, let a dementor get near them, etc...but then 'change your mind' and let one of your minions spare their life, on the assumption that the victim might still be useful.

From there, you have your victim convinced that their continued life/soul is a privilege, and that they /will/ lose it if they disobey or fall behind in training.

The character will be changed, there will be emotional, physical and psychological permanent consequences on her psyche. The torture is there as a plot-device, not because of a fantasm.
