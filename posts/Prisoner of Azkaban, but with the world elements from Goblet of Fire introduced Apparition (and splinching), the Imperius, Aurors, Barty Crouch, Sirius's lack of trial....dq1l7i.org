Because Peter Pettigrew sounds a lot less guilty when he claims 'I Apparated away but splinched my finger off' instead of 'I cut my finger off then turned into a rat'. Not forgetting the existence of the Imperius Curse and Obliviate and all the other mind-altering magic around.

Also, having Aurors guard the castle instead of (or at least in addition to) the Dementors is probably more sensible.


** Do you mean in the Shrieking Shack scene? As a defense? I could see that working...

“I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat.”

“Innocent, but scared,” squealed Pettigrew. “I wanted to confront him when I heard what had happened.”

“You?” asked Sirius incredulously. “Confront me? You've been scared of your own shadow ever since we met on the train in first year.”

“You killed them!” roared Pettigrew, before he took a step back, as if scared of his own emotional outburst. “They were my friends, too. And you betrayed them! We trusted you.” He took a few calming breaths and turned towards Remus again. “But he attacked me right away. Blew up the whole street, laughing like a maniac. I managed to apparate away - just in time. But you know I've never been good at apparating. I splinched myself. Lost my finger. I was so scared afterward, of him - I had not heard that he got arrested until much later - I went into hiding. Abroad. For years. Only when I came back did I find out that everyone thought me dead and that Sirius had been arrested.”

“But why not show yourself then?” Remus asked. “I could have needed a friend. Why live as a rat?”

“I thought no one missed me. And better they think I died a hero than lived a coward. I stayed at Hogwarts, hoping to one day meet James' son, hoping that by stayig close to him I could protect him should the need ever arise.”

Makes more sense as a story than the crappie lie he told them. He'd had enough time to come up with a good cover story.

Yeah, that doesn't jive very well. If he wanted to sell the Apparition story, he needed to actually show up afterwards.

*** Yeah, and if Pettigrew were still alive, you'd have to assume there would be a trial and some Veritaserum, if it's just Black's word against Pettigrew's.

Pettigrew had to be thought dead for his subterfuge to work.

*** I think a strong argument could be made that he would not want to show up if the Sirius-is-evil version of events is true.

Peter, insecure and uncharismatic as he is, followed his brave and cool friends into the order. He probably has very few, if any, other connections to other wizards. Add in some depression, existential angst.. whatever. He has a mum, but there could have easily been conflict that soured their relation.

Then Remus was thought to have turned on them, so he drifted out of the friend group. Self-flagellating-Remus just accepts his friends don't want him around anymore and never tries to convince them otherwise while diving head-first back into his infiltration mission.

Now there are two possible ways we end up at the next canon station.

Either evil-Sirius was the secretkeeper and betrayed the Potters. Then Peter tried to catch him and it goes as expected, he gets riggity wrecked by a better duelist and flees.

Or evil-Sirius was the caster of the fidelius and just also was a secret keeper, besides Peter. So Peter seeks him out in confusion after the Potter's death and again, gets nearly killed for trying to grief James with his only remaining friend.

So now Peter is down to zero friends, panicked and scared in a world that never manages to clean up after Voldemort and his merry gang of terrorists. Is Peter as a known Order member, the one whose clumsy duel with Sirius got Voldemort's right hand man imprisoned, in danger?

If being a rat is nice - Which it might be? Maybe you are in a perpetual state of cuddly, furry bliss. Rats seem kind of happy. - It wouldn't be such a stretch.

**** Considering that Lupin is alive and not in any danger despite being a werewolf, Peter never attempted to contact his living mother, and he lived as a rat in multiple young boys' rooms, no, that actually doesn't fit.

**** Peter could even point out that Voldemort managed to turn Sirius Black to his side, someone who James and Lily both trusted to be their secret keeper. Having your best friend be revealed to be Voldemort's right hand man would definitely give you major trust issues and make you wonder who else he may have turned.

** Not related to Goblet of Fire, but I would love to see Harry discover his father being a bully in his third year - the year that is actually supposed to be about him. I wonder if the stag Patronus and Dumbledore's words would help him overcome his father being a prick.

Or his Patronus might actually turn out to be a doe, rather than a stag.

You know I think that's further discrimination against muggle-borns. Who cares about the muggle-born mother, it's not like she's important.

******* Who says it hasn't happened before? And remember that Voldemort was specifically after the kid, not her. He'd have let her live, in all likelyhood, had she not chosen to sacrifice her life for his.

Couple that with the nature of the spell, and that it was Voldemort's signature as much as the dark mark, and you've got a legend. A reflected cutting curse that beheads the caster or dolohov's entrail curse would still be impressive, but not as earth-shattering as the killing curse, which can not be escaped.

"Of course! Sirius cannot remember that he curse me, nor when he pledge loyalty to V-Voldemort because they were happy memories. Dementors sucked them all. He only remember being friends with James because he was always jealous of Potter happy family" -said Peter the silvertongue. Remus frowned.
