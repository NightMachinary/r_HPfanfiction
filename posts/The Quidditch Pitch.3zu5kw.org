Did anyone manage to archive thequidditchpitch.org before it went down? It had some fairly good stories that could only be found on that website. I found an archive of some of the interviews conducted by the leaders of the site, but nothing else.


** I got most of it, but it's all mixed in with with my other downloaded fanfics so I can't share all of them right now, but if there's a specific fic you're after, let me know the author and title and there's a 90% chance I'll have it. Some people have said before that a lot of TQP fics are now hosted on AO3.

Once I finish the fic I'm currently writing (which I hope to do within the next two weeks, at the latest) then I will go through my fic archive and seperate out the ones that are actually no longer available online, make a list of them, and post it.

*** Bumping for posterity. I couldn't actually give you the name of the fic, merely that it was PWP Harry/Tonks, and set in a greenhouse.

*** Hello, I've been hunting for the outtakes to The Price of Love by Rogue Sugah. The titles of the specific outtakes in checkmated were "Behind Closed Doors" and "Truth and consequences". I'm not sure what format she had on the Quidditch pitch, if it was all one story or separated like on checkmated. The pg-13 version is posted on ff.net, but not the outtakes. If you could send those tome I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much!

*** Can't remember the title, it was a Harry/Luna story with a bdsm theme. One of the first chapters began with them having sex in the astronomy tower after Dumbledore died. And in one of the chapters she came to him and they went to a music shop, I remember one of them buying a radiohead album. I hope you know the fic and I hope you have it too.

Also HP and the unbreakable bond was good and had good art in it too.

*** Do you have "Now or Never" or "Secrets and Second Chances?" Both are Scorpius/Rose stories. One was made by Rose_starr and the other by Potterhead37. Thank you in advance!

**** I don't have "Secrets and Second Chances", but I may have "Now or Never". I have a story called that by queenb23, but after some Googling I think it's the same person. This is the summary provided on the fic I have:

#+begin_quote
  There was no questioning that her competition with Scorpius Malfoy was right personal, and Rose Weasley intended to win at all costs.  Unfortunately, somewhere along the line, a different kind of conflict arose, and for the first time in her life, she was less than confident about conquering
#+end_quote

It's 181,000 words, 31 chapters, Fluff/Romance, M-rated. Does this sound like the right fic?
