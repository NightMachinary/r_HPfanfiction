Basically anyone who doesn't read hp slash regularly but maybe came across one or two you really liked. What were they? Doesn't have to be complete but It would be nice.

Edit : Even though it has romance it doesn't have to be a romantically focused fic. It can be plot based and it just happens to also have a romance thats m/m .


** Romance bores me most of time, so I like more plot filled stuff with any potential shipping as a back burner, so these will probably be things you like.

So, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15809817][One to Speak, Another to Hear]] by seventymilestobabylon) is a really good one because the Remus/Sirius aspects are a great character/dynamic study more than anything else.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/809346][leave no stone unturned (a series of standalones)]] has some fantastic fics with a mix of stuff in it. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13281801][The Age of Lies]] by TheDivineComedian) is probably my favorite in it. Remus/Sirius isn't a huge feature.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366][face death in the hope]] by LullabyKnell) is technically a romance but it's so slowburn it's almost nonexistent.

  The Wizarding Wars are over, but the work of recovery has only begun. Remus Lupin is trying to find his place in an ever-changing world, and when he is invited to serve on a truth and reconciliation commission, he has to confront the truth that lives there---in the past and within himself.

** This is so far the one and only slash fic I unreservedly enjoyed. Strong trio friendship, protective!Ron and the romance was enjoyable even though I don't read slash usually:

linkffn(2519543)

EDIT: Wow, it is from 2005... I remember reading it while he was posting the chapters. How time flies.

EDIT2: Oh, I just remembered, trigger warnings for sexual abuse for this one. Mostly in the past and only talked about and not explicitly written if I remember correctly, but better to put it in here.
