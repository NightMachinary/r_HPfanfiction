Yes please see the title! :) I think it would be a possibility with his huge interest in nonmagic world that he would get immersed in it and maybe he would meet a nonmagic person and fall in love and marry them? :) Even if it is a one shot or something I would like to see this /somewhere/! Has it ever happened in fanfiction?


** Good point. Amusingly enough, /McGonagall/ is the one who almost married a muggle in canon.

*** She almost did that? That is so interesting and are there a lot of fanfics about her being married to a muggle at the time of Harry's years? :) Maybe she brings him to her house for a summer?

**** No... she /almost/ did. Almost being the operative word. Because of the Statute of Secrecy, she wasn't allowed to tell the muggle about magic before they were officially married, and she didn't want to force him into marriage without telling her the truth about what she was. In the end, fearing that he'd leave her for "lying" to him if she went ahead with the marriage, she left him without an explanation.

*** That could work! What if Molly died at the end of the first war like Lily and James did and then Arthur moves on and marries a nonmagic person? :)
