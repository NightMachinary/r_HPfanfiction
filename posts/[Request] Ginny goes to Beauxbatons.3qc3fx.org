Looking for a fanfiction I read once where Ginny goes to Beauxbatons after the second book and everyone has the memory of it wiped. She meets Harry at some point, and there's arguing if they should let them have their memories back.

Also looking for one where Harry is seemingly intelligent and builds a small settlement where Ron etc. lives nearby and at some point he investigates and copies the Room of Requirement and puts one in his own house. Oh, and Fawkes is there too I think.

*** This story started off pretty well, and I liked the mystery of why their memories got wiped but it started getting weird near the end. Especially the semi-random all the girls are pregnant subplot.
