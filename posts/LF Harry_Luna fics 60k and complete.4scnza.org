** Harry Potter and the Rejected Path Linkffn(6375811) is something I highly recommend, even if you are not normally into the multi genre. Luna plays a MAJOR roll in this one, and honestly is the driving force behind Harry.

/Note:/ I dont think its complete, but at nearly 400k words, its plenty of material and well worth a look, especially for Luna lovers.

**** I dont remember that part but its entirely possible. Its been ages since I read it but I just remember that its a very "dark" story in certain ways and Luna is by no means "an innocent" in it. It is a bit uh... smutty, but I always found it to be an amazing Luna fic in terms of an outside the box character study.

** Linkffn(Conlaodh's Song)

It's just about 60k words, but admittedly Luna is not very central to the story. Also, while it is technically completed, I will warn you that the ending is a direct set up for a sequel that I'm not sure we will ever see.

It does have a prequel, linkffn(By the Divining Light) Luna doesn't feature at all if I remember correctly though.

These are both amazingly written stories though, with one of the best Dumbledores I've read in fanfiction.
