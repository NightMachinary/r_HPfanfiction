I recently re-read the only story I know featuring a flamboyantly gay Harry and had a good laugh. So that send me wondering if there were more stories to be found around the internet which feature a flamboyant or just really obviously gay Harry (or anyone, really, as long as it's funny).

The story I am referring to is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1297222/1/][Harry Potter and the Pretty Sorcerors Balls]] and its sequel is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1457517/1/][Harry Potter and the Slippery Secret]].


** Unfortunately if you're looking for the over the top silly funny of those two. That's the only remotely well written stories right there. There are tonnes more "Haha look how badly written all this Harry/Snape slash is" but otherwise...well good luck :P

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3870764/1/A-Different-Start-American-Harry-Prequel]]

This is a good one, but it hasn't been updated in a couple of years and Harry is only 11 at the current point, but it is the most realistic showing of a gay 11 year old Harry I have ever found in fanfic. This author captures a child's mindset well and leaves you laughing constantly. You believe he is gay and is comfortable with that fact (mostly) because she shows the process of him figuring it out and his worry about acting "too" gay.

** I read this years ago and immediately thought of it when I saw your post: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2366955/1/The-Happy-Red-Prince][The Happy Red Prince]]. It's unfinished unfortunately, but does feature the campiest Harry I've ever read.

*** With funny fics in such short supply I mostly don't care if they are unfinished. Thanks for your suggestion.
