Remus is one of my favorite characters and I love to read his and harry's interactions in fanfic, since I don't think there's enough in the books (which is canon, I suppose, Remus has a lot of issues etc). Anyway, I would love some recs of remus and harry bonding fics (or fics with those moments in it). What I don't like: Harry being raised by Remus since he were a small child. I would be ok with a teenage Harry going to live with Remus over the summer, tho. Hope to hear from u guys :)

Thnks

*** Yep. I have a hard time finding good quality Harry and Remus relashionship fics at all, but I thought I would get some recs here. Also, if anyone would like to write something like that, it would be awesome.
