[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5087313/1/][Out of the Night]] has a good independent!Harry, as well as an interesting perspective on the dark. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1513042/1/][Hold Me While I'm Here]] is a particularly good time-travel fic in which Harry goes back to the time of his parents. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past]] is a /very/ good time-travel fic with going back to his younger self. Unfortunately, all of these are dead fics; but still very good.

** Taking Control is a great independent 6th year Harry fic, extremely well written. It was written after HBP came out because the author thought the horocrux plot was a copout, and was disappointed in the lack of character growth. It's Harry/Ginny, but in a much more likable way than is typical. It also features badass Neville, Minerva and Remus, which is also awesome. It's half a million words, and has a 7th year sequel that is in development now. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2954601/1/Taking_Control]]

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?chapno=1&storyid=619][After the End by Arabella and Zsenya]] - Definitely one of the greats. It was started after /GoF/ and the epilogue was published the night /OotP/ was released. It's twice as long as /OotP/. It's one of the most faithful characterizations I've ever come across and was a totally plausible ending for what we knew at the time. Brilliantly written and you fall in love with the characters again.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]] - One of the best [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail][For Want of a Nail]] fics out there. It all goes horribly wrong by the end and the only survivors are Harry, Ron, and Ginny. Nearly suicidal in their depression, they find a way to go back in time to make sure everyone survives. Make sure you read Parts II and III as well, although III hasn't been touched in 2 years.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/HPATPS.html][Barb LP's Psychic Serpent Trilogy]] - Another post-/GoF/ that covers Harry's last 3 years, I'm hesitant to suggest this. It's wonderfully written for the most part, but I've always felt there was a touch /too much/ personal drama in the relationships, as if she forgot they were just teenagers. But where the series shines is how very /British/ it feels. You get a much stronger sense of the geography and culture of the British Isles that I feel makes it worth the read. Also her oneshots [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/MATB01.html][Mad About the Boy]] and [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/HAH01.html][Horntails and Hippogriffs]] are /delightful/ and give you the fuzzies.

[[http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/stories.php?psid=2422][The F Words Series by Antosha]] - Taking place and published immediately after the last chapter of /DH/ (but before the epilogue), these are some of the most amazing fics I've ever read. You get to see the characters pull themselves together again after the Battle of Hogwarts. The next time you finish reading /DH/, start reading the series and prepare to have the bittersweet feeling held at bay for a mite longer. Although really everything by this author is amazing. His characterizations are always spot-on and his Luna is probably the best you'll find aside from Rowling's canon.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] - If you haven't read this, you need to do so immediately. The hands-down most hilarious and brilliant fanfic to come out in years. From the description: "Petunia married a professor, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter... " This should be required reading for everyone.

There are more that I could suggest but I think these represent the very best in terms of story, character, and writing. Plus it's hard to come up with these lists.

If you just type in "fanfiction" or "fanfic" or "fan fiction" or "fan-fiction" in the search reddit box to the right, you'll find more threads.

*** I can't help but feel that MoR is not really a story. More a textbook with bits of narrative in between. At best it's a fable.

A story should having a beginning, middle and end. It should have a plot. It should be going somewhere, and the reader should be able to feel that progression. MoR is just a series of stuff happening, with a bunch of lectures jammed in between.

Further, it holds both canon and the HP fandom at large in contempt. The author hasn't even read all of the books, but feels completely at ease issuing statements about what he considers the problems with canon. He also seems to think that his solutions are the only possible ones to the "problems" he sees with canon.

Personally, I feel that many of his solutions are worse than the so-called problems he sees. His transfiguration system is one example. By making transfiguration non-permanent and trying to integrate it with current scientific knowledge (e.g. atomic theory) he creates massive problems for himself. For example, he draws a somewhat arbitrary distinction between solids vs. liquids and gases.

It's not even as clever as it thinks it is (and it thinks itself very clever: the tone is insufferably smug). There's nothing in there you wouldn't know from a) taking a few 101 classes and b) using common sense. E.g. the bystander effect. I think almost everyone knows that this happens - individual people are reluctant to act in groups. Do we really make ourselves smarter or gain knowledge by giving it a name? Or are we just being self-indulgent and thinking ourselves clever?

Quantifying the degree to which someone is a bystander, and then discovering some quantifiable relation between this and likelihood of action - that would be gaining new and useful knowledge. If MoR talked about that, I'd be impressed. But it doesn't. It just mentions the bystander effect and moves on - the worst kind of name dropping. Look at me! I'm so clever! Simply observing that the bystander effect happens is the most trivial kind of science possible - going around categorising and naming those things about human behaviour that we already know.

On Topic: go to DarkLordPotter.net and look through the library there. There's hundreds of fics rated and reviewed, categorised by HP genre (e.g. independent, time travel, AU). Ignore any hysterical rants you might have heard about DLP. Contrary to popular opinion, DLP a) don't only read evil!Harry (in fact, evil!Harry is something of a minority taste there) b) don't hate Ginny (we got over our character bashing phase about 3 years ago) c) don't troll the fuck out of all new members (though if you write with text speech or bad spelling and grammar, bump year old threads, make loads of 5 word posts without significant content, start threads in the wrong sub-forum, or act like a general idiot, you are liable to be mocked).

**** He says himself how he views the overall structure in the introduction to the first chapter:

#+begin_quote
  The pacing of the story is that of serial fiction, i.e., that of a TV show running for a predetermined number of seasons, whose episodes are individually plotted but with an overall arc building to a final conclusion.
#+end_quote

And he's certainly not the first author to use fiction as a medium for the spreading of personal values/philosophy/etc..

While it's certainly a valid criticism that the story tends to drag on (though the pace is fine for me), the idea that it's somehow deficient for not /yet/ having finished is rather silly.

Even if he hadn't read the books, he knows enough about the plot to know that there /are/ problems with Rowling's world that a more scientifically minded person would have thought out in greater depth. Just because he hasn't read them doesn't mean his criticisms aren't valid. And this is from someone who holds the /Potter/ series as his favorite books series (which is saying something).

He draws an arbitrary distinction between the different phases of matter because there are essentially arbitrary differences between the phases of matter as they pertain to Transfiguration, which you would learn of in an introductory chemistry class.

It's surprising that you mention that the topics covered in his writing could be derived from common sense but make the completely baseless and nonsensical claim that you "think almost everyone knows that [they happen]". The fact that one has to learn something, and that many people first encounter the subject matter within his story, makes that an astoundingly silly thing to say.

He's one of the founders of Less Wrong, a blog dedicated to "refining the art of human rationality", which includes posts on epistemology, meta-ethics, and cognitive biases. He uses /MoR/ as a means of providing dialogues distilling the contents of these topics within an entertaining context. If these were areas of knowledge that were intuitively obvious to the human mind, then they wouldn't be worthy areas of research, nor would there be a need to introduce them to people. And the idea that it's "self-indulgent and thinking ourselves clever" to try and learn a bit more about how our minds work is so anti-science and pro-ignorance I'm surprised you even come to a site as liberal and pro-science as Reddit. I would think it patently obvious how in recognizing our biases (the bystander effect especially), we are better equipped to overcome them. And there's always learning for the sake of learning, but I've been learning to accept that this is something people rarely value.

There are certainly valid criticisms to make about /MoR/, and you definitely aren't entitled to like the story, but to write this very long and exceptionally poorly reasoned critique is a poor endorsement indeed for DLP (not to mention your apologetic defense of the community which was entirely unwarranted). I've been there before, but nothing there drew my interest away from more interesting and warmer /Potter/ communities that foster better writing and thoughtful analysis. If anything, you've just given me a negative opinion of the place, though I've seen some of their more laudatory contributions to the fandom.

The only vaguely active Potter forums I know of are DLP, TFF, AFC, Beyond the Veil (unofficial forum of FFA), SIYE, TTHM. Of these, only DLP and TFF have the kind of activity that requires checking more than once a week, and only DLP has the kind of activity worth checking daily. All the other old HP communities are now pretty much dead: Mugglenet, HPANA, FictionAlley/Schnoogle, TLC, Portkey, PhoenixSong, HPFF.

Maybe there are some niche websites out there that still have activity (i.e. slash and Snape-centric forums) but I don't know of any mainstream active communities other than DLP.

***** Congratulations on not being able to read. Some clarification:

  While it's certainly a valid criticism that the story tends to drag on (though the pace is fine for me), the idea that it's somehow deficient for not yet having finished is rather silly.
#+end_quote

This is not what I said. My point was not that the story hasn't ended, but that it has no direction. There is no plot. The reader doesn't feel like we're progressing towards some goal or climax. It's just stuff happening.

#+begin_quote
  Just because he hasn't read them doesn't mean his criticisms aren't valid.
#+end_quote

Logically, no. Not having read the books doesn't logically exclude him from being able to make valid criticisms. However, it just so happens that he does make criticisms about the books that would be solved if he had bothered to read them and therefore find out the answer to his problem. Transfiguration is just one example. There's nothing wrong with canon Transfiguration.

Regarding the states of matter, the point is this: in MoR, transfiguration introduces danger when transfigured substances mix with natural ones, become part of the structure of that thing, then disappear/revert. This can happen with solids as much as liquids and gases. Therefore the idea presented in MoR - that transfiguration of solids is safe, but liquids and gases not - is clearly flawed.

#+end_quote

You have missed my point entirely.

I never attacked cognitive science, psychology, decision theory, and the like. These are all worthy sciences. My attack is against MoR alone. I'm not saying it's too scientific. I'm saying it's not scientific enough. It's not even at the level of a "for dummies" book. It doesn't introduce these concepts well at all. It name-drops them and moves on with a smug tone, as if naming things was enough. We learn absolutely nothing that we don't already know from being socially capable human beings by saying "People often don't volunteer to do things if they're part of a group - let's call this the bystander effect". You see this in action almost every day. Calls for volunteers happen frequently in both classroom and work environments. We all know about this aspect of human behaviour already. Telling people the name of this thing is not spreading science. It's semantics.

If it's going to fail as fiction in pursuit of advertising ideas, it should at least try to do those ideas justice.

It's going somewhere. It's just going very slowly. Some might say excruciatingly slowly. But slowly nonetheless.

It's not so much that there's something wrong with Transfiguration, but there are several open questions that Rowling is unlikely to have considered that are absolutely valid. The idea that liquids and gases are not safe to transfigure is absolutely an idea consistent with what we know about Transfiguration from canon, and is suitable to exploration within a fanfiction story. It's not flawed because you say it is.

So you're saying he's name-dropping because he didn't write /Thinking, Fast and Slow/? His writing is meant to be an introduction to the concepts. He utilizes the circumstances of the plot as anecdotes to explain the ideas in a way that are accessible to layman. The notion that these are ideas that we all know is extraordinarily absurd and shows how completely removed from you are from society. There's a reason why psych 101 students are shocked and amazed on an annual basis when introduced to these ideas. They may be obvious in hindsight, but there's a reason it took us until the last 40-50 years to discover them. It isn't mere semantics. It provides an explanation for what we observe that we can recognize and, when the need arises, hopefully overcome. And within the context of the story's dialogues, he goes into perfectly adequate detail without including a textbook of information in between events. There's no need to go into the p-values or anything to explain a concept (since you brought up quantifying biases as the threshold of worthiness).

******* This may be an agree to disagree point.

My feeling is that you have to make a choice: either you're writing fiction, and have to focus on things like pace, flow, characterisation, believability, consistency, plot, setting, etc. or you choose to convey ideas, and have to focus on accuracy, comprehensiveness, and depth of understanding.

MoR aims for a middle point, and I just don't think that it's possible to do that middle point well. It ends up failing as fiction and failing as education. What we end up with is:

1. A story that's frequently interrupted by authorial-mouthpiece lectures from the characters, that has no sense of pace or direction, that frequently alternates in tone from serious to humour to deep thoughts and back again, and that is frustrating because it contains some great ideas (e.g. awesome Quirrel) that don't get to be fleshed out as they should be, and would be, in a story whose sole aim was to tell a great story.

2. An education that is shallow, simplified, and occasionally actively harmful to understanding (e.g. some of the sections on philosophy of science).

The problem is that you almost never get a satisfactory combination of the above. If you really felt that way, you wouldn't even bother reading fanfiction for how rarely all of those qualities are found in a single work. What stands for good fanfiction is usually a matter of overlooking the flaws in favor of the strengths, and making sure the ratio of the quality and quantity of the strengths to the quality and quantity of the flaws surpasses some personal threshold of decency.

Personally, I feel the strengths of /MoR/ far outweigh the faults, and the ratio of strengths to faults is far greater than the vast majority of fanfic (perhaps enough to put it into the top 20 Potter fanfic of all time).

I'm not aware of any problems with its exposition on the philosophy of science, though it's been several months since I last read the story.
