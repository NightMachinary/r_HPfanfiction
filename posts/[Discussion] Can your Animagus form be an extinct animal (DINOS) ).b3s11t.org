Yes I was thinking and I mean DINOSAURS aren't magical creatures, and I don't think magic would arbitrarily restrict itself to ONLY animals that are currently still in existence? So it is POSSIBLE that out of every mage throughout all of time, SOMEONE has to be able to become a GOSH DARN T REX!!!! Or a STEGO! :)

Yes please I'd love to hear thoughts on this and also if there are any fics with it please link them? :)


** I've seen a fanfic where the rule was that the animal had to be extant when you were born, but it doesn't matter if it goes extinct later --- so there's an Australian wizard whose Animagus form is a marsupial tiger.

*** That is what I thought about too, if it HAD to work that way. That if an animal DID go extinct you wouldn't lose access to your form if you already had it. :)

*** Perhaps you mean the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thylacine][thylacine]], because there are no marsupial tigers. Looking vaguely catlike and having stripes doesn't make you a tiger.

**** “Marsupial tiger” or “Tasmanian tiger” is an accepted (though biologically inaccurate) name for the thylacine, though it's also, amusingly, known as the "Tasmanian wolf". The Wikipedia article you linked to does in fact mention this in its lead paragraph.

***** So it's a tiger wolf. Makes sense. Kinda looks like a fox to.

The marsupial fox tiger wolf.

Or you could call it by what it is. A fucking thylacine.

****** Look, we get it. You think "Tasmanian tiger" is a silly name. But your opinion on this matter does not supersede the fact that /it is a real name for this animal/, just as valid a moniker as "thylacine".

Zoology and paleontology are /full/ of names that are inaccurate, or else a bit silly. /Basilosaurus/ is not a reptile, the Dementor Wasp is not in fact a humanoid ghostlike demon but rather an insect, etc. Those names are nevertheless perfectly acceptable.

But it is, in fact, a wasp

I also get your point, that you can call anything anything and that makes it what it is, but as you previously stated, it is inaccurate, which is my point. I added the snark for fun.

...yes it does? It literally means "King of Reptiles". The name was retained from an early point in paleontology where they thought it was a sea-based saurian akin to a plesiosaur.

** I honestly don't think that you would be able to. And not because of them not being magical creatures (you see Sirius be a black dog and Peter become a rat). But I think since basically the only animagi you can find are common animals, dinosaurs wouldn't really count. Maybe a part of the animal you want is required to become an animagi, the details aren't too clear on what you have to do to become one.

This is a world where a potion can make someone lucky, logic kinda goes out the window. And a dinosaur form would be a lot more useful than let's say.. a rat?
