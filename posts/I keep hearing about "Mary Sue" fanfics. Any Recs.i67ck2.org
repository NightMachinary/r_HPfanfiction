OC is okay, condition is that the female protag needs to be beautiful, smart, talented, not ostracized, popular etc.


** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8352390/1/My-Immortal-Original-story-reupload]])

Very well written, female OC-centric fic. It was deleted a while back, this is a reupload since it was so popular. Skip the first chapter, it just talks about the fact that it's a reupload. Enjoy!

******** A Mary Sue is the opposite if the Everyman. Although I disagree with the other commenter on what an Everyman is. I generally see the Everyman as someone like Luke Skywalker or Frodo Baggins: someone who's kind of thrust into a situation and is an average joe, but grows into a hero over time. It sounds like what they're talking about is the same, but without the character growth, which I agree would be pretty poor writing.

The Mary Sue is a goddess, perfection incarnate, who can do no wrong without even trying. Everyone likes her, even her enemies, and those who don't either begrudgingly respect her or are considered to be egregiously in the wrong. There's no struggle or real threat against the Mary Sue, because nothing can truly harm her. If she does die, it's always a self-sacrifice filled with beauty and despair, and never due to a failing on her part. She never fails, she never progresses (for what is there to to progress to when you're already perfect?), she's never wrong, she's...

Well, she's an overpowered bitch with little to no real character beyond being perfect. The trope started as fanfiction authors' self-inserts who were written as, essentially, the idealized versions of themselves, going into the story and having all the characters they like loving them, and fixing all the problems in the world that no one else could. It's boring and really shitty story-telling, and over the years has leaked out into mainstream media (tv, movies, etc., not the news). See: Ma-Rey Sue from the new Star Wars Films.

A true Average Joe.

Passive, goes with the flow.

Boring.

Passive, doesn't advance plot.

I came here to read action scenes and crackish/chaotic slice of life fics, I want action or fluff, I don't want this Joe Schmo incapable of picking a lock, I want CHAOS. Long reign the Alpacca-lypse!

Anyway, I just hate the trope. It perfectly fine if you like it tho.

in my opinion:

It's a female character that "can do no wrong", and bends the story elements to go along with this... It's this bending that tends to put people off of such fics, and Mary Sue / Gary Stue^{male version} thus tends to be used as a derogatory term.

My Imortal is an extreme case of Mary Sue, I would recommend at least watching some of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ffh7cWRrqF4][Internet Historian's reading of it]].

It's actually kind of hard to recommend any Mary Sue fic (at least for me) as any fic which I would remember/have read/want to recommend which might be considered Mary Sue would end up being so mild as to not trigger that connotation in my mind. ^{I think I might actually repress parts where these themes crop up automagically; so as to enjoy a story I'm reading}

** First, we need to define a Mary Sue. So, what is a Mary Sue ?

A Mary Sue is a character who has no difficulties during the entirety of the plot. The only ones refusing to be their friends are the bad guys, or maybe that emo gothic dude/girl who'll later bang the Mary Sue after two whole chapters of angst and "I'm sure behind that cold exterior is a heart of gold".

A Mary Sue is friend with everyone, except when the author doesn't want his character to be seen as a Mary Sue, at which point he will introduce *le gasp* conflict between characters. Expect the conflict to last as long as 5k words.

A Mary Sue has little to no difficulties practicing anything. They are a natural at everything, or they take to it extremely fast.

A Mary Sue's opponents are ALWAYS evil, and in the wrong. That, or they redeem themselves after one wrong deed and a confrontation with the Mary Sue.

A Mary Sue's kindness is infinite, and everyone should sing how much the Mary Sue is a perfect person and the world doesn't deserve them.

â€‹

If your character is all of this except he's a boy, then- uh oh, this is not a Mary Sue! But it is, instead, a not-less-rare specy known as a Gary Stu. Which is the same thing but again, for dudes.

â€‹

To put things into perspective : if something bad happens to the character *while the story is ongoing* (not as a flashback or as background information), to make him or her progress as a person and a character, then it's probably not a Mary Sue.

â€‹

Now, I would rec some fics, but I make a point of honor to not recommand anything I find badly written.

My caveat is that the struggle should inflect change/character growth on the MC. So many Mary Sue fics have a token conflict so that the author can claim 'S/he's not a Mary/Gary Sue!"

** The above comments have done a really good job hashing out what a straight Mary Sue is, so I'm just gonna rec some stuff you might like. It looks like you're looking for hypercompetent characters rather than a straight Sue, so I'll point you in that direction.

We'll start with *Victoria Potter*. Victoria is a smarter, more intuitive, more cunning, more attractive version of Harry who's sorted into Slytherin in a subtly AU world. Is she a Mary Sue? That's up to you. Is the story damn good, well written, and presents challenges to the protagonist? Absolutely.

You might also want to check out *The Pureblood Pretense*, somewhat of a crossover with Alanna the Lioness, which again features a smarter, more intuitive, more cunning version of Harry who swaps places with her male cousin to attend a pureblood-only version of Hogwarts. It's a straight power fantasy complicated only by the protagonist's slowly dissociating identity and involvement in all different corners of the wizarding world. This one's long.

*The Arithmancer* has a genius Hermione who instead of a bookworm is a math whiz, and IIRC has much better social skills than her canon self. It's a whole million-plus-word saga that's quite good, if draggy in parts.

There are more fics that have hypercompetent female characters in leading roles, but this should give you a good start. I can list some of those characters in a further comment if you want.
