:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was a lengthy oneshot written on AO3, basic premise is that following the war Harry Potter gradually becomes more distant from the rest of the Wizarding world following his revival.

The perspective changes I think, but most of it was from Hermione's POV.

Harry has lost the ability to die following his revival, and there were a bunch of lines about ‘his train having left the station'.

Sorry I cant be more specific, this fic has just really stuck with me and I wish to reread it.

*** Same, unfortunately there's not really anywhere for the story to go besides watching Harry become worse and worse as time goes on. Though I suppose you could do “x numbers of years pass, Harry has been imprisoned then /something/ happens”
