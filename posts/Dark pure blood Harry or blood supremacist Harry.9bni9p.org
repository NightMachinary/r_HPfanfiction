*** I second this, it really is shaping up to be rather solid. The characterization struggles at times but the plot is good and moves reasonably fast. Overall a very solid read and worth the time investment. I love how Harry (and Daphne)approach violence and torture, its fascinating in a strange way. The past few chapters where Harry has been struggling with the death of Sirius has been handled really rather well. Give it a read.
