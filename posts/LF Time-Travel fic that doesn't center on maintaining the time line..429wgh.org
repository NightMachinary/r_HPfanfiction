I've recently gotten into time travel fics, and have spent the last few reads on fics where Hermione gets thrown back in time and falls in love with Snape. Though all of the ones I've read, the main thing to fuel the plot is that she can't change the timeline because things have to stay the way she remembers them, otherwise she wouldn't go back in the first place or Voldemort will not disappear after trying to kill Harry and they will lose the war. She can't try to save anyone because she can't alter time. I'm looking for a fic where things change when the time travel happens, Snape doesn't become a death eater because of Hermione. They find out Pettigrew was the traitor before Sirius gets imprisoned. Snape doesn't call Lilly a mud blood and they stay friends. They go on a quest to kill the horocruxes before Voldemort comes back. Just something different than the original timeline.

Basically I'm looking for fics that traveling in time affects more than a plausible way to have Hermione and Snape be together. Any pairing is fine, and it doesn't need to be Hermione thrown in time either.

** If you're in the mood for something angsty, Tread Softly by Dius Corvus. linkffn(1847353) I don't want to say anything about the plot as it's been so long since I read this, but Iremember at the time very much liking the way it fits in with the Marauders and early days of the war, although it's probably rather overly dramatic. The original version was even more angsty and heartwrenching, but the updated version that's online now is slightly less depressing.

** Those got be the most frustrating stories of all. Imagine you are armed with advance knowledge, but can't do anything and have to watch everyone suffer and die. That's enough to drive anyone decent insane. What's the point of time travel then if you can't change anything? I think it's just a lame excuse from those authors who are too lazy to develop their own plot lines.

Fortunately, there are enough authors who know how to use advance knowledge effectively and develop their plots intelligently:

*Ginny Returns*, linkffn(4740107), has probably the most efficient way in disposing V and his death eaters, but it assumes that the Scarcrux could be eliminated by basilisk fang and phoenix tears.

*Returning to the Start*, linkffn(10687059), is more about gaining the 'new' Hermione's trust than getting rid of V and his sympathizers.

*Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), has two time travels (one backward, one forward). Most people like the back part, but some do not like the forward part (I'm actually fine with it). Harry went back without the knowledge of horcruxes, and it was Bellatrix who figured those things out.

*A Little Child Shall Lead Them*, linkffn(10871795), is how 'Hermione traveling back to the Marauder Era' should be done. There is none of the angsty and risky stuffs, just talk to Dumbledore, lay everything on the table, and let adults do the work.

*Strawberry Fields*, linkffn(4940094), is an one-shot about Dr. Who bringing the books and young Harry to the Grangers. There were some twists and Harry risked that AK from V in the graveyard. But otherwise, well written story and problems solved intelligently.
