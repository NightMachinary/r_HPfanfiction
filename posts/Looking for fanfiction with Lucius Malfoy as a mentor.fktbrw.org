:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello. I am looking for fanfiction in which there was this "Good Malfoys" trope and Lucius Malfoy was an expert on Ancient Runes but his father forbidden him to pursue it as it was not worthy of a pure-blooded heir. It was not a central point of the story, it was rather long and about Harry in Slytherin (I think). Oh, Harry and Draco gave Lucius some box with runes engraved on it. That's all I remember from it.

Besides I look for some good fanfiction in which Malfoys are mentors for Harry. Anything long, please!


** The fic was linkffn(Three Slytherin Mauraders)

  Harry & Dudley flee an abusive Vernon to Severus Snape. Severus finds a new home for himself & the boys with dragons and hunt the Horcruxes from there. The dragons, especially one become their allies. Tom R is VERY different.
