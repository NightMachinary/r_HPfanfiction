I believe that he was at the Dursley's, and it may have been Draco giving Harry his daughter for safe keeping because the mother way killed in a DE raid or something (I think she may have been a muggle or muggleborn), and he couldn't find a way to keep her safe with all the DE's hanging around the manor given her parentage? The war continues, I think the Malfoy's (or at least Narcissa) end up going into hiding in harry's room at the Dursley's eventually, and the end ship might be Drarry?

I remember really enjoying the parts where Harry is taking care of the baby and learning to parent, and if nothing else want to find the fic to reread for those sections.

**** Yeah, the fact that the kid isn't mentioned in the summary would make it hard to spot. But that's one of my absolute favorite stories, and favorite authors. I recommend all her stuff, if you haven't read the others. Malfoy Flavor is amazing, despite the atrocious title.

*** The baby is actually a very small part of the story, so you're probably not missing anything on that account. She's just the catalyst for Draco to take action to seperate himself from the Death Eaters and for Harry to change his opinion about Draco, and then others.
