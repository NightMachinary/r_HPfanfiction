Not sure if it has been done before, but I read a fic quite a while ago where Snape explained his actions in divulging the prophecy as thinking that the subject of the prophecy was likely a foreign adult wizard. Specifically it used "approaches" as coming to England and suggested the parents could have been V's victims while he was traveling and learning magic. Maybe the phophecy child or whatever was orphaned and is out for revenge. The "born as the 7th month dies" thing doesn't really preclude children born before then, especially overseas.

I can't remember the name, but in it Harry was still the prophecy child. I was thinking it would be interesting to see a fic where everyone thinks it's Harry or Neville or whatever, but actually it's some guy from Albania that no one has ever heard of. And he just waltzes in and defeats Voldemort leaving everyone stupefied.
