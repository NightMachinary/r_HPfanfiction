New fic about an aspiring Quidditch player, set post-war. Focusing on OC's but there are cameos and mentions of JKR's characters. I know most people don't like OC's but the first four chapters are up so just give it a look and see if you like it :)

** I left a review on ffn, but as I replied to your request for a beta reader and you did as I suggested, I thought I should reply here too.

It's not my kind of story, but it might grow into something interesting. Try to work on your characters and make absolutely certain you can relate the story to the HP universe through something more than just Quidditch. Good luck!
