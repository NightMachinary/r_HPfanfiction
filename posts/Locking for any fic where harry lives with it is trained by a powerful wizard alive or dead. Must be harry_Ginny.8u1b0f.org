** Here are the fics I can think of:

- Taking Control linkffn(Taking Control): Harry is trained by Sirius through dream magic that is pretty tenuous but gives some heart-felt moments.
- Harry Potter: Wizards at War linkffn(Harry Potter: Wizards at War): Harry, Neville, Ginny, and Luna are the founder's heirs and are trained by them in some parallel world/dimension thing.
- Hail Odysseus linkffn(Hail Odysseus): Harry raised by Grindelwald, arrives at Hogwarts as a 7th year. Possibly the most Slytherin ending I can remember.
- Harry Potter and the Zodiac Charms linkffn(Harry Potter and the Zodiac Charms): kind of a canon rehash, but I like that it shows Harry slowly come into his own. Also, props for the unique characters (Triwizard Tournament becomes the Tournament of Merlin), especially from the twelve schools that are competing in the tournament, as well as the changes to the tasks.
- The World I Leave Behind linkffn(The World I Leave Behind): Harry was trained by Dumbledore for a year via the resurrection stone. Kind of tropey, but a genuinely threatening Voldemort with a good use of the imperius curse (possibly the best I can remember).
- Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero): h/g is sort of to the side, though a strong motivation. But Harry here becomes a real powerhouse and Dumbledore recruits several teachers just for him by the end.
- Echoes of Power I: Anger linkffn(Echoes of Power I: Anger): pretty sure Harry was trained by Nicolas Flamel, but he is dead by the start, as well as Remus and an OC.
- Unspeakable Things linkffn(Unspeakable Things): Harry, Ginny and Luna were trained from 2nd year on to become essentially magical supersoldier for the Department of Mysteries, with multiple teachers (Lockhart is not as he seems).

#+begin_quote
  An !Independent and !Grey !Powerful Harry/Ginny story. Rated M for a reason. Harry and Ginny are soul mates, kept from each other by the meddlings of an old fool with half-moon glasses. Harry enters the Chamber and is hit with realisation. Dumbledore and Various Weasley bashing. Portions of the story are dark-ish. As with lots of AU stories, most characters are OOC, and react so.

  The Sequel to Binding Fury. You will need to read that first to understand, this continues on almost immediately. Harry and Ginny Soul-Bound, are about to enter their 5th year of Hogwarts. Voldemort has been resurrected and his Death Eaters are mounting attacks. As the world gets Darker the pair fight for each other. As with lots of AU stories, most characters are OOC, and react so

#+begin_quote
  Reign O'er Me is an exploration of what might happen if Harry were able to move past the Angst and start to put his life together and prepare to cash Voldemort's chips for good. Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel leave their quiet retirement to help.

  Post OotP. AU. Harry is fed up with Dumbledore's interference and sets out to do things his way, with help from some unexpected sources. When he learns the second half of the Prophecy, and finds his power, he won't allow anything to stand in his way.
