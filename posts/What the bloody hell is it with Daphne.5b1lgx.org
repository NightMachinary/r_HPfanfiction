She's like the 4th most popular shipping character according to the survey... except all we know about her is a Slytherin and Astoria is her relative. That's it. Just create a new OC if you're going to ship Harry with her.

Really one of the biggest missed opportunities by JKR. I get that she was writing children books, but Slytherin really could have done with some nuance - especially because the characteristics of that House could be so interesting (instead of being exclusively House Asshole).

******** It is a sort of moral tale, and to me, Slytherin stands for qualities that can easily turn bad. I don't see what is so 'immature' about it. There are environments that have more 'bad' people in them than good, where 'good behavior' doesn't get praised and 'bad behavior' is neccessary to have success or survive. Would you find a story about a prison unrealistic because there are only criminals in it? It doesn't mean that they can't have good personality traits. Just that what the world mostly sees is the negative ones. Why is that soo difficult to accept as part of the books?

They frequently demonstrate brash, stupid antagonism. Rowling sets up a house that utterly fails to adhere to its supposed values as selected by the hat, and uses them as scapegoats.

You claim they're an example of attributes that can "turn evil", but the attributes in question are rarely displayed, and if followed by someone with a drop of sense wouldn't lead to evil.

I tentatively agree, but there's exactly where nuance comes in. Slytherin students could certainly show a stronger likelihood to be somewhat ruthless, but there is really /nothing/ about ambition that connects to murder, racism and bigotry - in fact trying to overthrow the government or becoming a criminal might hurt your career opportunities and risk your continued existence.

***** She's not the only Slytherin blank slate. Tracey Davis is an even more tenuous creation, since she's known only from a list of students JKR once let out, a couple of interviews, and from Pottermore. I'm pretty sure neither Davis nor Greengrass appear in the sorting at all, btw.

Anyway, being upset with fanfic authors for having fun by twisting canon, or creating OCs, or de facto creating OCs this way by using a name with little detail known from canon, or for having fun with fanon cliches, is entirely unreasonable, at least IMHO.

Personally, I only care about whether a fic is good. If it is well written and engaging, the author can do anything they like as far as I'm concerned. If it is awful, it doesn't matter that they avoided every cliche in the book and stuck as much as they could to canon.

** I was sort of around during her heyday, when she was really popular and everyone was writing a million identical fics, ice queen this, ice queen that (heck I wrote a really bad one in '09 myself). Forbidden fruit, really. There's an allure to it. She's pureblood, she's slytherin, she's hot, she's intelligent she's out of Harry's league. At least, that's sort of what the fandom has built her into despite (at the time) all that we knew about her was a name and whatever people extrapolated from that prototype list JKR wrote 20 years ago that isn't actually canon. She was someone that wasn't Ginny, wasn't Hermione, wasn't Pansy, wasn't fem!Blaise. She represented everything that people thought the wizarding world was if you were born with the right last name.

For the record, she's both my favorite and least favorite pairing - you can look at the most recent 25 daphne fics and the vast majority are interchangeable and suck. I can't remember the last time I actually read a Daphne fic that I thought was excellent.

** In my opinion shes popular for 3 major reasons:

The first and most important is shes pretty much a blank slate. She can be adapted into whatever the author wishes without screwing up other aspects of cannon.

The second aspect is that her family straddles the border of dark/light and is described as neutral. This allows even more flexibility in story telling around her... again... without throwing out cannon.

The final reason may seem silly but it is important. She has.... elements.... that attract readers. Beyond the fact that shes implied to be dawning a "mask" as a Slytherin (and is one of the few Slytherins that seems a natural pairing for Harry) and that whole "ice queen" nonsense, there are more basic elements at play.. despite the fact shes mostly a blank slate. I am of course commenting on the implication that shes a beautiful individual with a younger sister. Either thing can lead in a variety of directions when you are talking romance, drama, or even smutty fics.

*** Your first point is accurate. Your other two points appear to be pure fanon, unless I am badly mistaken.

There isn't anything in canon to indicate that her family dabbles in the Dark Arts at all. Her family's status is never described in the series, let alone bring explicitly neutral. The closest you might get is that Astoria used to mildly accept pure blood supremacism before rejecting it entirely and sincerely after the war.

There is nothing in canon to suggest that she's putting on a "mask." There's nothing even to suggest that she's beautiful--no description of her is provided in canon. (In fact, as I argue above, she's probably plain looking if anything)

Daphne is mentioned precisely once in the entire series: in OotP when she goes to take her OWLs with a few other students. No indications there of her being an "Ice Queen," extremely beautiful or whatever other fanon has been invented around her.

**** It depends on what you consider cannon. If you are talking purely what is written or described in the books then you are correct. However if we are talking about what JK Rowling says or describes in interviews and beyond the books, then cannon expands somewhat. JK has talked herself about the Greengrass family straddling the line about blood purity.

These days the line between fannon and cannon is very thin unless you restrict yourself solely to the exact wording of the books. I tend to go with the books and then anything JK Rowling mentions or implies because at the end of the day... she is the author.

There was no mentioning of light/dark/gray factions in the Books at all. In fact, the canon Wizengamot is not nearly as powerful as fanon makes it out to be. For example, the Minister can order dementors around like his private army, throw people into Azkaban without trial, and replace the Chief Warlock just with a little smear campaign.

I find it telling that a relatively low-level, unpopular Ministry Department head (Arthur Weasley) could punch through a major controversial legislation (Muggle Protection Act).

**** I think you have rather misunderstood the events of OotP. Fudge wasn't some tyrant who was abusing executive power in the face of opposition from the Wizengamot, he had public support and the support of the Wizengamot. None of the events of OotP tell us anything about the balance of power between the Minister and the Wizengamot, as they were acting largely in concert.

Indeed, if we learnt anything from OotP it's that the Wizengamot is slightly stronger than Fudge, because he was removed from power the moment he lost support. Nor is he the first Minister to be removed from power after losing support: the same thing happened to Damocles Rowle.

Further, your list of accusations is oddly chosen. The head of executive government having authority over the guards of a prison is completely normal. The management of prisons is a traditional part of executive power. So the Minister being able to order Dementors around is normal. Sending them after Harry was of course illegal, which is exactly why Umbridge hid the fact from everyone (including Fudge).

Also, we have no context for the Muggle Protection Act. You're drawing a host of speculative conclusions from very little. For a start, calling it controversial is an overreach as we know of only one person in opposition: Lucius. Secondly, calling it "major" is a definite exaggeration as Arthur's department is repeatedly presented as being relatively insignificant. Thirdly, even calling it legislation is a presumption. It could equally be an executive order. It's not at all clear that wizarding Britain /has/ a legislature. What would normally be passed by legislation in the Muggle world appears to be passed by Ministerial decree (i.e. executive order) in the magical world. And even if it does have a legislature and the Muggle Protection Act is legislation, it could very well be delegated secondary legislation and thus firmly in the realm of executive power.

(Incidentally, in thinking of these matters one has to recall the size of the wizarding world. As far as we can tell wizarding Britain is the size of a large village or small town. I would propose that a strict doctrine of separation of powers, a formal legislature etc is an inappropriate level of constitutional formality for a community of this size.)

The only real firm criticism is the indefinite detention of prisoners without trial. However, on this front the magical world is at least no worse than the Muggle world, as the Muggle British government was also using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Demetrius][detention without trial]] for terrorist suspects in Northern Ireland in the 70s.

***** Wasn't the House of Lords the ultimate judicial authority until recently? If so, the obvious interpretation is that the Wizengamot is a wizarding analogue. (That fits with people talking about Noble seats on the Wizengamot, although I'm pretty sure that's fanon.) The number of Wizengamot members alone (too many votes for Harry to count) would be unrealistic for a purely judicial arm.

San Marino has a legislature, with a population of 30000 (the country, not the legislature). As does Lichtenstein. Granted, that's a little on the high side of population estimates for wizarding Britain, but I think two legislative chambers is perfectly manageable.

Certainly I think the Wizengamot's powers extend into the legislative sphere, and certainly I imagine they have evolved somewhat and become more institutional than the Witenagemot, but based on the above I don't really see them as a legislature in the modern sense of the word.

Instead of fucking up cannon and added a whole new character, you can use Daphne, you know shes Pureblood, you know shes a slytherin. From there you can go in many different directions. I personally have the Greengrass family as one of seven founding Families of Magical Britain after the Roman's left.

But anyway. The reason these characters are popular are because they are a template. you want a light sided Pureblood witch that isn't Ginny? Susan. You want a Dark sided one? Daph or Tracy. it lets you create your own stamp on the Potterverse with the risk of turning off readers with a new OC.

Hannah can be used in two ways depending on how people want her to be in the post Chamber scenes. I know when I started using her in one of my (currently on hiatus) fics, I had Harry dislike her for her attitude, but unfortunately forced to marry her due to Ye Olde Betrothal Contract situation.

Daphne I find can be used in a multitude of ways as a member of a "grey" family to which I usually use as a partner to Harry, Terry Boot (using him as another "grey") or Zabini, but I have used her as a "Dark" character in line with Malfoy and his Harem.
