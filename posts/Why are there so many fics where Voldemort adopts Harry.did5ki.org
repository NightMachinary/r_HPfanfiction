** There's over 800,000 fics on fanfiction.net alone, and another 200k on ao3.

Sure, some are going to be crossposted or translated duplicates, but that's still over a million fics without going to the HP dedicated sites like siye or crossovers on other fandom sites like twisting the hellmouth.

There's a lot of /every/ kind of fic.

** Besides what others have said, just by thinking "what would happen if... " we can get to Voldemort adopts Harry.

What would happen if Voldemort realized Harry was a horcrux? Well, he'd never want to destroy his own horcrux, right? He'd want to keep it safe. That means keeping Harry safe.

Now add in that, just maybe, Voldemort has some human feelings left, and maybe he realizes what diary Tom Riddle did, that there a lot of similarities between him and Harry- both orphans, both neglected, Harry even looks a little like a young Voldemort, and of course, they can both speak Parseltongue. They have so much in common, maybe they can understand each other on a few things?

And then add in people in this fandom's baffling love for Lordships and such, well, in canon Lord Voldemort is the only actual "lord" mentioned, and he has followers and all.

** Why not? People write what is interesting to them, and if a plot idea is done well once, then it tends to get iterated upon.

As for why this specific plot idea has some popularity: many people like to read about complex villains who are less one-dimensional compared to canon Voldemort. Thus, some people like to explore plotlines in which he is more sane - still morally questionable - but with methods and goals beyond the simple "kill everyone who oposes me, for the evulz!!1!". One way to do that is to have him be more cautious when acting upon the prophecy, realizing that Harry doesn't necessarily have to be his enemy.

*** Right, because if you go by the incomplete version that Voldemort would've heard about, it says that someone with the potential to be his downfall will be born soon, but nothing about if they will or won't oppose him.

**** And someone who is capable of bringing down a wizard as powerful as voldemort is someone who would make a very valuable ally. In the first book during their confrontation, voldemort even tells harry to join him (no doubt canon Voldemort would've killed him, but this is fanfiction, canon doesnt matter a whole lot)

** Because some people see that as an alternate plan Voldemort would've carried out instead of trying to kill him. It kinda makes sense to me. A saner more rational Voldemort wanting to take advantage of Harry who he thinks has the potential to be as powerful as him because of the prophecy. Killing a freaking baby that some prophecy claimed would be a threat to him someday was crazy and irrational which made sense since he was off his rocker. The better option would be to kidnap and raise that child to be loyal to him. Raise that child with love and care without killing his parents and the child would be hard pressed to kill him in the future. Or at least that's how I see it.

** People want a dark harry people also want him to not be raised by the duresly's, so the dark lord is the first choice for a dark powerful Gary Stu.
