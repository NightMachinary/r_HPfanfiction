Abraham Lincoln has just announced the Emancipation Proclamation and the crowd let's out a loud boo. Both wizards remember their muggle history and realize protecting old honest Abe should lead to great changes in the future.

​

Don't even ask where this weird idea came from.


** Would British teenagers in the 90s who effectively dropped out of school after (the British equivalent of) fifth grade even really know about Lincoln?

*** As a British teen, I can say that whilst we know about Lincoln....we know pretty much nothing of what he did or why he was so important. And to be honest....none of us really care enough to find out anyways.

*** Speaking as a former British teenager, if we're going based on school learning, then no. Maybe if Dean or his mum had an interest and read around, then he might know?

*** Some people have hobbies. It just so happens that Harry Potter and Dean Thomas shared a love of American history. It didn't hurt that they were kids, and that American history features more than a few explosions, gun fights, impressive speeches, Etc.

** Dean had tried to tackle Harry when he stood up in a rage casting his go to spell at the Goblet of Fire. He had not managed to stop him but he had managed to get tied up in Harry's newest adventure.

When the after effects of whatever happened when you mixed a rage induced Expelliarmus with a centuries old magical artifact settled Dean looked around.

Harry and he had found themselves far removed from Hogwarts judging by the fact they were currently in a wooded area. Oh well he nudged the moving form of Harry and got to it.

"Harry you remember the help me spell from first year?"

Harry took in the wooded area and realized that spell would probably be useful now.

It was a spell they learned in the first year class Understanding Magic, or as the kids called it Magic is Weird.

Apparently people getting lost all over the world, and in time occasionally, was so common that even before the statute of secrecy was invoked the ICW had crafted a custom spell that was taught to everyone.

It was a spell that would notify ICW headquarters of your current location, and what period of time you came from, no matter where you were currently.

They each cast the spell seven times quickly as they had been instructed to and sat down. An ICW team, or at the very least a local ministry team, would be there within the day at the latest.

°•○○•°

It had been two days and they were beginning to grow both hungry and concerned. They had cast the spell again and still there was no signs whatsoever of a rescuing party.

Deciding to cast the spell every night for going to sleep they set off to find food.

°•○○•°

Looking at the newspaper before them they knew they were in a tricky situation.

"President Abraham Lincoln Declares Emancipation Proclamation!"

Dean tried to remember where the American Ministry was at the time and it was Harry who remembered first.

It was somewhere out west but there was a British Ministry Embassy in Boston that had been there since before the revolution.

°•○○•°

1 month later

They had made it to Boston and did everything except casting spells wildly in the streets and could not find any sign of magicals hiding anywhere.

°•○○•°

It had been a year since they got here and they were living in the US capital city. It seemed there was no sign anywhere of magical presence. There was no magic anywhere as near as they could tell.

°•○○•°

They had resigned themselves to the fact they were the only wizards anywhere. Magic wasn't real in the world somehow and they hadn't the foggiest how that had come to be.

However Dean had remembered that Lincoln was shot in the head during a play while still president.

So they had taken to following the man and making sure that didn't happen. They knew they weren't in their own world anymore so there was no worries about changing the future.

°•○○•°

Dean Thomas and Harry Potter looked down at the medals hanging around their necks. They had both received a commendation for saving the president.

That a young free black man and his white friend had saved the president from a crazy white man was a gift from the heavens for Abraham Lincoln's presidential reflection campaign.

°•○○•°

Dean Thomas was the first to notice that they were aging far slower than they would have thought. It had been nearly two decades and they still both looked like young teens. In fact neither was sure if they were aging at all.

Lincoln had kept the boys by his side as propaganda pieces at first. When they had used their magic to save his life again where he could see it he kept them for different reasons.

°•○○•°

The office of the Federal Oversight Group consisted of two groups of people only. The current president amd former presidents of America, and the two ageless Wizards who advised the president.

They had judicial and executive powers that could only be challenged by the presidential portion.

They had kept each president safe from attacks for over a hundred years. And they had kept the country safe from itself.

The dangers of a democracy and unchecked capitalism were many. So they found those who hide their vile deeds with the framework of law and ensured the confessed their crimes publicly for all to know.

The Pinkerton case was a truly horrible one. That pompous hypocrite Edison was also a real piece of work.

They had crafted their own spells over the years that were used to force the truth out. In fact the entirety of the congressional building was cursed heavily with truth spells. No lies could be spoken inside that building. The mild compulsion to spend at least a few hours everyday doing work there for anyone who was a member of congress helped as well.

The longer they stayed away while being a member of congress the worse the compulsion on them grew.

They had in fact littered the places of federal and state government across the country with such spells.

The greatest downside was the lack of magical children.

They had both tried to start lives with a wife and had children. Not a single child had shown the spark of magic, or even being a squib.

Seeing their wives, children and grandchildren, grow old had been to much for them.

They kept an eye of the family lines incase a magical ever popped up but had stopped trying for relationships years ago.

°•○○•°

They both sat there in the hidden room adjacent to the oval office sharing a beer. It was October 31st, 1994. They had made it back to their own time though the world was a far different place.

Stopping corruption and extreme self interest from taking root in America had made it a bastion of innovation and freedom in the world.

They were reminiscing late into the night when a gigantic plume of fire appeared in the room. Albus Dumbledore appeared with his Phoenix looking rather spent.

They conjured a chair for him and handed him a cool beer to enjoy.

"I've found you boys, I hope it wasn't much of a wait. It took me hours to lock on to you both. A world without magic indeed! What a bizarre thing."

Dean laughed at the look the two shared with each other.

Harry responded while Dean was trying, and failing, to catch his breath.

"Not long at all, just slightly over 131 years is all."

Dumbledore paled and looked at his mug of ale. Shrugging he swiftly downed the drink before saying what was on his mind.

"Oh dear."
