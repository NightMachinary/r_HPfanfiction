I have come here once again looking for fanfic recommendations. This time, it is to recover from trauma of reading too many Stockholm Syndrome ("heroic done wrong") Harrys.

What I am looking for is not necessarily the edge fest that Dark!MC fics usually are, but I'd like to see MC, whoever they are, prioritize themselves and their friends/family/lovers. Helping someone when they have an opportunity is fine, but big, meaningful sacrifices should be reserved for those closest to MC.

I'd like to read a slice of life or soft adventure fic focused on group of friends displaying Hufflepuff ideals and sticking together. Something light, fluffy, and still willing to smack a bit*h if the situation calls for it, but really, anything lacking martyr complex or excessive edge will do.

I'd like to avoid explicit M/M, religious themes, whitewashing and relationships between characters with big age difference, but if the fic doesn't focus on that, it's fine too.


** No recommedations on this sadly but i have been thinking that Harry does have the setup to be a hufflepuff tbh. A fic based around him coming into the wizarding world feeling free to be more himself and open to any friends he can finally get, where he ends up getting more jaded by the world he finds himself in. It could be a gradual thing with draco being an easy catalyst that devolves into a hardworking harry who is loyal and caring to a fault to those he has bonded with and seems more aloof to those outside his circle. With puffs seen as leftovers and basically declared as the rest by the sorting hat he'd be placed into a perfect location for that type of story. Also with him growing up closer to cedric, his 4th year could have an even deeper impact. Even the title of this thread makes a good slogan that would fit a puff.

** Invincible linkffn(13161929) has a bit of this. It's a 2012 crossover where the radiation is especially deadly to magicals. They can't ride it out on boats like muggles, they need to get off the planet. And they can't possibly save everyone. First half of the story is developing a magical starship.

Harry meets with the witch he wants to run the medical side of things and flat out tells her, "I'm paying for this. I'm running the operation. I choose who comes and who stays. And me and mine get priority. ... Though, for what it's worth, me and mine includes the students, staff and family of Hogwarts, Durmstrang, Beuxbotoms and Ilvermorny."

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.

** I think you'd enjoy linkffn(The Best Revenge). Harry is a Hufflepuff and the fic focuses a lot on his friendships with various students. The mentor Snape relationship is very wholesome too. There's also a sequel! linkffn(The Best Revenge Time of the Basilisk)

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  AU: The continuation of Book I. Not all of Tom Riddle is gone. A mysterious journal and a new Defense teacher pose challenges for Harry and his guardian. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva.
