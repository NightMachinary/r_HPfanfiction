I've seen a fair few fics of this pairing it just always seemed to be one of the odder pairings to me(not judging anyone btw i ship Hermione/Luna so i know strange pairings can just capture peoples imagination haha though I think Fred/Hermione have more fics than luna and hermione as well) just wondering how or why this ship took off. Is there some scene in the book i'm forgetting where they were slightly flirty or had chemistry together? why does fred have more fics with Hermione than George and so on, just curious.


** I believe a few years ago one of those “HP Facts” tumblrs posted that JKR almost made Hermione/Fred canon and it became a popular post. Of course there's no proof to back it up and it was likely a fan who passed it off as something JKR said.

** There was that kind of sweet peice from Hbp where fred dabbed the antidote for one of his inventions on hermione's eye, besides that I personally like the pairing for Hermione because the two are good opposites of each other. No hate on ron, but him and Hermione are bad opposites. Fred can bring hermione back to earth and have fun but also can match Hermione intellectually and challenge her.

** honestly, they do make sense to me. they clash early on because of disregard for rules and poor work ethic by the only metric she knew to measure by at the time (grades).

but fred/george, despite their grades, are probably more 'studious' than anybody except hermione herself. they regularly start with an idea, and then research and experiment tirelessly until its completed (which i think she begins to realize when she tries the daydream charm).

if hermione can get past the joking mindset (and her views on rules definitely relaxes over the series), i think they'd be kindred spirits as intellectuals and magical researchers.

** u/ravenclaw-sass:
#+begin_quote
  why does fred have more fics with Hermione than George
#+end_quote

Because Fred died and is therefore often the favourite twin. He was also the older one and often took the leader role, so he comes across as strong enough to handle Hermione.

*** Just doing some googling about fred Hermione scenes from the books and I see there was that scene in CoS where Fred is going to batter Malfoy for calling Hermione mudblood and George has to hold him back that could also be the origin of the ship maybe?

*** To be honest even before DH I remember Fred/Hermione was fairly popular. I think it's because Fred always seems to be the one to take the lead and his humour is slightly crueller than George. I think Rowling said that was why she killed him off - he seemed to be the favourite twin.

** Because some people like the Weasleys but don't like Ron, so they take the one who is free, older and available. Charlie is popular for a similar reason. You still get a Weasley, but one who is not as limited by canon actions and characterisations as Ron.

** Is it really becoming so popular?

I guess people finally realized that Draco is pathetic so they go for a much better "bad boy" type?

*** maybe 'become' was the wrong choice of words maybe "was" would be better, I just saw for a while there was this somewhat strong Hermione/Fred community and just wondered why it took off. I guess the idea Hermione is charmed by the joking around troublemaker type is popular trope tbf.

** From what I remember, it was revealed in an interview at one point that Mr. Weasley was originally going to die in OotP but she saved him. Around the same time she was considering killing off one of the trio - and it probably would've been Ron. Because of these two deaths not following through, Rowling knew she wanted at least one Weasley to die - so a twin it would be. After Ron and Ginny, we only really get to know the twins compared to the rest.

Because of this, many people assumed that had Fred not died and Ron been sacrificed- Hermione would've ended up with another Weasley. And it was decided on Fred. Probably because he's the one that died. Who knows.

In reality I think that if Rowling has decided to kill Ron- we would've gotten Harmony. And I would probably have burned my books. But what can you do?
