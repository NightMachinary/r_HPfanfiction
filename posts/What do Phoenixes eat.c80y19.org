Are they carnivorous? Herbivorous? Omnivorous? Or perhaps they only eat lemon drops?

Do they have a favorite? Is it the same for all phoenixes? Or do tastes differ between individual phoenixes?

I'm curious as there doesn't seem to be a common answer and I'm trying to get some plausible facts straight for my own compendium of magical beasts :D

Thanks!

This is the only valid answer. Phoenixes only eat sweets. That's why Dumbledore so gets along with them.

** Solar-powered, but they enjoy hot peppers and pickled eggs. Russian versions eat apples (usually owned by haughty kings) and the Persian one dines on sheep's fat. cf. Firebird and Princess Vasilissa; Kurdish tale of the Simurgh/Simir.

** Maybe they feed on bad memories and sadness. Like how Dementors feed on happiness.

Maybe that's why people feel slightly better around phoenixes.

**** Also why Fawkes hangs around Dumbledore so much, he knows he's always well-fed there.

** My favorite headcanon is that they eat fruit and the odd book of matches. Mostly because Fawkes eating all of McGonagall's matches for that first transfiguration class is a hilarious mental image.
