On the wiki, it says Lily Potter's marital status: Widowed(briefly) I find this amazing


** Well she did outlive James by like 5 minutes or so.

**** I'm tempted to edit it and type the exact amount of time she was widowed for (if I can work out how long it took Tom to go from killing James to killing Lily)

***** We don't ever see it completely to my recollection. If you could draw up a map of the cottage at Godric's Hollow, and knew Voldemort's height, you could likely map the pace at which he walked, and then create a shortest possible time frame. I think we hear the dialogue between Voldemort and Lily, but if that doesn't work, we could pull up an audio book version, and see how long it takes to read the dialogue. That's how I'd go about it.

***** If it took Voldemort the same amount of time it takes me to go up one story at moderate pace, remove a light obstacle out of my way, open a door and read the warnings to Lily as well as Voldemort's internal monologue from Bathilda's Secret, it would be around 2 minutes and a half. I'd say 3 minutes to be conservative. I did not count the time it took me to get the DH book and the time it took me to find the right page.

****** But it depends on if he knew her exact location right away. For all we know, the upstairs might have had several rooms with Voldemort using a bit of trial and error at first, losing a minute or two in the process.

Incidentally, the wiki is where I learned that Lily's middle name starts with J.

*** No, it's not wrong. What do you think her middle name is? My money's on something like Janet. If we could figure out her family's names it would be easier.

**** I have no idea, but I doubt it would be Janet, unless the Wizarding World has a really weird fixation on Jane-like names (Hermione, Dolores).

***** Well, she's a muggleborn... I dunno. The easiest way to guess would be her godmother's name, but JKR rolls with random naming schemes so who knows. Speaking of Hermione and Dolores, I read a fic where the guy got the names backward, knew he got them backward and explained it in an author's note. If you're going to that much effort just fix the damn names!
