I mean there are a lot of fics where he travels into his younger self, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447/1/Amalgum-Lockhart-s-Folly][Lockhart]] or someone else. I don't want them. I want fics where he travels and he is just a new man. For example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11244373/1/Sine-Qua-Non]['Sine Qua Non']], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][On a Pale Horse]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11321032/1/The-Games-They-Play]['The games they play']].

I'm a Snape's fan, so please gime me fics without his bashing.
