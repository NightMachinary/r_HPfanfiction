** Minerva McGonagall, Professor of Hogwarts, looked up at Albus Dumbledore from where she sat, consoling a weeping Professor Pomona Sprout.

"Headmaster, you /must/ see reason," she hissed, her narrowed brows brooking no argument. "We cannot run the school like this."

"And yet, Minerva, it is how Hogwarts has always functioned," the elderly man responded, with a sympathetic smile. "Besides, surely such an occurrence would be unusual in the extreme. It's not as if it reflects on poor Pomona, here."

As Professor Sprout's wails increased in volume, the only one in Hogwarts more unsure and filled with dread than her squirmed uncomfortably in her seat. Daphne Greengrass sat in the Great Hall alone at her table, the yellow-on-black of Hufflepuff adorning her robes.

"I understand that my friendliness /bothered/ them," she muttered to herself, glancing around at the silent Hall - idle conversation being, apparently, too social for the notoriously icy students at Hogwarts, "but they didn't /all/ have to transfer into Slytherin and Ravenclaw. I wasn't even in Gryffindor, so that seemed excessive."

She locked eyes with Harry Potter, the mysterious and isolated young man who'd been drawing her attention recently. The boy's expression seemed to soften for a moment, only for him to turn back to his meal with a cool, disinterested look on his face. Daphne's wistful gaze was interrupted by a loud /SNAP/, signalling the arrival of her dinner companions.

"Do you ever feel like everything's all backwards?" she asked rhetorically, to the only two beings in the castle who seemed to match her friendliness.

"Dobby recommends working in the kitchens," said the House Elf helpfully, affixing a portrait to stand at one of the empty seats nearby.

"A task - or even better, a /quest!/ - will cure those doldrums right on the spot!" agreed Sir Cadogen.
