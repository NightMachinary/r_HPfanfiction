Has anyone ever seen a story where for some reason the Harry Potter multiverse starts collapsing and so Canon Harry starts meeting all the different versions of himself that we the fanfiction community have created of him.

Just a thought I had and was wondering if anyone had ever done it. Harry meeting a version of himself in love with Snape or Draco would probably be hysterical.


** Here: linkffn(2829366) is a close fit to your request. Each chapter is a hop to a new dimension.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

Very true, I suppose I should have made a disclaimer of that. I think the OP would have hard time finding fics to meet his request that aren't crack though.

** linkffn(Harry Potters Anonymous by LifeWriter) is a oneshot that seems to fit the bill.

There was also a fic with a different version of fanon Harry in each chapter, each running through the graveyard scene. It wrapped up with them all meeting each other. I'll see if I can dredge it up from the dark depths of my browser history.

Edit: There we are, linkffn(The Many Harry Potters of Little Hangleton)

** There are all kinds of crazy stories with broken time turners. One ends up with three Hermiones running around.

But one that's really good is the third part of the *Dark Prince Trilogy*: linkffn(2913149;3340621;3959072). The first two parts deal with the AU, and the dimensional travel happened in the third part. At one point, there will be 2 Harrys and 2 Ginnys.

*** I read the first one and I was never sure if I liked it. It was a good story but something about it always felt off to me, like the fact that Harry took almost the entire story to even begin questioning the obvious differences between the James and Lily he knew and the real James and Lily irked me. I'd understand thinking it might be a trick but after a little while there and glaring inconsistencies that the "powerful, smart, dark" Harry should question.
