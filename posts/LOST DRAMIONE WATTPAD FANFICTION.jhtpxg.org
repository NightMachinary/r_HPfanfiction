[UPDATE] I found it! After searching for the past 18 hours I have finally found it! If anyone wants to read it, its called "These Dark and Hollow Nights" by dramione27 on Wattpad

Hi guys!

This may seem like a strange request. However, I've been an idiot. I was reading a Dramione fanfiction on Wattpad. I didn't add it to my library, as I was testing it out, however when I got into it I forgot to add it in. My wattpad restarted and now I have lost the story. I have spent ages trying to find it as I have forgotten the title and the author.

This is what I know (SPOILERS):

Starts off with Ron cheating on Hermione with Lavender Brown.

Harry, Hermione and McGonagall, testify as witnesses of Draco's good behaviour in his trial with the ministry.

They all go back to Hogwarts for their final year, Hermione and Draco are headgirl and headboy.

Theodore Nott takes an interest in Hermione and convinces her to start dating him in private.

Turns out its a plot to ruin the Golden Trio.

Draco, Harry and Blaise Zabini team up to ruin Theo's plans.

Ginny might be kidnapped.

Ron might be under the Imperius curse.

Hermione keeps finding notes with codes on:

HTBD

A.D

TJN

DE

She also gets a sapphire necklace with one of the notes saying to wear it for protection.

That is as far I got into the story before I lost it. I hope posting this can help me find it, as I got quite invested into the story, not just because of the Dramione features. I have also posted this on [[/r/Dramione][r/Dramione]]
