Is it one-shot, one shot, or oneshot?

Are there any other words where there seems to be a divide or just a misconception.


** I want people to alphabetize ships. Even though that means Harry or Hermione often come second. So not hgdm or hpgw but dmhg and gwhp. It would make searching so much easier.

Also using that shorthand gets very confusing for Ginny and George Weasley but oh well.

** This really irks me on archiveofourown. So many variations of words or using characters in between them that the search bar ignores.

e.g. one-shot, character/character, powerfantasy!character, etc.

I much prefer camel casing words to have them easily excluded. e.g. superCharacter, characterBashing, ChChm etc. Someone should get this ball rolling.

**** I'm just learning c++. :l

Since I've learned this I've used it for most of my naming conventions in place of spaces, dashes, or underscores.

****** Studying for now. Hopefully it will become work when I graduate.

Or maybe I could pick up how to make useful extensions for fanfiction websites for personal use.

** Head canon vs ficlet. I almost never see anyone using ficlet anymore, it's been absorbed by headcanon. A headcanon is a fact or idea or something else relatively small, that in your head is true until proven otherwise. Like Neville being godparent to one of Harry's kids. A ficlet is a really short story or scene, mostly a fleshing out of a small idea. 500 words describing the circumstances behind Neville becoming godparent.

Something so small but it bothers me. One is an idea, the other is using the idea.
