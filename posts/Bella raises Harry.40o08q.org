I was contemplating unusual people who for whatever reason had to raise Harry. Bellatrix sprung to mind. Does anyone have any decent fanfics to recommend? Many thanks.


** Depending on what you mean by raised: Harry dursley and the chronicles of the king linkffn(8770795)

Pre Hogwarts, harry is raised by the dursleys. However, [[/spoiler][Harry is adopted by Bella in the later chapters]]

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

** linkffn(The Taste Of Your Magic by Annoy mouse) is a rather dark take on a young Harry Potter being raised by Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy. It is quite the disturbing tale really, but it fits the portrayal of the insane Bellatrix well in my opinion. The writer has been inactive for almost two years by now.

  [HIATUS!]Deliciously Dark. Evil too. Bellatrix finds baby Harry left with the muggles & discovers his unusual accidental magical trait, one that she finds... Very Appealing. She decides to keep and groom him to be their next Dark Lord, and enlists the aid of Narcissa. Harry/Bellatrix, quasi-harem for a reason but H/B/N overall. M for a reason. THESE CHARACTERS ARE EVIL
