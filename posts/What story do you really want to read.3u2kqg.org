What story have you always wanted to read, but no one's written it yet?

A twist on a classic cliche? A parody of an overused challenge? A ridiculous crack-fic that you want to read but don't want to write? An interesting magical theory that you would like to expand on?

Hopefully we can share some ideas and maybe inspire some original stories. If anyone does write any ideas please let us know.

I've posted [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3j7d96/whats_a_story_youd_really_like_to_read/][this]] twice before, if you want to have a look at ideas people came up with last time.


** Vernon getting fired from his company because of some new hotshot charismatic employee. Ends up depressed and decides to grow and sell magical weed (some flower Harry picked randomly and dried over the summer from the forbidden forest). Ends up recruiting Neville and buying a bunch of house elves and owls to keep up the production and distribution.

Has to stay ahead from both the muggle and wizard enforcement. And also from the mobs and yakuza trying to get a piece from his pie.

** I want something long. Like really long.

Something that explores more political reasons for people jumping on the death eater bandwagon. Not so much power, but because their (tropey) culture is being diluted to the point where it's at risk of extinction. It's not that nobody follows the 'old ways' but that nobody cares to even learn what they are.

I want creative magics used to fight that war, bring in stuff from other cultures, other systems. If the death eaters are trying to preserve their own culture (or even just think they are, while Voldy has his own plans), they're not likely to be using ancient Egyptian texts or Native American stories for ideas. Strange potions, pre-battle rituals, /failed/ magics...

Give me real consequences. I don't want all the good guys getting pardons just for being on the good side. An unforgivable is supposed to be an unforgivable, right? A crime is a crime, and something that may seem like a good idea in the middle of a war, and may in fact save lives overall, should still have consequences. (I think it's silly that we still don't know the consequences of breaking into, stealing from, and damaging Gringotts.)

Add in some disfigurement and disability- we see from the Longbottoms and Moody that this happens in canon. Give me realistic effects like PTSD and anxiety and people deciding to outright leave the wizarding world. Hell, show me people (not just Muggle born) deciding to flee the wizarding world before the war is even over. i want bad decisions and middle of the war pregnancies and the fights and drama that would come from losing one of their limited number of fighters to something like that.

I want spies within the ministry, and the related failed recruiting missions where a simple 'obliviate' wouldn't actually fix it because that's an "easy button." Spies for both sides. I want the prophecy to be /wrong/. Anyone can destroy the horcruxes, and any permanent death would destroy the one in Harry as well. So really, anyone /can/ kill Voldemort if they'd just bloody share information. That'd be a hell of a wrench to throw in, killing Harry. Sounds fun!

Plus death. Not just final battle death, but deaths that seem to make no sense. Snatchers, accidents, raids, rescue missions that end up just trading one life for another.

War is messy. I've read a bunch of stories that hit on a couple, but never one to get most/all of these. I have a story in my head, I'm just not a writer and wouldn't be able to get it out coherently. If I could clone myself and give her the ability to write fiction well, and give her unlimited motivation and inspiration, I'd be so happy.

**** The way I see it, just because he has the power to do so doesn't mean he has to be the sole individual to do so. Honestly the ring had more of Voldemort's soul (if it's cut in half, which I don't think is canon) in it than his final body did, and Dumbledore killed that one.

Or maybe just the interpretation of it is wrong. Throw in some metaphor and word play- Harry giving orders or devising plans could be enough to be by his 'hand' instead of needing to cast the final spell.

Or consider the first prophecy fulfilled Halloween 1981, because Voldemort's mortal body was essentially killed, making everything afterward fair game. He was vanquished, even if only temporarily.

It's all interpretation, and canon goes by /one/ of them. Maybe prophecies only show /one/ outcome, one possible chain of events?

** So, two magical classes that a basically completely unknown to us: Ancient Runes and Arithmancy.

I've toyed with the idea of writing an Ancient Runes fic (cliched Harry is awesome at it despite no formal education in it, basically written spells, wards etc) but the premise is that it's like Lyra's alethiometer from His Dark materials by Philip Pullman, using the furthark runes.

Might be a bit hard to explain to people who don't know the idea, but it's a series of images and each image has infinite meanings (A bee hive: bees, honey, hard work, workers, queen, team work, community etc) that can be put together to form full ideas.

I don't think it could make a story by itself, and I don't think it would fit well in a story, but I've often thought of coming up with a whole system for the furthark runes in this style. So each rune has a main meaning but also has infinite sub-meanings depending on orientation and combinations.

Arithmancy, on the other hand I've always thought would be funny to be just straight up maths in base 2, 3, 7, or 13. That or magical actuary studies, which could essentially be mathematical divination, which is just as funny because it's Hermione's favourite subject.

Also, I looked on FF.net and couldn't find a single HPxIn Bruges crossovers which seems shocking as Brendan Gleeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Clèmence Poèsy are all in it. I mean, I can't see a way to make a good story, but I was shocked that I couldn't find any bad ones either.

*** I always imagined Arithmancy had a healthy dose of wizarding physics mixed into it. After all, physics basically uses numbers and numerical concepts to explain how the world works. But since wizards don't have a magical equivalent of physical science (the closest seems to be Transfiguration), they simply call it divination, as it's the closest thing to a scientific method.

That is an interesting question. I'm guessing wizard kids that young don't display much accidental magic, so it might slip by the Potter's notice.

** A post DH story that takes place like a year of two later. Harry and Ginny are engaged and Harry is about to become an auror. He hasn't used the hallows other than his cloak but then he somehow comes in to his "powers" as master of death. He finds the resurrection stone again and is contacted by someone on the other side. The afterlife is in trouble for the first time ever and some great evil is stirring. So harry, ron, Hermione, Ginny all cross over when Harry learns to make a portal or something and with the help of all their friends and family who died investigate. Maybe eventually they have to travel to some kind of hell and get information from whatever is left of tom riddle's soul about what's going on cause he is somehow related to causing these events when he was alive by upsetting the balence between life and death when he made horcruxes.

I had this idea randomly a couple weeks ago but don't have time to write it. I hope someone is interested because I think it would be a fun and interesting read.

Which is the point. They were friends, and expected loyalty from the other. They're not going to have those expectations if they start off as enemies/not friends. If your friend, who you trust, does something to hurt you, you're going to be let down/trust broken, and that's difficult to repair. If some asshole does that, you wouldn't. If you and said asshole have things in common, then they've /subverted/ your expectations of them.

We need harem fics for other characters, Harry's gotten more than enough by now. Especially considering 50% of them are all the same thing. Think of the possibilities if Ron had a bunch of girls, or if Draco of Neville did. It wouldn't even have to make sense to be enjoyable.

** Excuse me for being so specific, but I'd love to read a story detailing the life of a pureblood wizard or witch in the early 20th century, maybe even up to the mid-60s. Maybe like a coming-of-age tale or something like that. It could be an OC, or an obscure character. Not interested in a main character time-traveling or Harry himself being involved. Something that would align well enough to canon and explore pureblood traditions in amusing and dramatic ways.

Alternatively, I've wanted to write a creature!fic starring an obscure character and keeping it as close to canon as humanly possible, detailing their secretive life at Hogwarts. But not with werewolves or veela -- something different, like changelings (Norwegian trolls?) or fauns.

Or just alternatively, folding in worldwide mythos into the Harry Potter continuity, like Sasquatch or Yeti, Greek legendary creatures -- but in a canon-compatible way.

Something I'd also like to see is Hagrid and Maxime's journey through Eastern Europe, and their encounters with the trolls in Poland and more details about the lives of the giant colony. Maybe see if there's such a thing as illegal poaching of magical creatures.

I've read fics before that briefly touch on a field of magizoology, but it was mostly in passing and left me wanting only more.

** You know, that's actually a really good question. I have no clue!

It's a bit of a negative outlook, but lately I've been focusing almost exclusively on stories I don't want to read--chief among which are stories which spend the majority of the time at Hogwarts.

I think worldbuilding is really important to me, so whether it be another country, an ancient kingdom or a completely different world altogether, I /need/ new settings, and I need them to be good. Preferably in a high fantasy kind of style.

These are just rough guidelines, but most stories that follow them would be good in my eyes. You could, for example, have a story where Voldemort opens up a portal to the Underworld, unleashing whatever magic is to be found there and basically raising hell (quite literally).

Or, as another example... you might have a story where Harry is a researcher who learns that Atlantis might actually exist, and sets out to find it. Then when he does, he gets stuck there, and has to find a way out. You could take that one step further by linking Atlantis to another, bigger world.

"Lore" is /super/ important to me. I need it. I'm a very visually driven person, so great descriptive quality of settings and history is essential. While there are infinitely many stories you could write that fit into these categories, these are simply what I look for.

I was thinking of reading the Hero Trilogy, by joe6991. It would seem to fit on more than a few accounts. If you've read it, could you confirm or deny?

** A story where the origins and creation of magical spells and artifacts is a central plot point. Not as a way to obviate conflict ("And then Harry invented a shield which blocked the unforgivable curses!") but as a way to foster it - in a magical arms race between opposing factions. There's tons of opportunity for intrigue and worldbuilding about both the magic system itself and the people who use it.

** Slughorn as head of house Hufflepuff. I'm almost at the point where I'm going to try to write this myself, it feels like it has so much potential. Also for the record, the best way to write Hufflepuff (in my opinion) is as the house with the chip on their shoulder. I see them as a bunch of people with something to prove, who are beliteled by the other houses to the point of adopting the mentality of 'us against the world'. Hufflepuff is known for loyalty, not founded for it, and they work hard because they know that the deck is stacked against them from the moment the hat said Huflepuff. It would be fun to see Slughorn built around proving his house's worth trying his hardest to unstack that deck.

** Stuff I wanna see:

Deans POV of canon, or failing that, a decent length story about him that doesn't focus on slash.

For some reason the Weasley twins never get bashed. I'd love to see a story where they are the bad Weasleys for once. Some ideas for this:

- They fuck up and seriously injure somone with a prank.

- They're just more dickish in general and bully Ron, so the trio has a more antagonistic relationship with them.

- They take advantage of Harrys celebrity status in some way.

- Combine it with some classic Dumbledore bashing. Turns out Fred and George have been paid to spy on Harry for him all along! Cue the rest of the Weasleys being shocked and appalled!

Also, I don't know if anyone here's ever read Laura Joh Rowland's Sano Ichirō series? It's about a detective in feudal Japan, and he often gets useful info from his wife, because she's lunches with all the other high ranking officials wives and is able to ask them questions that he wouldn't be able to.

Anyway, this got me wondering more about Molly's role in the order. What does she do? Perhaps she finds out intel about deatheaters in a similar way? Listening to all the other housewives gossip and knowing when to question them further? I think a fic like that could be interesting.

** I want to see an anti!wizard and anti!muggle Harry that just doesn't care about any of their problems. He'd have found out by some offhand comment from drunk!vernon that he was just abandoned on their doorstep by some dumbledore fellow, and run away as a kid. Pre-hogwarts by a year or two, and then when he sees the Dumbledore name on the letter doesn't go and stays away. He'd get roped into the triwizard competition, start a war between Dumbledore's Order, the Ministry, Voldemort, and himself, and then sneak out the back while everyone is distracted. Cue some sort of magical/technological combination and he could build a spaceship, or a stargate, or a something and pow, cool crossover. But i think a magic-boosted spaceship could be awesome. And what smuggler wouldn't give even their mother for shipping containers or a hold that was bigger on the inside.

It takes him a while to adjust to this magic thing, but progressively navigates (re:brutally kills) his way through corrupt Aurors, politicians, some Order members and eventually the DeathEaters. Plus, with horcruxes there can be sequels, which Taken is prone to. I'm imagining a 10 minute fight scene dedicated to him and Moody duking it out, ending with Moody losing another limb.

- Something like /Forests of Valbone/ but with a feel that is more like /The Hatchet/ (the book) i.e. Harry doesn't have the Sorting Hat to mentor him along. Just Harry, wand and the wilderness. No discovering he is a mage or can do wandless magic.

So, I loved the SnapexLupin of it all but of course I always love SnapexLupin. And I thought the mystery setup was good but not the payoff.

I could tell it was going to be [insert culprit's name here because no spoilers] and well, I don't care about him nor do I find him particularly interesting.

The Dante stuff is cool but the story is also weirdly religious themed while trying to state that it's not. Struck me as odd (just the way it was written in, didn't seem to fit).

** An AU story where Harry has a younger sister, but doesn't know. Either her death was staged, or her existence was kept a close secret, and all the people involved were Obliviated. In truth, she was kidnapped by loyal Death Eaters, who keep her as "insurance" of sorts, to be used against the BWL or for Voldemort should he return.

She is treated like a tool by her "family". In Harry's second year, she's the one who gets the diary. She's also tasked with observing Harry or sabotaging him. Through a series of events, Harry ends up rescuing her, and they eventually get together. When Harry witnesses Voldemort's return, the Death Eaters who "adopted" her leak her true parentage to the press in order to discredit Harry. At this point it's publicly known that they're a couple, and the Daily Prophet has a field day with this.

None of this crap matters though, I just want Harry to bone his sister ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
