All I remember is that female harry is given a doll because ' all young females should have a doll to properly grow their magic' and a scene where harry is brushing her dolls hair with other girls? Thanks for the help

EDIT: I remembered some more of the story, the doll was a gift from her fiancee(?) and was made by a famous doll maker.


** Do you remember if female harry has a different name or if the fic was a crossover?
