I can't recall too much of it, but there are two scenes I recall- one was when Emma Granger began poking Dumbledore's chest and he had a nasty bruise as a result, the other was when Momma Granger began subtly threatening Petunia Dursley with social ruin.


** Only one I know where they adopt him is the Accidental Animagus, but don't remember either of these scenes from that..
