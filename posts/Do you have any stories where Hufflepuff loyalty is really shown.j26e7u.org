Something terrible could have happened and the entire Hufflepuff house is outraged and screams and cursed and spits fire like never before and the hole great hall is shocked silence because they never saw those 'weaklings' and 'losers' like this and are just scared out if their shit. Like when Cedric dies and they want vengeance.

The better if professor Sprout is in with it.


** “Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly“ is [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][the whole sereies]] of next-gen Dudley Dursley's daughter (but that's just her background, the series has its own very original story line, it is not just that Dudley's daughter is a witch), who is a Hufflepuf and the author made a lot of effort to show different houses to be truly different. Highly recommended!
