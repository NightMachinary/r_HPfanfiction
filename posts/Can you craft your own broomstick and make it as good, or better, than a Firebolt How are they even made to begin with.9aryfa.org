Can a wizard as talented as Dumbledore make a broomstick that's even better than a Firebolt? I've seen lots of them use Arithmancy, what are the most creative ways you've seen characters make their own flying broom?


** My headcanon is that with precise enchantments like those on a broomstick, you really need to specialise to eke out the best quality you can. I think Dumbledore could make a halfway decent broom if he wanted, but it would take him quite some time and many failed attempts to work out how to make something like a Firebolt.

Here is my take on broom construction:

There are a number of charms and enchantments used on a broom. We know some of these from canon (cushioning, Horton-Keitch braking charm, etc). Layering multiple enchantments within a single object is a tricky business, and is half the battle of broom construction. If you take Arithmancy to be used in spell creation, then it could be important for both spell improvement and for making the layers of spellwork stable when used together. These aspects are still very important even if you don't think arithmancy is related. Another tricky aspect is quality control. You must know the spellwork inside and out to be able to get such consistent results. The materials also have to be consistent.

How they are made. I suspect the process includes some or all of the following, and maybe other things:

- Individual spellwork on each tail twig
- Soaking the materials in potions
- Seeking out and correctly preparing high quality wood
- Casting a number of charms in a specific way so that they work together and stay stable
- If you're into runes, they probably have those and all

I would say no. Dumbledore was (probably) the greatest Wizard alive /overall/. But he's not the greatest in every aspect. Snape is better with potions. I think it's said that Voldemort is better at legilimency. Seeing as seers exist and he's not one, he's not the best at divination. Etc.

Maybe he could make a better broom if he spent several years learning, practicing, then experimenting and pushing the boundaries of broomstick crafting.

There was one fic where, after the war, Hermione made a broom for Harry. It was supposed to be some grand gesture I think, I can't really remember the details. Anyway, it was actually a broom/wand hybrid. She used wand-making techniques - primarily by including a wand core. Seeing as the broom was for Harry, it was made from holly and had a phoenix feather within it.

** Sure, Dumbledore could make a better broom.

Technically so could Harry if he studied/learned how to make brooms.

** I like to imagine they're like the wizard equivalent of a desktop computer, where users typically buy prebuilt one, but one can customize and build their own

** Well, I like to think of copying a concept from Star Fox/F-Zero, and having a G-Diffuser. Something something force absorption, exploit the inertia-gravity-field-relationship, do something so that the broom and rider are weightless and can instantly change velocity without acceleration/deacceleration.
