I read one that had them succeed to take a part of his soul and it changed who he is forever. I hope you guys have some other ones that feature the same idea


** There's linkffn(6865828), What We Have Is What We Make Of It.\\
It's fairly short, Harry has a mental disability that gives him trouble interacting with others and performing spells, but he's exceptional at potions.\\
About halfway through, a brief encounter with a dementor implicitly empowers the scar horcrux, causing Harry severe nightmares to the point that he needs to go to St Mungos.

  The Killing Curse didn't leave Harry unaffected that night. Ten years later at Hogwarts saw a fledgling Gryffindor make a friend, and a savior who needed saving find a future... and the world changed.

** There's one of my all-time favorite five called linkffn(The Second String) where the Dementor's Kiss actually sends him back in time.

It's a pre-Hogwarts time travel fix but, get this: It happens before Harry knows about the Horcruxes.

It's one of the best reads I've ever had. Truly incredible.

It's updated pretty frequently and is in its third arc.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

  Summer before third year Harry has a life changing experience, and a close encounter with a dementor ends with him absorbing the horcrux within him. Features Harry with a backbone.
