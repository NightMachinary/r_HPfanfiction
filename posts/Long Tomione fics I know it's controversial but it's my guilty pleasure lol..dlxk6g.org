(Sorry in advance for formatting, on mobile) Preferably at least 80k words, and /please/ no redemption! I hate with every particle of my being where Tom meets Hermione and goes "well, guess I'll just give up my plans of world domination because that's totally in character!" Time travel is cool, AU is cool, soulmates and/or soulbonds are not so cool but still pretty cool if written very well. Some I've read which are basically what I'm looking for are: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15707220/chapters/36506895][Nothing Like The Sun]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10643571/chapters/23549517][Blood and Gold]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5012851/chapters/11520664][Addendum: He Is Also A Liar]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936][Birds of a Feather]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12801672/chapters/29219964][Strange Attractors]], and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7728303/1/][Unsphere the Stars]].

*** Oh, I'm reading that one! I'm only a few chapters in, but it seems.. okay, so far. I wouldn't say it's my fave but I'd recommend it.

** Oh I have got you!!! These can all be found on A03 ([[http://www.archiveofourown.com][www.archiveofourown.com]])

The Thrall by LovelyVillian Madam Umbridge Home For Wayward Girls by LovelyVillian The Department of Magical Law Enforcement by devdevlin

They are all WIP's but despite this are already over 200k words (Madam Umbridge is over 600k and I honestly could read another 600k-it's THAT good). These two authors are, I swear, actually professional writers who can't officially publish these stories due to copyright restrictions and the use of the world of Harry Potter. They are SO WELL WRITTEN. They are dark, they are sinful, they are “bad ass Hermione” meets “equally bad ass yet sociopathic Tom Riddle”-who seems to somehow actually find it in his gruesome heart to care for Hermione (and Hermione alone). And even though Tom Riddle cares for Hermione against his better sociopathic judgment and natural inclination, in all of these stories, he is not affected or changed by her lightness. He is beyond redemption and we love him for it. In fact, if either of these two is affected by the other, it is that Hermione maybe, just maybe, learns through Tom to embrace and accept the darkness already living inside of her. SWOOON. If you do read any of these, I'd love to hear your thoughts on them as I am a hopeless addict, myself.

*** Yay!! Thank you so much, I know not many people like tomione (understandably, it comes off as pretty FUCKED UP) but I actually really enjoy it, there's a lot of good material! I'm absolutely going to read all of these this afternoon and then regret it in the morning because I stayed up until 2. Yay for sociopathic Tom! I like it when he's not redeemed/redeemable. Thanks again :)

  Hermione is killed by Voldemort, and is now dead. Well, sort of. Turns out that death is a little more complex than she knew. Ignores epilogue and last 50ish pages of DH.

  Ultima ratio - the last resort. At last the day of the Final Battle against Lord Voldemort has come. Harry, Ron and Hermione fight bravely against their nemesis - but then something goes wrong. And Hermione finds herself alone in a precarious situation.
