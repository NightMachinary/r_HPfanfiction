:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
All I can really remember is that when Voldemort uses Harry's blood to revive himself it somehow also causes Lily to be brought back at the same time. But she comes back in godrics hollow. I also think it was mentioned that she had some vague memories from Harry's life up to that point cause her soul was protecting him.


** Interesting plot. I'm saving this post

  The blood magic used in Little Hangleton Graveyard does more than grant Lord Voldemort bodily form; it also brings Lily and James Potter back from the dead. OoTP AU but follows OoTP closely. Lily/James, Jily

  The events of the graveyard result in interesting ramifications as Lord Voldemort is not the only one who returns to a body. Harry/Multi.
