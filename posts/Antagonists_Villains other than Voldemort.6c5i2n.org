Whether its demons/gods/Dumbledore/Grindelwald or whatever our twisted minds come up with, are there any good fics that have something different as the main opposing force?

I know a lot of crossovers use the main villain from somewhere else but I'm looking for more HP centric fics. But I'll totally read a great crossover! I'm all open for suggestions :D

** Crossovers:

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-26436-16/DianeCastle+The+League+of+Extraordinary+Women.htm][The League of Extraordinary Women]] by [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/AuthorStories-22082/DianeCastle.htm][DianeCastle]] features the Potterverse Hermione as the main character. Several years after Voldemort's defeat, she had to gather a team of six heroines (Sam Carter from SG1, Buffy and Willow from the Vampire Slayers, Selina Kyle from the Justice League, Jaime from the Bionic Woman, and Alex Mack from the Terawattverse) to defeat an invasion from the hell dimension.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), is a SG crossover. I would say it could be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][Darth Marrs]]'s best work by far, as long as he doesn't mess up the remaining third of the story (which he did sometimes). The main antagonist so far is Ra, the System Overlord; but Ori the Enemy will certainly appear later on the stage. It's also the sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942), a SW crossover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of the Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136), is about Ginny and Sirius making a new career in the World of Ice and Fire.

Non Crossovers:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe][A Riddled Universe]], linkffn(8678567): Tom Riddle was a good guy here. But there are dark forces conspiring against him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]], linkffn(4889913): A Hallows obsessed Hermione was the main villain.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): Rulers of Magical France and Russia were the main antagonists.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(10099028), is a Voldemort free AU. There were no supervillains or Dark Lords here, but nevertheless some familiar and new bad guys.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11487602/1/Resurrexit][Resurrexit]], linkffn(11487602), has a grieving and vengeful Harry as the main villain.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

This is an after the war fic that deals with events surrounding the Forbidden Forest. I don't want to give to much away, but it pretty fantastic in my opinion. Hope this is something sort of like what you want.

Features a really cool depiction of the department of mysteries.

Edit: It is unfortunately unfished, as is the case with many great stories.
