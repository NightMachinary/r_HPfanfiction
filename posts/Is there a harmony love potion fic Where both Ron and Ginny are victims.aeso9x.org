In a lot of h/hr (and what's that about? how did hr become shorthand for Hermione Granger when both names have 3 Rs? why not hg?) fics Ginny doses Harry, Hermione, and sometimes Ron with love potions to attract Harry to her and repel Hermione to Ron. Sometimes Ron or Dumbledore or Molly are in on it but I haven't yet seen one where Ginny is dosed by Dumbledore/Molly. Is there one where Ron and Ginny are both innocent and are horrified when they find out?


** Not exactly what you're looking for but if you like Harmony check out linkffn(Time is the Fire by Oddment Tweak). It starts at the epilogue and goes back and forth in time. Time travel fic where Harry is manipulated into being with Ginny. Ron and Ginny aren't involved in the deception and time travel is used to fix it. Won't spoil anything else for you, just check it out.

  What would you do if the only way to save the person you loved was to sacrifice everything else that you held dear? DH-Epilogue compliant, sort of. Some HP/GW and RW/Hr, but ultimately, epically, HP/Hr.

** I do remember one where Ginny was dosed as well, but Ron is usually either part of the plot or out of it entirely

** So... I know it's super late and you've probably moved on but there's linkffn(It's For The Best by witowsmp) where both Ginny and Harry are love potioned (You can easily guess who)

  Total Dumbledore bashing. He's manipulating many people, including Harry, for his own purposes. Story starts a month after Harry has been told the prophecy in OotP. Eventually HHr

** I really like this premise! Unfortunately, nothing I've read or heard of calls to mind that fits that prompt exactly. However linkffn(Harry Potter and Future's Past by Driftwood1965) does an interesting take on the whole love potion trope.

Ginny is the one making the potions but her infatuation with Harry is treated extremely interestingly and in my opinion does more for the character's complexity and intrigue than JKR ever did. She is definitely a victim in her own way. Ron is consciously involved in the plot and is bashed but later comes around in true Ron fashion. Dumbledore is bashed but isn't involved in the potions, and later has serious character introspection and seems to be making attempts toward redemption.

  Starts out the day after the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry and Hermione meet the Goddess of Love, and she offers to let them go back in time. Strictly Harry and Hermione. Minor - well maybe major Ginny, Ron and Dumbledore Bashing. Soul Bond - Time Travel
