This sub mostly hates it, because people are reading it like a normal story.

HPMoR is not a story. It's crack. It's crack on crack. It's crack on martian mushrooms.

Petunia married a scientist? That makes no sense? It doesn't matter, because it's crack. Crack is crack. Crack can do whatever.

Does the story stretch the limits of its premise for a joke that rapidly gets old? (comedtea) It's crack!

In all seriousness, do not try to read HPMoR like a normal story. I did, and I liked it, but I also liked Euclid's /Elements/. If you are not used to reading dry academic texts, you will not enjoy reading it like a normal story. Because it is a story crossed with a self-written textbook.

Skip the boring parts. Skip most of the rationality stuff- if you want to know the author's work on rationality, go to his website and read the wiki. If something is too complicated to understand in a few minutes, skip it. I have tried to fully understand most of the stuff, and it mostly makes sense.

Try to read for the plot, humour, subplots, etc. Skip the rationality. Skip the blatantly OOC Harry, because he is canonically not Harry.

Now go forth and prosper.

Edit: For everyone who has a problem with how smart or iamverysmart the author is, or how he sounds in author notes, or how he asks for donations, or his organizations, read about [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor][Death of the Author]]. The story is a separate thing from the author.


** If your advice to better enjoy a story is "Skip parts of it!" Then it's probably not a good story, "crack" or otherwise.

The best way to enjoy HPMOR? Skip it. Just...skip it.

**** the story explicitly dismisses any character that does not match hpjev's intelligence. Ron, an everyman, loyal, relatable character, Harry's moral compass, and objectively a well written and interesting character, is straight up rejected, and is literally untouched besides one joke in the beginning and a few mentions during the army battles. Furthermore, despite the fic's pretense of "we will use the scientific method to dissect magic!" 97% of hpjev's reasoning is explicitly Aristotelian, sometimes with obvious jumps and gaps in logic, with zero experimentation or observation to support his hypotheses. In fact, there is literally NO practical observation or experimentation in the entire book besides one chapter. Furthermore, a lot of the scientific topics mentioned in HPMOR are explicitly wrong or misinterpreted, or exaggerated beyond all reason. Also, the final solution was complete and utter bullshit and had no way of working. The author also did not rigidly define the limitations of his interpretations of HP's magic system, which makes a lot of HPJEV's "clever solutions" feel like utter asspulling. The prose is also really fucking irritating to read.

Here's my ancient blogpost. I think some of the links might be dead now, though.

Edit: rereading my teenage rambles now, it seems like there are some obvious places that need polishing (also that's a comically angry blog post). But I think my main argument... Stands. Namely that if you accept the evidence as it is provided you can come up with a better model than "it's just recessive and squibs are all individually loss-of-function mutations".

Exactly! That's the point of the story! Harry doesn't walk in with all the answers. He's wrong a lot, he makes stupid, thoughtless mistakes all the time. The story is about Harry learning how to /become/ a more rational person.

This is probably the most often misunderstood part of the story. I feel most people who don't like the story think Harry is a Mary Sue self-insert, which he is very very very much not.

Harry is not the teacher of rationality. He is the student.

I don't agree that it had no way of working, but I do think it was only a moderately strong solution. The author agrees, in an interview he said that he had better ideas by the time he got to the end, but he had already foreshadowed the solution pretty explicitly in the first couple sentences in the story, and he felt it was too late to make such major changes.

***** I don't think that's a fair read of the book as a whole, though it is an obvious takeaway, especially if someone locked in their take from the first quarter of it. The dissecting magic turned out just to be an object lesson in how arrogant of a little twit Harry was and a series of little setups for later callbacks.

Proceeds to ask to be put in contact with JKR for purposes of more explicit commercialization. Not sporting at all.There is plenty of interesting magic and worldbuilding (best Transfiguration system in the fandom/ Philosophers stone concept/David Monroe/ Origins of Phoenixes / Interdiction of Merlin) and the unofficial sequel Significant Digits is a lot more well-written/less pretentious but HPMOR itself is a lot more controversial.

**** I can explain.

I think HPMOR is /entertaining/ and /enjoyable/. ... As a work of original fiction. As its own thing, with its own priorities, in its own world.

But as other responses to your comment showed... It's also kind of disrespectful to the original work. And therefore it kind of... Insults readers who /actually liked the original work/. Which is /the vast majority of people reading a fanfic/ because of the nature of what fanfiction /is./

HPMOR is just much more interested in being a Rationality textbook of platonic dialogues with fights and weird ideas in it than it is interested in /being a fanfic of a thing people liked, for the people who liked that thing/. That is why so many people hate it.

The idea that "this Ron is a different character" or "this Harry is a different character" is fine as one thing. But... /Every/ character is a different character. Not a single character behaves "in-character". The magic doesn't work like that, the science doesn't work like that, the entire thing is more interested in its own ideas than in Harry Potter /or/ the real world.

I read a lot of crackfics. There's a /library AU/ GoT fanfic that ships Cersei Lannister with Stannis Baratheon in AO3 in which there's weird orgies off-screen for no reason. There's also a Loki/Tony slashfic in which they raise a small child together who is a weird murderous magic bird thing. I /read and enjoyed/ both of those!

But even those things are labours of /love for the source material/, in their own way. They come out of a place of... "More". And "Better". And "thank you".

HPMOR is a labour of love /for rationality/. For bayesian updating and simple deduction and so on. Not for the source material. It doesn't come from a place of "more" or "better", but... "instead", and maybe "above". There's a mild disdain in that story and people sometimes struggle to explain it (which is why they call Harry an arrogant git and so on) but it's definitely /there/. I have no reason to believe Yudkowsky picked Harry Potter as the source of his fanfic because he actually loved it, the way the authors of the two fanfics I described clearly loved the source material, even if they had strange ideas about it. He probably just sort-of liked it, thought it would be a good framework for his ideas, and then sat down to it.

That is why HPMOR pisses so many people off. It's not because "it's bad". Lots of things are bad. It's because people read fanfiction as an act of love, and HPMOR is /not/ an act of love for the source material. It's an act of love for the writer's personal perspectives on rational choice theory and so on, snuck into a space of love (fanfiction). And the moment you realize that, as a fan, can be aggressively disappointing and upsetting.

Some people are immune to this. I'm not. I would read an original Yudkowsky book (in fact, I have!) but I would /never/ read another fanfic of /anything/ I like by him. Because HPMOR is not a real fanfic. It's an original work with original characters and a radically reimagined magical society and population... Coated in Harry Potter terminology like a wolf in sheep's clothing. It's a lie. I do not enjoy being lied to.

****** It's not that the author is disrespectful say, on his own time when he's saying stuff on Twitter. The /entire work/ feels inherently disrespectful because of how it /treats the source material./ For example, the entire analysis of the genetics of the thing /is complete bullshit/ and doesn't properly explain the observed data in the books. I know this because /I personally/ came up with a model of Harry Potter genetics that /does/ fit the data by creating a 3-gene system of epistasis and I ran it through my genetics professor when I was working on a personal project.

He just invented historical couples that had excessive amounts of children (despite wizards frequently having very very few children) in order to make the math easy, and gave Harry access to their number of children so that he could figure out it was a single Mendelian gene, because he felt like that kinda made sense, maybe.

That shows... He doesn't /care/. He didn't even fucking /try/. Great rationalist Eliezer Yudkowsky can't /bother/ to look up anything about genetics past Gregor Mendel in order to actually create a model that explains the data? Why am I reading this fic where he didn't even /try/? Use the /actual/ evidence you little--

Anyway.

It's not /about/ the author. Yudkowsky actually seems like a nice enough dude, certainly nicer now than when he wrote HPMOR. The /work/ betrays the disdain. The /work/ is disrespectful. That is why I struggle to enjoy /the work/.

What I just described is not a private opinion of the author. It's a /part/ of the work.

Yudkowsky could 100% agree with me on all points about /both works/ and it would not make me enjoy HPMOR more.

Replacing all of the Harry Potter specific terms with rough equivalents that are different enough that my brain is not constantly expecting Harry Potter and constantly being disappointed /would/ make me enjoy HPMOR more. I literally tried to make a filter to do that once, but I gave up halfway through the character names.

HPMOR as its own work would be fine. But I can't read those names and terms and so on and /not expect Harry Potter/. I told you, some people are immune to this problem. I am glad you are! /I am not./ If you write a story about Harry Potter, 16th century stable boy, and it's just an original story but it shares a bunch of the names /reading it will fuck with my brain/.

I don't want Harry Potter wrapping. I want Harry Potter. Maybe /different/ Harry Potter. Maybe /better/ Harry Potter. Maybe only partially Harry Potter! But... Not /wrapping/.

This...

#+begin_quote

Is... Confusing to me. Since the "stuffing" is /all of the good things in the fic/. If I ignore them, there's basically nothing I care about there. "Treat it as its own thing" is basically advice to /ignore the wrapping/ not ignore the stuffing.

Here.

In retrospect, it's a surprisingly angry blog post, and I should have done more with questions about the distribution of these genes in the general population, etc. But even acknowledging those failures of my /teenage self/, it's a vastly better model than Yudkowsky's "well wizards are recessive and also /every single squib/ is a loss-of-function mutation".

And it's not a vastly better model because I'm "smarter" than Yudkowsky (I am /most certainly not/), but because I actually gave enough of a shit to... /try/ to cover all the cases and their implications. For example, if squibs are a loss of function mutation, literally every child they have will have /that/ loss of function mutation unless the same gene mutates back (astronomically unlikely), and therefore the wizard children of squibs make /less sense/ than the wizard children of muggles even though it's implied that most wizard children of muggles have a witch grandparent or great-grandparent somewhere, who then /necessarily/ had to have a squib child for people to think the rest of the family was muggle.

And that's like... Self-evident? Like it's not a hard deduction to make, it's just the direct consequence of "children inherit their mutant parents' genes"...

But now I'm getting worked up again, and nothing good can come out of that. I hope you enjoy my old blog post.

But I understand that you can't know everything to a deep enough level to avoid being wrong somewhere about something.

As for the AU problems, it seems you have a problems with a lot of AUs in general (which transform both the setting and the characters). Then it's not HPMoR's fault it falls within that.

Let's do a study of two rationalfics: HPMOR and Metropolitan Man.

HPMOR and Metropolitan Man both write characters differently than how they are, both involve very smart protagonists, both kind of don't-care about the source material.

But /Metropolitan Man/ is written /respectfully/. The treatment it gives kryptonite is written /by taking into account all of the evidence it can/ from the actual source material, not pulling shit out of its ass whenever it feels like it. Metropolitan Man's characters are all #Rationalist versions of themselves, but Superman is not given the HPMOR "Ron" treatment. Metropolitan Man is not written in such a way that it makes people feel stupid for /liking Superman in the first place/. Or, conversely, for getting interested in actual science and seeing the fanfic say stupid stuff about it.

Metropolitan Man is a good rationalist work /and/ a good fanfic. HPMOR is a good(ish) rationalist work and a /terrible fanfic/. It works an order of magnitude better as an original work than as a fanfic. And yes, most people /who want to read fanfics/ are looking for things that make for /good fanfics/, not good original works with a coat of paint of fandom on top.

A fanwork, in my eyes, is a work of love wrt to a pre-existing work the creator/fanfic writer/etc is a fan of.

HPMOR is not... a work of love for HP. Period. And I think we agree on that. It doesn ot scratch the Harry Potter itch, because it is not /concerned/ with scratching that itch at all. It's doing something else.

I come to fanfiction /to scratch that itch/. Not to read someone... put names I recognize onto different characters and write their own personal manifesto. So my experience of reading HPMOR is an experience of profound disappointment.

I would be on board with that angle if, say, HPMOR centred trans voices or something. IIRC that's... not the case? Yudkowsky affirmed non-binary people in Inadequate Equilibria, so /as an author/ he seems to be a lot more open-minded than JKR herself is, but... I read fanfiction because I want fanfiction.

** Why, exactly, should I make an effort to complete a story I found banal and entirely too caught up in its own 'brilliance', which doesn't really add anything I'd value to the fandom? It's not even like the author is particularly likeable or laudable, so I certainly don't 'owe' it to them. I don't expect people who don't enjoy my stories to read them anyway. Why should I have to do so for someone else?

I think I have better uses for my time.

*** If you don't want to, then don't. It's not as if I'm telling you that you must read it. There are some people who are interested in it but can't get through it, and this is for them.

** So I think you are somewhat misusing death of the author to explain away what people feel while reading this story. Death of the Author simply means ignoring what the author intended the work to mean and simply reading the text to see what it means. If people read the text and still feel it is disrespectful to the source material, then the author's intent largely doesn't matter when it comes to how people like or dislike the fic. When I tried to read it I didn't know anything about the author and still held many of the same feelings about the fic. Somewhat related, if you are skipping parts that you don't like to make the fic more tolerable to read, you really aren't allowing the text to speak for itself either. Your choosing what the text is allowed to speak to you.

*** Your idea of what “respect to the source material” means includes intent of the author. Or at least your own notion of what “fanfic” is.

If you read the story as is, there's no disrespect. There's mild ribbing on the logical problems the source material has, but much harsher criticism of the ways other fanfic interacts with it.

At least that's my interpretation.

** I've just been thinking about one thing. For me, it's like a really unique thought experiment on psychology, the way the mind works, the way people behave and react in extreme circumstances etc., not a literature story in its classic meaning.

It's not meant to be read as the originals, it's the original story that is twisted to an extreme level, and that makes almost everyone super unrelatable and so surreal that you can't even keep up with all the craziness it provides. This is the starting point and let's see how the characters will fit into this insane version of the world!

** HPMOR may be my favorite written work. I also enjoyed Metropolitan Man and Worm/Ward, but nothing has approached HPMOR for me. Maybe I just like competence porn with a scientific angle?

I make this point (1) to suggest no one reads work they don't enjoy, especially HPMOR, and (2) to solicit new recommendations from outside the HPMOR subreddit.
