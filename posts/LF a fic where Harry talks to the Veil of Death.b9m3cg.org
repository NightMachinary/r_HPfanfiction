I'm looking for a fic with these details that I forgot the name of: From what I remember, Harry uses his memory of the Veil of Death to learn from the voices that were coming out of the Veil, including learning about the runes in the runes on the Veil. Eventually, iirc, he gets Sirius out of the Veil.

Thanks!!!!

#+begin_quote
  In the days after Sirius falls through the veil, Harry retreats into silence and watches as the scene repeats itself in his mind's eye. He knows that if he can just understand what was said by those whispering voices, that he could rescue his godfather.
