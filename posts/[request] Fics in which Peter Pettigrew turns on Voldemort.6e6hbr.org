Share them sweet Wormtail redemption stories. Every author and their son writes about Lucius being redeemed yet I've not come across many where PP turns.

Whilst Peter committed atrocities he just didn't want to die and having seen the seemingly unstoppable force of nature that is Voldemort tearing through the world, I can understand why he did what he did.


** Ah, I've always wanted to read one of those, and might write some day, after I'm done with /The Innocent Dementor/ and (hopefully) /Voldemort and the Struggle for Life/. (I do have a thing for writing stories about the redemption of rarely-redeemed villains, don't I?)

I seem to recall one story which took place in the Limbo Train Station (with a Discworld-inspired Grim Reaper), where one chapter dealt with Peter in a very sympathetic light. Don't remember the title, though.

**** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331820/1/][*/The Innocent Dementor/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7922987/Achille-Talon][/Achille Talon/]]

#+begin_quote
  The Dementors of Azkaban are soul-sucking monsters, but only becaused their own parents raised them that way. A young Dementor grows up alone in an abandoned wizarding castle, and when he faces the outside world's Dementors and the wizards' opinion of them, it comes as quite a shock. In progress.

  AU diverging at Harry and Voldemort's confrontation in front of the Mirror of Erised (details in preface). What if Voldemort was not, actually, as evil as the (vague) stories told to Harry up to that point make him out to be?

** The "Backstory" scene at the end of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/108/Odd-Ideas][Chapter 108 of Rorschach's Blot's "Odd Ideas"]] (before the "unrelated Omake") should fit your request.

** I seem to recall that in the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Dangerverse][Dangerverse]] series, Peter remains in Voldemort's employ, but secretly marries a muggle and reforms somewhat.

Personally I'm still waiting for a story where Peter Pettigrew was never the Secret Keeper or betrayer or whatnot in the first place.

*** This actually happens in the Saving Connor universe. It has probably my favorite portrayal of Peter. Song of the Trees also has a good redemption of Peter where he hated Sirius but adores James.
