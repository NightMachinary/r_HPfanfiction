Ok, this will probably require a bit of explaining. What I mean by this is Harry operating in multiple bodies, while still being one individual. Still confusing? Have an example linkffn(12361240) (warning slight spoilers for that fic) In this (hilarious) fic, the Gryffindor chasers get mind melded, basically it's just one entity (titling itselfs "the chasers") controlling three bodies. (spoilers over) This is what I'm looking for. Odd request? Yep. Do I want to see it regardless because I think it's a unique idea I want to see more of? Yep. If Harry becomes mind melded with someone, it could be anyone around his age preferably (except Draco) and the two bodies should not be romantically attracted to each other. It's one person in two bodies, kinda hard to be attracted to yourself.


** Kind of a spoiler, really, but it happens in linkffn(5614134), Quo Vadis?. [[/spoiler][There aren't only two or three bodies being controlled, though.]]

  It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way.

***** Oh wow...That one was really good, and basically exactly what I was looking for, though I would have been fine with a less dark version of it (Make no mistake, the dark nature of this one was fantastic, just saying that I'm not JUST looking for dark fics. I'm fine either way.) Much thanks go to you, Ruskbyte! :D

** [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] had a fic somewhat like this that I personally enjoyed, but it has since been taken down from ff.net. I think you can find it on DLP but I'm not sure. I believe it was named Essence Divided.

***** I consider my FF.Net profile my "public face" as it were, and as such I like to reserve it for my best writing. If people want to see behind the scenes at my history as a writer that's fine, but I don't advertise it up front.

** Looks like the bot didn't work (or I just got it wrong?), but the story I'm referring to is "Play up, play up, and break the game!" by Bakuraptor on ffnet. There's a promotional reddit post about it somewhere on this subreddit. I'll try the bot again, but FYI this is my first time using it so I doubt I'll get it right :(
