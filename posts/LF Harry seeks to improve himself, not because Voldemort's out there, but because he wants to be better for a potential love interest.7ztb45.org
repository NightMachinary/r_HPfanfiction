So I was reading The Chamber of Known Facts (can't link to it right now, FFN's on the fritz, but it's pretty good so far) (cancel that, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5972886/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Known-Facts][here it is]]), and I saw it; the getting-somewhat-cliche-by-now part where after Harry learns about Voldemort, he decides that he has to be stronger and tougher and more wizard-er, and so starts training himself to be powerful independent Harry and stuff.

I have to wonder; are there any fics where Harry, instead of going 'Voldemort's out there, I knew it before but it's really hit me, VOLDEMORT'S OUT THERE, OMFG I need to level grind to beat him!', is instead motivated to train, do research, and otherwise better himself because he's in love?

(Insert mini-fic here about Harry realising he's in love with Hermione and redoubling his study of Arithmancy to try and impress her.)


** Hm, I had one in mind (name escapes me), but since FF is down I can't look it up in my favs list... I'll edit once FF stops screwing up, lol

*** So I think the fic I'm thinking of is "Let Us Cling Together", though it's a soul bond fic (not everyone's cup of tea).
