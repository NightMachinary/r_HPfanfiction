I enjoyed reading Make a Wish but admit that I got disappointed when Harry eventually found out that he was becoming a legend and started living up to it. I was happier with the "I'm just a man on vacation" vibe.


** Try linkffn(On a Train, Switching Tracks), which is quite a funny story. It starts with Harry telling Ron and Draco Malfoy that muggle celebrities are crazy. Both immediately jump to the conclusion since Harry is a) a celebrity, and b) raised Muggle, he too would be crazy should he ever figure out his celebrity status. Thus begins the saga of Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Never-Knew, and incidentally, turns out to be eccentric all by himself.

  First year: "Celebrities," Harry said. "Fame makes them mad. I take it the wizarding world doesn't really have them, then?" Draco and Ron exchanged glances. "No, not really." AU, assorted oneshots and snippets.

  When the Dursleys die in a car crash, Dumbledore is left with a quandary as to where to place the Boy-Who-Lived. That is, until he remembers another relative of Lily's: a cousin in Japan. Rated M just be safe.

** Storybook Hero linkffn(7597067) has a similar vibe.

  Harry is sure he's living in a fairy tale with himself as the hero. Really, what else makes sense?
