So I've been reading a lot of stuff with the Marauders as the main characters. I know linkffn(The Life and Times) is great. And i've read a lot of Hermione Time Travel like linkffn(The Debt of Time) , linkffn(Hourglass) and linkffn(A Good Life)

But i wanna read something that tells you about how they all met and became friends, how they discovered Remus was a werewolf, how they prepared for their NEWTS and how their friendship fell apart during the war. Are there any stories like that? It doesn't have to be canon-compliant tho.

I also know there's a fanfic like that in russian and i've already read it. Now i'm looking for english ones.


** Here are two of my favorite stories: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387][All the Young Dudes]]. Both of them are about Remus. Not sure if it's your cup of tea, but All the Young Dudes is a Remus/Sirius. It is, however, complete. Against the Moon is not slash, but it is far from complete.

**** If it's any consolation, Against the Moon has 134 chapters. The author hasn't posted anything in a long time, but she's super active when she feels like writing. You mentioned wanting to see James, Sirius, and Peter discover Remus's secret, and I have yet to read anything more beautiful than that moment in AtM.

***** Till which year has the author managed to write to? I just skimmed through one of the later chapters, and they're not using their animagus nicknames - hasn't she gotten to at least fifth year yet, even after 850k words?

****** About a third of the way through third year, lol. There's a lot of side plots and character development: She's a beast at writing. When she's inspired, she'll crank out like fifty chapters at a time. There was point like two summers ago that it felt like a chapter was posted every other day. She hasn't written much since then. Though she is still writing, I promise. Wrote a monster of a Star Trek fic, and now she's working on a Lord of the Rings story. AtM isn't abandoned though. Just on hold.

******** Right??? The thing that's really insane is that it has not dipped in quality once over 134 chapters. I try to write, and it's absolute agony sometimes to get a thousand words down. I'm a huge fan of the story...but I'm also, extremely jealous.

***** God, after finishing against the moon I just wanted to obliviate myself and read it again. May I ask a question? What do you think of Remus's characterization in that story? I know there are people who aren't particularly happy with it.

** Loved In Spite of Ourselves, by orphan_account on AO3 is one of my favorites. It takes the Marauders all the way through Hogwarts, then goes AU after that. It is Remus/Sirius, but it's a well-developed story about all of the Marauders.
