It's finished reading what's written of linkffn(12659284) and am loving it. I'm looking for similar stories, where nobody knows about the relationship outside family, where the Malfoys are supportive of the relationship, where Hermione learns about the Pureblood culture, where she still has a relationship with Harry. Over 100k wording please. It needs to be during the Hogwarts years

Thank you!

  Once upon a time Hermione Granger literally ran into Draco Malfoy in a bookshop. His mother sees a connection between her son and the muggleborn that she can't ignore and determines to get to know the girl. An imagining of how things could have gone if Hermione had been taken under the wing of the Malfoy family.

** This isn't exactly what you asked for (it's Hermione/Tom), but I still think you might like it. Narcissa basically adopts Hermione and travels back in time with her to save Tom Riddle. It's got family relationships and the pureblood elitism that you seem to be into...and it's well written (all 280,000+ words of it!) and interesting even though it's not what I typically go for.

  Narcissa Malfoy is done with crazy, and she is determined to fix the mess her life has become. She has brains, a plan, and more than one dark spell to help her. But before she can put her plan into motion, she discovers a shocking secret about Hermione Granger, one that the girl doesn't even realize about herself. Before Hermione knows it, Narcissa has cursed them both, sending them back in time to deal with the Dark Lord in the form of the child Tom Riddle. Of course, Tom is no ordinary child, and time doesn't take kindly to being rewritten, so this will be a bumpy ride full of awesome, magical women, pragmatic decisions, and, rest assured, dear readers, plenty of sex eventually!
