If you're reading "Partially Kissed Hero" by chance, please stop - it's not getting better, it's only getting downhill from wherever you are.

linkffn(Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure Part 1 By dunuelos) if you want a "bad!Dumbledore" taken over by a "good!Dumbledore". It feels rather good, especially after a bad!Dumbledore story, because comeuppance.

linkffn(A long journey home), the "Close Encouters" Chapter if you have read the story already. It's worth to read a second time.

linkffn(Barefoot by Zaxaramas) is a good!Dumbledore, that has a few flaws, but in general it's a fun and happy story.

*** Definite second on "Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure Part 1" and "Barefoot". Both very entertaining.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
