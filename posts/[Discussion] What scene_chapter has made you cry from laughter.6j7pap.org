Not talking about funniest fics, just a scene that genuinely made you laugh audibly.

A few days ago someone made a post about the Madame Malkin scene in HPMoR, and although I wouldn't reread the entire fic, that scene did indeed make me giggle.

Anyone else?

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** One of the absolute funniest fics I've ever read is "The Secret Diary of Draco Malfoy: Aristocrat, Ne'er do Well, Rampant Homosexual" by Alysian_Fields. I've never laughed out loud so much when reading a fanfic before and can't point to a single chapter since just about all of them were funny.

It's a crack fic spoof of "Bridget Jones's Diary" with Draco as Bridget and Harry as Mark Darcy. Everyone is OOC, but if you enjoyed the original Bridget Jones, you'll love this version. While it ends on a bit of a shark jumping moment, it makes sense given the tone of the piece. Thankfully, it doesn't follow canon of either series too closely. It also contains references to other pop culture gems like "Clueless" and Draco calling his father the "gayest straight man" alive because of how he takes care of his hair.

Here's an example of how it's funny:

Friday 20th September.

Dear Diary,

[...]

Ooh, Professor Sprout just walked past. Ooh, there's a woman screaming for a makeover if ever there was one. Good God, the woman looks as though she's just thrown on an old potato sack and called it a robe. And is that the Sorting Hat she's got on her head? It certainly looks like it. Oh, and she could do with about a bucket-load of Dr Santiago's Sleek and Shine potion on that hair of hers. Ick. Oh, there's the bell. It's Herbology next, so I have to go and spend the next two hours looking at Sprout. Fabulous.

Sunday 22nd September.

Dear Diary,

Karma really is a bitch. Having mentioned how hideous Sprout is in my last entry, I went to Herbology and got a load of Stinksap in the face. This prompted a load of oh-so-funny comments from Blaise about whether I preferred to spit or swallow. I was not happy.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

** I was cracking up a lot while reading linkffn(10298713) but sadly the mood isn't consistent throughout the entire fic. I believe I dropped it eventually. Many of the first chapters are 10/10 though and it's worth checking out for how ingeniously it's written.

It has a great Madame Malkin scene too (chapter 2), funnily enough, and chapter 5 is really something else.

*** This might be off-topic, but have any of you noticed that many of the fanfics named "Chaos Theory", "Butterfly Effect", and so on, still cling incredibly hard to the Stations of Canon? It's extremely frustrating - that's like a complete antithesis to the title, and they don't even do this ironically. As if regular canon rehashes weren't enough, these ones just lure you in and disappoint you later. The authors must know what their titles mean, right? It's just- argh!

**** Lol I generally hate canon rehashing and my biggest problem of all is The Triwizard Tournament without any changes made to it. Such a potential to make it interesting and surprising and nope.. it's like you're reading badly written Goblet of Fire every time, just ugh. I often stop reading if I see that it's going to be the usual snorefest.

Also hate when the author spends 100k+ words on every year from year 1. AND IT'S ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME PLOT AS CANON. Except Harry does all these things as a Slytherin. Or a girl. Or he befriends Draco or Severus while doing the canon things.

Yeah this is even deeper off-topic but damn.

I'm triggered.

Chaos Theory isn't a fic you'd want to read for the plot though, that's true, and if you take it seriously you're just gonna end up annoyed. I'd only ever link it for its quirkiness and that's it. It can be endearing if you accept it for what it is.

  Chaos: when the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future. One gene varies, one neuron fires, one butterfly flaps its wings, and Draco Malfoy's life is completely different. Draco has always found a certain comfort in chaos. Perhaps he shouldn't.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/384445/chapters/629381][This]] fic seems like it would be a horror show, and to be honest, I didn't actually read after four or five chapters. But its written well enough, and there's a scene in the first chapter that made me laugh so hard that I cried. If you decide to read just the first chapter, its when "Hadrian" gets to James's story.

** The scene in “You Did What!” with the “Hufflepuff for Life” declaration. It's audacious to the point where it can be considered cringe-worthy, sure, but with the series already setting you up for absurd humour and that is a punchline of a kind.

Then again, I've laughed out loud pretty much every chapter, so that's that.
