I don't want Hermione bashing, as Book 5 Hermione (Only Book 5) is my favourite character outside of Luna (Book 6 Canon does enough Hermione bashing, the book turns the badass that was Book 5 Hermione that was willing to basically lead a corrupt Teacher/Headmistress/Ministry Official to her death, into Book 6 Hermione who whines like a brat about an annotated Textbook, becomes a moronic Hypocrite (Confunds McLaggen so Ron gets on the team, gets pissy about Harry sleight of handing with the Felix Felicis to give Ron a confidence boost)) and refuses to believe Harry that Malfoy was clearly a Death Eater causing trouble)

No Slash either (I don't want to read Harry x Draco x Snape x Voldemort x any Male death eater. Sexgod Snape is just like WTF)

I just want to see a fic, either no pairing/gen, or any female that ISN'T Hermione. I don't want Hermione to use her "SMARTEST WITCH OF HER GENERATION" brain to solve everything for Harry, I just want her shunted to the Lavender Brown level of Background Character at the least.

This is mostly because there's no in-between with Hermione. She's either an evil vindictive bitch who betrayed Harry for books, or she's Harry's soulmate even if he's in another relationship, and his best friend (not Ron) if he's not with her, and is written with the ability to do literally no wrong. "Oh look, a Harry x Veela fic. LolJK Hermione is in the pairing too, and we made her a Veela using the magical bond because Harry is in love with her"


** Following fics have her as a background, and yet sympathetic character:

** I'd argue book 5 Hermione had shades of her book 6 personality. She manipulated Harry into teaching a group of students.

But the fandom is very polar. I'll try looking, but inevitably, the only story neutral to Hermione is one she's dead in.

** Hermione is a very minor character in the Art of Self-Fashioning. linkffn(11585823)

She also appears but is pretty irrelevant in:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time)

and I just realized I already wrote the above in a post about a month ago

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/blvwdq/lf_no_hermione/]]

granted that doesn't filter out bashing or slash, but you'll likely find something to like there too. Continuing on...

In Harry Potter, Lord of the Swamp, she doesn't appear at all. Really funny too.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2673074/chapters/5976971?view_adult=true]]

If she appeared in Bad Oracle, I don't remember, which means she's irrelevant there too.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13788267/chapters/31695750]]

And finally there's Sole Survivor. It's like a zombie apocalypse story, without zombies, or Hermione. You'll like it.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.
