It seems to be a given that if you can cast a spell then you can use it, but...

Yea, you actually have to hit the person/object. I don't recall any canon or even fanfiction that truly mentions this issue? It seems like it would be a very major issue. Why doesn't Defence include target practice as gruesome as it sounds? Everyone seems to be naturally gifted with great accuracy which makes me wonder about sports. I don't recall much mention about the difficulty of accurately hitting or catching quidditch balls. Do wizards just have innately good accuracy, and timing? What does that imply for other sports or activities like knife throwing, archery, or even darts.

Accuracy just seems to be assumed which is reasonable, but it seems odd that I can't recall any mention of it.

+P.S. And why do spells come out straight? Why don't some interesting spells come out at a 60Â° angle instead. Seems like a neat crack idea.+


** Part of it seems to be something you can learn from practice, part of it seems to be part of the spell itself.

We know brooms can exceed 150 mph because the firebolt reaches 150 mph in 10 seconds and it's unlikely that is its top speed. We know from Deathly Hallows, that during a chase through the air at speeds of brooms, spells were able to be aimed with fair accuracy. Spells hit Hedwig, Ron nailed a death eater, and spells were for the most part aimed in the vicinity of a target.

Misses tend to be when the target is already moving (no dodging after a spell is cast). There's usually no focus on aiming when casting a spell towards something stationary, it doesn't seem to be that difficult.

My headcanon about aim are that spells originate from the wand. Spells form at the tip and shoot towards the target from the tip. The direction does not have to be the same as the direction of the wand itself. Aim is mostly about your skill with magic, though practice can help you improve your aim.

**** Reading your other comments it looks like you are thinking a wand is same as a gun, which it isn't. Guns have recoil whereas wands don't. Wands are more akin to laser pointers which most people can aim with reasonable accuracy without much practice. Also spells have to only touch a target to be fatal but bullets have to pierce critical parts of body.

** My headcanon is that since magic is all about intent a wizard casting magic is not pointing the wand somewhere and saying fancy words but rather also telling their magic "use 'insert spell here' on this target" and as such whenever they have good or bad accuracy doesn't matter since the spell will always go where the wizard is telling it to.

**** That's not what they're saying.

The idea is if you put up a bullseye, most wizards who can cast a spell can hit the bullseye every time. Because it's what they're intending to hit. If it moves while the wizard is casting, if it moves from the space that was being aimed at, then they might miss.

The spell's trajectory isn't adjusted mid flight. It is decided when it is cast.

** I think it's very clear there must be a magical component to it, and it's not actually all that similar to a gun.

Everyone who's ever been shooting (or alternatively, watched Mythbusters) knows holding a gun somewhere around the hip and firing produces terrible aim. And that's not even accounting for the fact that you actually have to /wave/ it in complicated circles before firing right at the end of it (the wand movement), which makes it flatly impossible to hit anything other than the literal broad side of a barn (if you're not further than 10ft away).

So, it can't be the case that wands work like guns firing spells straight ahead. Rather, the aim must be influenced by whatever component you want to declare is relevant in spellcasting (we don't know, in Canon) -- say, a clear mental image of what you want to hit. Magical aiming, mental aiming ... something like that. Physical aiming doesn't work.

** I like the accuracy angle, and I think a minimal amount of practice should be necessary, but I also headcanon that spells are just a physical (and magical) manifestation of the caster's /intent/. Nobody /ntends/ to miss, so if the target was standing still, nobody ever would. That the caster misses is down to the speed and agility of the target getting the hell out of the way. Once the spell has left the wand, its trajectory can't be changed, so it would take the target dodging the spell in the 0.2 seconds (or whatever) between the spell leaving the wand and reaching the target.

That's how I picture it, anyway.

A little bit more if you're going on intent, because then you're actually dodging the caster's reaction time, not just the spell time! It could be up to maybe 1-2 seconds between the caster noticing you dodged, mentally calculating where you're going next, and refocusing his intent on the new location, and by then they may have already cast the spell.

******** XD But they would be practicing, all the time. I'm not saying, by the way, that there couldn't be extra accuracy training for people who require it, like aurors. In fact, in my own fic I bring up aim a little. But hitting a person with a spell within a few meters? After even a year of constantly having and aiming a wand? It's not like a bullet where it has to hit a bullseye on a target. You aim for someone's center mass with a spell, boom. I would compare it to throwing. And little kids can throw well enough after a very short time to hit an adult's center mass. Dodging it? A little different obviously.

(It also would explain canon where Harry is so naturally good at dueling btw. His athleticism gives him a huge leg up in the sort of accuracy required)

** Well there are attack spells that probably need some sort of accuracy. When DA is started, Harry has the members practice against each other and Snape does the same as well in HBP. It is quite clear that not even students older than Harry are as good as him with dueling spells. Hell, considering that Death Eaters, who are supposed to be experienced wizards and witches have sometime trouble hitting the protagonists... you could assume that even adult magical folk have trouble with that. And the fact that (according to the Weasley twins) Ministry officials struggle with shield charms it may suggest that most witches and wizards are not particularly competent except for maybe a certain type of spell.

However, most spells don't need accuracy. The Patronus shoots out of the tip of your wand and after that it just walks (floats) around doing its thing. You just need to point your wand in the general direction of the object you are trying to repair. Same goes for vanishing. You only need to focus on the thing you are summoning. Same goes for conjuring. Most charms involve tapping with your wand the object you try to enchant.

So conclusion is that HP magic is most magic can be done without pointing your wind accurately at a moving target. It's only martial magic that requires that, and even though being one of the main forms of magic used in the book, from the simple fact that not even Hermione manages to get an O in her OWLs on DADA, martial magic is not only difficult but most wizards also suck at it.

*** That's different. It's just a spell missing because it missed not because Voldemort didnt do enough accuracy practice after transfiguration during his free period. Accuracy is a footnote rather than something significant. It would be like Dumbledore failing to cast a spell sometimes because... he failed. Spells miss, but accuracy isn't really a factor. It's more like every character has a 95% accuracy rate no matter who it is or their experience.

Catching a ball is easy. Young children are a bit clumsy at it, but teenagers - not a problem. Likewise hitting balls. Hitting them *accurately* is a different matter, not many can do that, but enough can that schools manage to have decent opening batsmen in their cricket teams.
