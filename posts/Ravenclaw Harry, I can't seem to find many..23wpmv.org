** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry_McGonagall][Harry McGonagall]] is one. Dumbledore doesn't come out of it looking so great but Minerva sure does, and Harry is in Ravenclaw. There's also a sequel. I think it's eventually H/Hr if that matters.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9750991/1/Angry-Harry-and-the-Seven][Angry Harry and the Seven]] is one:

#+begin_quote
  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

This one is really long, but completed and written pretty well IMO.

Another one that I liked, even though it is abandoned, is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power][Knowledge is Power]]:

#+begin_quote
  AU. Harry is two years older than canon and raised by Remus. Neville is BWL. Story of Harry's search for knowledge to cure his mother. Snarky characters, witty humor, Quidditch, deeply developed OCs. Harry/Fleur.

**** Yeah, I'm still upset i didn't realize that it was abandoned until I got to the last chapter. I read it last fall, and with how good I remember it being, if it had been finished it probably would have ended up being my favorite fic that I've read.

***** It was good enough that i was coming into the thread to post a rec to it. I was just surprised with how well the OC's were developed. Also I enjoy talented!Harry fic's where he actually works for it. best fic i've read in a while.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] has the fem!Harry protagonist in Ravenclaw. Not a lot of emphasis on the house though and it's pretty... let's say mature. Good though.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7863744/39/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elemental-Changes][HP and the Elemental Changes]] is a Ravenclaw Harry, but also a Wrong Twin who lived, with James and Lily still alive. I can't remember if it was much of a bashing fic, but I liked it nonetheless.
