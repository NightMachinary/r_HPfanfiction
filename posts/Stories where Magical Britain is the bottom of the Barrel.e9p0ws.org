Stories where Magical Britain is depicted as a cesspool of incompetence and stagnation, where other magical nations advanced to match their mundane counterpart.

This includes

- Hogwarts actually being one of the worst schools of magic in the world, thanks to its outdated curriculum, bad and bias teacher and the divisive house system.

-Voldemort and his band of wannabe magical nazi were just a domestic threat, not an international one if they made noise in another country they would have been taken care of permanently.

-Dumbledore still somewhat regarded highly by some on the international stage, but most see him as a bothersome old man constantly relaying old deeds and past glory for relevance, constantly sticking his crooked nose in other people's business, ridiculed in some circles for his "eccentric" views and beliefs especially his Graeter good


** You used the wrong flair. Recommendation is for fics that you are recommending. I think you're looking for Request.

*** Ok, so

1. I have no idea what's going on

2. I have no idea who anyone is

3. I have no idea what this is a crossover with

4. This version of Harry is an unlikeable prick with an anger management problem

5. This version of Albus has his competence slaved to the plot's needs instead of basic literary consistency

I'll pass

  AU! This is not your average HP fic. It may start out like the others, but it's not. This story involves death, lies, deceit, Voldemort, Death Eaters, the Order of the Pheonix and their weird way of recruiting agents. I hope you enjoy it! RR

  After his second year, Harry begins to realize Hogwarts isn't everything it could be. Are there other options available? While the Hogwarts characters belong to JK Rowling, the story is obviously outside of canon.

** Canon?

- Look at potions and history of magic. Add in pureblood agenda, and everything is dumbed down for their kids to achieve "better" grades or to keep the non-purebloods down. Effectively dragging down everybody.
- They were a domestic threat. IF they did any outside excursions, they were few and far between. They have the potential to go international, but Britain has to fall first.
- If they didn't view him that way, how has Britain not received any outside help to stamp down the Voldemort issue before he spreads like a plague after Britain falls?

Poison Pen. #1 is a big point there. #2 I'm not so sure about. #3 is 50/50, I'm not sure if all the fictions are mixing together in my head.
