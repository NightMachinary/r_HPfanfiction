Alright, who was the bozo to dream up this gem?

I swear, it feels like every other brother!WBWL fic I stumble on has this stupid fucking name for Harry's brother.

How the hell do you go from 'Harry' (a most common, normal name) to Skylar?!

Why not call him Bob. Or John. Or David. Or ANYTHING else?!

Am I the only one that is low-key triggered by this obnoxious name?

*** This was my thought too. I've seen a lot of very American names across all types of HP fic and it does instantly pull me out of a fic - Brett, Brad, Peyton, Jake, Harper, etc all are immediately recognisable as American and used as OC names off the top of my head.

It doesn't take much to google the top names of kids born in 1980 in the U.K. to get an idea of kids' names here, and usually it's a flag to me that there will be other Americanisms in the fic, which means I personally won't enjoy it.

**** Depends on what era you're writing. If it's a next-gen fic, Harper, Jake, and Peyton have gained in popularity in the UK in recent years. Also a lot of authors /are/ from that generation, so they use the names they know/like.

But yeah, it's really easy to just Google it all. I have a list of "random OC names" that are appropriate for each era.

JKR has a "Tracy Davis" on her OG 40 student masterlist, and most of the time fanfic authors write her as a halfblood. Something just doesn't feel right when a story has a pureblood witch whose name is "Kourtney". The pureblood characters in canon had old fashioned names like "Theodore", "Vincent", and "Gregory", if they weren't given quirky wizarding names like "Draco" or "Hestia".

** I haven't really seen any wbwl fic with that name. But god, I've seen an entire horrorshow of OC's with that name, and not just in the Harry Potter fics. If the fic has the name Skylar in it SOMEWHERE I'm automatically leaving it as it is.

It's really odd. Every author who uses the name Skylar writes really in the same bad style, and has the same kind of stories. They're exclusive territory for the Skylars of the world.

Are there actually any people in the USA who named their child Skylar? Seems like such a weird name that teenagers make up for themselves because they think it sounds cooler than their real name.

** Personally, I like to name my OC with meaningful names, as a few of the cannon characters, IMHO, have meaningful names.

For exemple, Harry means protector/gardian of the home/demesne while Harriet means Rules the home.

According to the first website I found when looking for Skylar's meaning:

#+begin_quote
  The name Skylar is an English variation of the Dutch surname Schuyler. The origin of this name is Dutch ans is mainly used is US as a boy name, though it is not used in the Netherlands as a first name for boys

  English meaning: Eternal life and strength

  Dutch meaning: A shelter

  American meaning: The Sky; Guarded; scholar, learned one
#+end_quote

In short, it could have been a great name for whatever child Voldemort would have managed to spawn/adopt IMHO.
