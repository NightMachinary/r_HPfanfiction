All I can remember about this fic is that Lucius was teaching a class about Lordships at Hogwarts and had the class sit in hierarchy order. The usual suspects were in it - Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini, Susan Bones etc, but Hermione decided to attend the class and was upset to realise she was at the bottom of the hierarchy. Harry was at the top I think?

Any ideas? Thanks!
