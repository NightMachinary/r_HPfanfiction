Trying to find two stories I previously read, but can't remember the titles, just a few details that stick out in my mind.

1) Narcissa Malfoy starts dating Remus Lupin and discovers that his self-hatred is because of a mandatory ministry counseling program. I think it's part of an independent Harry storyline.

2) Harry is shunned by the whole school after his name comes out of the goblet of Fire, and as a result he doesn't have a date to the Yule ball.


** 1) Is "Larceny, Lechery and Luna Lovegood", Chapter 32 and 33 to be exact.
