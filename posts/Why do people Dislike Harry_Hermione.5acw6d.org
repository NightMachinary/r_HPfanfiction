I've seen alot of people talking about how they don't like Harry/Hermione but they never really explain why. What are the main reasons people dislike the ship?


** I like the idea of Harry/Hermione but happen to hate basically every Harry/Hermione fic that has been written. It's a classic example of the fandom trapping people in certain bad tropes that just get repeated ad infinitum by bad authors unable to think of their own original plotlines. You'd think that a pairing involving two of the main characters would be one of the areas of fanfic most fully explored in the fandom, but there's actually a stunning lack of variety within the realm of Harry/Hermione fics. Common complaints include:

- Bossy/mothering/hand-on-hip "Harry James Potter!" sassy Hermione who completely dominates Harry, forcing a complete change in character, attitudes, and activities.

- Trophy Hermione who is stripped of all personality and ambition and instead takes on Harry's beliefs, ambitions and goals as her own.

- Authorial mouthpiece polemical storytelling which seeks to justify the pairing to the reader via argument and canon evidence. This will commonly happen with Harry and Hermione having a conversation in which they go through all the "evidence" and arguments used by Harmonians for why Harry/Hermione should be the OTP, concluding with a realisation that they should be boyfriend and girlfriend. An alternative is either one of them going through the same material in a mental monologue. It's not unusual for the characters to then repeat all this "evidence" to other characters. Multiple times.

- It's normally not enough for the Harmonian author to promote Harry/Hermione, they also feel the need to denigrate other characters and pairings to make Harry/Hermione look better in comparison. This is a form of bashing and comes with all the accompanying problems. Ginny and Ron being the prime targets.

- I've never seen a Harry/Hermione fic where the pairing is treated as a regular, realistic romance. They never have anything other than trivial problems and certainly never any fundamental incompatibilities that would have to be worked through like in a real relationship. There's basically never any conflict, which is required by all stories, even romances. Instead the author treats the pairing as an item of holy faith and builds their story around making it appear more awesome and "meant to be". This is the difference between a pairing and a ship: a pairing is a romance that just so happens to involve two characters, a ship is a form of fanaticism. Fics written by fanatics frothing at the mouth over their pet issue are never fun, because they're too busy making their point to tell a good story.

- On top of all of that, a surprising number of Hermione fans are spectacularly bad at capturing her canon character. It's very rare to find a Hermione who is anything like her canon self, and even rarer when the author is a fan of Hermione as they tend to completely lose their minds over her and make her the next Dumbledore with the body of Fleur Delacour.

- Oh, and it's also a genre that all too often includes blushing eunuch naive sex god Harry who convinces girls to sleep with him by being afraid to touch them and crying every time he accidentally expresses a sexual thought in their presence. The woman in question is so impressed by his asexuality (which they call "being a gentleman") that they immediately offer themselves up to him, at which point Harry manages to overcome his previous naivety in 5 minutes flat and suddenly becomes amazing at sex. Neckbeard "nice guy" fantasy 101.

- And of course, you can't forget that many Hermione-focused stories tend to also include a fair amount of Muggle wank.

*** Pretty much this. The relationship usually goes one of two ways. Harry is horribly henpecked and nagged almost constantly, or it is a bland relationship with no chemistry between the characters.

I also think people are confusing the character Hermione with the movie actress. She's always described as stunningly beautiful in these fanfics, but (by my interpretation) she was at best described as 'pretty' in the books, and that was after conning the nurse to fix her teeth and using a LOT of styling products. How often do you see her as written as kinda nice looking, but not extraordinary?

Then her cleverness is cranked up to genius levels of intelligence. Basically her fans like to project all of their ambitions onto her. To be the smartest and prettiest and all around bestest at everything. Then they throw in "But she's bad at riding a broom! hahaha!" as if that suddenly makes their Mary Sue portrayal balanced.

Why are so many H/Hr fans afraid to portray her as flawed? Flawed characters are awesome!

I actually think this is kinda the other way around. That is to say, Emma Watson didn't make Hermione attractive, but rather Hermione made Emma Watson attractive. Think about it: Emma Watson, though she is of course quite pretty, is by Hollywood standards not exactly "top shelf". And yet she has far more fans than most Hollywood actresses. It seems clear to me that her role as Hermione is the reason why. If not for the association with Hermione, she would not be making people's "top 5 hottest celebs" lists.

Nah mange, the Wizarding World has Draco Malfoy and shit so it's worse, dawg.

Of course, the reverse also exists in the pureblood wank, in which we get the whole "they're not so bad, really, just trying to preserve their culture you see", basically the HP version of "I'm not /racist/, I'm just pro-insert ethnicity here". Usually this takes the form of Slytherin!Harry or Dramione fics.

** I don't like it because: (1) I love the idea of the trio being this really awesome friendship. Harry/Hermione fics tend to have Ron bashing while Ron/Hermione fics tend to keep a strong trio relationship. (2) Harry/Hermione as a couple is too OP and I feel like there's often an emphasis on their abilities instead of their personalities. I like Ron with Hermione since it puts forth the idea that your worth isn't based on intelligence/power. (3) Harry/Hermione are too close and have already been through everything together so there's not as much relationship building in terms of learning about each others' experiences and getting to know each other in fics.

I don't ship Ron/Hermione that much but I prefer canon over Harry/Hermione. Still, as long as the trio friendship is strong in a fic, I can deal with Harry/Hermione.

** I just much preferred them being platonic sibling-y best friends. Really close opposite-sex and completely platonic friendships among heterosexual characters in books are just rare; authors usually spin it into a romance instead. For me, it was a breath of fresh air, and I love the idea of it.

That being said, I haven't really thought about whether they would work well together. And, honestly, the Harry and Hermione in my head have had their personalities altered way too often by fanfiction, I'm struggling to maintain a grasp on their canon personalities, so I can't really judge for myself. Can't really judge from fanfic, either, because, as Taure so wonderfully put, Harmony in fanfic is often explored in very limited and, frankly, ways so unromantic it just somehow makes their relationship seem more wooden to me.

So it's not like I strictly stick to R/H, but there's just something about Harry and Hermione as a couple that makes me literally go /ew, no./

** I personally dislike it because its /yet another pairing/ that eats away at the idea people of different genders can be friends without a sexual or romantic element.

As an LGBT person I've always found it bizarre /just how much/ media pushes the idea that this is difficult or impossible unless people are related.

(Speaking of which, fics that feel the need to point out that Hermione is /like a sister/ to Harry as justification for why he doesn't want her. I think canon does that too. As if the only way men and women come across each other is as relatives or romantic partners, as if /no men and women/ work together or go to school together anywhere in the world... -_- )

This is compounded by the fact a /lot/ of H/Hr fics don't expand their relationship beyond 'he was a boy, she was a girl', and/or make 'Hermione' into a weak, swooning, damsel in distress stereotype as soon as the pairing is set up or in progress. Hermione Granger has /never/ been that kind of character for any boy and throughout canon she was largely the muscle of the group as well as the brains. She carried that group all through DH.

** Because several times, Harry has thought of Hermione at best "like a sister" and at worst "annoying/not fun". Sure he loves her but the fact that he explicitly said that he thought of her like part of his family kept me from ever getting into the pairing. Honestly I was shocked when I first started getting into the fandom and realized people shipped Harry and Hermione together.

Harry can get any girl he wants in fanfiction, if you read the right one. But Hermione is his closest female friend and I prefer to read stories where she stays that way.

** In all honesty, I'd prefer Harry with no ship at all, would prefer if he lead a like like Dumbledore on 'relationship' perspective. (Edit: By all means, I meant psychological perspective, not romantic or gay or straight. I don't care about a person's sexuality.)

I can't imagine a person who has gone through the experiences Harry did, would hook on with someone & become a family man.

I don't like either H/Hr or H/G ship. Because both are too obvious. As soon as I read CoS, I knew Ginny was going to pair with Harry. And honestly I wanted too. Perhaps one of the effects of being teenage. As you ask about H/Hr, I'll limit my answer to this pairing.

On fanon perspective, most Harmony shipper writers tends to write Hermione 'Emma Watson' Granger which is very good reason not to like this pairing.

On canon characteristics, both are a bit too independent person for building a mutual understanding & I'm telling you from real life experiences. Ron provides better buffering for R/Hr pairing than Harry would ever do.

On magical society's perspective, I think it's better to pairing Harry with someone who grew up in magical society. Harry himself knows very little about magical society. So is Hermione. Both are ignorant of many wizard cultures and customs. I think to have a global acceptance in magical society, it's better Harry to have someone with magical society's understanding, someone who grew up in magical society. Harry is like unofficially king of wizarding world after Voldemort's defeat whether he wanted it or not. Pairing Harry with Hermione is a bit like having a king who himself know little about the kingdom, with a foreigner queen.

And again, taking about fanon Hermione. Stories which likes to tell wizarding world is backdated without trying to understand it from wizard's perspective tends to pair Harry with Hermione. Because Hermione is only 'modern' person. Infact, I think it's quite opposite. From wizarding perspective. Hermione is infact a backdated/foreigner to wizarding world.

So yeah I would not prefer pairing Harry with Hermione. And especially when someone paints wizarding word as backdated & non-magical as advanced.

**** Was Dumbledore gay? I think not. He was friends with Grindelwald. But in all honesty, there's no hint in canon that he was gay.

By Dumbledore-like relationship, I meant not having a romantic relationship to deep enough to make it a marriage. Both Dumbledore & Harry went through similar experiences & it's very difficult to understand them who hasn't gone through situations like this. It doesn't have to be a dark lord but at a personal level, an experience as dark as it.

****** I'm not disagreeing with you 100%, but there was really no graceful way of bringing it up in the books because Dumbledore's personal life was never really explored. Rita Skeeter hinted at it in a rather disgusting manner in book 7, but that was really the only time Dumbledore's romantic interests were even brought up. The books are written from Harry's POV, and so unless someone mentioned it to Harry, there's no reason we should have known either.

So I don't know, I always felt it was pretty realistic that it never came up in the books.

** It's more the shippers, rather than the ship itself.

Now, obviously not all H/Hr shippers are "delusional militantists". But why is H/Hr the most vocal ship? Why not something like Ginny/Luna or Hermione/Neville? The answer is simple. Because the books built up all this interaction between the trio. Regardless of whether it's platonic or not, more presence between the two characters is always "positive" to your ship. It means more opportunity to look for the tiniest cracks in the canon.

It thus poses a "threat" to the major canon couples, and it has the merit of being somewhat more realistic than others, which is why some people will... advocate more strongly for it. The natural evolution of this vocalness is proclaiming that it's better than the canon ships, that the fanon should have happened. So you have to get Ginny and Ron out of the way. And how is that usually done? By bashing. Which inevitably creates a backlash.

** When I was new to fandom, I felt like you were supposed to only ship things that you thought would be canon, and though I don't remember my exact reasoning, I was always convinced Ron and Hermione would end up together.

Now that I'm older I actually prefer non-canon ships, but still greatly dislike most main male character/best friend who's a girl pairings, even if they aren't canon. They're just so boring and overused to me.

Also I'm not a big fan of high school sweethearts that last forever. So I don't really like Hermione/Ron or Harry/Ginny much anymore either.

Same reason I dislike Harry/snape, snape loved his mother and very few snarry fics address that, and Harry/Draco, they hate each other with a passion, if you make them not ever rivals then sure but if things are canon up to 5th or 6th year then no.

** I dislike it as I dislike almost every single portrayal of Hermione. That being said I also find her profoundly irritating in cannon. Some people forget that she was so annoying that she was bullied she was so patronising that Neville who struggled in class never once asked her for help as far as I can remember. In H/hr she also stop being a beaverish bookworm from day one. Never forget the hours spent before the Yule ball making her merely pretty. How many potions and charms we don't know. Emma Watson was far too attractive to play Hermione and combined with Hollywood-esque fascination with pairing leading man and leading lady you get people feeling they were robbed by Ginny who appears seemingly out of the blue to steal their Harry.

Also take a moment to think who relates to Hermione, female nerds, people who rightly think there are more to attractiveness than looks so they don't understand why they don't get the hero at the end. Ron is often bashed in fan fiction and the more you read the more off your opinion comes meaning Hermione is "better" than him and she is "settling". Compare the number of Hermione fans with Ron fans, people think she deserves better. Honestly I wish she'd been made a martyr at the end of book 7, then no epilogue would have made things more interesting.

And I think you might be painting with a pretty broad brush on the concept of female nerds choosing to admire brains over attractiveness, and that choice explaining the admiration of Hermione as a character. I don't feel the need to submit head shots and transcripts, but there are some of us who never found the two mutually exclusive. /flicks hair/

** So for a different perspective I happen to like the harry/hermione ship. I agree there are several ideas that repeat themselves in many of the stories but I do take issue with some of the complaints here. First is making Hermione too pretty i.e. Emma Watson isn't the real Hermione, I think Emma Watson does represent Hermione as she ages while not a super model she is very attractive. Second, like a sister I always felt that was Harry telling Ron what he needed to hear to not run off again in book 7. Also Ginny looks a lot like Lilly and that creeps me the fuck out. Third, the Weasley's yes bashing them is over done but so is having them be perfect Ron is a jerk and doesn't seem to ever grow up, Ginny and Harry, as well as ron/Hermione happen too fast to seem natural and we know Molly used a love potion before. Fourth, Hermione is a prodigy and is at the top of the class by miles she gets spells first always gets the potions right (until Harry uses another prodigy's work). If Harry has all the power (3rd year...) then Hermione has all the brains remember who trains him to beat the tasks year 4. Finally, Ron for all his supposed crush on Hermione and knowing what a living relationship looks like is always cruel to her.

***** 1) Movies don't count. The books are canon. And within them we only hear that Lily and Ginny may or may not, depending on the interpretation of a few adjectives, share a hair color. One might even argue that "brilliant witch & muggleborn" makes Lily closer to Hermione than Ginny.

2) In Snape's class, when he calls Hermione a know-it-all, Ron speaks out in her favor.

When Draco calls Hermione a mudblood, Ron jumps to her defense.

Ron repeatedly compliments Hermione on her skill (especially in OotP) and openly acknowledges that she is the better magic user, by far.

The countless times Ron jumps in front of his friends to defend them. I mean... come on.

Despite of being absolutely, bloody terrified, Ron saves Fang before himself in the Forbidden Forest when the Acrumantulas chased them.

And of course, the famous scene when Rons seems to be the only one who thought about the Hogwarts houseelves.

And those are just the ones I know from the top of my head.

*** I don't recall Hermione being called a prodigy in canon. She was called clever several times, and it was mentioned that she was top of the class in several courses, but that does not make someone a genius. That's a HUGE leap you're making there, and you are misusing the term prodigy. Someone who speaks five languages fluently at 10 = possible prodigy. Someone who gets great grades because they study hard = not prodigy. Snape /might/ be a potions prodigy, but honestly we never got told whether his ability was natural born or if he just worked really hard at it until he was exceptionally good. Being a prodigy means you have an exceptional capacity towards something. Hermione was always just a bit ahead of her classmates because of study habits.

And there is not a single sentence in the books that describe Hermione as anything other than "pretty" and again, that was after she tried really, really hard to look nice. Saying that she is average looking is not being unkind to the character. It's actually a great part of her character, I think.

Also, as far as your claim that Harry has the power and Hermione has the brains, you seem to be getting that from fanfiction and maybe the movies in part. Harry was never stupid to begin with. The Sorting Hat specifically said that he has a good mind (implying that he may do well in Ravenclaw). What Harry happens to be is a combination of lazy and overburdened. Had he studied as much as Hermione, he very well may have gotten grades as good as hers. His grades may have also improved without the distraction of murderous madmen trying to kill him every year. Ron and Hermione helped, but he took on the majority of that burden.

Molly in a throwaway line mentions that she once brewed a love potion, she does not mention using it or if it worked. I hate Molly, and even I think this is a stupid and unfair assumption to make about her.

It's fine to like the ship. I really don't care if other people like the ship. This was just a discussion of WHY people might dislike the ship. Most of your arguments seem to be based on fanon, not canon, and fanon is too inconsistent to depend on for charactarization.

**** I didn't look at fanon I just considered the movies as visual canon that supplement the books especially for how characters look ignoring minor issues like Dan Radcliff not having green eyes. I agree Harry isn't stupid but I think Ron who it is clear doesn't like studying helps hold him back because part of Ron character is his jelaousy. I agree Hermione isn't called a prodigy in Canon but how would you describe someone who is ahead of all of her classmates despite many of them having years of living in the magical world. Then there is the fact that she always gets the new spell or concept first in class and she certainly seems to be a prodigy and is labled the brightest witch of the age.
