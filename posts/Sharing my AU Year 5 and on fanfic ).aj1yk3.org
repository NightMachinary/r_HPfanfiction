Hi everyone, I'd like to share my story with you all. Hopefully this is allowed?

I spent about 5 months working on this over the summer, and I'd love to know what you guys think, if you wanted to give it a go.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13125917/1/Trading-Places][Trading Places]]

When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard as he learns to separate the magical fantasy world he's always known from its dark reality. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, Dan's happy days at Hogwarts are certainly numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. But what can Dan do, in Harry's place? And how high will the cost be... to switch them back?

This is the first time I've worked on something long like this. Before this, I mainly only wrote one-shots. The story is fully written, and about 2/3 of it is posted to FFN so far. I'm uploading 2 chapters a week.

Thanks for considering it!
