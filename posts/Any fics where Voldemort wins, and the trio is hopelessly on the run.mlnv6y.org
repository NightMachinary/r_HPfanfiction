I'm looking for something where they don't see a way to win, they're just trying to stay alive. Preferably with no resistance or order to support them, just their wits against the stronger and stronger death eater government.

I don't mind smut, slash or character bashing if that makes a difference. The longer the better!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] is very similar, although it's Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville against them all.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/Betrayal][Betrayal]], it's actually Harry alone, until he freed Daphne Greengrass. On the other hand, he's not necessarily losing.

The lead up to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][Harry Potter and the Witch Queen]] is like that too. But in addition, Hermione had gained huge amount of power and became just as destructive as Voldemort. Their fights reduced most of Europe, including the Muggle part, to ashes.

4 years after the Battle of Hogwarts, a Hermione from another dimension is asking for help in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]]. The Trio and Ginny, now very powerful, enter the breach one more time.
