I just finished The Arithmancer, Marauder's Plan, and The Cupboard Series. Anyone have any complete fic recommandations that are similar? I really like how these have more of the wizarding world than just Hogwarts and more adults involved. I do prefer fics where Sirius lives and I really don't care if there is or isn't bashing or specific ships. I'm kinda dreading spending the night looking for something and coming up empty. Thanks!


** linkffn(A Second Chance by Breanie)

Sirius lives and gets a trial after four years, gets freed and he and Remus raise Harry. 2.1 M words and Harry is in sixth year now. Slow burn hinny and still updating :)

  What if Sirius didn't spend twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.

***** What I particularly like about the Innocent series is how it doesn't try to make Harry or Sirius overpowered or anything, it's just about them as people. What would you say is the highlight of A Second Chance?

****** Tbh just the whole family dynamic they've got going is great. Even Dumbledore and Minerva are somewhat grandparental figures to Harry which is nice. Also the romance is very well done

******* That sounds comparable, except that Innocent doesn't (yet?) have romance.

Edit: Also, that's a /lot/ of sex-related content warnings.

Edit2: Ohhh, right, that's the story where I asked on Discord whether the story still makes sense if you skip the smut scenes, and half a dozen people got highly offended by the suggestion.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) expands the world quite a bit. The spinoff Revolutionary Arc, starting with linkao3(Breaking the Lines), goes international.
