** linkffn(Shadow of Angmar) is often recommended --- it's a "Harry moving into Middle-Earth"-type story. There's also, I'm told, a bunch of vaguely-terrible stories where Harry is adopted by Elves and ends up shipped with Legolas, or something.

What I have never been able to find is the reverse, a good story where someone /from/ the Legendarium ends up in the HP universe. I mean, I have a vague recollection of a story where the One Ring ended up in Hogwarts, but I couldn't even tell you if it exists or if it was discussed as a tentative plot-bunny somewhere on this sub.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Harry Potter, now affectionately named Mad Baggins the Second, has no idea that there is, in fact, a lot of history he could accidentally muck up in Middle Earth.Not that this stops him from doing so.Or; how Frodo has a different start, meets his new BFFs in the form of a sadistic snake and a ranger, falls in love and makes a mess of it all in general.120k+Enjoy.(P.S. How the hell is Frodo/Anyone-But-Sam not a thing in the fandom??)

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter helped with the rebuilding and then went back to school, sitting his NEWTS and graduating with the rest of what The Daily Prophet called ‘The Disrupted Class.' Following that, everyone expected him to become an auror. Harry himself expected it, right up until the moment came to apply to the academy.He takes up a hobby instead, and it leads him to a whole new world.

  Eternal Wanderer, Lonely Traveler, Chained Sage, and Master of Death. He was known by these and many more names in several worlds, though he found no solace in any name or world. Hallowed in blood, forged in war and baptised in loss, Harry Potter has run far away from the world that birthed him. He traces a path through infinity, intent on reclaiming that which was lost.
