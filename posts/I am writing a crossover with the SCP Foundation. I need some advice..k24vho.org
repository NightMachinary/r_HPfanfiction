So, I have posted here about this, but I really need advice, since I have no idea where to start.

The SCP Foundation is the name of a fictional organization in charge of containing, capturing, or(If absolutely necessary) eliminating hostile anomalous objects.

The SCP wiki has some pretty creepy entries, and you all should totally check them out. Just google 'SCP Foundation', the site is the first result.

Anyway, I like it so much I was thinking of writing a crossover for it.

My idea is this:

Within the SCP universe, there is a document held in Foundation custody, which is essentially what the Foundation uses to evaluate whether or not an object is anomalous. At the approval of the O5 Council(The highest authority in the Foundation: Think the Cabinet in the US, or the European Council in the EU), the document can be modified.. In the fic, upon discovering that Scranton Reality Anchors(Which are devices that temporarily remove anomalous properties from objects) do not affect magical objects, the Foundation decides to add a form of magic to the document. They list it as 'Dark Energy Channeling'. The Wizards of HP in this story do not actually have supernatural abilities. Rather, they merely think they do, because some humans and creatures evolved to channel dark energy. I know, I know, kind of cliche. But we really don't know what Dark Energy is, so it causing humans to evolve in strange ways is kind of interesting. And magic operates on laws and principles, whereas SCPs do not('The force of gravity is now salmon! Your mother is now comprised of eyeballs-And she is still alive!' and all that).

They soon realize, however, that policing this new world will not be easy. An anomalous object can hide easily within the Wizarding World, and all attempts at negotiation with the International Confederation and the various Ministries break down. Despite the Administrator's pleas, as well as presenting their record of saving both humanity and all reality, they still refuse to offer support to ' those mad muggles'.

So, in a classic example of the Foundation's extreme pragmatism, the Regional Administrator for Great Britain proposes a radical, if slightly unethical solution to the O5 Council and the Ethics Committee(The Ethics committee is in charge of making sure the Foundation doesn't stray too far off the straight and narrow. Not that they don't approve some ethically questionable things, but only when they are necessary for the survival of humanity). The proposal is to kidnap the best witches and wizards from all around the world, and train them to police the Wizarding World.

While at first rejected by the EC, the proposal is approved after the Regional Administrator convinces them that the ethical cost of the project is far less than the ethical cost of letting anomalous objects run rampant over a billion humans and 'magical' creatures.

The project is given the name 'Operation Merlin', after the famous wizard of ancient lore.The Foundation manages to steal many records from the Wizarding World, along with several newspaper clippings. They read about the Order of the Phoenix and the group known as the Death Eaters. The Regional Administrator, seeing that these two groups are some of the best wizards in Great Britain, makes capturing and training these individuals the top priority.

They succeed, and the two groups(Except those that can't fight, like Molly and Arthur) are brought to the Greater London Containment Site, and undergo a brutal training.

What I need advice on is this: How should I write their training? What steps can the Foundation take to ensure that these two groups either A. Can work together, or B. At least can work for the Foundation? The Foundation in most canons is pretty powerful. But even it needs people that can do the job it needs.

I also want to go into their trauma, along with them having adventures in capturing and containing the dark powers that inhabit the universe.

Any advice?


** I was recently thinking about writing some sort of SCP/fantasy crossover, actually. It's good to see that others are working on the same idea.

I think the Foundation would be very generous with their captives. In fact, part of me thinks that they wouldn't kidnap members at all, only willing participants (they have to deal with enough unruly and unwilling sentient anomalies as they do - it's not as if they have a lack of wizards to pick and choose from). If they're going to turn them into brainwashed soldiers, then they might negotiate to take out a few maximum-security prisoners from Azkaban and the like.

Despite the 'whatever it takes', the Foundation is quite willing to accommodate cooperative anomalies, after all. First one that came to mind was their treatment of [[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-085][SCP-085]]. Yes, training will be harsh and uncomfortable, but they'd try to shower the participants with amenities to make up for it, to keep them friendly to the Foundation.

I wonder what they'd do with other magical races. Centaurs, with their skill in divination, could be useful in some sort of think tank. Goblins are unnaturally good smiths. Fawkes and other phoenixes can basically cry [[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-500][SCP-500]] on command.

** Oh yes! I bookmarked that and meant to look at it but it's so cool!

I...don't think I have anything to add tbh, as my brain doesn't really work well with this kind of subject, but I think it's rad and will definitely read it!

*** Well, the story is quite weird.

Imagine for instance Bellatrix leading a group of SWAT-like soldiers(MTFs), in taking down a giant Garfield creature that force-feeds people lasagna.

SCP-3166, is worth checking out. Its unnerving, and a bit weird, but it involves a Garfield-looking monster that stalks people involved with bringing down the popularity of the comic strip. It manifests around people who are either critics of the franchise, or are responsible for it lessening in popularity.

***** Its growing in popularity? I thought it was pretty much static, actually.

Well, good. The SCP Foundation is a great franchise.

BTW, its under a Creative Commons license. That means no one person has a hold on the copyright, and anyone can contribute.

You could go on there and write one right now.

** This is something I've been looking forward to for ages.

- Very reluctant training from both sides, except for a select few who are very much into it. (Like how 507 wishes to join the foundation as a researcher. Think Arthur)

- Th trained wizard's are placed into different categories of MTF, with each having their own specialties (death eaters: combat, Tranmuters: infiltration, etc)

- Plot twist: they have Lockheart, he's in the amnestics division.

- As a part of a thing to help them get to working together, stage a containment breach of a few less dangerous anomalies. Think like SCP-5033, SCP-1027, anythind Euclid that wouldn't really pose to serious of a threat to a trained mtf squad, but to these uncooperative wizards, it's a life or death senario.

- Potential meta commentary via SCP-3059

- Exposure of animagus (Mcgonagal) to SCP-3270

*** 1. Arthur isn't one of the Wizards kidnapped, along with Molly. But I get what you mean. Maybe Hermione would be in that category.
2. Yeah, that was my original idea. But wizards other than the DE's know combat spells too.
3. No. The story takes place in 96, so Lockheart would be completely unable to function in the Foundation.
4. That's a good idea. Who would win: An exploding sheep and a living nervous system or: A bunch of newly-minted Magical Mobile Task Forces? 5: I don't think so, since in this universe, the books are real.
5. That would just change her into a cat permanently, like everyone else.
