** Yes, there are thousands of them, and my favorite one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167). It's DH, but not Epilogue compliant.

--------------

If you insist on full canon compliance, then I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian's]] massive postwar series, consisting of 80+ fics of various length. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5486257/1/Grave-Days][Grave Days]], linkffn(5486257), is the one that shows what happened immediately after the Battle.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  The Battle of Hogwarts is over. The following day Harry wakes to a changed world, to a future he did not think he would have. This is a story about those first days after the battle. Days of mourning and funerals. Grave Days.

**** Ah, so specifically canon-continuation? You care about epilogue-adherence?

****** Hmmm... try some of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterContinuation][these]]?

Edit: re-reading my comments it seems a little cop-out-ish to ask qualification questions, only to give a link to a much more varied recommendation collection. That wasn't my intention, I just don't have a lot of experience with continuation fics, but I presumed the qualification questions would help others who do.
