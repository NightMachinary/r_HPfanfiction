** Man I never even considered this possibility, usually you see Sirius' daughter fics or somthing like that. What would she be like? like I think she would be sorta outgoing like how Sirius' daughter tends to be portrayed 'cause Remus is all depresed and she would need to help him not be a downer all the time.

Might not be exactly what you wanted. Oc is Sirius' daughter but after her mom is killed and Sirius is locked up she is protected and claimed to be Remus' child with a Muggle born who sent her to him for protection that he raises in a fake relationship with Regulus Black. The girl uses an old spell to break Sirius out of Azkaban and disguises him as Remus' cousin and the three raise oc, Neville and Harry as Remus' children with said pretend muggleborn mother. All working in the ministry and trying to make the world better until oc is 11 and their true identity and Sirius' assumed dead daughter is taken up again to attend Hogwarts and the Death Eaters begin to circle in a battle that oc knows will end in the same question that killed her mother. Will you join us or die?

Sirius is her dad by blood but the three guys and the Weasleys all raised her and the boys. It's 336,163 words and that's just the first book of the trilogy. Third book is still in progress.
