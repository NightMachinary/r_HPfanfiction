What does everyone think about magic in other countries and points in history?

For example IMM, a large portion of Native American mages were animagi,

And parseltongue originated in Ancient Greece and India,

Japanese mages have huge amounts of enchanted objects/weapons and most learn the same small set of wandless skills (not necessarily spells) after school,

And all the weird Australian animals are actually magical and their school of magic is a huge network of tunnels and caverns inside ‘Heirs Rock', where a group of purebloods went to study the new magical land, and learned from the natives that magic has everything to do with wether you have any magical ancestors, and halfbloods are not weaker.

Edits:

It has been suggested that people add their nationality to their post. This might be interesting, so feel free to do that.

If anyone is writing a fic involving other countries, Hogwarts should get a class that's something along the lines of: ‘Societies and Traditions of Other Magical Peoples' (STOMP) that teaches about other countries... you guessed it society and traditions (culture)

(Australia--- probably obvious)


** The terracotta warriors and surrounding necropolis were constructed so that they could be transported into a Hidden Realm of magic, enabling a sudden presence for the first Emperor and his host to establish a stronghold in the foothills of this fairy land. What was left behind were the shells of their muggle-side presence.

This is the land sometimes called Shangri La, Xanadu, Nirvana, Hy Breasil, Avalon... the city of clay is only one gateway to this promised land, an unearthly paradise only open to magical beasts and beings.

The Age of Sail and the growth of European imperialism forced the hand of the Asian wizards- many were uninterested in living lives of secrecy and chose to migrate to the Hidden Realm. A substantial drop in Asiatic magicians may have accelerated the success of the invaders, making the lesser portion who had stayed unable to resist the imposition of European Confederacy rule.

In modern times, those few new wizards who arise in the populations from the western edge of the Himalayas all the way to the Pacific coastline are offered the simple choice; stay with the muggles, living an inconsequential life with strict control over when and how magic may be used, or migrate to the Hidden Realm.

The only mainland Asian wizards still kicking around are descended from British, French, or Russian families.

Canonically, there is only one school in Africa. How do magical communities play out in, say, Africa or Asia where colonialism drew the maps without taking into account existing cultures and tribal borders?

Similarly, how did magical communities handle apartheid and Jim Crow laws? Okay, yes, MACUSA had a black woman in charge in Fantastic Beasts, but Kingsley Shacklebolt is also the Minister of Magic, and Great Britain doesn't exactly have a great history with racism either.

But almost every country should have at least one, with maybe a few exceptions. The cultural and language bariers in Europe are quite significant, and barring few exceptions there is no way people from different countries could go to one school and be fine with it.

Africa on the other hand, considering it's nature... i could see them having only one school - a rather old one, either in Mali or Egypt. Then, during colonial era, they'd most likely be neglected or maybe imported to mainland schools in some rare instances, while general populace would learn magic in a more traditional master-apprentice kind of way.

#+begin_quote
  Russian Ministry of Magic decided during the late 1400s
#+end_quote

There wasn't even a country named Russia in the late 1400s, it was Muscovy. The name was changed much later as a political move to claim being a successor of Kievan Rus. And the idea that there could be any kind of democracy to justify having a Ministry of Magic at that time is pretty laughable.

You write

#+begin_quote
  As the borders of the Russian Empire expanded, so did the range that Koldovstoretz enrols its students from. Over the years the institute came to accept youngsters from not only Russia but also from countries such as Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Armenia, just to name a few.
#+end_quote

and it's all very idillyc, but in muggle reality, the Russian Empire expanded through bloody wars and then proceeded to try their hardest to assimilate the shit out of the other cultures (and then the Soviet Union perfected those methods, stopping at nothing up and including genocide). The Russian Empire banned books and education in local languages, and it's easy to see how Russian wizards would bring this upstanding tradition to local magical communities, banning books of spells in native languages and closing down local schools of magic so the youth would have to go to Koldovstoretz to do magic the Russian way if they want a good, comprehensive education, because that's the only reason why they would go to /Siberia/ of all places.

Note that people went to Siberia first and foremost for /punishment/, for decades-long prison sentences. I just cannot imagine Ukrainian or Belarussian witches and wizards of the Russian Empire willingly sending their children to some far-away frozen hellhole where people have wildly different culture, lifestyle and traditions. And Armenia's and especially Kazakhstan wizarding cultures would be even more different.

And then you even rename USSR's magical counterpart as "Magical Union of Russia", because fuck those other cultures, amirite? Even the muggle Soviet Union kept up the pretence with the name. And after the "Revolution that fought for equality", no less.

I should probably stop there before this gets even longer. I'm by no means bashing you or your fic, because you cannot be expected to know all the regional intricacies, just putting some things into perspective. I also think Koldovstoretz is a really awesome name, and you have many interesting ideas.

TL;DR I just feel a bit like an Indian person reading about delights of the British empire, and how great it was that people from the colonies were given an opportunity to attend Hogwarts.

*********** I kind of ignore the canon implication that Durmstrang is the only school for Eastern+Central+Northern Europe, because it's just doesn't make sense in terms of population. Maybe the oldest/most prestigious, so only rich purebloods from old families get accepted there. Because Germany alone has bigger population than the UK (and British magical population we see was decimated by the recent war), so even if 1,000 kids attend Durmstrang at any given time, it still isn't even close to cover the demand.

In my headcanon, most countries have their own smaller schools, maybe magical departments in old universities. I once toyed with an idea of a historical Ukrainian AU where there was a magical department in the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, one of the oldest universities in the country, and also a school in the Carpathian Mountains.

Also, historically, a half of Ukraine was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and then Poland, so if magical families from that part wanted to send their kids to a foreign school, they would look at the schools there.

And I do think realistically there must be many schools across Europe alone, because how would you cover all the magical population otherwise? Britain and France have their own schools, and Hogwarts at least doesn't seem to have international students. Where does Portugal sends their children to? What about Spain? Italy?

Ernst won't be featured for a while so don't worry. Answers will come.

There are many characters in the story but it only has 3 POV. Durmstrang is enormous so it makes sense that the protagonists would encounter a lot of new people oftenly.

On a side note do you think that the sarcasm, meta humor and the character's familarity with the World takes away from the magic and mystery? Part of the appeal with the original series was that Harry was newly introduced to the wizarding World and so were we. Now it is a bit blasé to be honest when you know the universe back and fourth.

3 years ago I wrote another Durmstrang story that was essentially "Philosopher Stone in Sweden" and the main character was a muggle born who followed the exact same journey as Harry. So much time and pages Went to explaining everything you already knew that it didn't even get to Durmstrang before I stopped Writing.

This one get's to the Point quicker and takes more risks but I wonder whether it really was to its advantage or not?

*********************** Sarcasm is always appreciated in my book, and I don't think character's familarity with the world is a disadvantage. After all, we as a readers already know a lot about magic of this world simply by having read the canon, we don't necessarily need a clueless protagonist that discovers everything for the first time to follow along.

As for meta humous... It's a fine line. Something like your offhanded Twilight reference is fine because it's plausibe for the characters to know about it, but making JKR and HP books exist in-universe is a personal pet peeve of mine that throws me out of the story completely, sorry (although many people like it, judging by popularity of "characters finding/reading canon books/fanfiction" trope, so it's a matter of personal tast, I suppose).

I think getting to the point quicker and then explaining things as they come up is almost always a better approach. Actually, I found your first chapters a bit exposition-heavy, but as I said earlier, your writing really imroves in the later chapter where you mix explanations with character interactions much more organically.

I think most countries would be able to teach their 11 yos Potions and Charms themselves. Also imagine gathering 20K+ pre-teens/teens in one boarding school...

** I'm Australian as well! But I always thought that given the large amount of tourism Ayers Rock (I think it's better known as Uluru?) gets that it's unwise to place a magical community there. So it's just a place for rituals and for growing magical native plants and maybe even some school excursions.

My personal headcanon for the school placement is that it's in the Northern Territory since it's the least populated state and there's a lot of parks around to visit (filled with magical creatures). Thus, the Australian school places a lot of importance in magizoology. Speaking of magical creatures, we also have an abundance of marine animals that are magical. A lot of alumni work in magizoology sector such as in caring for magical creatures or potions (based on ingredients from creatures).

The school is underground but a lot of classes are held during the night (that involve spell casting and maybe astronomy) above the ground when it's cooler. This is probably my favourite part of the headcanon :)

Most of the Aboriginal community is aware of the magical community since magic isn't kept a secret amongst them and because many children attend the Australian magic school. So it's not unusual to see the wizarding community working alongside Muggles.

I thought of most of this while I typed it up so I'm wondering if anyone else has anything to add? This is fun.

Partly because Heir's Rock is just so perfect, but also cos' Uluru and the surrounding lands are believed by the Anangu Aboriginal people to have been created at the beginning of time. Also tourists only really began going there around 1950. I think Anangu people recently convinced the government to stop people from climbing all over what they believe is sacred ground too.

** My main headcanon is that wands are far superiour to every other known way to wield magic. Wands were what allowed the Conquistadores to defeat most of the New World's wizards despite being outnumbered. And their adaption of wands is what allowed the native american shamans of North America to keep their territory on the great plains, after Spain took California and European wizard malcontents took the East Coast, founding dozens of extremist wizarding enclaves. Even the Aborigines in Australia, xenophobic and isolationist, adapted wands - and managed to keep all other wizards out of their country by killing visitors where tehy found them. The agreement with the ICW that stipulates that muggleborns will be sent to New Zealand once discovered instead of killed, is deemed a great diplomatic achievement by the rest of the Wizarding World.

** I think it's more interesting to think of Magical Britain as an autocratic state and for all of the Pottermore canon about foreign schools to be propaganda or blatant lies.

Just look at /Mahoutokoro/. You know what that translates as? Magic place. /Magic place/. Sure, there are charmingly literal place names in the real world, but calling a magic school "Magic place" just smacks of laziness next to other names like Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, or Durmstrang.

So a fun, if unsupported, way to think about it is to move the horrible name choice from out-of-universe to in-universe. Mahoutokoro doesn't exist. Japanese wizards were wiped out by the atom bomb and radiation, which causes wizards to go 100% sterile and completely stops magical births. Mahoutokoro was "created" by Ministry propaganda using extant details of the original Japanese schools and enforced via memory charm, which wasn't hard given the utter stupidity of the wizarding public. Wizards who /are/ smart enough to figure it out are also smart enough to connect it to the boms. These days, any attempt to use magic in Japan summons Godzilla. The Japanese Quidditch team is a Pan-Asian team of part-Japanese wizards commemorating their lost shared heritage.

Sure, it's stereotypical. But it's probably still less offensive than dressing up Cho and the Patils in mangled cultural dress for the Yule Ball.

** I think there are three main considerations to bear in mind when answering this question.

*Firstly, magical and Muggle worlds tend to operate in parallel rather than completely diverging.*

#+begin_quote
  JKR: I'm going to tell you as much as I told someone earlier who asked me. You know Owen who won the [UK television] competition to interview me? He asked about Grindelwald [pronounced "Grindelvald" HMM...]. He said, “Is it coincidence that he died in 1945,” and I said no. It amuses me to make allusions to things that were happening in the Muggle world, so my feeling would be that while there's a global Muggle war going on, there's also a global wizarding war going on.

  ES: Does he have any connection to --

  JKR: I have no comment to make on that subject.

  [Laughter.]

  MA: Do they feed each other, the Muggle and wizarding wars?

  JKR: Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Mm.
#+end_quote

We see repeatedly in canon that magical and wizarding worlds parallel each other, without there being any factual causal relationship between the people/events involved.

For example, Grindelwald's rise coincided with the rise of Naziism, despite neither one having any relation to the other. Similarly, Voldemort's domestic terrorism mirrors the period of the Troubles (with Voldemort's fall occurring about a month after the Good Friday Agreement was signed).

It's as if there's a "spirit of the times" which encompasses both Muggle and wizarding worlds, a driving narrative (or Hegelian "spirit") behind the unfolding of human history. For example, the spirit of the 1930s-1940s was that of ideological struggle against totalitarian movements, and that spirit influenced events in both Muggle and magical worlds.

*Secondly, magic is a technology analogue.*

This is not a statement about the nature of magic or how it works. Rather it is a statement about magic's role in wizarding society. Magic plays the same role for wizards as technology does in Muggle society - it is the means by which wizards achieve higher quality of life by distancing themselves from the state of nature, the basis of a capitalistic economy, the subject of innovation as it advances over time, with individuals creating inventions which spread through the community.

In this regard it is worth noting that the nature of technology is that, over time, regional variation tends to be eliminated as innovations spread and (subject to financial resources and governmental barriers to trade) societies adopt the best form of technology available. It is not culturally relative - a iPhone is the same no matter where in the world it is.

*Thirdly, magic itself operates in accordance with rules expressed in similar terms to natural law.*

Although magic is not science, the theory of magic bears one crucial similarity to science, which is that its findings are expressed in universal terms.

Items such as Gamp's Law and its exceptions are expressed as rules which are objective and absolute. They are not likely to vary by region or culture. Magic works the same everywhere.

*Conclusion*

From these three considerations I think it's likely that:

1. Magic is more or less the same everywhere, with regional variations being eliminated over time. Cosmetic differences may remain (e.g. incantations in different languages), but the content of magic (i.e. how it behaves) would be universal. So while Chinese wizards may have a different incantation to the Stunning Charm, it's still the same Stunning Charm.

2. As regards cultural differences, the broad strokes of history are likely to be the same in magical and Muggle worlds, even after the separation of worlds. In particular, it seems likely that in the Americas, the magical population faced a similar decimation as did the Muggle one, with European wizards bringing over diseases like dragon pox.

For most of history we've had rather lax attitude and policies regarding religion in comparison to the rest of Europe. It was mostly XIX and XX century occupations that caused religion to be rather heavily ingrained into Polish national identity in order to help its preservation.

Considering our tales and folklore i wouldn't be surprised if the Polish were heavily dabbling in necromancy and had the school or our wizards on the moon.\\

** More headcanon to consider:

The international Confederation of Wizardry claims worldwide responsibility for the suppression of magic in muggle lives. There is a representative of the ICW in every muggle government, whose team is responsible for monitoring, managing and correcting all possible violations of the Statute. In some regions (the Caribbean, for example), one team exerts influence over several nations who are culturally similar, and they can set policy as best seems to suit them. Nations with sufficient stability and a large enough sustained magical population can offer their own representatives to the ICW, so long as the ICW feels that they are fulfilling the need for secrecy.

In North America, the statute is managed by the Magical Congress. Their Mystic Investigation Bureau has provided numerous developments to aid the ICW charter in the last 30 years. In particular, their seeding of Muggle Compulsion charms in software and website licensing agreements has proven essential to the project in the digital age. Rumors suggest that they have partnership think tanks established alongside muggle scientists in Boston, Oak Ridge, and Colorado Springs. Their most recent embarrassment came from an unrestrained clan war between followers of two different Bokors based around the Gulf of Mexico. The subsequent cover-up called Operation:Katrina required assets loaned from many other ICW representatives.

Wizards/witches that travel to America need permission from the Elders to enter the country, to be granted a prayer of safe travel, and can only stay a certain time before their magic starts to leech out, their witches become barren... their progeny squibs... The Natives, when they saw visions of the destruction the interlopers would bring, had copied the whole country and ever since lived in their own green, wildlife rich country, superimposed over the one that we know. Few white men have stumbled upon it in the past, but their stories are called crazy, drug addled hallucinations and they are treated very much similar to those poor souls claiming Alien abductions...placed in institutions and forgotten about.

** I think all the magical world except for maybe some secluded communities has caught up with wands centuries ago, because ritual chanting and battle staves are all well and good, but not very practical in a day-to-day life of an average witch or wizard. Basics of Charms, Transfiguration and Potions have all probably been standardized for ages, only incantations are different depending on language.

I also think magical schools JKR mentioned cannot even begin to cover global magical population, so maybe they are considered a sort of "Ivy League", and there are smaller schools or maybe magical departments in muggle universities in most other countries. Even for Europe alone, Hogwarts covers Britain, France has Beauxbatons, and how many students Durmstrang can possibly take?

In my headcanon, rather than being these mystical lands, East Asian countries are at the forefront of adapting muggle technological advancements to magic; Japan launched its first wizarding TV channel long before Arthur Weasley learned how to pronounce "electricity" (not that wizarding TVs need it, like WWN, they work using magic).

Muggle Soviet Union used wizards to low-key mind control population and spread propaganda; Russian wizards did their best to assimilate wizarding communities of the countries that were in the Soviet Union / Russian Empire before that. Those communities fought back fiercely, of course, even though, since /Magical Pravda/ would make /Prophet/ seem like a definition of free press, the details were hushed. But locals still remember what one strategically used Ukrainian Ironbelly can do.

Wands are best at charms and other effect magic, hand signs are elemental, staves control people and souls best, alchemy is self explanatory, song and dance control animals and the weather, and rings are the best are enchantments and wards.

** So, I am from Germany (just to fill your request for adding our nationalities to the posting)

So for me (taking into account what Rowling has said about say wandless magic and what we've seen in 'Fantastic beasts' about the US):

- Japan has a magical culture that takes martial arts, mind magic (meditation is part of Occlumency after all) and wandless magic (can't use a wand while using a sword for example) the center of education (with European style magics being taught as well)

- Same for the Chinese (who also have some Tibethan monk influences), they also dabble in soul and spirit stuff and they also do enchanted statues (the terracota army for example is a dormant defensive army for China against invasion!)

- The Russians might have tried to wipe magic out under communism (and failed, wards are not that easy to break and bullets probably don't work against shield-charms!)...their magical culture probably has the dark arts being taught to everybody (so dark lords don't rise because people simply kill them!)

- Africans use wandless magic a lot, while also teaching European style magic in schools (without being wand-dependent!). They also have obscure potions and rituals

- the Carribbean has water/storm magics and they also have magic that can link objects to people (the stereotypical vodoo-doll!) and cause them pain, but also healing etc

- the US teach European style magic in schools but also have Native Americans who use different shapeshifting magic (not like the animagus) more like turning into animals you have hunted yourself (something about the animal's spirit, maybe wearing a totem carved from the animal's bones etc.) and nature magics (influencing the weather etc.)

- the South and Middle Americans have ancient (and now forbidden) sacrificial magic and old runes and enchanted items and something about having familiars and communicating with animals

- The Egyptians have a lot of dark magic (mumies and such) and stuff based on the suns and echantments and such based on hieroglyphs and also enchanted statues and traps etc.

- The greek have a lot of music based magic (the legends about Sirens!) and body-enhancing magics (the legends about Demi-Gods)

- The Indians have parseltongue (it's from there, their culture after all worships snakes) and summoning demons (or at least creatures from other worlds)

- The Swedes, Norwegians and Finns have magics based on shaping the earth and ice etc.

- Nomads in Africa have traveling magics (portals - not like the floo, more like a doorway)

- People from Transilvania (Dracula is from there) have (forbidden/regulated) blood-magic

...that's it for me ;)
