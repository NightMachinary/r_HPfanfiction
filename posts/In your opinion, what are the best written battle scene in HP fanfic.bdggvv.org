**** No problem. If you haven't read Newcomb's other fic linkffn(What You Leave Behind) you should definitely do so. It isn't so action heavy, but it's an incredibly well written story that doesn't rehash canon. There is also a specific scene of Dumbledore instructing Harry that I suspect you'd enjoy.

**** It's a Michael Bay book. Lots of violence and explosions, an entertaining anti-hero version of Harry, and it does a great job of fusing the Dresden and HP universes in a way that sorta makes sense and doesn't just make HP wizards all suck.

I love the series. For me it tickles the same taste buds as Pacific Rim and Vampire: The Masquerade. It's a fun action romp.

And it also does well at having a powerful Harry against equally powerful threats. Voldemort and other villains are powered up as well.

I also like the characterization of Dumbledore, and the relationship he builds with Dark!Indy!Possessed!Harry.
