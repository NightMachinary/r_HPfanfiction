:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's a fic on FFN (I think) where Harry and Hermione both have PTSD and it's so bad that they have to sleep in the same bed otherwise they have night terrors. Essentially they are so codependent on each other that they have be in the same room as each other at all times otherwise they start to panic. They are living in Hermione's house because they couldn't find a way to fix her parent's memories after the war, and they also have to decide if they want to return for their seventh year at Hogwarts given their current mental state.

I can't remember the title for the life of me so if anyone could help me out I'd greatly appreciate it.


** I remember reading it, pretty sure it was on FFN

  Post DH. After Voldemort's defeat, the survivors face a recovery like no other... Harry and Hermione embark on their final year at Hogwarts, intent on discovering how it is they are supposed to fit into the Voldemort-free world. Together, they fight their various inner demons, and learn that there are indeed many things left for which to live.
