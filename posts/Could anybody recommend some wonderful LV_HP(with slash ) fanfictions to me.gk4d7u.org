I prefer the stories happening in the background of Hogwarts with White!Harry and no Dumbledore Bashing.

As I don't quite appreciate novels too grave,please recommend the light-hearted ones or the story with a sense of humor in it.

As I'm new to LV/HP fanfiction and haven't read too many, just A Snake Named Voldemort, Abandon, Death of Today, and Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux(not slash), so feel free to recommend the classical ones to me.

Besides, are there fanfics in which the split soul of Voldemort wakes up and accompanies Harry? Harry Potter and the accidental Horcrux is one of this type, but it's not slash and Harry in this story has been influenced towards the somehow dark side.

Please comment and recommend to me the LV/HP fanfics, and I'm really grateful for it!

  Harry's world ends at the hands of those he'd once fought to save. An adult-Harry goes back to his younger self fic. Semi-super!Harry, Voldemort/Harry, SLASH-for the idiots

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.

  Harry wanted to be outraged on behalf of the castle that he still considered to be his home. Hogwarts didn't deserve to have a piece of Tom Riddle lodged inside it like a particularly vicious splinter. But there was something he was annoyed about even more than the fact that he was once again alive at the same time as a once and future dark lord. For the first time in his life, he sympathized with Voldemort, and knew that in this one instance, Voldemort might sympathize with him. Harry looked at Tom head-on, and said, "Albus Dumbledore is a bastard."*Both turned down for the position of Hogwarts DADA professor, Tom and Harry have a few things to say to each other.
