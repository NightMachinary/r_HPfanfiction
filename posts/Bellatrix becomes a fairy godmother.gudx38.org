So I somehow completely forgot about the fact that Helena Bonham Carter was cast as the fairy godmother in Disney's live action Cinderella. Didn't realize it until I was watching a clip from the movie on youtube. She meets poor Ella, asks for a cup of milk, which she proceeds to slurp up (like with actual slurping sounds), and then introduces herself as Ella's Hairy Dogfather. Clearly this is Bellatrix Lestrange, who in the afterlife has been punished to use her magic only for the good of others as a fairy godmother. And clearly she's been spending too much time around Sirius Black in the afterlife (who probably finds her predicament hilarious).

I don't suppose anyone out there has attempted to write this little cracky crossover? Even a one-shot? Anyone?


** "I'm Bella" "And I'm Voldie!" "AND WE'RE ... YOUR FAIRY GODPARENTS!"

The ways Bella and Voldie had to deal with Vicky were increasingly more brutal each time... and he wasn't sure what happened to Mr. Crocker, but the dogs in the neighborhood were well fed the day Francis went missing.

Jorgen wasn't sure how two fairies kept breaking the No Killing part of Da Rules, but if they could kill that easily, he figured he'd better stay out of their way just in case.

** Now I want to see both this and a fic where Harry introduces Sirius as his "hairy dogfather"

Edit: Or maybe have Dobby refer to Sirius as "Hairy Dogfather" (Harry's Godfather)

** This reminds me of Legends of Tomorrow. In it an ex-assasin is made the fairy god mother.
