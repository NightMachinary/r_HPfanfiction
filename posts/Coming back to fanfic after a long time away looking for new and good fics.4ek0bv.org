Hey everyone, this is my first post on this sub, so please forgive me if I'm not doing things correctly. I'll give you a short history first and see if you can help from that.

I was heavily into HP fanfiction about 8 or 9 years ago, since just befote order of the pehonix came out. I posted regularly on several forums (fictionalley was the main one), beta'd for a few of the more well known authors back then, even tried writing myself which failed since I never managed to get past the first 3 chapters in anything I wrote haha. I also have a huge file on burned CD of old classics that I copied and pasted into word and saved haha, I've found some of them are hard to come by now as the authors have deleted them.

Anyway I've been away from the fandom now for at least 5 years, probably longer. I recently reread an old favorite and I'm eager to get back into it again, only I don't know where to find the new stuff that's good. I tried fictionalley and it's like a ghost town, so I'm hoping the people here can help :).

I'm looking for really good new fics. Ones written in the last 5 years, or that became popular in the last 5 years. I prefer longer ones, don't need to be prince of the dark kingdom long (for the record I remember reading that when it was just a few chapters long haha) but I like something I can get into and that has character development. NO SLASH, crossovers, or creature!harry (unless it really makes sense) just not into it. But I do tend to like time travel/AU and powerful!harry. I don't have a favorite ship, but have a soft spot for lore silvere (harry/bella). But most of all I'm looking for quality. I want a few really well written stories that I haven't read before.

Sorry this post was a lot longer then i was planning. Might have to put a tldr in here lol.

TLDR: reading fics again after long time away. Looking for new ones (past 5 years). No slash, crossover. Want decent length and good quality. Like time travel but not picky.


** WOW! Thanks for the replies! And there's a lot of them! I'm not sure where to start haha. I went to sleep after posting that last night and thinking meh I might get 4 or 5 and I'll be happy with that. Thanks again everyone, I'm off to read and ignore everything else for the day... thus pissing off my wife terribly. Gonna be a good day ;).

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** I'm so curious about what you have saved on that CD. I've been in the fandom for about 10 years, but I know there were things I missed back then (or read back then) that aren't around anymore. I'm mad that I didn't think to save any of them.

** These stories are listed in the order of their completion date:

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), was just finished yesterday. It's a bloody good story, and one of my top 5 already. After Voldemort's fall, the Ministry kept sucking up to pureblood extremists. Harry was angry, very angry, and he was not alone.

*Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650): Harry's horcrux offered him a deal, resulting in a far more powerful and ruthless Harry. But Voldemort was not his only enemy.

*Not From Others*, linkffn(11419408): the best year 7 Hogwarts story by far, written by fellow redditor [[/u/FloreatCastellum]].

*The Arithmancer*, linkffn(10070079): highly popular canon-rehash story with a somewhat different Hermione. Year 1-4. *Lady Archimedes*, linkffn(11463030) covers year 5 and above.

*One Hundred and Sixty Nine*, linkffn(8581093): great Hermione time-travel to Marauder Era fic.

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005): the real war began after Voldemort's fall, written by fellow redditor [[/u/Starfox5]].

linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool) - super clever and often-funny fic.

linkffn(War Paint) - crazy stuff that somehow works.

linkffn(The Changeling) - /brilliant/ Slytherin!Ginny fic.

linkffn(Shadow Walks) - pretty good Harmony, without any bashing.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Ahsoka feeling abandoned, betrayed and disillusioned with the Jedi Order, decided to part ways. She left to find meaning and purpose in her life. She never expected it to come in the form of an enigmatic green eyed young man who had more than a passing interest in the past. She never imagined that learning about the history of the galaxy could be so dangerous---or magical.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things.

Winter is coming, but magic is might.

** A Cadmean Victory linkffn(11446957) would be my suggestion, along with The Sum of Their Parts, which has already been suggested in this thread.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
