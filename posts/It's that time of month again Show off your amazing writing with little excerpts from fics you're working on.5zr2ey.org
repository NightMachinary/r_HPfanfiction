"-and so, my Lord, the Light are running around like headless chickens trying to find their precious savior." Severus Snape was barely able to keep his eyes on Lord Voldemort. It was very difficult, what with there being a third person in the room. The man who hadn't been introduced was sprawled sideways ungracefully in an armchair, reading a dark ritual book with undisguised fascination. He had shoulder length black hair that tangled and curled like a Potter's but that was all he could see, other than that he was short.

"Very good, Sever-"

"Hey, Tom, where DO you find 70 year old virgin women anyway?" Severus's blood ran cold. This man was insane. Not only calling the Dark Lord by name, but interrupting him without a care in the world. To his stunned amazement however, Voldemort merely sighed and glared over at the unknown male.

"Muggle convents mostly. Now do you mind? I'm trying to do business. I let you come in here, you promised to be quiet. Don't make me kick you out." The man snorted.

"Please, like you could." Still, he quieted down and Voldemort turned his attention back to Severus.

"Ignore him, Severus. Now, we'll be reaching feelers out across Europe, gaining allies. I want you to get in touch with your fellow potions masters."

"Yes, my Lord." Voldemort gave him a look that let Severus know he was being dismissed, so he stood, bowed, and hurried out. As the door closed he heard the man speak again.

"Can we do this ritual?"

"Why on earth do you want to be able to bear children?"

"Oh Tom, don't break my heart by telling me you don't want any!" Severus barely kept back a choke of surprise, his pace quickening further. He REALLY had to share this information with Dumbledore.

(Side note: Harry isn't actually sleeping with Tom here. Nor does he actually want to get man-pregnant) Edit: Since some people have expressed interest in my stories, which are sadly yet to be published, here's a link to my ffn account to follow for when I DO post them: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7288663/][Here]]


** Excerpt from a future chapter of linkffn(Like a Red headed Stepchild by mugglesftw).

/////////\//////////

“Are you sure you're a Weasley? Because I don't want to go making assumptions just based on hair color like last year, rather embarrassing and all you know...”

“Just because I'm a girl doesn't mean I can't be a Weasley!” Ginny half shouted, sticking her lip out and folding her arms across her chest in a great pout.

The Sorting Hat, despite being a hat, managed to look rather ashamed of itself. “Oh! Beg your pardon my dear, I can see that you are indeed a Weasley. Right then, off you go.”

“Thanks,” Ginny said, taking off the hat and starting towards the Gryffindor table.

“Miss Weasley!” Professor McGonagall snapped. Then she turned to glare at the Sorting Hat. “Hat! You did not, in fact, sort Miss Weasley!”

“I did!” the Hat protested. “She said she was a Weasley, so she goes in the Weasley house!”

“I am so writing dad that that's actually a thing now,” George whispered, causing his brothers and Hermione to all snigger and the rest of the Gryffindors to roll their eyes in resignation.

“There is no Weasley house, Hat,” McGonagall ground out.

The Hat was silent for a moment. “Oh, right. Come on, put me back on.”

Ginny went back, but as soon as the Hat touched her head it bellowed, “Gryffindor!” then flopped off of Ginny's head and managed to give the appearance of glaring at McGonagall. “Don't act like we didn't all know what I meant! I'm 1002 years old, woman! I'm not some spring straw hat!”

“You cannot simply start telling students to go with their families! It would be a break in tradition that goes back over-”

“Oh don't you lecture ME on tradition! I started half of them you know, before you were even a twinkle in your grandfather's eye, why-”

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.

** Harry buys his first wand.

#+begin_quote
  "Red pine, twelve inches, rather stiff. Dragon core, one of my... less popular variants."

  Harry looked at Ollivander in askance, but picked it up. When his fingers gripped the smooth handle, an electrifying tingle shot up his arm, filling his body with warmth. He gave the wand a broad sweep, shooting out multicolored sparks that lingered in the air.

  "Mwahaha!" Harry laughed, feeling heady and energized. "All shall fear my power!"

  "Indeed," Ollivander said dryly, bringing him back to earth. "I knew this wand would find its master one day. Unfortunately, not many wizards accept a splinter from a dragon's baculum as the core, which is why I haven't crafted one for decades."

  "Baculum, sir?"

  "Also known as a penile bone," Ollivander said. "I don't have a diagram on hand, but the name should be self-explanatory."

  Harry scanned the wandmaker's face for signs of mockery, but he appeared perfectly serious. "A dragon's..."

  "Penile bone, yes."

  Harry chuckled nervously. "Mr. Ollivander, surely you are just making fun of a clueless Muggle-raised wizard like myself?" He slowly lowered the wand to the counter, already unwilling to part with it.

  The man drew himself up. "Mr. Potter, I treat my craft with utmost respect. Along with its heart, the baculum is a dragon's most magical part. The only reason it isn't used more is that customers often refuse to buy wands with these cores."

  "I wonder why," Harry muttered.

** Here's another shorter one. A crossover between HP and Baccano!

Four year old Harry Potter stared up at the blood splattered redhead, blinking as the man smiled down at him.

"Hi there," he said. The man had a funny accent.

"Hi . . ." Harry muttered back.

"I'm Claire Stanfield! I knew your mother-sort of. Would you like to come live with me?" Harry looked past Claire to where his . . . Aunt, he thought, was strewn across the upstairs bathroom. And the upstairs hallway. And partially down the stairs. He nodded slowly.

** /Edited to add context: clichéd mind-connection, sane!handsome!youngFiennes!Riddle, sixth year AU aaand... That's probably all you need./

‘What?' Harry kept his eyes on his book, hoping Hermione was too engrossed in her work opposite to notice his lack of genuine attention. ‘Other prophecies about you?'

‘Of course, as a Dark Lord I was big news,' and though Harry couldn't see him, he knew Tom was smirking. ‘Back in the fifties,' began Tom. (‘When you were bumming around Europe being suspicious and going crazy?' asked Harry, to which Tom replied ‘Yes, brat, then.') ‘I snuck into the Department of Mysteries. Though as you proved, it's not exactly hard. It was even easier then, despite a post-War spy-obsessed Ministry. They had few checkpoints, hadn't integrated Muggle ideas like the scans they were introducing at airports, the ID checks which were ubiquitous at customs and immigration points even at that time. If you walked in with confidence and arrogance, it was expected you belonged. Plus,' he added wryly, ‘a few sympathisers on the inside always works wonders. And though I wasn't looking for it, I did find the Hall of Prophecy.'

Tom, in his study, sank back in his chair and stared at the fire, allowing himself to remember. He tried to recall as much detail as possible, not easy given the fractures, but there was enough. He let Harry see, and narrated as he went. He recalled wandering the racks, endless but oppressively claustrophobic. ‘I saw the records, how beautiful they were, like snow-globes I would see in shop windows as a child. They were little beacons, and I wanted to know everything they had to say. But I knew the rules, I knew I could only touch and hear those pertaining to me. My curiosity got the better of me, and I navigated my way to a prophecy concerning myself. Then another, and another. There were quite a number.'

He remembered using his wand to point his way, homing in on even unassigned prophecies but ones which his magic seemed to agree were unequivocally about Tom Riddle, the self-styled Lord Voldemort. Some were dimmed, long fulfilled or thwarted to be rendered obsolete, and he smashed them out of spite. ‘I was already quite mad,' commented Tom, shame and amusement mingling into self-deprecation. ‘Angry to be denied knowledge about myself. I hated that other people would have known things about me that I would never know.' Tom didn't need to say it, but Harry understood perfectly. Other people had been the ones to tell them both of their heritage, their magic and their world. It had been other people who had told them who they were and could be, when it should have been there all along, the legacy of their parents and their families, so they could grow and decide who to be. Tom continued, ‘When I came across a prophecy which indicated I'd share power with an equal, I lost what little composure I could maintain.'

He'd listened to every prophecy regarding himself, and smashed each one gleefully to the ground. No-one else would ever know these things about Tom Riddle, some would never be assigned. And most importantly: some would never, Voldemort vowed, be fulfilled.

‘It was about you and I, I know that now,' Tom said calmly, watching the flames flicker in the grating. ‘I've long since forgotten many of the prophecies, but I know I fulfilled some and voided others. But that prophecy, the one which made me so livid, I remember quite well.'

** Excerpt from a future chapter of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12334664/1/The-Rezidentura][*The Rezidentura*]]. Dumbledore reveals, potentially, his Batman gambit:

#+begin_quote
  “How did you know?” Voldemort replied, not moving his wand from where he had last cast the spell at Misha, “Not even this fool's family could figure it out.”

  “Quirinus was a happy man,” Dumbledore replied, “You have always had a very particular distinct shroud of sadness about you.”

  “If you have known for six years, why wait till now,” Voldemort shot a spell at Dumbledore this time, who conjured a flock of small birds to intercept the spell. Immediately the bird launched at Voldemort who quickly banished them away.

  “Oh, because I have been waiting for this moment,” Dumbledore replied with a chuckle, “And planning for it the past six years. You were always going to end up in this Chamber with me. If you will indulge an old man for a second, I am quite impressed with it. I did not expect it to go this easy.”

  “What are you talking about Dumbledore,” Voldemort hissed, as Misha wondered why the Headmaster was monologuing.

  “The day you took over poor Quirinus I started planning for this exact moment,” the Headmaster replied, “I started to move the pieces around on the chessboard that would result in you thinking there was a special package in the vaults of Gringotts. I let you into my confidence, pushing for Quirinus to take a year exploring so that he could come back ready to be the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. Of course, you were sloppy enough to think you had pulled your gambit off that you did not realize I had you followed the entire time. Everything you saw on your expedition was of my doing.”

  “While you were away, I continued to move the pieces around. I wanted to set the stage for when you returned properly. I acquired this mirror for instance. I had Minerva craft a gigantic chess board as well. All things to make you believe. When you came back, the entire stage was set. At that point, it was like a muggle magic trick. I just enticed you to look in one direction and to my amusement you followed every time. You always enjoyed thinking you had the upper hand, so I let you.”

  “Didn't you find it odd that dear old Hagrid was the one sent to retrieve the stone from Gringotts? I trust in Hagrid of course, but I know the man can not keep a secret. I knew you were going to be in that pub, on that day, at that exact time. You reacted exactly as I knew you would.”

** In my spare time, I've actually started plonking along on that /Blacklist/ crossover that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5q87m1/idea_for_a_story_the_blacklist/][someone here had an idea]] for not too long ago -- an idea that was pretty much like a fic I had on the backburner. (Well, I mean, is it really on the backburner when most of my fics are on the backburner?)

Anyway, here's a snippet, raw and unedited, from the first chapter.

--------------

The man in the black hat arrived at the Atrium of the British Ministry of Magic with a swirl of smoke and a small thunderclap, and /Merlin/, they hadn't done anything with the place in /years/. Everything, from the brilliantly blue ceiling to the unrepentantly ugly fountain halfway down the massive room, was exactly as he had last seen it. No accounting for taste, or lack thereof, as the case might be, but he could at least let them know his thoughts on their decor. As he left the area assigned for incoming travelers, he twitched a silent spell at the fountain, a spell that wouldn't make itself known until the right moment.

There, he felt better about that old eyesore already. With that bit of impromptu work finished, he pressed through the crowd of visitors and Ministry workers, heading towards the golden gates ahead of him.

There was a queue, of course. More than one. He stood at the end of the one to the left, assigned for visitors. Several minutes passed. If the faces of the surrounding people had been any indication, this might have been the most boring moment of their collective lives. Most of them didn't know true boredom, which happened to be sitting in a Muggle shipping container somewhere in the Marianas Trench for three weeks, passing time by playing word games with old friends you had long since stopped worrying about hallucinating, and occasionally praying that the interesting spells keeping you oxygenated and fed wouldn't give out due to some whim of your biggest enemy at the moment. Or perhaps it had been your allies. It had turned out to be rather difficult to remember that during such an extended holiday. After that little adventure, the "boredom" that came with standing in a queue simply couldn't compare.

Said queue moved along in due time, and he reached the watch-witch standing -- well, sitting -- guard at the gates.

"Wand," the guard said.

He gave this over at once, which she began to weigh and analyze. It was cute, that they thought this could prevent a real threat from doing anything in this place. If he had a mind to do something -- well, he hadn't. Not today. No, today he had meant to do something a bit different from what might be expected of him to do.

"Your purpose for visiting today?" she said as the wand analyzer hummed and chirped away beneath his wand.

Several, but she needn't know that. In as blandly pleasant a tone as he could manage, he said, "I'm here to speak with the Deputy Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Kingsley Shacklebolt."

She chewed and clacked her gum, which she was paying more attention to than his face. Well, this would likely be her last day on the job. "And you know 'im personally, I suppose?"

"No, not personally, but I do have business with him." He smiled, tightly, not meaning it. "My name is Sirius Black."

Those words hadn't their impended impact. She blew a bubble. Had he slipped that far down the Ministry's Most Wanted list? After the bubble had popped, she said, "If that's supposed to mean something to me, it doesn't -- this won't go any faster just because of whoever you might or might not be."

Ah, the ignorance of youth. Or perhaps it was the ignorance of the terminally thick.

** And one more, my lovely friends.

Minerva McGonagall glanced from the letter in her hand to the large complex before her. Children moved about on the lawn behind the gate, some limping with strange sticks on their arms and some scarred worse than Alastor Moody. She even saw one who was missing everything from the waist down being pushed around in a wheelchair. Surrounding them were men and women in white clothes, some helping those who were clearly unable to move properly. Others just walked beside the children and engaged them in conversation. Frowning, she took a breath and made her way past the sign that read "St. Marciana's Children's Care."

Striding briskly to the entrance, McGonagall stepped inside and glanced around. "Hello, may I help you?" A sweet sounding woman sitting behind a desk asked.

"Yes, my name is Professor McGonagall, I'm here to see a Mr. Harry Potter about offering him a place at our school."

"Oh! Harry? Of course! Oh that's just wonderful! Poor child needs to get out and meet new people!"

McGonagall watched the woman press several buttons on what she recalled was a telephone. "Lucy, Harry Potter's in your class right now, right? Could you ask him to come to the front desk? There's a woman here to see him." The woman smiled up at McGonagoll again. "He'll be down shortly. Feel free to take a seat while you wait."

The witch nodded but made no move to sit, instead glancing around the colorfully decorated entrance. "I hope you don't mind, but I was under the impression Mr. Potter lived with his relatives?" She asked eventually. Before the receptionist could answer, she heard a voice behind her.

"I haven't lived with the Dursleys for almost five years, ma'am."

Turning around, it was all she could do to stifle a gasp. "Mr. Potter," she breathed.

"Yes?" There was something in the child's voice, warning her that she was now taking a test more important than any NEWT.

"You really do look just like your father, save the eyes," she said. The child smiled and a tension she didn't notice was there faded away as Harry relaxed back into the wheelchair.

  Riddle gazed into her eyes. She felt him bulling through her memories, and tried as best she could to simply accept it. Accept that he would see everything she'd known and everything she thought. Like any assault where one cannot defend, the only other option was to ruin the fun for them.

  And she giggled.

  "Why do you laugh?"

  "Oh, baby. Come into me! I want to feel your hot probe in all my dark recesses. Come into my wholeness. Explore my every orifice. Make me feel like your head-sleeve. I want you to wear me like a swimsuit."

  "Defy me if you think you can," his high voice warned her, "everything you know will be mine. Resistance is futile."

  Riddle's red eyes and deathly-pale, serpentine face filled her vision. His features morphed in her mind into a similarly pale and bald man bearing patches of blackened armour on his skull and covering half his face. His hand had been replaced by a whirring device of no obvious purpose.

  "Snrk! 'We will add your biological and metaphysical distinctiveness to our own. Your magic will adapt to service ... us.' "

  Even from within her head, Riddle's confusion was evident. "Mechanical inferi?"

  Holly's giggling got harder to hold back.

  "I will NOT be mocked!"

  "I'm not! I'm not- this situation is so insane, though, that I can't help but... SNRk. Bah HAHAHHHAHAAAH!"

Michael's spell hit him full in the chest, sending him to the floor with a thump as his wand spun out of his hand and fell neatly into his friend's.

“Mind wandering a bit, Sol?”

The Slytherin scratched at his neck a little abashedly as the Ravenclaw gave him back his wand.

“Sorry, just had a bit of a revelation.”

Michael cocked an eyebrow inquisitively.

“Oh yeah?”

Sol nodded solemnly and leaned in a little to talk without being overheard, his eyes shifting about to make sure none of Lockhart's spies (he called them fangirls, but Sol knew the truth) were nearby.

** Oh goodness I hope this is okay. My first (published) HP fanfic. It's on ao3 but I'll be crossposting to FF tomorrow. Set n NYC, 1924. A prequel of sorts to Fantastic Beasts.

It began with a hum that the assorted wizards were quick to notice. Expressions of confusion and mild interest crossed the Auror's faces, though none looked overly concerned. The noise didn't fade. Much the opposite, it progressively grew louder in pitch and volume.

At the front of the auditorium a brunette witch pursed her lips, huffing at the interruption. She was already on thin ice with her fellow peers, and was miffed at the idea that her presentation might be regarded in ill-manner, or forgotten due to this anomaly.

“As I was saying,” Tina continued. “She has adopted two new children. One of whom is a Barebone descendant. Now, it's likely he's a squib-”

The hum rose sharply in volume once more. It was now impossible to ignore. A murmur rolled through the crowd. One witch muttered something about the Experimental Spells crew, who'd taken over the adjacent hall that day to show off their new charms.
