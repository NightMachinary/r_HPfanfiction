** That is a super interesting idea! :) That would mean Sirius was the spy and Secret keeper, and Peter hid as a rat because he was honestly afraid of Sirius for the right reasons after Sirius tried to kill him in the street?! :o I have never read a good guy Peter and bad guy Sirius before! It would be like how everyone in universe THOUGHT the story went! :)

** Conlaodh's Song, and it's short prequel By The Divining Light, feature Sirius Black as one of Voldemort's most fearsome (and deranged) followers. Would definitely recommend these two fics - writing style is top-notch, and the author (enembee) is also the writer of The Skitterleap.

** This happens in the rather divisive Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (linkffn(5782108)), though it's a very minor plot point and Sirius never plays any large role.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** Well since such a thing does not seem to exist (at least as a main plot) anyone wanna write one? I suppose I could but I don't think I'm qualified to write Fanfiction seeing as I only read the series once many years ago (too many other books on my list I haven't read to spend time re-reading) I also don't know how I would come up with a convincing alternate backstory for as to why Sirius Black changed sides and betrayed his friends. If I ever figure that out and read the series again then maybe I will someday...
