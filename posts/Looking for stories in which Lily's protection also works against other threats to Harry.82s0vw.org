So, Lily's protection was enough to deal with Quirrel but is never seen working afterwards. Are there any fics where it actually does something against someone else (besides a manipulative Dumbledore, that trope is rather boring)? Like anyone trying to harm Harry or bearing the Dark Mark? Crack is fine (I doubt that there is a serious story with that premise), but I'd prefer no Hermione/Ron and no Hermione/"any male Slytherin" in the background.

Just to name a few examples out of my head:

- Snape brushing against Harry in the corridors? BBQed.

- Malfoy trying to use the Cruciatus on Harry? Dead.

- Karkaroff? Should have stayed at Durmstrang.

- Scabbers? Roasted.

- The Dursleys? Didn't make it 24 hours.

- Aunt Marge? You mean Aunt Hindenburg.

- Ripper? RIP.


** This would be hilarious. I almost want it to /not/ be a crack fic because having it played straight would be even funnier. Harry would be like, "Of course that guy got axed. Fucker brushed against me and mummy doesn't like that".

More seriously, I have considered making the protection more general, but only unbeatable against Voldemort. Like a general defensive buff but +infinity in the right conditions.

  Lily's sacrifice did a lot more for Harry than protect him from Voldemort. It protected him from the worst of his relatives' abuse, too. But when Dumbledore tells him the whole story, he decides he's had enough and takes control of his life. Set in sixth year.

*** Honestly, that barely qualifies. Lily's protection saved Harry from the damage of the /emotional/ abuse of the Dursleys, while Dumbledore's Protection of Blood Charm on the house mostly prevented the abuse from getting too physical.
