A fic where Harry sees a opportunity instead of hating it like he did in the books. Just without Voldemort influencing him, and it would be nice to for Harry to have some fanatics by manipulating the people around him with his fame.


** He pretty much uses everything he has in some way or another in linkffn(Oh god not again) . I can't think a closer fic :/

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Cormac McLaggen explains a few simple truths to Harry, with profound consequences. Harry/Romilda. Smut.
