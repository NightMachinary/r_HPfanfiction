Now we all know about what the traps are. But I think something gets missed when we look back at them and see that they all were got past by first years. And that's that maybe they were always supposed to be got past? It goes like this:

â€‹

Dumbledore's goal isn't to kill a thief, it's to capture a thief, hopefully Voldemort. All of the traps can be solved even by first years however, they reset once you exit the room.

â€‹

Locked door? infantile. That's just to deter random people opening the door. Fluffy is the first real challenge. Most people at this point would just slam the door closed and run. If you know how to send it to sleep, you can get past it. However, it's notable in the books that Fluffy's paw is blocking the trapdoor, even in its sleep. So did it somehow move its paw there in its sleep, or was it magically drawn there after the trapdoor was closed?

â€‹

Now we get onto the second trap. Devils Snare. Not really a problem, but it is there to draw your attention away from the fact that there's a long drop above it, which you now can't get back up without flying.

â€‹

Now the cursed broom, flying keys and another locked door. This door in particular was locked after quirrel went through, with a key that wasn't on his side of the door. We can only assume from this that the door relocked itself after quirrel went through. So now you are trapped the wrong side of a presumably heavily warded door.

â€‹

Next trap: chess. once you exit the room it resets. But oh no. Now you are on the side of the board that you can't control. Presumably at this point you are forced to fight through both sides of the chess board that you bypassed earlier.

â€‹

The troll can be more or less forgotten about. The potions though? Presumably the 'poisons' were in fact draught of the living death. The potions that sent you through the fire were a finite resource and would wear out once you crossed over, leaving you trapped in the Erised chamber. And the mirror was made to be impossible to get passed for anybody like Quirrelmort.

â€‹

Thoughts?


** They were traps designed by each teacher. Dumbledore saved the best for last, because quirrel could never have gotten the stone if it weren't for harry, so in a way, foolproof, genius i'd say. Have a little faith in dumbledore ðŸ˜‹

** My personal headcannon is that the stone was a trap meant to draw out Voldemort from hiding and everything up to the mirror was meant to just delay, it could be gotten past, but it was meant to be time consuming. The gauntlet was made so magic was minimally helpful, so anyone would need to work through it rather than bypassing with magic. Harry & co, having little magical ability at this point in time, don't pick up on this detail.

Harry & co actually screwed Dumbledore's plan by going in and Harry confronting Quirrel allows Voldemort to escape, but Dumbledore gave them points, because he felt guilty about students getting caught up in his scheme.

*** This has essentially been my interpretation of the traps for years now, with the additional detail that the Philosopher's Stone contained within the Mirror was a fake, just on the off chance that Voldemort somehow found a way to retrieve it. The real one being kept on Dumbledore's person at all times since Hagrid collected it from Gringotts.

*** This would be accurate except, Hagrid & Harry at Gringotts, Dumbledore drops a hint about fluffy at the welcoming feast, ANYONE could open the door to Fluffy, Dumbledore explains how the mirror works instead of relocating it before(or right after) harry finds it.

Now taken by themselves, these can be coincidence. But take them all together, and its obvious this was a test, for Harry. Which also doubled as a trap for Quirrel.

All Dumbledore had to do to stop children from going in was an age line. Or better yet, vanish the door altogether and have the house elves feed fluffy.

*** Yeah, this is the right answer. He could even influence teachers decisions... "So Minerva, you suggest autonomous soldiers... how about an extra layer? You play chess... don't you?" and stuff like that.

The real issues are 3:

- What is the public reason to have the stone in Hogwarts? Is it really more secure than Gringotts? I think it isn't. All you did in Hogwarts could have been done in Gringotts as well. And it always felt like a stretch that Quirrell/Voldemort could have gone through Gringotts easily and undetected. More of a plot device. No teacher or Ministry official ask Dumbledore... "Really?"

- After first year, some of the teachers most have been tipped off on Dumbledore doing this on purpose. If either Minerva or Flitwick realized this, they would have gone to Dumbledore to ask about it. So either he tells them more, or they are left more suspicious of Dumbledore. Neither of those two seemed to have happened.

- It's okay that Dumbledore is setting Quirrell against Harry in a controlled way, for all we knew Dumbledore could have been hidden in the chamber waiting for act if something went awry. However, having Quirrell free for months seems like too much of a risk for students. Does any fanfic have an explanation of how Dumbledore could have taken care of this?

** idiotic. and the main reason why manipulative Dumbledore is my headcanon.

if you take the traps apart, each one of them was for someone from the group. the potions were made for Hermione, the chess was made for Ron, the keys were made for Harry and the devil's snare was made for Neville. remember that Neville was caught with the trio and got detention. Dumbledore might have assumed he will also be a part of the mission, so he made a task just for him. and concerning Fluffy, who else is a good friend to Harry and can't keep a secret? Hagrid. and then there was the whole getting the package from Gringotts in front of Harry, despite the fact that Hagrid isn't supposed to do magic (is not too good at it either). wouldn't it make more sense for Dumbledore to go himself for something so priceless?

I know it was made by JK as an easy plot, but if it wasn't written, it would all be Dumbledore.

not to mention, the moving stairs, which never malfunctioned before and were generally reliable other than the missing step people got stuck in.... just so happen to take the trio right to the third corridor. coincidence? I think not!

"And sir, there's one more thing..."\\
"Just the one?"\\
"Why were you so certain your trap would work, sir? That he wouldn't just leave and try another day?"\\
"Well, I could say I bet on his pride and not be far from truth. Because that is precisely what I did, though perhaps not in a way you would have expected.

"I could have left the defences as they were, and have a good chance that he would still be standing in front of the mirror when I returned, of his own free will. But that is not what I did.

"Seven Trials of the Seeker. What do you know about rituals, Harry?"

"Not much, Sir. Aren't those the large magical undertakings with flor grafitti and a lot of omnious chanting?"

"Hahaha! Ah, to be young! No, the essence of a ritual is sacrifice... But even more so it is commitment. Each of the Trials by itself was simple, almost insultingly so. They needed to be in case Voldemort tried to take hostages or if some student went to the third floor driven by curiosity...

But each time he passed one of the trials, he affirmed his consent, his willing participation. He, in the end, became part of the magic, unable to stop. Unable to quit. Compelled to see the endavour through even if it killed him."

"And what if a student passed a few of those?"

"Nothing would happen! Someone driven merely by curiosity, would satisfy the victory condition by merely satisfying their curiosity. Instead of a seven part ritual, they would see seven separate pieces of capital entertainment. Harmless puzzles, if you will. Well, mostly."

** The only useful trap was the mirror at the end. Fluffy was a deterrent, fine. I'd be way more comfortable if it was the door. But whatever. If the objective was to catch, then why have a plant that breaks your fall right after fluffy? Use something hard, that way whoever it is hopefully gets injured enough that they cant move. Long before getting to the actual stone. If that doesnt work then you have the rest of the traps hellbent on trapping, one wau or the other. It's not that hard to figure out.

** I think that Voldemort had sabotaged the traps so that Harry had a easier time coming in.

The door may have been magically spelledto keep Voldemort out but after he opened it, he didn't care about locking it again.

I am not sure about the trap though. But then it was Sprout, she would have taken mercy or something and not tried to kill anyone. Apart from the fact that even Hermione was a little disoriented when she fell, I think a single wizard wouldn't have identified it in time to save himself. Or there was a subtle confundus charm placed there.

For the room with flying keys. We already know that Voldemort had taken the key once to open the door. He might not have handled it gently enough, not that he did anything dently, and twisted a few wings here and there. Even then Harry had had a little more difficulty catching the key. If it had been in pristine condition, I don't think he would have been able to pluck it in the air, especially in a closed room, with a key that could turn on the spot while a broom couldn't.

He could have confounded the chess peice easily enough. I mean, there wasn't even one sign to show that a fight had taken place, and I don't think Voldemort go on cleaning the room and repairing the room for Harry. So I presume he confounded the Chess set to take only one person out, instead of everyone who entered the room or something like that.

The troll, You said it all.

For Snape's trap, I think he used logical means to stop Voldemort because he could have said to Voldemort later that he had not wanted to stop Voldemort in his goal but had wanted to keep the trust of Dumbledore. And Logic was something that Voldemort probably connected to Muggles, whom he detested. However he couldn't have complained as that meant that he was accepting he couldn't do something that Muggles could. However all the bottles were intact in the room, not one emptied, so I guess Voldemort used some Dark magic to get through those flames.

But I guess that was a small win for Snape. And for some reason I can't stop thinking about Snape, sitting a dark corner in his quarters, with an oil lamp on the wall and drinking firewhiskey. And smiling, or perhaps even grinning to himself. XD

But Dumbledore's plan was dependent on a variable of things and Voldemort could be surprising as ever. But then again, Dumbledore was a strategist if nothing else, and he would have thought all that already. I hope so.

Thanks.

Ps- I know many of you don't Like Snape and Dumbledore but please don't hate me for about writing about it. I have been getting a lot of hate comments just because I tell others about my opinion of them whenever there is a discussion.

** Intriguing.

However, I think it still makes more sense to take the traps at face value. That is, not only are the intended to keep people out but, in fact, they're good choices (except for the troll, which was put in there by someone who always wanted an easy way through). Although, I suppose, there's no reason they can't have been two way locks.

Fluffy's the interesting one. In principle, just kill him, right? But maybe Voldemort intended on the theft's remaining undetected... which holds up until you remember that Quirrel knows Snape knows he's after the Stone. Similarly, people act like it should be obvious how to get by Fluffy. Well, no. Voldemort, Quirrel and Snape all have no idea. HP isn't set in the real world so real world knowledge of Orpheus' legend isn't relevant. Which means we're back to... why not kill Fluffy? The logical answer is... you can't. Avada Kedavra doesn't kill Fawkes... not permanently, why wouldn't something similar apply here?

Then we get to the Devil's Snare. This one's another that people argue, "But it's got such an obvious and well known weakness!" Okay, sure. Now, let's remember what was used to kill Broderick Brode. Oh, yeah. Healers have to be good at herbology and they failed to recognise it. Similarly, the trio. They saw the plant too and... didn't recognise it. The only actual problem is that you'd expect people to use light immediately to see what they've landed in.

Next up is the key room. This is, again, cleverer than it first appears. Firstly you have to figure out what to do. Secondly you have to do it. Usually I think people argue that the key can just be summoned... which ignores that the door can't just be unlocked. Why wouldn't it be possible to prevent an object from being summoned? We know that not all wizards are good at seeking. This is actually even a notorious timeline problem since Charlie's only just finished at Hogwarts. And similarly we know Harry's meant to be very good. It's not a foolproof "lock" but it's not a bad one either.

The chess set is again interesting. We know that the match is meant to be a good one since Ron gets points for it but somehow this is ignored. Similarly, we also know that Ron only found a way to win by sacrificing himself. Chess is not an easy game. I'm not very good at it, for example, but I was clearly better than my friends at primary. Even worse, it's a game where a forced draw is... a common result. And the less said about the "just fly over it" solutions the better.

The troll is a relative dud, but that;s because the troll is also an inside man.

Now, I think you're probably right that the potions aren't lethal but are, instead, designed to incapacitate. And the reason I say this is because when it comes down to it, Dumbledore seems to trust Hagrid and Snape much more than any of the other teachers (even McGonagall). I think the potions were the original "final" lock before Dumbledore got the Stone into the Mirror.

Of course, it never really mattered since the Mirror is the perfect safe. Indeed, I rather suspect that the reason the Mirror wasn't in place from the start was because Dumbledore was trying to convince Flamel to die. It is a bit "too pat" that Flamel just decides to die, but there's no reason /why/ that couldn't have been a conversation they'd had months earlier. And the Mirror has always seemed to me to be a bit "too good" as a safe.
