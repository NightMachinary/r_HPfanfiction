([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5640811/2/Hagrid-and-the-Skoolgurlz]]) inspired me to take the definition of a crackfic one step further.

In the AU I just thought up, the Order of the Phoenix and Death Eaters are heavy metal bands. However, much like Slipknot and Mushroomhead, they and their fans feud with each other. Then the neutral or stupid people(ex. Amelia Bones, Cornelius Fudge) are fans of One Direction, the dance pop band. While the One Directioners are partying, the Order and Death Eaters are fighting for market share among the wizarding community, which happens to involve looting, destruction, and and death. The reason the Ministry is so ineffective is because the three factions are too busy fighting/partying to effectively govern Wizarding Britain, which leaves people like Harry, who doesn't give a shit, to find his own way. This could include him going Rise of the Wizards on everyone, where he creates a completely new band in /his/ image, or him going canon, where he joins the Order of the Phoenix and gets all of the Death Eaters and their fans killed.


** Let's just say I am slowly planning out an AU during years 5-7. Fun things about the fic:

1.  Voldemort is D E A D dead.

2.  Chamber of Secrets does open, during 4th year. Attaining the Sword of Gryffindor has far more... long term and widespread importance than seen in canon.

3.  Horcruxes aren't immortality devices, but more akin to Sith Holocrons.

4.  Each Hogwarts House has its own traditions. For example: Gryffindor's practice swordplay as a way to teach discipline, while Hufflepuffs tend to join multiple different societies leading to a maze of loyalties that virtually no outsider can ever figure out.

5.  Sirius Black is in a long-term, magically induced coma in the Janus Thickey Ward of St. Mungo's.

6.  It is unclear whether the Betrayer of the Potters was Peter Pettigrew, Sirius Black or known werewolf Remus Lupin.

7.  Oct 18 1981 was the last time Remus Lupin was seen in Brittania, though rumors place him somewhere in the South Americas or Africa.

8.  No one knows who any of the Death Eaters were, except for the ones killed/captured (though Snape was still Dumbledore's spy, it just never became known).

9.  Lucius Malfoy started (in 1983) an organization whose purpose is to help integrate Muggleborns into Wizarding Society, teaching them the traditions of the new culture to which they are now entering. They have been in charge of informing Muggleborns of magic and leading them to Diagon Alley/Platform 9 3/4 since 1985.

10. While not a supremely powerful wizard, Peter Pettigrew (before his disappearance in 1981) was a /highly/ gifted researcher.

11. I already know what the last sentence will be.

12. It is technically a crossover/fusion with Robert E. Howard's Kull of Atlantis/Conan of Cimmeria/Solomon Kane stories, though none of those characters are involved.

13. While Ancient Runes can be used to help tie conflicting/incompatible enchantments together, they are not needed for the creation of artifacts or protective enchantments.

14. Spellscribing does not require Arithmancy or Ancient Runes.

15. It will most likely never be written.

**** Hermione: Not entirely sure on the details on all of her going ons, but is a Hufflepuff and has had an on-again/off-again with Draco Malfoy (who, as you can probably guess from number 9 /is not/ a pureblood-supremecist twat). More of a background character, but would have more prominence in Year 6.

Ron: Still a Gryffindor, would be main cast. Probably would be a skilled practicer of Divination (which would be a different take than canon, with some aspects blatantly stolen from enembee, Rent-a-Hero and Forging the Sword). Aspires to be a cursebreaker like his brother Bill, renowned for not only breaking the curses of the last (known) remaining Temple of Father Set (the Hyborian God of the deceased Stygian people) but being the only survivor of that expedition.

Harry: Main character. Start of the first book (tentatively titled: /Harry Potter and the Knights of Walpurgis/) deals with him struggling with the aftermath of Drawing Gryffindor's Sword, being the 5th year Gryffindor prefect while receiving a strange, unsigned invitation to the Shrieking Shack... Incredibly skilled at Dark Magic and Primal Magics.

Haven't decided who the third main cast person would be. Maybe a Slytherin?

** - AU where wizards discovered immortality around 700AD and all the most powerful witches and wizards of history are still alive, amidst a much larger wizarding society (AKA Lords of Magic).

- AU where wizards discovered "self-spelling wands" (i.e. the ability to automate magic) in the 1800s, leading to a magical industrial revolution. Wizardry shifts to become more about being magical engineers than casting magic yourself. Steampunky world. Voldemort is an extremist who is particularly talented with the wanded magic that society has largely discarded and seeks to return the wizarding world to what it used to be, with wizards casting their own magic once more.

- AU where the Statute of Secrecy was never passed and wizards are known to exist, though most Muggles will still never interact with one unless they move in the highest circles of society. Wizards occupy a privileged position in society and represent the political and financial elite. Teen drama storyline amongst the magical elite, showcasing this society. Harry Potter meets Gossip Girl meets Bartimaeus Trilogy.

** Akira (movie version) crossed with Harry Potter, where Tetsuo is embodied by Luna Lovegood. The original Akira-esque powerhouse would be Ariana Dumbledore.

The Department of Mysteries was researching that whole 'magic is intent' concept, and trying to liberate the mind from all constraints on reality-bending. Their experiments resulted in Ariana erasing Atlantis from history, so they shut down the project. Some of their top researchers in later generations, Xeno and Pandora Lovegood, rediscovered the materials and worked on their own in secret.

What they created was a monster, capable of warping reality by the worst imaginings of her 'id' whenever the constraints were broken. This is Luna. Pandora died putting the breakers on her mind in place, but every once in a while Luna's cage is broken, and something horrible is let loose.

For instance, the Weasleys used to have ten kids (and people wonder why Molly is so protective).

Albus and Flitwick are aware. Trelawney can sense it but is incapable of predicting around Luna's actions- Sybill fears the little girl for that. Xeno just tries to distract his daughter with safe, fanciful notions and conspiracy-politics; things she can dream about without accidentally enacting them. Her reality-bending doesn't work subtle-ly, usually. She can convert a mob of muggles into a zombie apocalypse, but her urges aren't fine-tuned enough to warp a government. The runic puzzles in the Quibbler are meant to train her mind to reinforce the cage. Other readers just find them challenging and occasionally inspirational.

It's when Harry makes the run at the Ministry to 'save Sirius' that Luna is pushed beyond her controls. Bad things keep happening to these new friends of hers. When she finds Harry being possessed by Voldemort in the Atrium, things... happen. The rising Dark Lord loses some of his significance. Even if he can rebuild another body, he's really considering holding off for a bit. Maybe just fall back on possessing Nagini and taking a nice long holiday in Rwanda.

Harry is the Kaneda in this- the sane friend just trying to help, that may eventually have to put Luna down like a mad dog, if he can only find a weapon powerful enough to defeat her.

** Here is one that I keep throwing around in my head.

There have been a lot of magic traditions, mostly defined by their language use, before the christian rule of Europe. Norse, Celtic, Uralic, Latin, Greek, Egyptian, Persian,... .In this AU, wizards and witches of these other traditions have realized the threat of monotheistic religions to their cultures and counteracted. Hogwarts in the 20th century is a melting pot of Mercian, Danelaw, Norse and Scottish students. Durmstrang is mainly Norse and Uralic. Beauxbatons is the equivalent for the Latin tradition left by the Romans. There are much more schools of magic founded after those three, covering Germanic, Greek and many more cultures. Magic remains diverse, but progress is halted due to the lack of effective intercultural exchange. Muggles have experienced a second Dark Age during which the northern tribes and kingdoms pushed back the influence of Rome by using their tools of liturgy and priesthood, and established a "heathen culture belt" featuring a unified pantheon of several cultures north of the alps. This slowed any progress down for roughly another thousand years, making the year 2000 still part of what would be called medieval times. It also contained the spread of Islam due to the pushback of established beliefs in Egypt and the regions of Euphrat and Tigris, as well as the Byzantine Empire along the mediterranen coast. Contained to Mekka and Medina, The Golden Age of Islam never happened and the basic principles of modern day mathematics, astronomy, medicine wouldn't be developed for ages to come. The Statute was never enforced, given the central position of witches and wizards in a lot of the belief systems now prevalent.

No idea what kind of plot I'd put into that AU, but there it is...

*** Very interesting AU, though I'd argue that simply having a different prevalent culture would not have slowed down the march of scientific progress overmuch; it could possibly even be the opposite depending on how you spin things. Rather, it just would have gotten there differently. Like, would Newton still have been born and invented calculus, but as a "heathen" rather than a christian?

The real differences would be in the realm of social progress. Imagine, would the Reformation ever have happened if Martin Luther was a "heathen" rather than a christian? Would he have reformed the "heathen" religions instead?

Those kinds of societal changes are what would make that AU extremely interesting, otherwise you may as well write a straight up medieval AU where Hogwarts was founded in the first century and all the characters and plot are running around during the Norman invasion. That's a pretty interesting idea all on its own actually.

The same principal applies to all those middle-eastern scholars in Bagdad that applies to Newton. They just as well may have preserved and advanced science and math as heathens rather than as muslims.

I doubt you meant to and I don't want to turn this into a religious debate, but you're making it sound like you think polytheists are somehow less capable of preserving and advancing knowledge than monotheists. All it takes to prove otherwise is to look at the advancements of the Roman Empire and others like China.

Additionally the peoples of Northern Europe were as smart as anyone else and the Dark Ages weren't as dark as people make them out to be. It was more to do with the Plague and political disorder caused by the fall of Rome than any sort of social or scientific regress.

Granted, I have not written down a word of it, so the whole things is really just transforming constantly. I think my assumption, originally, was that the heathen onslaught was also coupled with a cultural cleansing. Burning the monestaries, burning the libraries, leveling churches, in order to "cleanse" the lands of christian influences. Its completely valid that they may have looked through the parchments a bit before burning them.

Aaanyway, I'll see if this goes anywhere. If it does I'll do a whole lot of research on the subject and erase little inconsistencies like that.

Yeah, definitely. Like, what would the Americas look like? Would the Aztecs, Inca, and Iroquois still be major powers? Would the Norse have continued colonizing North America and have us all celebrating Leif Erickson Day rather than Columbus Day? Would the World Wars even happen in any recognizable form?

The Balrog begins to reawaken the goblins' true nature and starts turning Gringotts into Moria 2.0. Auror Harry Potter is dispatched to enter the locked doors of the bank, find out what has happened, and neutralise any threat to the Ministry.

As for who it would be centered on, I don't know. There's another AU fic I have an idea for that I'm thinking of combining with the Dark!Trio idea. The bare bones of that AU is both Dumbledore and Voldemort are portrayed as more grey characters and Voldemort is a lot smarter/clever than in canon. Both Dumbledore and Voldemort are acting for what they believe is right, but taking dubious actions in order to get there. That'd be one portion of the plot. Another section of the plot is Rita Skeeter as an investigative journalist trying to piece together what is going on. She'd be writing her own articles and digging through archives and such to figure out who's doing what (I don't want to give too much away here because I'm seriously considering having this as my next big project, but Voldemort would be a much more complex character than in canon and merit Rita doing research on him). So back to who it would be centered on...to be honest, I'm not sure. Right now, if I end up combining the Dark!Trio idea with my political shenanigans AU, it'd kind of be like in Game of Thrones where you have a large cast of characters who swap off narrating. I think that's the only way I would really be able to capture all of the different subplots. I don't know if this would be something people would actually want to read, and it would take a lot of planning to write it well, but let me know if this is something you'd want to see written.
