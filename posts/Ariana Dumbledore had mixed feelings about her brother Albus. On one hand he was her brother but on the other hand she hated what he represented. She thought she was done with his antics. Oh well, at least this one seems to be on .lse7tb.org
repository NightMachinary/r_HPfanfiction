#+TITLE: Ariana Dumbledore had mixed feelings about her brother Albus. On one hand he was her brother but on the other hand she hated what he represented. She thought she was done with his antics. Oh well, at least this one seems to be on the right path.

Basically the Order of the Phoenix is losing and really needs a hero so they do the spell and what not but instead of Harry they get very powerful old witch a few years younger than Dumbledore named Ariana is who they get.

Except in this universe Ariana is a magical prodigy and never had a reason to become an obscures (did I spell that correctly) so she was never there to dies and break up the three way duel. The duel still happens because Aberforth is angry Albus is choosing Gellert over his own family.

Grindelwald is a little smarter and chooses not to use unforgivables (or has already manipulated Albus too much for him to care) so Aberforth loses the duel. Either way Albus chooses Gellert in the end and they were knows as “the Dark Lords Grindelwald and Dumbledore”.

So there you go. Maybe it's Ariana who eventually takes down Albus and Gellert in then end.


** I'm not all up to date on the implications from Fantastic Beasts, but is it canon that Ariana was an obscuras (sp)?

I thought becoming one required years and years of repression and abuse, not a single - horrible and traumatizing as it may have been - interaction with muggle children.

*** Yeah. I'm not up to date with Fantastic Beasts either.

Didn't the muggle children bully her or something. Which is the reason Percival is in Azkaban. You know for hurting the muggle children.
