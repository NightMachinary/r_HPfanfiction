I recently just posted my own fanfiction just to give it a try. But even though I love the ideas in my head it just sounds so cringe when I read it. It's honestly a weird dichotomy and its confusing. I hope it's just my grammar and not anything else.


** Is it just me who enjoys reading his own stories then? I get a kick out of the mistakes I made and honestly, I enjoy what I created. None of my stories are masterpieces but I am proud nonetheless.

*** Same! I love reading my older works over. I have a persistent universe and it's good practice to remind myself of what's happened in other stories before adding a new one. Sometimes I'll run across a reference that will inspire a new story. Sometimes I even dare to pay myself on the back with how a scene or bit of dialogue came out.

Same applies to you too. Your work isn't probably a masterpiece either but you created a story and put it out there. You should be proud of yourself.

****** Well, start by realising you actually wrote a story, which means you wrote more than most people do. You may or may not have the talent, I wouldn't know, but you have the drive and desire to follow your dreams, big or small.

That's an accomplishment. I say be proud, and if you are inclined to, listen to wise counsel of a good betas and other writers to improve yourself.

** I actually enjoy rereading old stories of mine, because I write much too much to remember it all, and so it's like discovering new stories that are entirely to my taste. Of course, whenever there's something stupid, I cringe a little bit at my past self's forgotten blunder, but oh well.

** Nothing is ever going to be as good on paper as the vague idealized story you have in your head. When you write it down, you come face to face with the reality that writing is a skill you have to work at, and that having read a lot of books doesn't magically turn into knowing how to write one. But the more you do it, the more rough edges in your work get smoothed away.

Grammarly can help if what's bugging you right now is mechanics. It's not perfect, but it's better than a lot of beta readers turn out to be.

And, yeah, I hate reading my old stuff. A handful of short things I can take, but by and large once it's complete, I'm done with it. Because every story you write improves your craft, something 2 or 3 years old is painful to read, at least for me.

Perky people suggest seeing the shift in your skills as proof of your improvement, and perhaps that mindset will work for you.

Such an interesting promise, a starting point that I rarely see in fanfics. It introduces certain characters far earlier and in a different context. Steers Harry towards certain interesting skills and ideas. But it is so poorly written.

** I like rereading my fanfic stories; though I do have to force myself not to rewrite things. I am proud of the works written by my inexperienced hand. They are by no means exceptional, but readers of 'free fanfiction' should not expect that. Reviews and comments from those who have read beyond the story summary and past the first few chapters have generally been favorable. Writing is a craft, like anything else, and skills will develop with dedication and practice. JKR provided some insights into writing: [[https://www.jkrowling.com/answers/]]

** Personally, it depends on the story. Most of my published stories are shorter (3k-5k) so it's a quick little read that I can find grammar issues with but fix them as I read. I enjoy going through and seeing how my style has developed.

​

On the other hand, my longest (and more popular) story is straight trash. I hate it. I think the plot is awful and see tons of plot holes. I got favorable reviews and people seem to enjoy it which is the only thing keeping me from taking it down.

*** I have a complicated relationship with my longest fic of the ones I've written. Like the first 2-4 chapters are crap, IMO. The timeline's completely wrong and compressed to the point where it actually making sense would require violating the laws of physics, the actual sequence of events is boring, and the character development is next to nonexistent. But it has some other chapters that I'm particularly proud of, especially one or two near the very end. But over the whole course of it, character development seems to be something that I utterly failed at with pretty much everyone except my main character.

Multiple times over the years I've sat down to try and rewrite it, but I can never get something I'm satisfied with.
