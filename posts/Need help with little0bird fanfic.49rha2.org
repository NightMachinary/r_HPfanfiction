As I've mentioned in other threads, I've really gotten into little0bird's post Battle of Hogwarts. I'm almost done with the Ron/Hermione specific one but had a question.

SPOILER AHEAD

During the first two big books, the big drama between Harry and Ginny is whether she is ready to commit to him after she graduates and move in to his flat. Also Harry is possibly set for an investigation into his use of an Unforgivable Curse. The second book ends and they move on to other stories, but I don't think they resolved those two story lines. (Obviously we know what happens since they marry and Harry rises to head the Auror Department).

Am I missing it or did she not conclude that plot line?


** Isn't there a time gap between when More than Words ends and when the next longer fic, "Burning Down the House" picks up? Couldn't both storylines have been resolved in the interim?

Little0bird's writing can be a little more episodic, and it sometimes feels more like a TV show (or real life) rather than a novel with a defined end and beginning. In real life, all of your plotlines don't wrap up at once, and the story doesn't end when you say "I do."

*** There's actually a bunch of single chapter stories that take place between More Than Words and Burning Down the House. One is when Harry proposes to Ginny.

It just seems like she ended More Than Words before wrapping up those two plot lines, which were very specific to to More Than Words.

**** Yes, but they're much shorter one-off fics. I mean the next novel-length fic is Burning Down the House, which doesn't pick up until several years later.

***** Yes, you're right. My point is just I thought it odd that the main plot line of More Than Words was not resolved. I thought maybe I missed it in the short stories before Burning Down the House.

Many of the short stories were obviously singular events like marriage proposal or date nights.

** So this fan fic sounds really interesting. Is there a place with all Little0bird's work. I found More the Words on fanfiction.com.

*** All of them are on fanfiction.net [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][here]].

There's a recommended order if you want to read them in chronological order, though most of them can be read independently.

** If I'm not mistaken, More Than Words is /not/ marked complete on FFNet so the author has yet to conclude it
