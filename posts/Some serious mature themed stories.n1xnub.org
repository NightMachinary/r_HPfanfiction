If anyone knows some serious HP fanfics, could you please recommend me some. Pls have some romance in there with not a lot of humor cuz these are the ones I'm only finding. I've read honour thy blood and liked it a lot and I need more


** I'm always reluctant recommending Manacled.... It's very well written and I enjoy it a lot but it has dark, nsfw themes and a heavy story. But if that's what your looking for then Manacled is very good. Just mind yourself. (Linkao3(Manacled by Seniylu))

Antithesis is also very dark and heavy but a good read. Linkao3(Antithesis). Just read some craic Fics afterwards üòä.

Linkao3(Blackpool by TheDivineComedian) is fantastic. All their stories balance on the edge of dark and drama and are overall wonderful.

Linkao3(The Art of Getting By by Sarewolf) isnt so much dark as angsty but wonderfully so. A lot of heavy emotion and responsibility and worry.

Linkao3(First Blood by JanuaryGrey) sees Sirius getting captured by DeathEaters if you want some whump.

Linkao3(Let Slip the Dogs of War by itallstartedwithdefenestration) is a dark fic with a lot of manipulation, unhealthy relationships and drama. Again, read something happy afterwards üòä.

.... I also like more dark, mature stories üòã. Just mind yourself üòä

**** Not a stupid question üòä

Yap. Its completely.

There are three arcs within the story. So the first third of the book is very different to the second which is very different to the last.

Like I said before, the opening third is very dark and heavy. If you're going to read it,mind yourself. The second and third arcs are relatively lighter.

Equipped with only her will, her wit, and her medical aptitude, she must survive in a foreign world where dangers lurk around every corner.

I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?
