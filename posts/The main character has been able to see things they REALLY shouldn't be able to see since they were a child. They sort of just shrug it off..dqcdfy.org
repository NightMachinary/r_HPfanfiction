Think of Hermione Granger, Demonologist except instead of demons it's eldritch horrors from the deep and in the main characters opinion they're VERY good boys, oh yes.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.
