:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been trying to remember the title or specifics of this fic for a while now. Essentially, pollution is causing magic to slowly stop working, and Hermione comes up with a ritual that restores it by fixing the pollution somehow. I know this is a horribly vague description, but this has been bugging me for a while now and I'm desperate. Thanks in advance!


** You might be thinking of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4787480][Golden Age]] by zeitgeistic. Either way, it's a damn good fic.

  The Celtic druids once made a decision that kept magic in abundance in Britannia, but they couldn't account for the technological advances Muggles would make centuries later. Now magic is dying on the isles, and this is not a dark lord that Harry can fight. OR: Harry Potter doesn't save the world this time, but he does get a lot of hugs.
