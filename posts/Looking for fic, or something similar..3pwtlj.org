**** I'm sorry, I don't quite understand your comment! Are you searching for the same fic as OP, adding to what I remember of a similar fic, or something else? If you're looking for the fic you're talking about, I'm sorry to say I don't remember the title or author. I wasn't interested in it so I didn't finish.

***** Adding. The fic (I think) you are talking about is linkffn(Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord). But I'm not sure. It's a fic I liked a lot. Also has a WIP sequel, if I remember correctly.
