I mean, there are tons of deatheaters, usually between 30-300 in fanfiction and cannon, yet I can't recall one fanficion where the bad guys rob a few muggle banks; They don't care about the statue of secrecy after all, hell they unleash giants on muggles in cannon!

I guess it's /possible/ that wizards behind the scenes put up anti-appartion/portkey wards, but somehow I doubt it with all the bigotry/ignorance in the ministery when it concerns muggles.

I for one would love to see a Harry Potter fanfiction where Harry or some other character, while a wizard, does some of the things like in the book "Jumper" (a novel about a teleporter that robs a bank among other things)


** The recently completed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina][Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina]] features a master of apparition and disappariton jinxes/wards who, among other things, apparates into peoples houses and turns their clothing into portkeys that are set to activate whenever Death Eaters are nearby.

The story is set before Harry goes to Hogwarts and revolves mainly around the Black family.

** Apparition is used as a weapon twiceish in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]], but the fic is not at all centered around teleporting. Note PotDK is very long and not finished.

** Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776013/1/Blood-of-the-Phoenix][Blood of the Phoenix]]

#+begin_quote
  A unique visitor during the summer rewrites Harry's world and sets him on the path to Voldemort's ultimate destruction. Takes place during Order of the Phoenix.

Harry develops (I won't tell how, because spoilers) phoenix's flame-teleporting ability, and it features prominently in this story. Also, some stuff on learning apparating, tracking, etc.

EDIT: Wait, Jumper is also a novel? Huh, nice. Need to read it now.

*** I'll give it a go thanks, seems the best recommendation yet.

As to Jumper, it's an absolutely fantastic novel, works as a stand alone, though it's actually a series, and one of my favorites.

Starts with "Jumper", next is "jumper Reflex", next is "shade", then "Impulse".

There's also a novel based on the movie adaptation of Jumper 1, (Confusing eh? A novel based on a movie based on the first novel, and the same author wrote both novels) (Called "Jumper: Griffin's story") which is quite different from the first, and has pretty much no relation to the normal series other than the teleporting power. Still a decent novel, but not as good as the regular series.

All of it's written by a fantastic Scifi writer Steven Gould, who also wrote one of my other favorite scifi novels, Wildside where people find a gateway to an alternate Earth and basically mine the shit out of it to get rich, but then the government finds out, always a bad thing)

**** Yup, I've seen the movie, and I really liked it, but I never knew there were novels. I'll be sure to check this out, thanks.

***** Well, let me just say that the movies were somewhat disappointing to Jumper and Jumper Reflex, (the only two books that were out before the movie), the series is much better, the main character is an adult for most of the novel too, and it's a slight bit darker, instead of fighting people that hate jumpers, he eventually fights terrorists. In fact, it isn't until the second novel that anyone knows about teleporters, the first novel only has one, and there are only 3 Jumpers by the end of the series.

**** Glad you liked it. If you haven't noticed, there's also a sequel, though it's not very regularly updated. Nonetheless, at least it is not abandoned.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8532802/1/Hero-Harry][Hero Harry]], and its prequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal-Harry][Brutal Harry]], involve a Harry who's only goal is survival after his uncle almost kills him by bending a golf club around his head, nearly killing him. As the name suggests, he brutally takes advantage of his powers and the rules of battle. One of the most important of which is, of course, maneuverability. He uses all forms of movement to the fullest extent, brooms and apparition alike.

*** I was really into this story and the sequel right up until it started a massive preach fest right near the end -/- kudos to the author for not just leaving us with strawman arguments and making the atheist in this story a decent human being. But it was wildly out of place and left a sour taste in my mouth. If I wanted a theological discussion I'd have one with a Christian friend. Not read about one in a fantasy story about wizards ffs -/-

** Early on in "The Ties That Bind" - A Harry/Ginny soul-bond fic learn how to Teleport (different than apparate) in Hogwarts and use it a lot, much to the chagrin of Professor McGonagall.
