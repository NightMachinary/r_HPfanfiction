I'm getting a bit bored of weasley bashing, so any fics that go the other way and power up Ron (preferably only Ron) would be a nice change of pace.

Thanks.

** I've written a story where he starts mostly normal and ends up a hero with a knack for fighting and tactics, both command and commando, and more battles under his belt than Harry at the end. It's set post-Hogwarts in an AU though, and he uses muggle weapons as well as magic to fight. The other Weasleys have a good showing as well, especially Percy and Ginny.

**** Fire away. Though I have to point out that the story's more than one year old and I'm currently writing two weekly stories, so odds are I'm not going to spend much time changing anything. If I wrote the story today, I'd cut a lot from the earliest chapters, especially 2, 3 and 4, and integrated the Prologue into the main story so readers who don't bother reading that short story before reading the main story would know just how corrupt and fucked up Wizarding Britain after Voldemort was.

***** Great! So the main problem I have is that the entire story feels too straightforward with not enough setbacks. There's two main ways to continue the plot you can use: either solve the current problem and then reveal a new, bigger one (the one you ended up using) or have the main characters fail to fully resolve the current problem. Using either of them too much detracts from the story, because either it feels like the main characters just roll over everyone or they never succeed.

In your story, there's never really a point where I felt like the main characters were going to fail their current objective and it would /cost them/. The enemies felt too weak, there wasn't enough bad luck to make up for the good luck, all their plans worked, and from start to finish there was never a clear line where on one side they've won and on the other they've lost, just a series of 'objective complete' points. There was also not enough variation in the subplots - it was always "[new country] also has evil wizards oppressing good wizards, we need to help, we don't have enough military power, let's train their people, yay we win" - I don't mean that in a demeaning way, it's a good plot to use once or even twice, but when it's repeated too often it loses its impact, like any other plot.

The bad guys also never learn or come back stronger. They are often left holding the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][Idiot Ball]], to the extent that it's unclear how they could ever have had any political might in the past. Again, it's fine in moderation, but you relied on it too much.

This next part is probably more a conscious decision than a flaw, but I also think you wrote the main characters as incredibly brutal without any of the consequences flowing from that behaviour showing up. Throughout history, that pattern of ruthlessness has generally led to some incredibly horrible situations - I actually can't think of any cases where it was justified and turned out to be for the best. The nearest analogy is, of course, the French Revolution, which originally had the best intentions, but led to the leaders becoming corrupted by power and infighting. The lack of any significant power struggles on the 'good' side, not just within the UK but also internationally, was particularly bad for my suspension of disbelief, although I'm not sure how much it will have impacted others - I significantly have more interest in and knowledge of similar historic situations than most people, I expect.

Overall, it was a nice story, and still enjoyable, but these are the things that stopped it from being perfect for me. I'm not sure whether similar flaws are in your other stories, since I don't think I've read them, but it might be worth bearing in mind - particularly the first three paragraphs, since the 4th one is largely a matter of genre rather than writing techniques.

****** Thanks for the feedback :) You've correctly pointed out a number of points, though a couple were designed that way, so to speak.

I styled the war after real wars. In WW2, as the most famous conflict, the Axis powers had lost the war in December 1941. The only questions left after the USA entered the war was when Germany and Japan would be defeated, and how many soldiers the allies would lose. That the axis powers would be defeated was never in doubt. In this story, the pureblood regimes had lost when their invasion failed. After that, they had no chance to win anymore, since they hadn't the numerical advantage anymore to try again, couldn't match magic and technology with their magic alone, and the British were building up. That's why there's a series of objective, but no "We need to win this, or we have lost" final battle for the good guys. Though I do hope that people still care about who lives and dies in the story. They certainly do when watching and reading about WW2, even though everyone knows how that war ended. So, yes, the bad guys getting weaker and weaker - though there were exceptions, the Russians managed to hold the British off after all - was intended. I didn't want a desperate struggle against an evenly matched foe, I wanted a WW2-style crushing and inevitable defeat of the axis of evil, where the only question was who among the soldiers at the front would survive. (And I was foiled by my own characters when the Tsar found a political/diplomatic way to stop the British from invading Russia. I hadn't planned that, but it was a logical move the Tsar would make.)

With regards to the idiot ball holding, it's not as if the purebloods are that stupid, but they're caught in a trap. In order to beat a country that's using magic and technology, they would have needed to use technology and magic as well. But without muggleborns, they wouldn't have been able to use technology, and if they got the muggleborns to help, then they would be giving up the whole reason they were waging war in the first place: to preserve pureblood dominance. (The Tsar mentions that when one of his generals asks to arm up with muggle weapons as well. His reaction os the same as the reaction of the Confederated government to an officer's proposal to arm Black slaves in the ACW.)

So, it's not as much as they are holding the idiot ball - the Russians, for example adapt their layered shields, rendering them immune to the RPG used against them before, and the Freikorps had some nasty tactics to counter the Muggleborn Movement's guns - but they were fundamentally unable to win while preserving what they were fighting for in the first place. They were in power in the first place because they kept the muggleborns down and had a numerical advantage. Their magic advantage also served them well, until the technological advances in the 20th century were big enough to counter that. But, as you suspect: With the muggleborn numbers rising, they would have lost their power sooner or later anyway. Grindelwald almost managed it - like Napoleon - but his defeat bought the Purebloods another 50 years, a bit like Metternich's era in the 19th century. As mentioned, the Tsar managed to defend his country from a British invasion using a political move Harry and co. couldn't counter even though they basically guessed his plan. (Also, they didn't train the Germans, or the Russian Revolutionaries. The Bulgarians had some help - 4 British Muggles - but did most of it themselves. The Poles too, did most themselves, though they had Military help as well.)

But ultimately, the pureblood bigots were on the wrong side of history, and doomed from the start.

With regards to the lack of power struggles, I once again took history as an example. When WW1 started, all the internal struggles did, if not vanish, at least get reduced very significantly. The socialists who had opposed the war before joined the army. The Kaiser could say that he didn't see socialists or conservatives anymore, but solely Germans. But once the war was going badly, the internal struggles started again, and entire Empires crumbled because of it. The same happened in the story; faced with most of Magical Europe attacking them, the British decided to shelf their differences and defend their country. Neville, Ginny and co. joined then and there too. The other nations started with similar patriotism, but as they didn't fare as well in the war, insurgencies and revolutions started. Like in WW1.

With regards to the subplots, I tried to vary them. France tried to use their mudbloods as cannon fodder, and when they deserted, tried to use hostages to make them surrender. Germany was wrecked with a three-way civil war with the roots dating back to Grindelwald. Russia was facing an actual red revolution. Bulgaria somehow had an accidnetal revolution. Poland simply wanted to kick the Russians out, kicking their own government down was a step in that. But most of Europe was involved in the war from day one; Britain simply had to take them out one by one. A sort of Island Hopping campaign, if you want to, though it was really more like everyone jumping on the revolutionary bandwagon, and Britain being forced to help where they could. But yes, it was turning out "more of the same", hence I ended the story with the war in Europe ending, though a few readers wanted to see Asia, America and the Middle East.

With regards to the brutality, I have to point out that they didn't do anything worse, and actually were less brutal towards civilians, than the Western Allies in WW2. And they were facing pureblood bigots bent on enslaving and murdering them - magical nazis in all but name. So, I'd say the nearest analogy is not the French Revolution, but WW2, with the difference that those "just following orders" and "Just helped the legal government" didn't get away at the Nuremberg Trials, but were judged as well. I don't really see why they should be suffering consequences the Western Allies didn't suffer either. Did it turn out for the best? I don't know. But it could have been far, far worse.

With regards to my other stories, I do write character-based stories. The plot is the result of characters acting and reacting to each other according to their means. In "Patron", Voldemort and Dumbledore were changed to live up to their reputations and both make plans that do not rely on the other side making mistakes or on coincidences. And both aim to have plans that advance their goals even if they fail, or at least have multiple objectives. Like Voldemort entering Harry into the Tournament - it's a distraction to keep Dumbledore busy so he can get revived without interference, but if Dumbledore's reputation suffers, or Harry dies in the process, that's even better. But he doesn't need Harry at all, and would never use a plan that relies on Harry winning the tournament, or someone fooling Dumbledore with polyjuice for a year. Dumbledore suspects that, but if he doesn't focus on protecting Harry, then he might lose the boy, and that would be a blow he cannot afford. On the other hand, Dumbledore later managed to take out one of Voldemort's Death Eaters, and blame Voldemort for it, costing him both the minion and wrecking his reputation among other purebloods. In that story, the outcome of the struggle is still open, since both of them are evenly matched.
