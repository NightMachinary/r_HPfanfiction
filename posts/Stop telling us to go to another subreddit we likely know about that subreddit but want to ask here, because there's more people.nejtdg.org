** Here's my hot take. I actually appreciate these comments. It's how I've found my way to specific subreddits so when I'm in the mood to read Harmony I can pop over there for recommendations. Can people be assholes about it? Sure, but these comments can be genuinely helpful for those that /are/ unaware of their existence.

*** Yes, I post these sorts of comments because I read slash and Dramione, and I don't want the OP to be discouraged by the dozens of downvotes, rude comments, or lack of a response. And because the Slash sub is one of the friendliest subs ever, so I want to make sure everyone who is interested knows a better resource.

*** There's already a list of related subreddits in the sidebar.

But in any case, the comments seem to be mostly coming from people who don't know anything about the specific request in question. It's very rarely "here are some of my favourites, and you might find more if you ask on this sub." It's usually comments from people who don't read that sort of fic anyway and aren't interested in it, which is why it comes across as trying to get rid of the OP. It comes across as "I don't care, go ask someone who does."

And I do understand why the majority of redditors are coming from, but with every slash post we put up, we always get a comment saying ‚Äúgo to the slash reddit‚Äù. Like no shit? I mean, the first time I got a comment on my post like that was useful, but after every post I put up with the same response and nothing else in contribution, it feels like the slash community (myself included) are just getting shoved into the corner of shame.

The purpose of the analogy is not in the hammer itself, but on the customer and the employee.

I definitely haven't had as much outright discrimination as others so I'm lucky in that way.

I do think that you're maybe taking the analogy at face value a bit too much considering the topic of this thread has overwhelmingly been about slash fics in the top posts, but maybe that's only as obvious after the fact and it was more ambiguous when they commented it.

With subs like this any potentially veiled homophobia makes me a bit wary though, because you can very clearly see people either saying openly offensive things or just alluding to them without stating it clearly. It's hard to give people the benefit of the doubt in this environment-- doing things your way lets people get away with a lot of iffy sentiments.

Even looking back at everyone's comments in this thread, it's easy to analyse how everyone reacted and their different view points in retrospect. I don't want to get into a stupid internet argument over something so tricky when I'm sure this would be a non-issue if this was all said in person. I have no issue with calling out actual homophobia (just go look at one of the most heavily downvoted top-level comments) but having a go at someone for making a humorous analogy felt like it was taking it too far for me.
