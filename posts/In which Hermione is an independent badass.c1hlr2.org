I'm on the hunt for fics in which Hermione is a total loner badass. Maybe Ron and Harry never saved her from the troll. Maybe she was sorted into a different house. Maybe she joined a different group of friends entirely. I don't really care. I just want to read about Hermione being an intelligent, cunning, clever muggleborn witch... but without any of her canon friends by her side. Love ron and harry, but not really in the mood for them. Tbh i just want to watch Hermione go above and beyond to achieve greatness while the world is set on fire around her... I don't really like character bashing (Dumbledore is the exception because honestly those fics are inevitable at this point and im used to it), nor do I want her to be a generic “strong independent woman who don't need no man” trope. Yeah, that's pretty much it. I really appreciate this you guys, thank you!!

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): At least in the beginning, she founded her guerrilla group and killed boatloads of Death Eaters without Harry and Ron's involvements. As the war goes on, she does needs allies and has to coordinate their efforts. Voldemort is in a league of his own and much more dangerous than in canon.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** Maybe Hermione isn't a loner here, but this is all about her going out into the world and doing whatever the fuck she wants. Roman Holiday and the two accompanying fics are old favorites of mine. I really should save them, but here is a link to Roman Holiday on the wayback machine:

** (edit) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11132624/1/Persephone]] since I tagged the wrong one originally.

linkffn(Six Pomegranate Seeds)

These are both pretty dark, but show Hermione as a badass (but not really one with a moral compass in Persephone). Seselt is personally one of my favorite fanfic writers. Attention to detail, magical world building, inventive magic system- this author has it all. In both of these stories, Hermione is goal oriented and operates on her own.

  Better to be the right hand of the devil than in his path. Better still to be the consort of Hades than a part of his collection of souls. Ten years after Voldemort has won the war, Hermione reaches a breaking point and shreds the flow of time to change her future. If she can't change the world, she will change her place in it. - Extremely dark Tomione/Volmione. Warnings inside.

** So... you want canon Hermione? Just without Harry and Ron?

Not only that, you want her to have been able to save herself from the troll? As a first year?

She does literally everything you described in canon. Harry and Ron don't validate her at all, so not sure where you're going with that. This is a ridiculous request.
