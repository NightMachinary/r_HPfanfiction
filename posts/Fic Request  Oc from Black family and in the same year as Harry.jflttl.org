Probably something similar to the Star Chronicle series by NileRivers94, That series with Leo Black. Anyway, been searching for days and I really want to find one!

Edit: To clear things up, I'm looking for male OC's only, I am sick of only seeing female ones and want to read something else for once.


** I'm actually writing a fanfic with a Black OC that is a year older than Harry. Although he's not the absolute protagonist! If it's the same for you you can try and check it out.

Tell me what you think about it, concrit is well received.

  Bellona de Poitiers begins her time at Hogwarts as an interloper for her French accent, for her Veela's blood, for the absence of her father.Hogwarts is not the haven she expected, though, and she quickly discovers that Slytherin is no true home to any interloper. With fewer friends than enemies, she does her best to keep her head down and muddle through safely.Then, just as she's about to return for third year, her father escapes from prison, and everything goes to hell.

** Sorry for the very late reply. But in this fic Regulus has a son that is raised by Orion and Walburga while Harry is raised by Sirius. I found it pretty good but its abandoned at around 120K words.
