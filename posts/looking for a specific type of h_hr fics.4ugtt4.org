So I just re-read linkffn(Error of Soul) and was reminded of how much I enjoyed that fic, especially compared to some of the absolutely awful soul-bond fics out there. So I'm wondering if anyone knows of anything similar, wherein Harry and Hermione are forced into either a soul-bond or marriage contract and aren't romantic partners from the start. Stanrick's Thresholds(linkffn(9649736)) is another example of this.

Not a fan of Weasley-bashing.

Thanks for the help!

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.
