looking for fics where Sirius succeeds in handing Peter into the ministry.


** I'd also like some. I've only read one thus far, the rest tend to "accidently" or purposely kill him.

Bonus points if Harry actually likes Sirus and they have a father / son type relationship instead of the the resentment on Harry's behalf.

** If Peter is captured in his Harry's 3rd year, then there would be no-one to help Voldemort and free Barty Crouch Jr. This would also mean:

- Harry isn't selected as a Tri-wizard champion(has a quiet year),

- Voldemort doesn't get resurrected,

- The ministry doesn't mistrust Dumbledore and Harry,

- Umbridge doesn't come to Hogwarts(has a quiet OWL year),

- Sirius doesn't die,

- The only drama Harry has in his 6th year is the HBP book,

- Draco Malfoy doesn't become a death eater,

- Without the pressure of Voldemort, Dumbledore decides to be more thorough with finding info on the horcrux's(and maybe a way to get the soul fragment out of Harry's scar),

- Harry goes hocrux hunting with Dumbledore in his 7th year,

- Harry realising he has a soul piece in his head look's for a way to get it out(has Dumbledore find a way) or alternatively he kills himself.

The end.

I doubt there are any authors who would go this route, they would probably deus ex machina a way for Voldemort to be resurected in Harry's 4th year.

*** They'd probably just have Barty Crouch Jr break his dad's imperius and then he either recruits someone to play Pettigrew's role or impersonates Moody. Or no Moody impersonation and they kidnap Harry the old fashioned way.

Then it's as you were.

***** All you'd have to do is say Crouch Jr is stronger his father and after enough time out of Azkaban, he'd recuperated enough to break it on his own.

I remember a story where they imperius'd/convinced Bertha Jorkins to help Voldy when they captured her to find out about the tournament.

** Excluding time travels, these fics have Wormtail captured before end of Year 3:

In 3 of the above 4 fics, Voldemort managed to find assistance from other Death Eaters and still managed to push through the TWT plot.

I have yet to find a story in which Voldemort got stuck in Albania for a long time and only came back much much later.

** in the they shook hands series Harry is a slytherin and the first 4 years have basically the same main overall story line but with different conclusions and and some other differences. The biggest differences start at the end of the fourth year and how Voldemort resurrection is handled without Pettigrew assisting him

** I believe that happened in one of White Squirrel's fics. Don't remember if it was /Arithmancer/ or /Animagus/, though. The result was that Crouch Jr. was the one to perform the resurrection ritual.
