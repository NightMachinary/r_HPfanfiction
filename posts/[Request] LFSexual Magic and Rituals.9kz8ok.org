** Harry Potter and the sword of Gryffindor. Larceny lechery and Luna lovegood --- not the main focus but it is one of the subplots.

** I remember once reading one that was like a video game? Every time Harry has sex with someone he levels up...can't remember the title or where I read it. Wasn't really my cup of tea

** There's a story where the main character redesigns the Dark Mark so that the follower's loyalty is enforced through pleasure rather than pain. The implanting of this Mark came with a very messy and enjoyable ritual.

#+begin_quote
  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10420833/1/Witchhiker-s-Guide-To-Beltane]]

Witchhiker's Guide To Beltane Â» Wizarding Britain, ten years after the war. Things are good, but the Ministry thinks what's needed is a good old fashioned Beltane revel. Hogwarts is just the place to do it. In the meantime, Severus isn't enjoying life right now; he's the subject of Rita Skeeter's new tell-all book. And don't get Hermione started on how Ron continues to make her life a misery. Rated MA for reasons

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1844462/1/The-Twenty]]

COMPLETE! Hermione and an unlikely Pansy form an elite group of witches, and possess one unusual commonality. Facing their most carnal desires, they will harness a power not seen in an age, to save themselves and protect Hogwarts. Can it stay a secret?

I avoided this one for quite a while because the summary didn't do it for me, but it's really very good.

**** Ah well, that happens.

Really he's Ann unrequited love interest, so there's much more focus on the sixth/seventh year girls. It's about the power of virginity and warding magic and unexpected friendships.

And Draco is an ass if that makes you feel better.
