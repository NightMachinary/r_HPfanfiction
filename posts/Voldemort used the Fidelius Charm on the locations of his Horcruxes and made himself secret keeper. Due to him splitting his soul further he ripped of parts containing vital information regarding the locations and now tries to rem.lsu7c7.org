** Comedic interpretation: person searching for their car keys, horcrux edition.

Horror interpretation: Voldemort is completely unkillable but suffers from ever-worsening dementia, making him less than a shadow of his former self. He exists in a perpetual state of confusion and incomprehension and the brief moments of lucidity only serve to remind him of what his hubris has cost him.

On mobile rn may come back to this later.

** That's why Harry is the only one with the power to defeat Voldemort- due to him being a Horcrux, he's the only one that can locate them. However, due to the small amount of soul in him he only holds enough info to find one, and he then has to convince that Horcrux to share the secret of the next one. Each horcrux know the location of one other.

**** Yep, I could definitely imagine how Harry trying to manipulate the Horcruxes into giving him the Secret could be played for laughs. Like, promising Nagini a rabbit in return for the Secret, which is something Nagini knows she shouldn't do but she's so /hungry/ and the rabbit is so /juicy/...

***** Yes, but I suspect Nagini would be the easiest to talk into giving away the secret. I just picture him running around with the diadem on his head having a weird telepathic argument or trying to get information out of the freaking cup.

Here's what I've got:

It had been a /long/ couple of days. Voldemort was a big enough man to admit that he /may/ have, /possibly,/ */ever so slightly.../* miscalculated. Being immortal wasn't enough. Not when you couldn't keep the means of your immortality secure. The Flamels were an abject lesson in that. Who knew a worm like Pettigrew would hold the solution to his conundrum?

Even he had to admit the Fidelius Charm was, perhaps, the ultimate protection a wizard could invoke. If the Potters hadn't trusted the secret to a treacherous coward they probably would've still been alive. Despite his best efforts, at that!

He quickly came upon a solution to the charm's one weakness - the Secret Keeper. Who better to trust than himself when it came to the role? Sure, if he were to die the locations of his Horcruxes would be forever lost to the world, but that wasn't something he'd need be concerned about, was it?

Only it hadn't worked out like that.

He'd decided to make /another/ Horcrux. /"One can never be/ too /immortal"/ he'd thought. In a twist of fate, a chance so low as to be astronomical, he'd sheared off the part of his soul that contained the secret of the Fidelius!

In all his time he'd never considered the core of the charm's function: /It hid a secret in the soul!/ This wasn't something you could /force/ yourself to remember. Not some piece of trivia to be written down! For all intents and purposes the information was lost to him. You couldn't just take a piece of soul and put it back!

He'd spent the following day in a frenzy, trying every conceivable method of recovering a series of locations that, as far as Magic was concerned, /didn't exist./ The tomes at his disposal were of no help at all. The Fidelius was such an obscure spell that it was never recorded. Pettigrew only knew how to perform the charm and was oblivious of it's inner workings.

In a pique of nervous energy he'd taken to storming over Malfoy Manor, checking every possible hiding place in the hope that he'd find /something/.

This did not escape the attention of his host.

"Might I be of service, my lord?"

Lucius was growing concerned over Voldemort's recent behavior. There'd been a certain tension in the way he spoke, a slight feeling of nervousness that colored all his interactions. Not to mention that he was currently rummaging through his sock drawer.

"I'm looking for the thing, Lucius."

"... The /thing,/ my lord?"

"/Yes, Lucius,/ I'm looking for /the thing/ that holds something very valuable to me and unless you can /provide assistance/ in that I recommend you /busy yourself elsewhere!/"

That sounded like a splendid idea!

"By your leave, then."

Maybe he'd move himself and Narcissa to one of the guest rooms for the time being.

Voldemort was growing desperate. He'd decided to retrace his steps, but that was no mean feat when those steps spanned a lifetime.

Wool's Orphanage was his first stop. The old ruin gave him no clues but he persevered. He revisited every place he frequented, every nook and cranny that were known only to him. It was when he revisited the seashore that he had his first breakthrough.

While walking around, trying to recall where the little field trip organized by the matron could've taken him, he suddenly found himself plummeting to the ocean. Voldemort was wet, battered, and filled with newfound confidence. He had his first target.

With a wicked gleam in his eye, he apparated back to Malfoy Manor. It was time to once again prove that nothing was safe from Lord Voldemort. Even if that thing was Lord Voldemort.

A month later had nothing but wasted parchment and a twitch in his eye to show for his efforts. It was unfortunate that his Inner Circle had elected this time to induct new members. It was especially unfortunate for a distant cousin of the Carrows who decided to introduce himself.

By the time the first word left that unfortunate soul, he had a manic Dark Lord bearing down on him with a crazy look in his eyes and his wand up one of his nostrils.

‚ÄúYOU!‚Äù he said ‚ÄúYou look like a clever young man. How do you find something that isn't there?‚Äù

The prospective Death Eater answered as best he could.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

How unfortunate.

‚ÄúThat isn't the answer to my question.‚Äù said the now irritated Dark Lord ‚ÄúTry again!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù Let it not be said the recruit wasn't consistent.

‚ÄúAre you daft, boy? Where are you from?!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚Äú'What' is not a country I've ever heard of. Do they speak English in ‚ÄòWhat'?!‚Äù

‚Äú... what?‚Äù

‚ÄúSay ‚Äòwhat' again! I dare you- I DOUBLE-DARE YOU! Say ‚Äòwhat' one more time!‚Äù

‚Äú... what ...‚Äù
