** Its not a trope, but I feel like authors became a bit more willing to leave the known shores and spread their stories out into the world. Maybe that was sparked by the announcement of Fantastic Beast, more or less giving the fandom the courage to go similar routes, or maybe it was just a natural development, but I for one saw much more of those this year.

*** I still don't quite understand Wrong Boy Who Lived. Does that mean Harry lived when he shouldn't? Or his brother or what?

**** Everyone believes someone other than the ACTUAL BWL is the BWL. Usually it's Harry's brother, where Harry is the real BWL.

***** I still want to read a WBWL story where /Harry/ is the WBWL and Neville or Harry's brother is the real BWL.

**** I almost never check the publish date, so I'm not sure if the ones I saw were published in 2016, but they seem to be recommended more often this year
