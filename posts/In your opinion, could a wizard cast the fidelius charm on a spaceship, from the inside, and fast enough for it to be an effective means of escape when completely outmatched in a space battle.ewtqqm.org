** I don't see why not. Though there's an argument to be made that a wizard can only cast the Fidelius Charm on his or her own "Secret." So it might have to be /his/ spaceship.

But a wizard talented enough to do it quickly can probably just cast protective spells on the ship to make it indestructible in the first place. Unless the other spaceships also have wizards.

** I've always felt that the casting of a Fidelius took a long time - like hours to days, which is why it isn't done flippantly. It takes dedicated time, resources, and focus. Known casters include Albus, James and/or Lily Potter, & Arthur and/or Bill Weasley.

*** Couldn't take days. Bill does one after the trio show up at Shell Cottage and it's up by the time Harry buries Dobby.

** So have you been reading linkffn('The Havok side of the Force') , have you? /Wink/.

If you haven't, do read it. Its a comedy/action crossover with Star wars that i would put on par with Nonjon's level of writing.

*** I was re-reading E. E. Doc Smith's Skylark Three, the bit where Seaton & co encounter the Fenachrone for the first time, and are so spectacularly outgunned that they have to switch on a forcefield that is utterly impenetrable in both directions, like a sort of pocket universe. Will certainly check out that fic though...

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

** I don't think so. A fidelius works by entrusting a secret to another person. The other person would have to be outside and away from the spaceship, for the concept of trusting that person to work. Magic works by conceptual and not physical laws.

** You don't really need a Fidelius. Normal invisibility and accelerating in a random direction should work just fine as escape method. Heck, black paint should work if the engine doesn't produce a glowing exhaust plume. Space is huge and it's easy to blend in with the background.

*** I'm assuming my opponent has magic or some tracking method where just running away wouldn't help. On a side note, black paint would be less than useless for hiding. It isn't remotely dark in space. Planets with atmospheres like our little rock are about the only places in the universe where you can actually find darkness. There is no background in space, only light in abundance. It looks dark because of contrast between stars, and because everything is really far apart and really small.

**** Olber's Paradox has been resolved. Space is mostly dark. Anything that emits or reflects just a small amount of light is brighter than the background and if it moves it's easily detectable. The area of space we're in is brighter than 99.99999999999999% of space.
