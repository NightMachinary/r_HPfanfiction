Several years ago, read a story in which Harry saves Draco from a quidditch player. It's post war/Hogwarts and told from Draco's POV.

Ginny isn't portrayed positively. She also has dark red hair in the fic. I remember Draco describing it.

Towards the end of the fic, Draco and Harry get engaged and go to a get-together of some sort and Ginny finds out they are engaged and throws a fit.

Any help?

It would likely have been on AO3 or FF.net.
