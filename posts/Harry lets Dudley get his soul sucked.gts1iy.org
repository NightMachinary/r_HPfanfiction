Basically the title: in the summer before fifth year, when the dementors come, Harry let's them eat Dudley's soul. The way I see it there are many possible ways of doing this: he could have left his wand in his bedroom, he could actually hate the Dursley's enough to deliberately let one of them die, he could have gone back before the dementors came and so wasn't there, he could have decided that having his wand snapped wasn't a price he would willing pay for Dudley's life, he could panic and just flee... there are so many possible reasons that I'm actually surprised there aren't many more stories in which this happens. Looking for fanfics in which this happens and the possible consequences of it.


** I remember one story I read had Harry visiting Hermione in London when the Dementor attack happened. Only it still happened in Little Whinging. Dudley got his soul sucked out. And he still got a notification of being expelled for casting a patronus charm, despite being nowhere near the area and not knowing how to cast the charm.

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE. A/N: Slytherin-Harry.

*** That sounds like the dumbest example of "stations-of-canon" imaginable.

**** It was acknowledged as a very clumsy attempt to silence Harry Potter that ended up making Fudge look even more idiotic than normal, when he /still/ tried him in front of the full Wizengamot. While it /is/ a "Stations-of-Canon," the stupidity is easily attributed to the characters, rather than the writer, IMO.

The whole fanfic is a somewhat long oneshot, and more than a little cracky, but it's mostly played for laughs.

***** Yeah. I was just thinking about how I wanted Harry who embodied malicious compliance so much that it just changes how he acts and reacts and I realized it was pretty cracky. I wanted a long, oneshot fic with humor and petty revenge in abundance within.

Typically, if it's an AU, then those defining moments of canon will usually change in some way even if you still use the basic outline of the scene itself. This was done as a way to show how inept Fudge is because he and Harry are in a somewhat silent war against each other's reputations, but I wanted to do it in a funny way. It started lightly with Sirius being freed when Harry called him out for Sirius and Hagrid's wrongful imprisonment, and then further wrongful imprisonment that made him look even worse, and then it evolved into trying to ruin each other in petty ways.

** Not quite what you were asking for as Dudley isn't the one who loses his soul, but Harry isn't able to save everybody from the dementors in On the Way to Greatness. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness]])

Chapter 11 has the scene.
