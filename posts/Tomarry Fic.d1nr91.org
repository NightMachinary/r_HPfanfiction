There's been this fic that I've been trying to find forever. It's when Harry grew up with Tom and fell in love throughout their Hogwarts years and after, then something happened to Harry and Tom went crazy. Harry was his Queen and Tom was the King. I know it's really vague and I appreciate any help. I'll also be grateful for any tomarry fic recs.


** Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well.

(/Happy Tomarry fan noises/)

** Is that the one with reincarnation and Harry was originally Henrik? If it is it could be Rebirth by Athey.

** Not sure what fic you're looking for, but here's a rec:

linkao3(12707139) One of my all-time favourite Tomarrys. Very AU. Great and refreshing characterisations.

**** Just a heads up because I think people should be aware when reading this fic, it's literally Grey's anatomy, there are huge scenes and chunks of dialogue taken straight from the show without any sort of acknowledgement from the author on which parts are not her writing. The plot follows Grey's anatomy storylines and characterizations throughout the whole fic right until the end, even though she claims it doesn't.

This isn't the only fic of hers that does this either, she has a tendency to borrow lines from shows/movies/books without any sort of credit/acknowledgement at all.

***** Hmm, well that certainly sucks. I've never seen Grey's Anatomy, so while I was aware that the fic was inspired by it, I hadn't known that there were literal scenes and dialogues cut from it. Damn.

****** Yeah, there's a lot taken, most of it word for word and then scenes that you can literally watch on YouTube and then read in the fic, if you've never seen the show. It crosses a line from'inspired' by in my opinion... Just too much is Grey's anatomy.

  Harry Potter is screwed.With a penchant for Firewhiskey and late-night parties, he had no idea that he would find a handsome man in his bed the next morning, when he wakes up; already late for his first day at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies as a Healer trainee. He also had no idea that his mom's ex-boyfriend would have an axe to grind, the most eager girl would follow him around like she'd been hit with a Permanent Sticking Charm, or that the handsome man in his bed that morning was his boss, Tom Marvolo Riddle, Head of Spell Damage.Like I said, Harry Potter is screwed.
