Something I would like to read is a story or one-shot where Ron is possessive of Harry (and Hermione) because he is the second youngest and always had to share everything. Harry and Ron could be in a relationship or Ron is just possessive over his friend (maybe fem!harry)


** Canon ?

*** He isn't possessive over them in canon though.

**** Except he throws a fit whenever Hermione is with another boy, even Harry who clearly has no romantic interest in her. He isn't possessive towards Harry though, but definitely has a jealous streak -- one of his worst traits in canon (but not nearly as bad as fanon would have you believe).

***** That's not him being possessive about his friends, its him getting jealous because his crush is going on a date with another boy.

Jealousy and possessiveness aren't the same.

** His Belongings by Penelope-Z

H/R slash, H/D implied* His faded sweaters, his torn robes, his broken toys, his second-hand desires, his Harry. Ron is a greedy boy.
