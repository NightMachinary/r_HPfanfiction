By art I'm talking from making sculptures to taking photos to painting pictures. I just really want stories with characters diving into the world of art in the wizarding world


** Prince of the Dark Kingdom has Harry as an artist, and there is at least one class around art that he takes linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom).

There is also an interesting scene where Harry makes a bunch of oragami birds with magic to attack some soldiers, if thats your thing.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** An obvious suggestion if you don't mind slash is Turn by Sara's Girl, [ [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695]] ] which has magical furniture and sculpture making, and everyone in the Drarry-fandom loves it. It's well-written, and generally a good read, and the art-thing is not just "blink and you'll miss it", but really there.

I also know that a lot of people write Dean Thomas as an artist, so if you haven't already you could search for fics with him.

"I'm conjuring this big ass fluffy throne of awesomeness from thin air just to rest my ass while I'm allowing you to explain your troubles" kind of thing.

****** Sure, it's possible to conjure stuff in canon, but the theory behind it is never fully explored. As most magical theory isn't elaborated on in canon fanfic-writers usually have to either define stuff for themselves or just not write about those things. We do not know if conjured items are permanent or temporary, or if it's possible to conjure whatever you want or if there are limitations (we know that there are rules for transfiguration, like you can't conjure food, but I think that's the only explicit mention of a limitation, but it's implied that there are more).

In Turn the writer doesn't outline many rules about conjuring stuff, because she's focusing on the artistic process of using magic to reform raw materials into elegant furniture and sculptures. There is one conjured (I believe) item of furniture in the fic, but it is only temporary and disappears after X amount of time. Seeing as this thread asked for fics about creating magical art I recommended it, because it is a fic about creating magical art.
