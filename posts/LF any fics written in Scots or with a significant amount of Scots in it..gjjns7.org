** Failing fanfiction, and if you haven't read it already, there is always Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stane (ie the Philosopher's stone that's published in Scot's language edition).

"Mr and Mrs Dursley, o nummer fower, Privet Loan, were prood tae say that they were gey normal, thank ye awfie muckle. They were the lest fowk ye wid jalouse wid be taigled up wi onythin unco or ferlie, because they jist widnae hae onythin tae dae wi joukery packery like yon."

*** That's awesome! I had no idea that Harry Potter actually got published in Scots. Did the whole series published in the language too?

**** To my knowledge it's only the first book - it's the only one I've seen on shelves here. It's a pretty funny ready - but you might need a dictionary in places. I can't do any Scottish accent to save my life - but it's better in one, if you can imagine it.

I would love a fic with a strong Scottish English character, but there's so few who could write it that I don't seek it. I've seen some pretty cringeworthy attempts. (English, living in Scotland making me a 'new Scot'.)

Whenever I read something in Scots or Scottish English, I imagine those guys from Burnistoun reading it aloud but I'm not from the UK so I don't know if that's accurate or not. I also feel like the Scottish English lines in fanfiction ought to be at least to the same quality and authenticity that you'd see on [[/r/ScottishPeopleTwitter][r/ScottishPeopleTwitter]].

****** I'm not sure I've seen the Burnistoun reference. You get a fair bit of variability here. Some people use a fair bit more dialect than others, a smaller number have a strong Scots influence.

I'm in the central belt, so I've only heard a word or two of Doric before.

The Scottish People Twitter looks very similar to Face's Scottish Patter which I follow with far more interest than my actual Scottish friends.

******* Burnistoun is a Scottish sketch comedy show but I'm not sure if try to emulate a particular region of Scotland or if they're just using a "general" Scottish accent. This one is their most famous video: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqAu-DDlINs][link here]]. But since you mentioned patter, here's their video on pub patter: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0wEzUFifbo]]

*** Closer to Scottish Harry Potter. Scots considered either it's own language or a dialect of English depending on who you ask. Here's an example, it starts out mostly intelligible for my North American ears, but becomes significantly harder (though still possible) to understand at around 40 seconds: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRnQ8lYcvFU]]

** Ok, so this might be pointless - but have you tried Harry Potter in Scots?

We've been getting our friend - whose whole family speaks Scots - to read it to us. Although she does say they've pulled out some really archaic words that nobody has used for decades or more, just to make a point. So even that is not natural.

I can't find any of pictures of my favourite bit, but if you google it you can get an idea. Here is one: [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FScotland%2Fcomments%2F8vrv65%2Fi_dinnae_ken_said_harry_harry_potter_scots_edition%2F&psig=AOvVaw0YVRcRkg6-P7b5Gh0LgkoP&ust=1589578857631000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCKimkuuotOkCFQAAAAAdAAAAABBT]]
