** Fawkes is an animal that hangs out with Dumbledore of his own will. He does what he wants. If Fawkes personally had no emotional connection to Arthur Weasley then why would he care about him any more than Harry's owl would?

** Because that would make things too easy for the good guys?

Throughout the series, JKR has repeatedly prevented good guys from using easy solutions so as not to interfere her narratives.

*** Ever read the Magic Ex Libris series? Magic users in that series have the ability to pull objects out of books. Want a lightsaber? Grab a Star Wars novel. A personal shield from Dune makes you immune to bullets. Health potions can be found in a D&D manual. Everyone has a Babel fish.

However they also have the ability to 'lock down' a book if there's a particularly dangerous object that would be very BAD if got out. Things like The One Ring.

In the back story they locked down The Prisoner of Azkaban to keep Time-Turners out of circulation. They also got in touch with JKR personally and persuaded her to never to mention them again.

** Phoenixes can't cry on demand? Harry was basically saying goodbye, and telling the bird that his death wasn't the birds fault. Also, there is that “loyalty to Dumbledore” to call the Phoenix?

Basically they were having a moment. There was no moment for Arthur, which makes sense Fawkes did so up. I think I would be more annoyed if the bird did show up.

*** But why not /make/ a moment out of it? Like, why would Dumbledore (manipulative old genius that he is) not go up to Fawkes and show him a picture of Ginny and Ron crying and generally tug at his heartstrings until he cried?

**** We already had the ‘wow' moment with Fawkes coming to the rescue. Why would Dumbledore (manipulative old genius that he is) save Arthur using his bird? It's been a while since I've read that chapter, but there wasn't a reason that Dumbledore/the order couldn't immediately come to Arthur's aid-unlike with the Chamber.

Also, It would have been weird pace wise for the story for the issue to be resolved so anticlimactically.

My point is I don't think this is a plot hole, but more of a strategic decision (by Dumbledore and JKR) to not use Fawkes.

...I don't think we're talking about the same thing? I don't mean to have Fawkes come to Arthur's rescue right there right after getting bitten. I mean later on, when they keep trying to heal him and for a while can't seem to find a way.

****** Ah! Thanks for the clarification!

In that case, I would argue that Tom Riddle is being a contrary little shit by attacking an order member with snake poison that the team's mascot can't cure.

******* But it can cure any poison and nagini's venom is unlikely to be much compared to basilisk venom.

** Why would he? Arthur didn't die or suffer any permanent injuries so clearly Fawkes wasn't needed.

I'm certain Dumbledore would have arranged it if Arthur was beyond human help and Fawkes was actually needed.
