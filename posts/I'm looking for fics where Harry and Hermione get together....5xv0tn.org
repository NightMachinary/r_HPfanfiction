*** Is this the one where they decide to time travel back to their younger bodies, erasing all their kids? (and if it's not do you by any chance know the fic I'm talking about?)

  What would you do if the only way to save the person you loved was to sacrifice everything else that you held dear? DH-Epilogue compliant, sort of. Some HP/GW and RW/Hr, but ultimately, epically, HP/Hr.

**** Hermione was trying to tackle unpopular issues, and only Harry supported her, so they kind got together...

It's actually a pretty good story, but is abandoned.

  Through a series of snapshots from the eyes of Harry Potter, this is the story of his journey through life with the woman he loves. Harry is with Ginny, Ron with Hermione as the Wizarding Community expected. Still, Harry and Hermione have always shared a special bond. How far will this take them? H/Hr - Epilogue Compliant
