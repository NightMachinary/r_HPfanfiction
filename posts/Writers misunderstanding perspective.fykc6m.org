I see this way too often. Writer puts "xyz characters pov", but the following text is in 3rd person. I don't get why people keep doing this.


** Third person does not mean it isn't from a particular character's perspective. Just that it is written in third person. See: A Song of Ice and Fire.

*** But it feels like the flow of the story gets broken when they announce that it's xyz pov.

**** You mean like they do it part way through the story? So a fic could look like:

"Harry Potter POV-

[Insert story scene]

Scene Break

Hermione Granger POV-

[Insert story scene]"

etc?

****** Ah, okay. Yeah, I agree with you that it can be detrimental to the flow of the narrative, but if you're an amateur writer, you're often not able to really establish perspective changes like that in the actual prose (and fandom people are renowned for not reading ANs, missing perfectly obvious signals, and generally not getting the point you want them to), so it can be a useful, yet simple way to guarantee that the reader knows who the perspective is from at all times. They'll grow past it if they keep writing and find out a better way to do things.

** Of course you can have PoV characters in third person. You write the world from their perspective, mix in their thoughts, limit your descriptions to what the character would realistically see and hear.

Literally announcing whose PoV it is is clunky and amateurish though.

** This is called 'third person limited', and it is distinct from 'third person omniscient' because of the very fact that it is limited by the perception of a specific character, rather than having perfect knowledge of all characters and events.

Think of it as over-the-shoulder, rather than in-the-head.

** I think you misunderstand what POV is. POV can of course be in 3rd person. It is even very normal.
