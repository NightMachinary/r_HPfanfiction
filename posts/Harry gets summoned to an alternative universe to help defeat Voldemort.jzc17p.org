  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.

  Harry won the war. It's months afterwards and unexpectedly, he's literally picked up off the face of the world and shoved into another. One where Harry Potter died a long time ago. Where the Potter family's still fighting a war against a Dark Lord that's ruling the world one muggle murder at a time. They say he's their only hope. Harry doesn't really want in.

** Well, my favourite is 0800-rent-a-hero. Sadly not updated for a few years but very good.

** How do you not bash in a trope that starts with them summoning a Harry who's defeated Voldemort, only to make +it+ him do it all over again? At best they've kidnapped him from what should be the "the first day of the rest of his life."

Edit: word correction.
