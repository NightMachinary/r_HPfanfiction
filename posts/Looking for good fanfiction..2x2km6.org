Something well written, with fully developed characters.

Hopefully, not too many cliches or plot tropes, and something rational. (Ex. Harry getting a harem is NOT what I'm looking for. Saccharine-sweet relationships are also a turn off. I've never quite liked romance stories unless they're extraordinarily well done.)

I've gone on a HPMOR binge, and need something creative. As long as the characters don't go Gary/Mary Sue on me, I'm fine. Can anyone recommend me anything?


** Innocent by MarauderLover7

  Sirius escapes from Azkaban when harry is 8, finds his situation with the Dursleys and offers him to live with him while on the run of the Ministry. It's Slightly AU as Draco has a twin and other minor changes. A+ Characterization and plot. has two sequels Initiate and Identity

Strangers at Drakeshaugh

#+begin_quote
  A slice of life/Mystery. Told from the point of view of a muggle family that befriends the new inhabitants of a sleepy corner of the Cheviot Hills. Excellent writing style and characterization, canon compliant

Harry Potter and the Natural 20

#+begin_quote
  HPxD&D xover. Milo is is an 11 years old adventurer Wizard, while fighting his archnemesis Fell Lord, Thamior the Thaumaturge 'accidentally gets transported to the HP-verse with 'no way back'

Crumpets Aren't My Style

#+begin_quote
  HPxSG1 xover General O'Neill is sent on a nice relaxing dipolmatic mission in the U.K. Of course there's bound to be trouble when he runs into a murderous cult called the Death Eaters, who've some how gotten their hands on alien technology.

** "Bring me a rock" is usually followed by, "wrong rock."

It may make sense to search through the C2 or favorites lists from some of your favorites writers. It's hard to recommend to someone who basically says, "looking for a good story." Otherwise, you're liable to get the same links everyone gets: Inverarity's stuff, Northumbrian's stuff, jbern's, joe6991's, nonjon's, Voice of the Nephillim's, etc.

** If you like HPMoR, HP and the Natural 20 and Fantastic Elves, already recced, are there for you.

[[/r/rational]] is the next place you should look. If you ask there, we will /drown/ you in Fanfiction. That said, here's a few I can add from the HP stuff on my Favorited list.

Applied Cultural Anthropology, Or...: Slytherin!Hermione, incomplete, just started 3rd year.

Seventh Horcrux: Harry's personality is overwritten by Voldemort's at Godric's Hollow. Crack. Amazing. Complete.

[[/u/Alexanderwales]] is here for you. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4976703/alexanderwales]]. Conjure by his name at your own risk.

Hopefully something there will tide you over.

*** Thank you so much for the recommendation! I've just read your fanfic, and it feels realistic-you know, multi-faceted, as opposed to stereotypes. I like the writing. Thanks for a great rec.
