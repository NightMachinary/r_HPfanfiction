I think it would be interesting to see how he would treat Harry with going through something similar


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3000137][On the Wings of a Phoenix]] has a prophecy from original books actually refer to Dumbledore and Grindewald. But looking at your description I don't think that's what you want. (Dead)

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

** Radaslab on fanfiction.net has a fic in which Dumbledore is the dark lord that Harry's prophecy refers to, but I can't say I've ever come across a fic where Dumbledore had already fulfilled his own prophecy.

  AU post OoTP. Poor Harry. Sirius left him far more than a house and some money. Dumbledore is the Dark Lord? And what is he supposed to do with the women he was left? Sometimes, Pranks suck and others they are opportunities. H/Multi
