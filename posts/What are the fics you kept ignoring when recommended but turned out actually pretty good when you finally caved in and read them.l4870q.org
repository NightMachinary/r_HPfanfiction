Alexandra Quick series for me. I kept ignoring it because I don't usually read OCs as main characters .


** Hope by jeconais. I generally dont like quidditch stories but it was really good.

Witches of Westfield. The name kinda turned me off but while it does have some issues it's a fun read

** linkffn(13022013) and linkffn(6035532) are two fics that I skipped/ignored many times before I finally decided to read them and realised that they were actually really good.

*Novocaine:* I mostly ignored this one at first because I just don't usually read post-war fanfictions and prefer Hogwarts-centered fics of fics about time-travel. Because of that, I rarely explore the late 90s and 2000s when I read Harry Potter fanfiction. Also, from late summer to early winter, I prefered reading shorter fics (~100k) and this one far exceed the word count which gave me another reason to ignore it. Finally, about a month ago, I decided one day to just give it a shot and I was surprised how good it was. It's still W.I.P however so not-completed.

*Souls Abound:* As a main Harmony shipper, I read a lot of RobSt's fanfictions but I always skipped this one. Before reading it, the description never really interested me as I felt like the world of the story would rapidely become a mess with so many Voldemorts running around and would generally be a dark fanfic. Then, I gave it a go. I quickly realised that I was completely wrong about this fic and, if anything, felt like the story was completely hilarious to read. The many Voldemorts aren't exactly a problem. (Won't say more to spoil the story.)
