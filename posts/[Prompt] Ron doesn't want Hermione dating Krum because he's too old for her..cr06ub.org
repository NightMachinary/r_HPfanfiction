Book 4, you can have Ron still have his crush, but put a protective element.

Krum is 18 in the summer; Hermione is 15 in September.


** Two posts today, two posts yesterday, all four about this same topic... Why are you so obsessed with Hermione and Krum's age difference?

*** I like to keep the topic in this subreddit's mind, and I do post prompts that pop in my head. Plus while Ron's character isn't a Saint, he's vilified for no reason.

It was actually that Fleur topic that brought it back to mind for me, where Ginny, Hermione, and Molly get called out for their crap in the beginning of HBP, which reminded me of a pairings post.

People criticize GoF Harry/Fleur because she's too old, but canon Viktor/Hermione actually occurs, and Krum is canonically even older. I see bashing for the most random reasons ever, from conspiring to steal Harry's inheritance, to a metaphorical boner for authority.

I read a Krum in the Lie I've lived that was arrogant with no basis in canon. I've read Hermione's that tattles for no reason, sabotage Harry's grades, tells lies.

I just wanted to read a fic that dealt with the topic better. Maybe have Hermione's parents informed about Krum. Or Krum being ostracized for it.

Is there any canon age for Viktor? Because you can follow canon and still have him less than two years older than her (Hermione born September 1979, Viktor has to be born before 31st of October 1977)

***** Krum was mentioned as just 18 during the summer of 1994 by Ron.

He was also called 38 at the 2014 world cup on Pottermore.

Which puts him around a Summer of 1976 birth.

  "He is only 18 or something"
#+end_quote

That is far from a definite answer given that Ron is not even sure himself.

Not in the books = not canon

******* You also can't have him as less than 2 years older than Hermione as his age is mentioned again in GoF as being an 18 years. 18 - 15 > 2. Ron's a fairly reliable source of Quidditch information.

I'm not going to bother arguing if Pottermore is canon.

That was a literal quote from the GoF book. He is not sure.

** It's not that he was jealous.

/He's not!/

It's just, he was so much older than her! Hermoine is smart, why would she do something so stupid? So reckless and irresponsible?

He didn't hate Krum, he actually admired the man. He had skill, the way he moved through the air? Unparalleled. He was able to take a curse and shrug it off like nothing. Something Ron wished he could do.

No, he didn't hate Krum.

But he did wonder, why does an adult have an interest in a fifteen-year-old girl?

He could see the appeal of Hermoine. She didn't fawn of boys like Emmaline Vane. She didn't gossip Like Lavander Brown. She had more concern with her books than her hair, unlike Parvati. She thought quickly on her feet. Her knowledge, though intimidating at first, was exciting to explore and challenge.

Plus, she could always help when he got confused.

He had to say something to her. Harry, sharing is confusion over Krum's interest, refused to get in the middle of it. Harry concluded that Hermoine was smart enough to make her own decisions.

Ron summarized that since he didn't have a sister, that he didn't really understand. Just, what if he had asked Ginny?

He had to say something, so he did.

"I'm concerned about you," He commented with his hands stuck in his pockets.

She had stopped mid-turn, her eyer watching him behind her bangs. "Why?"

"It's Krum," He started ignoring the huff and eye roll she gave him, "I'm just concerned with the interest he is giving you."

"It's none of your business," She hissed.

"Of course it is! You're my friend!"

"As your friend, you should trust my judgment!" Her voice had raised receiving a few glances from students around them.

"You should acknowledge my concern!" He spat back.

"I acknowledge it and I'm ignoring it." She had then pushed past him, her face red with anger. She slammed her shoulder into his causing him to stumble back into his date.

The rest of the ball was him watching Hermoine and Ginny. Watching where the boy's placed their hands. How close they got. Watching like a hawk every time the girls were handed a drink form their dates. It wasn't fun work, but it was necessary.

And he wouldn't forgive himself if something happened on his watch.

*** I like it! There's some grammar and spelling mistakes, and Emmeline Vance was older.

But Ron's character is great. He's both concerned and has a crush.

Hermione isn't automatically accepted as right, which is nice.

Krum has his positive attributes highlighted.
