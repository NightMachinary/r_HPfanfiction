** Thing is with the cartoonish portrayal of him, it's never possible to situation gets better with Voldemort taking over the ministry when the events are remotely similar to canon.

*** To be fair, in cannon Voldemort's uprising makes no fucking sense at all. It is clear that money rules politics in cannon, and we never really learn of a rich muggleborn. The purebloods Voldemort has as followers have money (Malfoys, Lestranges, etc...), and then for some reason he revolts against a system that he essentially controls to begin with? Makes no god damned sense.

What's even weirder is the fact the purebloods follow Voldemort. In 99% of fannon the muggleborn are heavily discriminated against, have basically no legal protections, and no real future, cannon the purebloods just act far more important than muggleborns. The ministry is pretty obviously "We don't really give a fuck about muggleborns" so if they really wanted they could basically start a genocide. So instead they rally around Voldemort and start attacking the ministry that they control to further discriminate against the muggleborns?

You can argue that if Voldemort tried to go about it politically he would face resistance, but all dictators did. They make the resistance a target of the public and make it legal to kill them, generally by faking a major crime. Problem solved.

I'm actually working on something very slowly that has Voldemort as a muggleborn revolutionary against the system, absurdly AU. That at least makes a bit of sense in my head.

Yes yes yes, I can't wait to read it. I've been wanting a realistic Voldemort uprising for a very, very long time.

** If you're okay with highly AU stuff, linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) is right up your alley. There's "subtext" between Harry and Voldemort, but Harry shows quite a bit of interest in the opposite sex, and nothing explicit occurs anyway from what I can remember. Definitely no explicit slash.

**** Thanks for the clarification. Yeah - the only reason I mentioned subtext is because it's a fairly common interpretation of their relationship, though it didn't exactly strike me that way.

****** Yeah... That one was a bit of a curveball. I think it was a hasty retcon, to be honest.

*** Whilst I 100% support the rec, it should be clear that the wizarding world isn't strictly speaking better - it's not strictly worse, and nowhere near the hell on earth some fics go for, but what is presented is a complex picture, and clearly seen in different ways by different actors within it. Harry has a limited POV on the world, even more limited than our own, as he can't compare it to Canon outcomes and his stance is necessarily complex, and shifts frequently.
