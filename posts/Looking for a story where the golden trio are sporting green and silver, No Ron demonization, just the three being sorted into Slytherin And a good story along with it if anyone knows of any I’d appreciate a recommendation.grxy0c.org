Thanks, Hopefully not to OC Outside of the Weasley twins falling over and pretending to stabbed in the back like Julius Caesar from a joking family Betrayal every time they see Ron for his first week as a Slytherin but the informed him he will always be there annoying little brother ronnikins Preferably in public while making a spider dance across the Slytherin table Toward him. You know the classic older brother moderate torture that tells their younger siblings They still love them and their relationship hasn't changed.if a Slytherin Ron Were to perhaps retaliate with the help of Hermione and Draco starting an inter house/inter year prank war Being waged on both sides by Weasleys I would have no problem with that either.

  Slytherin Trio. Deaf Harry. No ridiculous modification of beloved character behavior to turn them into evil monsters. Because fuck that shit.Ron is a Slytherin and he is perfect. Because for some reason Slytherin Harry fics tend to demonise Ron and I am not about that shit.
