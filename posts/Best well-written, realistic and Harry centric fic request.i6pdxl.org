I have really struggled to find Harry Potter fics that I absolutely love. There is always something that puts me off when I start to read any, be it the writing style, character portrayal or plot.

I know that it's hard to find something as good as JK, but I also know that there are amazing writers out there and maybe I just haven't found the right fics for my taste.

So that being said, if anyone has recs for these particular requests please let me know!! Thank you

- Harry centric
- Well written and developed
- Characters act realistically, like in canon
- No crazy plots like time travelling and etc
- Happen between the time of book 1 and 7
- No new characters outside of canon


** Sorry to toot my own horn, but you might like some of my missing moments series. Most of them, but not all, focus on Harry at least in some way, and some are completely Harry centric. They're all stand alone canon compliant one shots during Harry's Hogwarts years and mostly focus on character exploration. Ones specifically from Harry's pov are later, starting around sixth year.

*** This is so funny, but you are the one fanfic writer that I love! I was even going to mention it in my post like ‚ÄòDoes anyone know fic that is as well written and realistic as the one-shot fics by FloreatCastellum?' but then I though I should just keep it general. I re-read your work all the time and love it! I wish I could find more fic like that, it ticks all the boxes for me.

PS - your one shot with Ginny imitating Snape to Harry and Remus has made me laugh aloud in the most inconvenient places just thinking about it lmao

** I like a lot of LullabyKnells Harry Potter fanfictions. If you don¬¥t mind slow-updating fics there might be some you like. ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/282654]])

linlao3(Hogwarts, to welcome you home) is always great, and gets recommended regularly.

And also one shot what if scenario collection:

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
