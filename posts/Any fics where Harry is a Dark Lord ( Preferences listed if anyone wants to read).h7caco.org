  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.
