** Sirius managed to cast a patronus with his bare hands and with the 'happy' thought of killing Harry Potter.

His patronus was a giant snake that ate dementors.

** The maker of Azkaban Prison was a seer. He foresaw Sirius being framed and put in Askaban. So he specifically built it so that in the Summer of 1993, the enchantments around the cell would temporarily dissipate, allowing Sirius to escape.

** Azkaban is Pollen Central and Sirius Black has just the worst hayfever imaginable, so he escaped to try harvest the toe-nails of wild Unicorns, the leg muscles of a narcoleptic Mandrake, and several chains of daisies in order to make the perfect Antihistamine so when the Heroic Ministry inevitably recaptures him, he'll be able to survive the Prison and keep his sanity.

** You know Sirius Black right?

Well his last name Black means dark innit. So that means defence against the dark arts was actually defence against Sirius Black, so they have been preparing us to defeat him because he was the true mastermind behind Voldemort.

It's a bit suspicious that when he goes to prison Voldemort is “dead” and if Sirius was friends with the Potters then maybe Sirius is Voldemort!!

So if defence against the dark arts was against Sirius, who is Voldemort in disguise then that means we have to defend the squid.

** Sirius had definitely dabbled in the Dark Arts if he was able to escape from Azkaban. So when he escaped from Hogwarts, he'd obviously created a copy of his distant relative Elizabeth Burke's portrait. She gave him a long speech about the many holes in the wards, how the purebloods would be better at doing it than "that son of a Mudblood" Dumbledore, ending with encouraging him to be "nasty to Mudbloods"(as she always did). He escaped with her help, duh.

** The ministry accidentally killed Sirius, so they hid his body and told everyone he escaped. The attack at Hogwarts was an auror using poly juice.

My other theory is that Sirius black was so evil that dementors avoided him. It was literally as easy as walking out.

** Everyone knows that as You-Know-Who's right hand man Black has dabbled in the Dark Arts big time. So, obviously, he just used the same Dark Arts he used to escape from the prison to escape from Hogwarts. I mean, if he could break out from an actual prison for the worst wizards possible, breaking out from a school would be a walk in the park for him. Also, weren't the dementors actually working for Voldemort back during the war? They have probably been working with Black all this time and never tried to catch him in first place.
