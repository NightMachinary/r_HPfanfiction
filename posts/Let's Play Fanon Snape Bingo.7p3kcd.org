I decided that the characters in my latest story are going to be playing Snape Bingo, in which they attempt to get Snape to say or do something to win a game of bingo. I decided to make a fanon version, for all those times that Snape is suddenly and inexplicably OOC (or just repeating himself from canon).


** Just a nit pick here. Isn't the free space usually in the direct middle? It's been a while since I've bingoed.

*** How about inexplicably amazing in bed? And incredibly attractive to women?

I love Snape, he's my absolute favourite character in the series but even I can't stomach that

He's not a man who gets laid

**** I can't imagine why anyone would ever want to describe how fantastic Snape is in bed except for Snape when writing his own personal stories about him and Lily.

*** Maybe a spot for excessively harsh point deductions and lengthy detentions? For example:

#+begin_quote
  THIS IS AN ABYSMAL NUMBER OF CLICHES. A MILLION POINTS FROM GRYFFINDOR AND A YEAR OF DETENTION WITH MR FILCH!

**** He thought he was going to have an excellent morning - it had been showing definite signs, what with the hot blonde and all - but it did, in fact, turn out to be a Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.

(Also, I think moving to Australia might actually be a very good reason because, come to think of it, everyone I've known who moved to Australia came back much improved. I'm pretty sure that's where they make the hot people.)
