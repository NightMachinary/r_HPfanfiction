I'm looking for a steamy romance with Hermione. No Harmony or Snape please. Draco, any Weasley brother, or death eater are preferred. I'd either like it set during the war or as adults, not really looking for Hogwarts romance. Action is good. I would like it Complete and longer than 50k words please.


** Linkffn(debt of time) ticks most of those boxes except "not really looking for Hogwarts romance". Hermione gets sent back in the to the marauders era. Very steamy, and the characters do grow up (so we get several years of post Hogwarts).

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

** Try linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozalsky). Quite steamy, quite bendy, quite long, but not quite finished.

*** I adore that. I'm reading it right now. It doesn't have a /ton/ of sex, and it's extraordinarily clever.

*** Nope. You are free to love your teacher/student fics. Just don't judge me and my love of death eaters with Hermione.

** I personally like Those Gilded Chains We Wear very much. Its one of the best Hermione/Bellatrix pairings out there due to having a very well done Bellatrix character in it. It may not be enough smut for you though. Actually its really slow moving so it may miss the mark completely.

linkffn(7755315)

This one is a Harry/Multi with a focus on Hermione. Harry Potter and the Curse's Cure. Its probably as smutty as it gets in my list of fics.

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.
