Looking for ministry of magic fanfics where they are held accountable for the miscarage of justice that has happened ie sirius black,underage magic,umbridge not getting charged,etc. or political fics where preferably harry kind of “takes on the ministry” slash is fine ,so is nonpairing or harry and luna or harry and hermione


** Overthrow the corrupt, incompetent, and malicious British Ministry of Magic is a massive guilty pleasure of mine. Sure, the new revolutionary regime could be even worse, as the aftermaths of many real world revolutions show, but I consider the status quo to be utterly unacceptable.

I mean if you throw teenagers and children to the wolves, and if they win the day, you are going to deal with a bunch of hardened and ruthless child soldiers who also happen to have a bunch of issues. Most of them are not going to let your shit go on any longer, and they are going to make you pay, with very very high interests. Even the Wizard Jesus can only take so much, and he will crucio any enemy who spits on his friends.

Not many fics address that topic, but here are some I like very much:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): The Trio and their friends finally had it enough and declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They began with vigilante killings against Death Eaters who got off again. I just love the following excerpt:

#+begin_quote
  The Ministry would burn. Not today. Not tomorrow. But soon. They would burn, every last one of them, because if that was the only way to keep them from ever going after Ron and Hermione again, then that was what he would do.

  Burn it all, scour it to the very bedrock, and rebuild it from scratch in the ashes. If the Minister could not command the Wizengamot, then the Wizengamot would yield. By Fiendfyre, blackmail, or loyalty, he did not particularly care which.

  His left hand rested by Hermione's neck, tangled in her hair. His right had a tight grip on Ron's shoulder, “silent reassurance that he was there, that they had him back for good.

  "They will burn," he vowed quietly. "Every single last one of them will burn for this."

  Hermione's breath hitched. Then her grip tightened and she looked up to meet his gaze, stubborn and furious and defiant through bloodshot eyes and ash-grey skin.

  "They will burn," she agreed.

  "... Every single last one of them," Ron finished, low and hoarse. "Every single last one."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): The establishment learnt nothing from Voldemort's defeat and tried to add a marriage law to their list of atrocities. Harry and Hermione reacted violently to that, so violently that other European Pureblood regimes decided to intervene.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald broke out after Dumbledore's death and offered to help Harry. Together they spread chaos and revolutions across Europe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978): UK government and allied wizards shot up Death Eaters, Thickeness/Umbridge Ministry, and Voldemort. The Trio helped hunting down Horcruxes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan time travelled and killed off their enemies in droves. They even did the Goblins in, but failed to get Snape and Karkaroff...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/There-s-Always-a-Way][There's Always a Way]], linkffn(2612901): Another take down of that stupid marriage law trope, in which a gravelly injured Harry hires a super assassin SI from America to take out those responsible. Written by the same author of NOFP.

Finally, I greatly enjoyed the scene in CoG where Grindelwald incinerated those Ministry goons.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.
