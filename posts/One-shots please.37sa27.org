I'm in grad school, and these next two weeks before summer break are going to be absolute hell. My to-do list is scary, so I'm going to need something to do during my tiny scheduled breaks to keep my sanity. Due to my propensity to read books in one sitting (it's a bad habit, I know), I shouldn't read anything with multiple chapters. Therefore, I would like some awesome one-shots please!!

My only requirement is that they be canon-complaint. Other than that, they can be any genre, any pairing...whatever you got. Thanks!

*** Oh yes! I have read that one before now that I look at it. Thank you for recommending it, though. It was not in my favorites, and now it is!

** I don't generally read one shots. The only one that I even remember offhand is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8461800/1/The-Twine-Bracelet][The Twine Bracelet]]. Hard mode: don't tear up.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10071063/1/The-Assassin-Wore-White][The Assassin Wore White]]: In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7611783/1/Pair-the-Spare][Pair the Spare]]: Luna Scamander reminisces upon finding her spangled-silver dress robes at the back of her closet. One-shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5870848/1/The-Wall][The Wall]]: There is a wall, in 12 Grimmauld Place, which displays the dead. Oneshot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5318441/1/Box-on-the-Stool][Box on the Stool]]: Harry offers to free Kreacher.

[[http://letterblade.net/thirty-five_owls.html][Thirty-Five Owls]]: Go teach your children, eat your candy, preen your bird and bury me. But we were brilliant together, Albus, and not even you can change history. (This is honestly some of the best writing I've ever seen. Anywhere.)

*** Hahahaha, I just picked a random one before bed, and settled on "Out of the Fire and into the Cupboard". That was probably the funniest one-shot I've ever read. Thank you. That was glorious.
