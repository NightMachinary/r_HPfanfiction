I know I've seen this trope one or two times in fics but I can't recall when or which ones! I've always been a sucker for this because let's admit it it's wholesome as frick.

Anyways no specific requirements, can be a fic centered around this or just vaguely has this in. Harry just needs to find Sirius as a dog and look after/adopt him without knowing who he is


** There was a prompt here for a fic where Sirius has a different animagus form and so I wrote this in response.

  Instead of a grim, Sirius Black had a different Animagus form, one that Harry adopted as his new pet. The result of a Reddit prompt.

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.

** linkffn(2052919)

It's pretty good, at first the plot kind of revolves around Harry befriending dog Sirius. Some Dursley abuse at the start, it's a beginning of a rewrite of the books. I remember it being pretty good, but it's been a while. The series got a little weaker later on, but the first few are pretty good from what I remember.

(I think I did the link right)

** It isn't Harry, but the MC of linkao3(19992961) does this. I figure that you might appreciate something tangential to what you're after - because this is real wholesome too.

The first half of the first chapter leads you to believe otherwise, but you really don't need to know anything about the other half of the crossover to enjoy this. If you want some context for that bit; everybody mentioned in that first half of the first chapter is either a Superhero or a Supervillain and is also completely irrelevant to the plot of the fic.
