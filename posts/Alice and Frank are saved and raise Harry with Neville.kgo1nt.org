Basically what the title says. Anyone know a good fic where somehow Alice and Frank either are cured or don't end up insane and are able to raise Harry and Neville as brothers? Would rather not have any Weasley bashing.


** Immediate thought is that somehow, rescuing and housing Harry is what saved them from their canon fate.

*** It is fanon that they had a close relationship with Harry's parents or that Alice Longbottom was his godmother. Although they would be likely candidates assuming Dumbledore decided to place him with a wizarding family.

**** I think Marlene was(she was one of Lily's closest girl friends), wasn't Alice older than them?

*** I think Remus and Peter were(and then maybe Alice and Frank) the (only)options after Sirius(since James trusted his friends with his life), but Dumby didn't want to place a child with a person that has a hairy problem once a month(a newborn needs a lot of attention, and a family), and Peter was a traitor(and the Marauders thought either Peter or Remus was a traitor). Alice and Franks torture was in first two weeks of November/first week of December(the wiki says this, and I would say that Bellatrix and the others were caught red-handed, on the spot, or perhaps were in custody for a month, due to a lot of things happening in the world after Voldys downfall), or it could have lasted a whole month until they were caught. The timeline is not explained in the books and we don't know how many Crucio's you need to take in order to turn into that. Andromeda could have been a good option, but Dumbs being Dumby didn't want for Harry to grew up in the wizarding world. Also giving them Harry was a double-edged sword due to the fact that even Dumbs didn't know if Neville was maybe the child of the prophecy.

**** Andromeda and Ted is a hard to choose in the situation, it gives the ability for Lucius and Narcissa to be able to get Harry if something happens to them + Sirius was from all pepoles perspective a traitor.

Sirius should of recived a trial though, so much shit would of come to light i reckon if he had + Harry would of grown up around his parents best friend that actually loves him.

Imagine if Sirius raises him, no way would Harry be the one we see from canon, he would probably be able to handle his fame better than he ever did in canon, grow up with stories about both his parents and be able to choose friends of a wider variety + would have a reliable guardian to protect him against the bs that happens at hogwarts aswell as have his magical abilities be neglected from age 1-11.

Albus knew that Neville wasnt the boy, due to Tom choosing Harry, now it dosent exclude Neville from being marked later, but Neville at the time of october 31st-november 1st was "free" from destiny

I agree. The one thing that was constantly bugging me(besides him not having a trial) is why they didn't use Pensieve to see trough his memories that he wasn't the Secret Keeper, and also the duel with Peter, they would have seen that he turned to a rat, and escaped after the explosion(I know that you can alter memories, but Dumbs would have seen if the memories were altered). Dumbs was a supreme warlock of Wizengamot.

It would have been a great thing, I would like a realistic fanficiton about it. But even if he was raised by him, they would be constantly bothered cause Harry saved the world(cause he wouldn't have been isolated from it), and I think Harry would have been annoyed about it(reminding him constantly about the death of his parents and stuff like that, or perhaps fame going to his head, but I think that Remus and Sirius would have delt with that, but still he is James' kid, and James was obnoxious when he was a kid). But overall he would have been the happiest kid ever. He would also have Remus there included in his life to have more stability.

Well Sirius could be a reliable guardian(with the help of Remus ofc), but I think he would have been prone to encourage Harry's mischievous side(I can totally see him sending a Howler to Harry, when Ron and he went with the flying car to Hogwarts in their second year and praising them, his barking laugh echoing throughout the Great Hall, telling him that he is truly his father's son and that he is brilliant, switching to Lupin's scolding concerning voice that Lily would have their hides if he died, but still chuckling nevertheless). Sirius would have been also a good role model to Ron(I can totally imagine Sirius would been proud that Harry had a great friend like that who went followed him trough thick and thin), and could help Ron to overcome his confidence issues cause of his siblings.

I think Albus assumed he wasn't due to Harry being a halfblood like Voldemort. I mean due to prophecy, even the Longbottoms and the Potters went to hiding(having sons born at the end of July, and escaping him three times), and when they killed the Potters and vanished, he knew when Harry was marked. Maybe Longbottoms were already captured in November, we don't know the timeline, still he should have gone to Sirius.
