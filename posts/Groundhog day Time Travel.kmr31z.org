Time Travel stories where they experience the same thing/day over and over again?

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc

NO: No Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune, no Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc.

  This story was written as a gift for Olivie Blake, in the grand tradition of giving her murder for her birthday, and since I know that she enjoys the particular flavour of Harmony. It was, as the tags suggest, partly inspired by Groundhog Day, but with the darker twist of Edge of Tomorrow.

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?
