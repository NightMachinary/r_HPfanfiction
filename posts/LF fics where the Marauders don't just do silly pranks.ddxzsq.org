Are there any fics out there where the Marauders aren't just doing coloring changing spells, or dosing people (usually Slytherins) with potions that make them act ridiculous?

I want to read a fic that shows Marauders that start doing more and more risky and potentially harmful magic as they get older, until getting a wake up call when Sirius tells Snape how to get under the Whomping Willow.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder][Dark Marauder]], linkffn(4586362): James survived Halloween 1981, and Marauders now mean business.

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.

  After a prank gone too far, Sirius Black realises that things have to change. He never wanted to follow the path of his parents and the realisation that, in certain ways, he was like them wasn't good. His life from there on took another direction. One person certainly found this new Black heir very interesting.

***** I'm really late to this discussion, but they were probably talking about /Tarantallegra/, not /Imperio/ (it doesn't actually make you dance, but your legs spasm in a way that resembles dancing).

We don't actually see much overlap between potion and spell effects, though.

** Except that The Werewolf Prank /didn't make them stop/. Chronologically from The Prince's Tale, it's obvious that the prank happened before Mudblood. This means that they did not stop the harassments of SS (and possibly others) even when it clearly had gone out of hand and someone was almost killed.

**** It's not clear exactly when it happens, but considering that the chapter is completely chronological, it's clear that it happens before.

My personal headcanon is that at some point either in the summer between 5th and 6th year, or some time during the 6th year, James' parents dies. This gave him a reality check and made him (and the rest of the Marauders, given that he's sort of their leader) stop harassing Slytherins. In the end, he matures, and this ultimately causes him to become Head Boy.

One interpretation I've seen -- that I find really disturbing, and the main reason the Jily ship always made me very wary, because this also happens with Petunia some years later in the Dursley wedding -- is that they stopped /because/ of Mudblood, and Lily swearing off her friend, meaning there was no reason to harass him anymore.

***** It's too bad that not much of the books was devoted to exploring James and Lily too.

My headcanon is somewhat similar, but differs in that Sirius moved in with the Potters in 6th Year, and his own place when he was 17, so they died some time between the start and end of 6th Year. Due to James having to deal with their deaths and facing the deaths of loved ones, he matures, resulting in him becoming Head Boy, and Lily becoming interested in him.

That is a disturbing interpretation. It would mean that their childhood rivalry morphed into some twisted aim to break off Snape's and Lily's friendship because they saw that he loved her and wanted to break him so he'd snap in a way that she'd no longer wish to be friends with him. But even if they no longer harrassed him, it doesn't mean they stopped harassing everyone. So what would cause Lily to go from hating James to marrying him?

****** Even in pro-James stories that I read (before my feelings on Jily turned towards dislike), he's usually written as having a rather creepy obsession with her starting around 3rd year, and continuing to insisting on pursuing her and Lily ultimately trying it out mostly because nobody bothered trying to defy James' pursuing resulting in an utter lack of prospects. It's this common premise that made me dislike the ship in first place and, after reading a story with a particularly cruel James, has made me unable to stand main-focus Jily.

I vastly prefer Remily as alternative to Jily -- them getting to know each other more as Gryffindor Prefects, and things developing from that. Too bad I have a hard time seeing it happen, not because it's a bad match, but because I can't really see Remus stepping on James' toes since he obviously likes her.

******* I do see that in an overwhelming majority of Jily stories, unless it's an AU where they met another way. Reading them has made me want to find stories where he's not some creepy stalker who is also popular, powerful, and a bully.

James's friendship with Remus is one of the reasons why I am not totally against him. He befriended him, sought a way to help him when he found out Remus was a Werewolf, and cared enough about him to risk being sentenced to Azkaban for becoming an illegal animagus. If he can do all that for a friend then surely he has qualities that others who aren't in the know would like about him?

Remily/Limus(?) is a good pairing, but I do wonder how much he actually dated as a teenager, and if he would have dated someone, even if they knew he was a Werewolf, considering how opposed he was to dating Tonks due, mainly, to being a Werewolf. I imagine if he had the same hangups he did with Tonks then he wouldn't have pursued a romantic relationship with her, considering his being a Werewolf and James's feelings.
