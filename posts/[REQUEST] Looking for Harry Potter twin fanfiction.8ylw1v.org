This is all I remember about the story

•Harry's parents are alive and he ran away/thinks he's dead

•Harry goes to Hogwarts under a different name and identity to hide from his family

•Harry disguises himself as a muggleborn

•Harry and his twin are in Gryffindor

•Harry's identity is revealed at some point within the first 3 years (at least to his twin)

•Harry's twin isn't a massive a-hole

•Might also be a wrong boy who lived story

That's all I remember about the story, thanks if you know what I'm talking about


** Could it be the Unknown Relations series by ksomm814 linkffn(2970733)?
