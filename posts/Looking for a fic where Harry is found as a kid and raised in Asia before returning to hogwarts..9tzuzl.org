I started this a long time ago and lost it before i could finish it, and I've been trying to find it for a while with no luck.

Some things I remember: - The Asian magic users used rings as foci -I believe Harry doesn't return to England until his later Hogwarts years, but I could be wrong. - Harry is quite the womanizer, but the fic doesn't go into graphic detail. - At one point Harry jumps off the astronomy tower and rolls at the bottom, just to prove he can - Harry doesn't respect authority, and in Dumbledore's office he lifts his feet up and holds them above the desk instead of just putting them on the floor

Sorry I couldn't remember more, it's been a few years. If these scattered and vague memories ring a bell for any of you, please let me know. Thanks!


** This sounds like Harry Potter and the sun source by clell65619, but it has been done time since I read it.
