I read a fic a long time ago in which Harry (and only Harry) is sent back to before the Founder's era, and where he must live through the thousands of years to his time, but doesn't age. He recieves a wand from the original Ollivander, meets the founders/teaches at Hogwarts in the past, and becomes a special kind of healer (battle healer? He can't harm people unless it is in battle or something like that), tutored in this by Morgana. He meets another time traveler, around the 1700-1800s (1xxx, I know that much), but she returns to the present and dies from this. I also remember him fighting with the original Order during the first war. I was waiting on an update but lost the fic somehow! I think it was on ff.net? Literally any ideas would be appreciated, I'd love to finish and reread this fic!


** Woah this sounds interesting. I would love to know the name of this one as well

*** I know you won't believe this, but I remembered a specific sentence from the fic right after posting it (something I typed must have sparked a memory). Here's the fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/2/Basilisk-born]]
