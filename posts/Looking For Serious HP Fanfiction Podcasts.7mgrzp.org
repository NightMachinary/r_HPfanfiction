I recently came across the podcast [[http://www.potterficweekly.com/][PotterFicWeekly]] by accident, and I'm a fan! The hosts have serious (but still funny and entertaining) discussions on some mostly decent fanfics, rather than just finding weird fics to bash like I've seen on the few other fanfiction podcasts that I've managed to find. Does anyone know of any other podcasts like this that I can subscribe to?

I don't really have any friends that read fanfiction, so it's nice to have podcasts to listen to instead where fanfiction is dissected or discussed. Plus, I like the idea of finding more fics to read based on what's discussed in the episodes. Any recs would be greatly appreciated!


** The old PotterFicWeekly episodes are the best. I've got nothing against the new hosts, but the episodes with Ryan and Jen are amazing

*** Didn't know they changed - bummer! I'm actually starting with the episodes for [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][A Year Like None Other]], which are older episodes with the original hosts. I figured I'd start by listening to episodes for fics I've already read first.

** What a coincidence. I was just wondering about a podcast or channel that reads Harry Potter fics in a similar way as the No Sleep Podcast.
