I read a few WBWL fics and I am disappointed that in none of them, James and Lily got their comeuppance ( I know that they're nice people in canon and that they're unfairly bashed in WBWL fics). Can somebody recommend me a Dark! Harry fic where he kills either or both of his parents?

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
