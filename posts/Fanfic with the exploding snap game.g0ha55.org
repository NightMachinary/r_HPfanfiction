Harry modifies the exploding snap cards and make some slice make a force field And makes a game out of them With belts that charge them or something like that Filius Flitwick play the game as well

Edit found it [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10851278/50/][Nobody told Me the rules]]


** Fun fact: In the early German translations the game was called "Snape explodiert", which translates to Snape explodes.

I did some research on it and it seems to be fixed in later versions but before I started reading fanfiction I was under the impression that this game was created by hogwarts students to make fun of Snape.
