Vernon likes watching PMQs, a young Harry takes a liking to the current Prime Minister wits and intelligence, due to that he gains an interest in politics. In he's spare time he learns how politics work and what is good governance.

Once he arrives at Hogwarts he also starts taking an interest in the Wizarding government.

When Harry has the hearing for using the Patronus, everyone except Dumbledore of course, is shocked that Harry knows his magical law than the common ministry worker. He manages to prove that he is innocent on his own.

Also please comment fanfics with similar plots.


** "-And therefore, under clause six of the Wizarding Self-defence Act of 1746, which categorically states that any muggle in the vicinity of a Wizard that happens to witness magic being performed in defence of their life are themselves exempt from the Statute of Secrecy for the duration of the emergency. Dudley Dursley, being a close relation of mine and therefore privy to the knowledge that the Wizarding World exists, would therefore still be considered exempt from the statute even if the genetic ties we share were not present-and believe me, there are times where I wish we did not share them." Harry stated.

"Nonetheless, you /did/ knowingly violate the Decree For The Reasonable Restriction For Use of Under-age Magic, which while recognising your right to self-defence, does not in fact account for doing so in the presence of muggles." Fudge countered.

"Ah, but it does cover close relations though and, more crucially, fails to clarify whether or not such relations are Witches and Wizards or not." Harry retorted promptly. "See, the Decree is meant to help /save/ lives, not endanger them. If a close relation has to be magical in order for the self defence clause to be recognised, why aren't they assisting the Underage Magic user in the first place?"

"While the law itself does not do so, the jurisprudence does." Fudge responded smugly. "That fact was covered in the Weasley vs Malfoy case of 1972."

Harry clapped. "Nice cherry pick Minister, that is indeed the judgement rendered in favour of that particular interpretation. Pity it ignores an earlier case that covered similar particulars, namely the Prince case of 1948. There it was found that Artemis Prince, then-scion of the Prince family, was not guilty of using magic to defend his Squib cousin during a werewolf attack despite being 13 at the time. Had the Weasley lawyer actually pressed to have the case judged on a historical basis, the Malfoys would have had to take the matter to appeals. Pity their choice didn't have the penchant for research a true lawyer would have exhibited." Harry finished pointedly.

"You DARE-" Umbridge, whose father had lost that case, shrieked.

"Madam Secretary." Fudge interrupted, looking down at the young man in front of him with excitement. "You've certainly done your homework young man." He stated. "Was this perhaps... Premeditated?" He asked, causing a murmur to sweep the courtroom.

"No. It's merely a consequence of being who I am and living where I do." Harry answered curtly. "To be blunt minister, I was expecting an attack on my person after the events of last year, so I brushed up on the legalities with the hope of figuring out what to do and what not to do when confronted by those that want me dead. I have done additional research on citizen's arrest procedures, when and where the use of force against an enemy Wizard is validated and what to do to keep myself out of Azkaban in the event of a Death Eater attack. Imagine my surprise when half the things I studied became moot... Given that someone in the Ministry struck first. Dementors Minister? Really? The Ministry is the only organisation capable of commanding them! How in the World did whoever thought this up think that they could possibly get away with such a blatant assassination attempt? Honestly, you might as well have just sent a squad of hitwizards to my door with a signed Death warrant. It would certainly have been less of a mess to deal with! Muggles suffering from Dementor exposure. A political mess that not even the Prophet can truly cover up. A plot by a doubtlessly high ranking member of your administration not only plotting to kill a fifteen year old but failing miserably! And then this switcheroo where I cop the blame for their plot to kill me? Honestly Minister, I am not to blame but someone in your government doubtlessly is! And if not on your orders, then on whose? Who could possibly want me dead, Minister? Care to hazard a guess?"

The court erupted.

"SILENCE!" Fudge shouted, slamming the gavel down. "I shall have silence in court! What are you doing boy, fishing for contempt charges? We all know Dementors cannot be truly controlled. What happened was an accident, nothing more, and I will not hear a word more said on the subject until the investigation into how such events came to pass is complete. What we are here for is the determination of whether or not you have violated the law and premeditation is a valid concern here! Why look up the legalities if you did not intend to go through with the act? Why go as far as you have when such events were vanishingly unlikely to occur in the first place? Can you answer that?"

"The world cup." Harry answered. "I needed to know if defending myself when necessary was a basic legal right in the Wizarding World or not."

"I can assure you, boy, that it is." The Minister said contemptuously.

"In that case Minister, as you have just pointed out, I have done nothing wrong and am free to go." Harry said with a smile. "After all, all I did that night was defend myself. Nothing more, nothing less. If it is the inherent right of a Wizard or Witch to defend themselves, regardless of their age, beliefs or social standing, then you cannot find me guilty because I cast nothing but a lighting charm and the Patronus that night, both in defence of myself and others. If the court so pleases, I am willing to swear an oath to that respect right here and now, so Merlin strike me down."

Fudge leaned back, scowling. "Then do so." He said, savouring the exchange he'd just had.

Merlin, that had to be the most enjoyable defeat he'd ever had. Fudge promised himself to mend fences with the little brat, if only so that he could try again... But with lower stakes next time.

There was no game quite like politics and finding such a talent to pit himself against was rare indeed.

*** The idea that Fudge /enjoyed/ the competition was one I didn't expect, as it in canon he's not the kind to like /any/ sort of competition.

**** In canon, it's because he's an oaf under the thumb of either the old purebloods or Dumbledore and sees everyone who rocks the social boat as a threat to his tenure as Minister.

In this, it's because every one of his peers relies on money, family, connections or reputation to coast through a Ministry Career. Having an opponent willing to play the game is worth the dozen or so poncy normies' bribe money he'll be missing out on by getting Harry more involved in the Ministry.

TL;DR: CANON-"Muh tenure!" , Fanon-"Ooh, not a fucking normie, nice."

**** He was probably thinking along the lines of Jim Hacker. He is certainly as recognisable as Maggie these days, if not more so. Baroness Thatcher's retirement from the spotlight has done her few favours with regards to remaining in the public conscience for those born after her retirement... And even then, few who were children during her period in office would be able to remember her as anything more than a talking head outside of the Falklands War and a few other occasions that she is still remembered (and sometimes reviled) for today.

It's a shame really. She was a fascinating character, though her son could have done with inheriting more of Mommy dearest's brains.

***** She's widely remembered by people under 30, her legacy has lived on in many areas of the country where she wrecked the economy and the social support network. She's remembered positively only by the children of the wealthy and privileged, everyone else has a very negative view of her premiership.
