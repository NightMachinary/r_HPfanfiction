#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

** linkffn(12775205) is by the author of Delenda Est and is a WIP. Susan and Harry are sent back, is from Susan's POV.

linkffn(4740107) sends Ginny back. Interesting dynamics, as Ginny struggles to relate with Harry, although they do end up together.

linkffn(9824342) is Dumbledore being given a chance to right some wrongs. Well written and rather popular around here.

These are the three that come to mind that are not just Harry going back, but rather from his gen (although Dumbledore is an exception, but its so good I'd be remiss to not include it).

****** 1 is definitely complete, 2 is like 95% complete, 3 idk since I wasn't super interested in molly's perspective.

2 has almost all the main plot done, the author decided to "auction off" the remaining 2 chapters "once ___ author gets x amount of follows I will release the final chp+eplogue" etc to raise awareness of her friend's story or something. But it's been stuck waiting like that since 2015 sooo yea purdy dead. If it's any consolation, the main story of 2 is basically complete. Just missing the conflict resolution for a murder committed during the protag's travels. And the (probably fluffy) epilogue

** Also one where Dudley's memories get sent back to his eleven-year-old body. Completely different vibe from Backwards with Purpose but still an intriguing take. Dudley dursley goes to hogwarts in this new timeline, whereas "original" timeline he was a mid-30s dad sending his daughter to hogwarts. You dont really find out who/what sent him back for a while, book 1 complete book 2 updated as of feb2017.

  Dudley Dursley, 37, has only just put his daughter on the Hogwarts Express and said goodbye when Platform 9 3/4 is attacked. In the ensuing explosion, he blacks out - and wakes up as an eleven year old back in Privet Drive. Confused and wary, he finds himself blundering through his life all over again, and unfortunately, being eleven isn't the only surprise in store.

** Cant believe I forgot this one!

Very well done, harry and hermione (and neville & luna) travel back in time, but in an alternate reality than their original(AU) one. Due to choices made by certain characters years prior to their arrival, almost everyone is different. They want to help defeat voldie in this AU before returning to their original and continue fighting him there. Had some developments I hadn't seen yet in other fics. You really see how worn out the travelers are.
