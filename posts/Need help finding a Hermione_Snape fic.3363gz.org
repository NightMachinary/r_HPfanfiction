I read this fic a few years ago I think, and wanted to read it again - it was a fairly long one, and I vaguely remember that Hermione was obliviated and forgot her relationship with Snape, and then gets pregnant, and the whole thing comes rushing back?

Sorry if this makes no sense, it was a few years back, and I can't find it anywhere!


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1024910/1/][Hinge of Fate]] seems like a a good candidate, but I don't think it fits the description exactly.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2402632/1/][Forget Me Not]] is another Hermione memory loss fic, but only briefly mentions pregnancy I think.

** Could it be Future Imperfect? I never finished it, so I'm not sure if it fits what you were looking for. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10085083/1/Future-Imperfect]]

Edit: Looking at it again, it was only written last year, and isn't very long. Sorry!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3245929/1/Accountable][Accountable]] by Dyce? Not quite obliviation but sounds similar.

** If just go to fanfiction.com and look up Snape/Hermione docs with an M rating... You'll have to wade through stuff but it's probably there.

** Well, you certainly need help if you want to reread a fic that sounds as terrible as that.

*** Haha I've just realised how awful that tiny bit sounds - there was a lot more that went on, that's just the only bit that really stuck in my mind years later!
