(Am I using the right flair?)

My favorite fic isn't majorly popular (the oldest one of the series only have 6K favorites), nor does it have a super original plot, but it is how the plot and the characters develop. I am talking about is the Black Queen series by Silently Watches. (I'm not linking it because there is a plot point about a child brothel, and there are sexual references involving minors. Not sure how much rule 8 is enforced)

The story begins, like many before it, with the night Voldemort decided to attack the Potters. Unlike many others, Charlus Potter was babysitting the twin Potter children. Charlus gave his life for the twins.

One child was raised by Lily and James Potter, in the Light. The other was raised by a runaway witch from Haiti, growing in the Dark.

The actual first chapter starts after the end of Book 3, when Sirius Black tries to find his goddaughter. He takes away from a child brothel (which comes up a few times later, but isn't too much of a major thing). His faith in the Potters have fallen apart due to their abandonment of Jennifer to Petunia Dursley.

He introduced her to Andromeda and Nymphadora Tonks, and Narcissa Malfoy, one of which was a familiar face from the past. She goes to Hogwarts for the fourth year.

That's about all I want to reveal without spoilers. Not a Wrong Boy Who Lived story, interestingly.

It involves sex (not shown, but very directly alluded to), a few trolls, violence, Death, and gore. It definitely deserves the M rating it has.

This is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of story writing. Silently Watches, if you read this, you did a masterful job and I wish you success on further stories (Spells in Silence looks promising!)

It is on Fanfiction and has what looks to be a direct copy by someone else onto AO3.
