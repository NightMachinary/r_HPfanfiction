A lot of the posts on the subreddit are repeats, and the same fanfics are recommended over and over again. I feel like there are lots of good fics that I haven't seen because they have never came up.

What are some good fics that you are seldom able to recommend and have never had the chance to?


** linkao3(6894757) THERMOS!, or, How a Muggle-Born Brought a New Age of Spell-Making to Hogwarts (Entirely by Accident) is a rather silly fic, but I still liked it.

** I can't call this one a guilty pleasure fic because I don't feel guilty about enjoying it, but linkffn(Lotos et Serpentium by the aspiring cynic) fits the bill as something I wouldn't usually recommend. Or read. It's as a time-travel soul bound fic, but it somehow works. A big part of why it works is that the soul bond doesn't automatically make for Twu Wuv. The pairing is also unusual enough to be interesting.

(The only problem is the update rate.)

Two other fics that I inexplicably love are linkffn(By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept by Deco; Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The Carnivorous Muffin). They're both weird. Really weird. And rambling. But they're offbeat, funny, and complex without ever talking down to the audience.

** A linkffn(A Thousand Years of Good Wine) by... I don't remember. And now that I'm going looking for it again, I can't find it. It was a gorgeous fic, absolutely beautiful writing, devastating topic. It was the summer before Sirius ran away, and it detailed his tragic relationship with Regulus. And by tragic, I mean it had incest warnings. But it was so amazingly put together I can still quote it now.

Er. Not to go on and on about it or anything.

I never see linkffn(Snitch! by Al) was always a favorite, but it's so old it isn't recommended anymore, I guess. Harry/Draco, organized crime, and AU after GF because it was written in 2001. Forgotten now, but a genre-definer at the time.

** Linkffn(Duality) is one I don't recommend often. It's a Haphne fic that involves them doing unscrupulous stuff, and actually feeling the significant pressure that comes from working with high stakes and illegal acts.

Linkffn(The Little Veela That Could) is one of the few non-sexual Harry/Gabrielle fics that is both lengthy and complete, and has an interesting twist in its portrayal of veela.

linkffn(4 Out of 5 DADA Professors Recommend) is an amusing fic that features Harry detailing his time at Hogwarts and the staff reading it.

** linkffn(Secret Keeper by Ermalope)

Really liked how the Snape's relationship dynamics with James and Lily was handled. Dumbledore was awesome too. It is unfortunate that Voldemort was painted as a one-dimensional crucio-happy passive antagonistst, which takes the story down from 'very good' to merely 'good'.

  Dumbledore suggests Severus Snape as Secret Keeper for the Potters, which is awkward all around. AU
