Well, this is the first time that I have written Daphne Greengrass for a fic - I know she is mostly Fanon - so I just wanted some feedback on how I've written her so far., also I want some feedback on how my fic is so far for the first chapter.

This is a part of a little series that I have done, in which Harry is adopted/mothered by female magical creatures.

First one being; linkffn(13718923)

  Life at Hogwarts for Harry was challenging, although he was enjoying life much more now that he was there and not at the Dursley's. He only had one good friend in which he confide in by the name of Daphne Greengrass. However, what he didn't know, was that his life would change drastically within the coming months.

  By some twist of fate, the Hungarian Horntail takes an interest in Harry Potter, and thus, it decides to become his new mother, after hearing how badly he was treated at the Dursley's and also at Hogwarts. Nothing will ever make him feel unwelcomed or unwanted again. Not on her scales, and she would make sure of it! [Harry x Mother Hungarian Horntail]
