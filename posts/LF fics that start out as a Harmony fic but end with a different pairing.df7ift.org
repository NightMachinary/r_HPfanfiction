I remember reading a couple of fics that had the reverse and ended up as Harmony (normally with a Manipulative!Weasley bent to it) but never one that started out as a Harmony fic and ended somewhere else. I'm open to any final pairing, but double bonus points if it starts as Harmony and ends as Orange Crush (Hinny). The Harmony aspect can already an established relationship or the work can spend some chapters trying to develop the Harmony relationship, both work for me.

Thanks in advance!


** Ugh, My least favorite type of story... Well, still want to be helpful, and as a mostly Harmony reader I have seen a few of these, the untagged or misleading ones are the WORST.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/288212/1/][Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent]] Starts Harmony ends H/G

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]] Starts Harmony, ends I don't even know.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11637611/1/][The Silent World of Cassandra Evans]] feels like it is going in a harmonious way, but then takes a hard turn to Fem!Harry/Susan Bones.

*** The Psychic serpent really didn't age well.

Personally, never could stand overly complicated love triangles in fics.

**** Agreed on both parts.

Psychic Serpent made me uncomfortable in the beginning with its "beautification" of the main characters (Harry working out for the whole summer, Hermione cutting her hair short and getting a tan). For the most part, I don't like that sort of thing.

I don't want to read about Super Buff Harry winning the heart of a Supermodel that shares a few characteristics of Hermione, I want to read about normal Harry Potter (the scraggly haired teen with glasses) having a good time with Hermione, (the nerdy bushy haired bookworm who only cares for her own appearance on rare special occasions). Giving Harry contacts feels wrong to me, just as much as making Hermione a supermodel that just needs to cut/grow out/have her hair settle with age.

In my mind, the main problem with that sort of fic is most readers have some sort of opinion on how it should turn out, so when the main character is doing stuff with one love interest, a third of the readers aren't happy, and the same with the other love interest.

***** I dislike love triangles because it usually takes away from actual plot. Making the characters more handsome or beautiful just changes the type of story. It's no longer about the underdog, but rather about this perfect figure.

The casual change in attitudes other characters do disgusts me as well.

Don't know why I didn't mention that, maybe I thought it was implied unsaid? But yes, most of the time I would rather be reading action or worldbuilding or fluff, instead of the artificial drama that love triangles add.

******* Eh, sometimes you forget things or deem them implied, when they aren't. I left off a prepositional phrase by accident a few days back and completely disagreed by accident with a post I 100% was behind.

It's why I make an awful tutor.

I love good worldbuilding in these fics. Action tends to try to act fast-paced, but it can't really be so in words.

******** I think I used action a bit wrong there, by action I kinda meant that things are moving along in the plot. More difficulties of communicating on the internet...

But yeah, good worldbuilding is the best.

  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
