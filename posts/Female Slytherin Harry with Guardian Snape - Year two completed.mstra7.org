The second fic in my female Slytherin Harry series (Rachel Snow) with guardian Snape has been completely posted (and the first chapter of year three is up!). Please feel free to ask me any questions you might have about the series!

Year One:

When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

Year Two:

Rachel Snow has a lot to look forward to after her first year at Hogwarts. She's living with Professor Snape - her new guardian - and she has a group of friends who she can't wait to see again. She's ready for her second year at Hogwarts to be full of learning new things, making new friends, and having new adventures. However, her second year isn't without its own problems.

** Is there bashing and/or whitewashing of the way Slytherins often act?

*** No bashing, and Draco is still a brat (about on the same level as in the early books) but Millicent Bulstrode and Theodore Nott are shown as good people.

** Congratulations!

I'm really enjoying your work.

I must admit I was a bit confused with the name of the character, I thought it would be a plot point or something and wasn't very into it but I was on the mood for Snape guardian so I gave it a try. I did not regret it.

I love all the care you put into children psychology, and Rachel's development. The pace is good and most importantly the events of the books happen in a very different manner and still manage to be a very big part of the plot.

I'm so looking forward to the next update! :)

*** Thanks so much for giving it a try, I'm glad you're enjoying it.

I didn't realize there would be this much confusion about her name, but it's definitely too late now. Oh well.

I'm glad that you found that there wasn't too much canon rehashing. I wanted to stay relatively close to canon, but approach it from another angle and have different end results. I really think that canon Harry wouldn't have gotten into so much danger if he'd had a responsible adult around (probably why he didn't).

Thanks again! I update every Saturday.

** Ugh. Why did you completely change the first and last name? Really, not even "Potter"? It's just an OC, not a female Harry. At least own that.

*** Because it's an AU where James' last name is Snow. It's female Harry: she has the same family members, the same backstory, and the same skills.

**** Okay...but then why did you change James' last name arbitrarily? If "everything is still the same" why do that?

***** Because I liked the way it sounded and it works thematically for all the titles in the series. And Snow is the last name of a teacher who saved my life - I wanted to honor her by including her in a project that is very important to me and that I've invested a lot of time and effort into.
