Stories where Harry predicts where Voldemort might be hiding or what he might be doing and then successfully acts on said revelations. Stories where harry sufficiently redefines conflicts to the point that the force Voldemort brought is no longer effective. Stories where Harry does something sufficiently unexpected and Voldemort has no answer.

I am NOT looking for Harry has super powers Harry amasses political power Harry trains REALLY hard

Stories that have said elements are fine as long as harry is not winning BECAUSE of them.

Examples of what I am looking for are: Harry tricks Voldemort into walking into a trap Harry accepts that Voldemort is immortal and prepares a fate worse than death instead of trying to kill him harry has preemptively disrupted Voldemort's support structure so thoroughly that Voldemort Never gets resurrected Harry is able to predict Voldemort's moves and counter them to the point that Voldemort is left reacting to Harry rather than acting on his own initiative

I'm also happy to hear about any stories that feature Voldemort being defeated by things other than magic or dramatic battle. e.g. Someone shot Voldemort with a sniper rifle when he left his tent to contemplate the stars on the eve of The Final Battle. creative applications of the laws of physics excessive force (nuke, pinpoint asteroid drop, etc)

Anyway, thanks in advance :)


** I remember a fic where when Voldemort tried to resurrect himself with Harry's blood, "forcibly taken", Harry /willingly/ gave Voldemort his blood. It messed up the ritual and weakened Voldemort allowing Harry to defeat him later. Sorry, I don't remember the name.

*** linkffn(Oh God Not Again! by Sarah1281) is a pretty good fic in which Harry gave his blood willingly which messed up the ritual. It's also a very humorous fic with Harry unwillingly time travelling and being a little shit and I love it.

** There was a fic by Brennus where he had destroyed all of the horcruxes without Voldemort knowing and he made an oath with Voldemort to be able to leave the country and that Voldemort wouldn't attack abroad till Harry dies of natural causes.

Since Voldemort was mortal without his knowing, he would just die of old age unable to attack Harry because of the oath.

** Thanks for the suggestions so far, please keep them coming. Here are a few stories I found through my own searching. They will hopefully give people an idea of what kinds of stories to suggest and help out anyone else looking for something to read. linkffn(11669575) This story is called 'For the Love of Magic'. Harry is proactive, cunning and completely ruthless. It is good but it features a very powerful Harry so it isn't quite what I am looking for right now. linkffn(3885086) This isn't so much a story as a series of rewrites of scenes from cannon. It is called 'Almost a Squib' and unsurprisingly features a Harry without much magic. Harry makes up for his lack of power with cleverness and planning. It is very much what I was looking for but is sadly very short and by its nature disjointed.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
