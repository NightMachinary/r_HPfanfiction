Tom spends the war at Bletchley Park, figuring out how to crack the enigma to defeat the Nazis during the day and studying dark magic to defeat Grindelwald during the night. Working with the country's brightest mathematicians (and a primitive computer) helps a lot in figuring out the arithmancy to stabilize dark rituals. The fact that they're muggles doesn't matter, there's only power and those too weak or stupid to seize it. And being able to listen in on all enemy conversations is extremely powerful.

Potential for Tom Riddle/Alan Turing slash. I don't think anyone's done this pairing before. Edit: I have been proven wrong. Never underestimate the internet.

He could potentially not have heard about the atomic bomb. And then bombs in general? In his day, they whistled and you could hear/see the plane(s) coming. Not to mention the air-raid sirens. Nowadays? You wouldn't even see or hear the jets until they already passed, if they even used jets.

And the effects from that many horcruxes could have lead him to believing that he was above Muggle weaponry. Or they wouldn't effect him.

***** My own headcanon is /entirely/ on board with Riddle knowing just how dangerous the muggles could be. It's why he used purebloods for his power-fantasy trip: if he'd gone for a muggleborn revolution to get his megalomaniac jollies there was every chance that they'd go Grindelwald on him and the results would be un-pretty.

There's also the fact that his muggle life consisted of an underfunded orphanage up until his 14th birthday and homelessness after, that being the age you were expected to fend for yourself in those days. Borgin & Burke was his summer job that kept a roof over his head when Hogwarts was closed.

*** That's why I dislike mugglewanky methods of beating him. He ultimately decided magic had more potential, and his talent lay with it instead of muggle science, but he is very much paranoid enough to have defenses against any muggle weapon he knows.

- Automatic shield charms on his person that activate on gunshots and only stop kinetic energy.

- enchantments that prevent large-scale combustion around his bases.

- alert charms for radioactive material, and specifically developed transfiguration spells to neutralize them.

- Specialized enchantments that make any sort of bomb bounce off the building and surrounding land, perhaps even back towards the plane that dropped it and/or the cannon that fired it

- anti-kinetic charms that rob any physical projectile faster than human movement speed of its energy

etc etc. Beating voldemort with muggle weapons is ludicrous.

**** While I equally agree mugglewank method are generally lame, I feel like you're delving into a big grey area of Harry Potter. One, is that magic you mentioned even possible in cannon? And secondly is Voldemort really that way because he was a well thought out villain, or is it because that's the way JK made him when it was still a children's novel?

I think it's more ludicrous that JK never had anyone try muggle methods in the book. At least she could have ruled it out then. Desperate people would try anything.

** Wouldn't that make him hate all muggles even more, though? When he sees what they've done across the globe he could just go: "They obviously can't rule themselves and need to be subjugated for their own good."

Voldemort never struck me as very patriotic. He killed lots of British wizards. Why would he suddenly protect the muggles? Hell, he never even cared about his Death Eaters. Helping the war effort would require selflessness and empathy that Voldemort simply lacks.

Then he'd think of how Dumbledore could probably stop Grindelwald and end everything right now and comes to the conclusion that clearly Dumbledore doesn't care when people die, and consider not returning after his O.W.L.s and studying the dark arts on his own. He'd still need a place to stay so he applies for the mysterious job just to see what it is, and after realizing just how powerful information is in a war he decides to join just to get revenge on the Nazis that almost killed him.

**** Oh, you could do some gorgeous character development with that.

Tom hates the Nazis for very selfish reasons at first: Fucked up his summer, almost killed him. A petty grudge really. Then he joins Bletchley Park and is surrounded with people who have deeper reasons for fighting against them, trying to help end the war. Their families, friend, love for queen and country. Tom scoffs at that at first, but he comes to understand, then emphasize, then adopt some of their motivations.

Then in 42 the allies first get information on the holocaust. Tom, sneaky SOB he is, gets his hands on it. Morbidly fascinated he starts studying nazi ideology, about the master race and the inferior sub-humans, and suddenly makes a startling connection:

That sounds a hell of a lot like his own thoughts about wizards and muggles.

That's unsettling. He rationalizes, of course. He's not going to just... go around and kill muggles. (Did the nazis start out planning to kill everyone they deemed unworthy? asks a little voice in his head.) Hitler's delusions of grandeur have nothing in common with his past plans for immortality. (Or do they?) The way he was collecting... followers in school, the way he enjoyed their groveling and how easy they were to manipulate to do things they would have never done on their own... that's nothing like the power Hitler holds over Germany. (But is it though?)

Finally, painfully, he comes to the realization how close he came to descending into madness and inhumanity. Horcruxes! How low had he sunken to even consider something so disgusting! It's not like he didn't read the warnings about horcruxes mutilating the soul in incomprehensible ways.

He just didn't care.

He's changed forever and swears to cage the animal parts of his personality that almost condemned himself to a half life, more beast than man. Man, not wizard or muggle, truly, who cares about that anyway.

Dumbledore understood, he musses. While Tom was gallivanting down the path to demise, Dumbledore saw it for what it was and tried to stop him. Perhaps he even really cared.

He ought to write him a letter and reassure him he came to his senses in time.

***** Dear Professor Dumbledore

You were right, murdering innocent people is stupid. While you spent the last few years doing nothing, the Nazis and Grindelwald's wizards killed millions. I happened to have a good source of information on what was going on on the continent, both muggle and magical, so I was able to keep track.

I also happened to have some very clever people here who helped me with the arithmancy that I needed to develop a new dark curse. I spent the past few months testing it on Grindelwald's soldiers, it works like a charm. Don't worry, they were definitely not innocent.

According to my sources, Grindelwald himself is going to be inspecting a dark ritual site near Vienna on Friday. Meet me at the following coordinates at 10:30 and we can ambush him together.

Tom
