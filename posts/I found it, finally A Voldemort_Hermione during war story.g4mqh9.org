So, about eight months ago, I made a post here asking about a particular fanfic, a voldemort/hermione fanfic. Those who answered it couldn't help me, although they where very solicit.

Anyway, to the future reader(s) that'll come looking for something to read, this is it. Maybe it really was in another post here, but I'll never know. Enough about that, let's talk plot! The fic is a sequel of another, and overall is better than the first one in my opinion, the writer seems to have matured his/her writing style since the first story.

After a traumatic stay in Voldemort's fortress, Hermione, now older and working as a healer, or Medicus as the story calls it, is part of an Order that helps anyone who has enough money, regardless of who the client may be. Our Dark Lord asks specifically for Hermione to be his Medicus, for the duration of his life till his death. That means that any Medicus/patient duo will form a strong emotional bond, because, as the rules dictate, the Medicus must do anything and everything to ensure the patient's survival. The internal conflict that Hermione feels is very "organic", very human and is what keeps the story moving - well, that and wanting to find out what will happen: will Voldemort perish by the hands of morality and ethics of a key piece in the war or will this piece save him and change the course of (canon) history? Also, will the very same emotions and humanity make Voldemort change, even a little, or will he remain ruthless and always in search of immortality?

I don't know how to post links here, so forgive me... The first fanfic is Abyss and it's sequel is Ascent, both by Lunalelle, on ff.net.

If it interests you who read this wall of text till here, I wish you a happy reading!

P.S: Writing this on a phone screws with the text formatting, sorry about that. P.P.S: If there are any grammar, meaning or word mistake please ignore it, as English is not my first language.
