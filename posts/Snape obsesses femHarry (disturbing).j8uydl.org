I don't think I've ever read a long story than a chapter about Snape and his complicated relationship with fem!Harry, so that idea came up at least for the first 3 books and I would like opinions, suggestions.... I know it's *disturbing* *+and thats the point+* but it's a interesting idea? Is it worth the effort? I think of giving her a personality that makes this closeness inevitable since the same canon Harry personality will not work so if you want to call this ooc its ok:

- fem! H has dark hair but is very similar to Lily, in personality too but she is even more compassionate and welcoming to what is weird, she is like Newt. She is not a boyish. She's really beautiful, charming and studious, but she doesn't see herself like that, Petunia completely destroyed her self-esteem, so she identifies with the outsiders

- Now she is closer to maternal figures and has difficulty making friends easily, she is very quiet and insecure (James and Lily's flame will awaken at some point)

- Upon arriving at Hogwarts, Snape is completely disturbed by the resemblance and completely ignores her

- She is a /hufflepuff/ and is well received there, but other girl students from other houses may be furious because girls are cruel -periodt-, especially Pansy and her friends. and just coz the protagonist needs to suffer

- She loves potions and is intrigued because the teacher ignores her and tries to approach silently to learn more and gradually he accepts this approach

- As she gets into lethal troubles he goes into overprotective mode but gradually it evolves into an uncontrolled obsession and he starts to feel jealous of her male friends and tries to keep her from people he feels fear or hate like Sirius and Remus. As she never received direct or indirect care she just accepts

*Snape is not my favorite character so I am afraid to ruin his character and turn him into a criminal or an angel, I just think he is an adult emotionally stucked in a 15-year-old emotional and I want to work it.

Any thoughts?


** It's an interesting concept of how Snape probably would react to a female Harry (I do think he would be disturbing/off about it), and there's been a few one shots over the years following this trend. One was with an alive Lily and James and him fixating on their daughter.

I do think in a story it would be unrealistic---even in fanon version---for Dumbledore to be like "okay, it's fine for you to spend time alone with Harry." Even in canon professors don't really spend one on one time with students, and Dumbledore was aware of his fixation on Lily and the occulemency lessons seem like the exception rather than the rule....or for Harry to meekly accept her teacher dictating who she spends time with. It might be more interesting since she would spend more time/bond with her classmates first, if more disturbing in a sense, if Harry clearly views him as a Flitwick like figure (a person to respect but who they are not particularly close to) and isn't particularly attached to him but he in turn develops an attachment towards her that people eventually pick up on.
