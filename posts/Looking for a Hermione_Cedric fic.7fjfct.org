In this fic, Cedric lives but spends time unconscious at St. Mungos. Hermione comes to visit him every day; when he eventually wakes up, he and Hermione become close and then fall in love. It has an unfinished sequel, and Umbridge is in the first one. Sorry I don't have any better description, but any thoughts appreciated.

  The-Boy-Who-Almost-Died has to figure out what it means that he didn't. Harry's tumultuous 5th year at Hogwarts is Cedric's 7th and final. Bound together by shared trauma, both boys fall under Ministry suspicion ... Who is Cedric Diggory? Cedric!Lives AU
