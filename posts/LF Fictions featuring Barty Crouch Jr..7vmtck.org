Recently, I read the excellent The Well Groomed Mind by Lady_Khali ([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/427653/chapters/719529]]). It features a version of Barty Crouch Jr that turns out to be very close to my own and reading it also really helped with writing inspiration. I don't want to give spoilers, but aside from his general tone and manner, he possesses the full range of canon attributes - raw power, extreme intelligence etc., which most people seem to overlook or forget about, without the stereotypical craziness which is more a product of the movies.

For various reasons, I haven't really read HP fiction aside from the odd one or two in recent years, so my knowledge is very out of date. I don't think I came across a similar version back when I did read them regularly, either. Search filters haven't been much help, because they don't allow me to exclude anything. (Where did the Regulus trend even come from? So much trudging.) So I thought I'd ask if anyone knew of any that I could read my way through when inspiration is needed. I'd prefer to avoid romances but some form of redemption or overall greyness would be helpful. I'd also quite like it if he didn't end up dead or kissed.

Does anybody by chance know of any fictions that might fit?

Thanks in advance.


** I intend to use Barty in my story, but haven't quite gotten there yet. Best of luck with yours! What is it, pray tell?

*** Thanks. :) I'm still working out the details, it's more the ghost of a concept at the moment. It's not really traditional fiction, but I'm still looking into how something like what I have in mind might work.

****** 'Ello! I thought I'd keep you updated on thing. Barty has been up to a /lot/ of things. Most recently he's broken all the other Death Eaters out of Azkaban. By himself.

******* He's one of the very few characters that I'd believe could do it.

** No recs because I came here to recommend The Well Groomed Mind based on the title... It's such a great fic and after I finished it I tried to find anything with similar Barty too. Didn't really find anything.
