** Non-angsty Harry?! What is this madness?

In all honesty, I completely see your point. Most long stories are either angsty or smut fests - in some cases, both. However, a counter-argument is that more subtle emotions are really hard to write/convey without going completely fluff or having the pacing be too fast.

  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. M for later. Eventual Hinny.

Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected. Now, not really sure what to do, he decides to see what time will bring.Perhaps a change in the Ministry won't be too bad.

** The two things I can't stand are angst and politics so I have a whole list of suggestions. The following are complete and above 100k words:

​

Fantastic elves and where to find them linkffn(8197451)

This and its sequel form a fairly self contained novel length piece. Harry is definitely an elf, he has the ears to prove it and will shoot anyone who says otherwise. As a real elf, Harry believes that angst, depression and the like are for lesser races like humans, goblins, werewolves and anything else that isn't an elf.

​

For Love of Magic linkffn(11669575)

This story drags on in places and has a lot of smut. But it is complete and enormous. It features an evil Harry who slowly falls into darkness but is pretty cool with that. No angst that I recall.

​

weeb linkffn(12350003)

Harry is a weabo. 120k words. Obviously comedic, rehashing cannon, not a whole lot of angst.

​

Moving to incomplete stories I can offer a few more:

​

Harry the Hufflepuff linkffn(6466185)

A series of 3.3 books so far and about 50k words. If it ever finishes (sadly looking less likely) it should hit 100k.

No angst. Angst is effort and Harry is against that. Well written, comedic, cannon rehashing.

​

The Fire that swallowed the world linkao3(15832620)

Still in the early stages and already at 70k words.

Harry is a fire elemental fused into the body of a little girl.

Turns out fire elementals aren't big on Angst .

​

Harry is a dragon and that's okay linkffn(13230340)

Over 250k words and still going strong.

What it says on the tin. HP is a dragon, human sized and for some reason I can't fathom still dressed in robes and glasses. No angst, captures the whimsy of the first book and runs with it, light hearted but not played entirely for laughs, well written, wholesome I guess. If you don't find the initial premise too distracting this might be worth a look.

  Harriet Potter died at one year old. What was left of her slogged through life, alive in body and mind but not soul. Six years later she was finally cremated. This is not the story of Harriet Potter. This is the story of the brilliant flame who inherited her place, and her journey in the strange world of humans.*****Harriet is trapped, surrounded by humans, and painfully easy to extinguish if she doesn't keep her flames hidden. After the Dursleys, Hogwarts is a step up for her, but now she has to unravel the mysteries surrounding the body she stole and fight to survive against a monster who may be even less human than she is.One by one, Harriet's friends will find that they are playing with fire, and the price of failure is greater than they ever could have known.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequenes of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
