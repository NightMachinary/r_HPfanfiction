Fem!Harry is fine. Femslash is fine. I don't like slash though.

This is however very much just a starting point for the story. The main part has nothing to do with the betrayal.

*** I do not forgive, I do not forget!

God, I almost dropped the fic right there when I read that. Honestly, Harry could have dropped a "motherfucker" in that line and it would have made it better.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** Harry forgave Hermione in this one. But take my upvote anyways, as this was one of the first HP fanfictions I read - and additionally one of my favorites.
