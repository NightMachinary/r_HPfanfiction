I want to find as many bellatrix/harry fics as i can, be they good or bad, smutty or not, don't care, I just want to find as many as possible.\\
Although, to help me prioritise the order i shall be reading them in, a rating out of 1-10, or simply a few words about what you think of the fic would be amahzing!


** Harry Potter and the Turning of the Sun.

The Harry/Bella pairing isn't really all that great in that one, and the writing is less than stellar, but the rest of the story's pretty cool.

** Delenda Est and Wind Shear come to mind right now. The first one is quite good, although I didn't really like the ending, and the second is not very good, and the ending was kind of stupid and rushed

*** Delenda Est is great. Personally, I think the chapters set in the past are god-tier, while the chapters in the present are truthfully kinda meh.

There's only so much "It's Harry Ashworth!" I can take before I feel like I'm reading the Crucible.

*** I second this recommendation. Delenda Est wasn't the best fic objectively, but I really enjoyed it. I have to agree that the ending was not really satisfying.

I would only recommend Wind Shear to someone who really wants to read every decent Harry/Bella fic. Though the FF.net version hasn't really progressed there yet. I wasn't really impressed by the fic.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

**** Chilord originally wrote Wind Shear for zetaboards.com. The ffn version has added materials, and went through a beta. Though he seems to be doing less editing recently. [[http://s3.zetaboards.com/FanFictionFederation/topic/7651592/1/#new][Here's]] the link if you want it, but zetaboard requires registration to view fics.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
