So, it's established in canon that spells only require lots of practice to get right, along with strict pronunciation accuracy (the intent-power-focus thing seems to be purely fanon). Does that mean Harry could actually practice spells over the holidays, by waving a random stick as best he can and repeating the pronunciation until he can memorise it, then repeating those actions with magic and his wand when he's back at Hogwarts? Opinions on whether it'd be interesting or workable, does it fit canon, general thoughts, etc?

Like the old way of memorising the times-tables. "One times one is one, one times two is two, two times two is four" etc, where you'd memorise the basics so that you could do useful stuff by adding more onto it later. He'd memorise the movement and pronunciation at Privet Drive, then add in the magic at Hogwarts.


** No.

In the first book it says

#+begin_quote
  'there was a lot more to magic than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.'
#+end_quote

We don't really know what the 'lot more' is but you don't seem to account for it. The intent stuff seems to spring from this combined with what we know about silent casting, that being clear focus. People know there is more but since we don't actually know what it is people keep grasping in the dark for ideas.

*** That doesn't mean that magic isn't about waving a wand and saying funny words though. To an eleven year old learning precise wand movements and exact pronunciations is a lot more than just "waving" a wand and saying some "funny words"

*** Fair. But well, how do I account for something I don't know the identity of?

And that was a thing? All I remembered of Non-verbal casting was that it was basically normal casting, only you had to say the incantation precisely in your head instead of verbally. The only time I remember intent coming into spellcasting was Crouch-Moody talking about the Killing Curse being useless without intent.

**** According to Snape in HBP, the actual chapter called HBP,

#+begin_quote
  ...in their spell casting. Not all wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of concentration and mind power which some lack.
#+end_quote

You could say Snape is a bad teacher and ignore this but with regards to silent casting that is what he has to say about it.

How do you account for it? Well that's up to you. You can do what the intent people do and try and whip up your own secret sauce or you can do what JKR does and skip those bits in a way that feels as natural as possible. You aren't trying to teach us magic you're trying to achieve something with a scene. What can you SHOW us that conveys that Harry is studying and practicing without TELLing what he's reading/has read/has been told about? The how of magic isn't nearly as important in Harry Potter as the story that's told.

***** Nah, the dude isn't a bad teacher, just an bitter twat. I'd accept what he says.

That's a really interesting thought. I've not heard anyone put it quite like that before. Magic isn't just a tool in a Watsonian sense, it's a tool in a Doylist sense too. Guess it's the D&D DM in me that's slightly off about the latter, but it's certainly interesting.

But I mean, sure it isn't as important, but it's still important. It doesn't irritate you that she sets her rules of Magic (whether explicit or implicit) then breaks them to the point that the original scene no longer makes sense? eg. James and Co have an external secret keeper despite Bill and Arthur both demonstrating that they can cast the spell on their own homes (and that Bill can share Arthur's secret, but I'll accept that's just an error Rowling's increasingly less hard-working editor didn't catch).

****** Given how a jinx was defined in the first book by Hermione with regards to the bucking broom and how we see jinxes later, even within that book JKR always played a bit loose with her magic system. When it comes down to it, JKR is perhaps the greatest story teller of all time but she is not the greatest writer. Is it frustrating. I guess, I like knowing how things work, I have a master's in engineering because I like knowing how things work but I also believe that trying to nail down exactly how it works takes the magic out of it. I like the idea that a lot of magic had vague symbolism behind it and that contributes to the lack of logic. If you could break magic down logically then the lack of logic amongst wizards would be a bigger deal.

I've always said JKR got bigger than her editors by the four book which is why the fourth book and onwards bloat so much. By that point she was a household name and people became hesitant to change her work.

******* To preface this: what I've written may come off as combative in some places, but that's unintended. I'm just thoroughly baffled by your view and trying to ask questions that would help me understand. Apologies for it being a bit long.

It's not about telling us how it works. It's just having the rules for internal narrative consistency - a solid foundation to build the story off of. If she kept it magical and mysterious in the books, then released some kind of 'non-fiction' fiction tome to tell us the rules of magic, I'd be fine with that.

I just feel that... setting limits on a magic system is what makes a story with magic, especially powerful magic like the HP Universe has, challenging. Knowing what a character can't do is part of what gives a story tension, gives the characters a point to struggle to. Like that 'Magic can't make true love' thing - if a character is then trying to get someone to fall in love with them, they have to work for it rather than just waving their wand, but magic can still be used in support of that goal (transfiguring plants to give to them, or making fireworks or some shit). Thus, plot and tension and struggle. If we then find out that their buddy has used magic to make someone fall in love with them, doesn't that make the first person's struggle and whole plot less to you? It doesn't mean there's lack of logic in magic, just lack of logic in people. We don't have to see the rules, but as people who use magic to do things, they should know how to use the things they're using.

Everyone always aims at someone to cast a spell in their direction, for example. Rule, and obedience, and thus consistency. We don't know why you need to physically aim, since you could theoretically just as equally give mental targeting in your mind ('think hitting that guy over there with the spell and don't move').

'cause that's the basic argument for Rowling's inconsistency in magic being a bad thing. Breaking the old rules that made an action reasonable, makes that action illogical. If the Potters could've kept their own secret like Bill and Arthur did (ie. the logical action, permitted by the spell, that most people who want to live would take), then literally none of the plot would've happened. Or it could've, but it'd've needed to have happened in a better way. That's why most people see her breaking her own rules as a bad thing. It makes her characters seem suicidally moronic. She's the only writer I really know that sets rules, implicit or explicit, then breaks them so thoroughly later on. I honestly wouldn't be surprised to hear she wrote each book as a single thing and never reread any of her old books for fact checks and continuity.

I do agree with you that, in the narrative/story itself, having the spells be symbolic and irrational works far better both as a plot and as a setting-support (wizards be cray-cray), but that doesn't preclude her from having rules that she knows herself that form the framework of that ill-logic. Vague symbolism is great and mysterious, but it has to cover some kind of consistent undertone or it renders the actions of the people who use that magic in a way that's stupider than the spell allows moot. Do you really find that, as an itemising example, the Potters not having one of them be the secret keeper (which Bill and Arthur both demonstrated was possible) was a really, really stupid decision that brought their death upon them and could've been avoided if they used the spell as the 'rules' of the spell said it could be?

Oh, and very much agreed on the editorial note. I imagine arguing with her at that point could be quite intimidating.

** I would say that, according to canon, correct casting of a spell requires exact pronunciation and precise wand movements. As such, practicing at home should be completely practical.

That being said, without any feedback from an instructor or from actually feeling the magic cast, it might be difficult to be sure that one is practicing right. Practice makes permanent. Perfect practice makes perfect. I would imagine that the benefit of such practice at home would not be so much in learning new spells but in developing higher levels of muscle memory for already known spells

**** I can't imagine how he would get that feedback in a canon situation. That being said, I thought of a decent analogy. It would be like practicing piano on a keyboard without speakers. Even if you have already "learned" a piece, practicing helps make the finger movements muscle memory so you don't hit the wrong key when it matters. It's not as effective as being able to hear, but if you know what is right, and you know the ways you often slip up, you can practice without the feedback.

You can also practice a new piece that you haven't played before and start to learn it. The better you are at playing piano, the less likely you are to accidentally make a mistake, and there is no guarantee that you will, but there is still the chance that you do practice a mistake over and over again and when you go to actually perform, find yourself slipping up.

In a fic I imagine this would work best with Harry or main character, practicing during the summer and occasionally developing bad habits that they have to overcome once back at school. As they get older though they are more capable of getting it right from instructions and magic less practice alone. A good implementation would be them practicing easy spells that they may not have learned during earlier years rather than struggling with spells that will most likely need teacher support.

***** True. Though, I wonder if that feedback would come under the Operational Security justification when Harry wasn't really told much during the holidays. People did still message him in canon, after all. Just not on the war.

I like that analogy. It makes very clear sense. If it was combined with Jasoneill23's comment elsewhere in this thread, about each individual spell being like learning a new skill, I think a really good description could be built from that. Each spell is like learning a different and unfamiliar tune on the piano, so you can learn a Forte piece but not know what Accelerando means until you're taught and can then apply that to learning new music in that style. Then you get a piano (wand) that's tuned to sound really well when playing Jazz, but sounds less good when playing EDM. You have to kind of learn a lot of different skills with not much overlap, then overlap them later on to cast, to put it another way.

I like the bad habits idea. Could also work with Harry's mindset to discourage him initially from more boring academics and help reconstruct him in a more academically-favourable-cliche manner instead of the 'he's suddenly not lazy now, hurrah!' way some choose. :)

** I like to think of it as each individual spell being more like learning a new skill. Say you are learning to ride a bike. You can peddle all you want on a stationary bike, you could tey a balance bike all you like but at some point you need to put them together and that takes practice to get the nack of and perfect. Once you have it though, it almost comes naturally and can be done without thinking.

The same goes for spells in that no matter how well you can pronounce the words or wave your wand it comes down to just practicing. Everybody learns at a different pace, somethings come quickly whilst others take time but once you have it down it will always come easily.

So the answer I think is that no, Harry couldn't practice with a pencil and then do spells for the first time perfectly in class or in a battle. He could study all he wants but in the end it comes down to practice to get the balance just right

*** I like it. I think linking it with Kingsonne's comment elsewhere in this thread could make a really good structure for Rowling-Magic. They compare it to learning piano. The better you are at piano (magic), the more likely you are to learn new pieces (spells) without mistakes. But, like you said, there are different skills in Magic (so, learning to arch your hands properly, learning to read sheet music, learning the technical terms, hearing musical tone/pitch properly, etc) that you have to add together to learn new spells, and that makes it more difficult. But once those skills are gained and the combination done right, you can get spells easier.

Plus, you can get instruments tuned for different styles of music and playing environments. Grand pianos are better for classical pieces in grand halls, while electronic keyboards are better for EDM in clubs. So, you get wands that are better at transfiguration and wands that are better at healing, etc.

Thank you for weighing in!

*** I mean sure, but canon explicitly says that saying the incantation wrong can change the spell you cast (wizard Baruffio anecdote) and we constantly make jokes about Hermione (who supposedly is our 'hyper-studious' model to base magical practice off of) making a point to correct pronunciation and casting the spell correctly due to it.

Personally, I prefer the Belief-Power-Intent type systems than Rowling's 'Learning a Spell is like buying a slightly-more-esoteric Power Tool' approach. If it had been the former, I suspect we'd have a proper Harry Potter Tabletop RPG by now, rather than the crappy converted ones we have to run with.

** While the idea is sound, there remains a few problems.

1. The dursleys loathe anything to do with magic, so it is doubtful that they would allow him anything even remotely resembling a wand. Also it is can on canonically known (at least to my recollection) that they lock away all of his school-related items(books, broom, etc.) In the cupboard(his former room).

2. If he were to practice the incantations, unless he were directed by a book on the exact pronunciation, he could be pronouncing them incorrectly. With improper pronunciation, we would have another Seamus Finnegan to deal with. We get a prime example of this in SS when Seamus's seemingly innocuous pronunciation leads to rather destructive consequences. One of my favorite teachers saying was- "Imperfect practice doesn't make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect."

***** I mean, it's hard for me to accept that 'saying the magic words properly is very important, too' doesn't mean saying the magic words is very important, but you really do have a point on the accents - maybe that's why Scottish students are a minority in Hogwarts, the brogue makes spellcasting impossible. I grew up in Scotland and I know I couldn't've pronounced Wingardium Leviosa properly when I was a kid. :D

Maybe that's why Hagrid can cast silently despite being expelled in his third year. The accent made it wholly necessary. :D

Though, you're right that Buffalo guy was an amusing anecdote-warning rather than an anecdote about the actual spell, as the mistake he made wasn't even possible with the spell they were learning (Wingardium Leviosa).
