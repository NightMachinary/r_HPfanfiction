I'm doing a fic where Voldemort went to Hufflepuff instead of Slytherin, and his target for recruitment are Hufflepuffs, muggle borns and half-bloods, those of not-obviously English heritage and basically anyone who might be discriminated against.

I don't want to use Death Eaters, but I can't think of a good name for his group. Suggestions would be much appreciated. Thank you!


** I think it makes sense to create a villain whose goal was basically the magical version of Communism, which demanded the overthrow of traditional houses, confiscation of hereditary wealth, and 'dictatorship' of the masses. The name would most likely be drawn from Muggle inspirations, so anything containing 'people', 'front', and 'liberation' would be fine.

*** I believe Rowling originally thought of "Knights of Walpurgis" for the DE. Could work in this story, I like the "Knights of..." for Hufflepuffs.

** The Community - Hufflepuff loyalty implied and vague enough to use in normal conversation without getting caught/sense of mystery.

** His movement is the "Socialist Nation against Tyranny and Aristocracy" or for short: SoNaTA. And his followers are "The Symphonists"

In his youth, in the orphanage, Voldemort was influenced by Lenin and Marx. The Internationale shall rule the wizarding world.

*** Well, they're bad enough that when every single follower pled imperius, new laws were drafted to put the worst of the worst (Amelia Bones and Andromeda Tonks to name a few) in Azkaban anyway, over "fear of implanted suggestions". They're not evil toward their own side. In fact it's more of a giant, culty family where devotion to Riddle is fanatic and undying and passed down like a religion. To their enemies however? Yeah, there's a reason they tried to lock up as many of them as possible.

** The Order of the Black and Gold and his most loyal can be called The Cete.

Edit: He could also call them The Bolsheviks or some other communist based name/ideology where purebloods wouldn't understand the reference.

** Well, I'll take an idea from one of the fanfics I've read and say “[Hufflepuffian] Shadow Council”.

Or have them as a whole be “[Hufflepuffian] Shadow Army” or “[Hufflepuffian] Shadow Conspiracy”, and leave the above title for the inner circle.

** Well with Hufflepuff, we know they are Loyal, we know, from Sprout and Tonks that they value simplicity and eccentricity in equal measure.

Companions of Vol

Makes sense, declares their loyalty on their sleeve to anyone in the know.

Doorbellers

Could be a reference to some sort of door to door protection racket. Or any number of other things. Even perhaps an attempt at self-deprecation that became a horror story, like a pureblood family just installed a doorbell, and a recruit rings it before busting down the door, alerting the entire house, causing a failure of a raid, with massive losses on both sides. Essentially in the ranks it would be, "Don't be a Doorbeller," and out of the ranks it'd be a fearful utterance, "The Doorbellers aren't due today."
