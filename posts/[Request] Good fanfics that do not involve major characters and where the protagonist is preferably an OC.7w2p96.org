  Todd Ollivander can't seem to shake his feelings for the new apprentice at his father's wand shop. It's not a good time to be distracted, as it's becoming clearer and clearer that Ollivander's is a major target of Lord Voldemort's during the First Wizarding War.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

** There's always the Alexandra Quick series by Inverarity, which takes place in America and involves no canon characters at all. Voldemort is mentioned once, and that's it.

If that's too detatched from the books, Inverarity also wrote one of my favourite fanfics ever, Hogwarts Houses Divided, which is about Teddy Lupin's first year at Hogwarts. Harry, as Teddy's godfather, is still an important character in the fic, mind you, but he's strictly a secondary character... and most of the main chars are OCs. The story itself is also really good, based around the Sorting Hat's last-ditch attempt to get the Hogwarts houses to get along by basically saying "look, either you stop these stupid inter-house rivalries, or I quit the Sorting business!"
