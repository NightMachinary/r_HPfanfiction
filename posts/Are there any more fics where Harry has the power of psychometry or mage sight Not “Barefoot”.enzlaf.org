  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** That's the most retarded synopsis I've ever read...

If I had such a spell I would send back my more loyal followers to start a hidden cult, creating a secret army, so they can reappear to support me once their time catches up with the present.

Sending your enemies to the past seems like gifting them your head...

**** The only logical justification would be if time operated under a time loop philosophy which would make the past set in stone.

Under those rules the 'current' Voldemort would know that a 'future' Voldemort has already sent a 'future' Harry back and it didn't negatively effect anything up to that point in 'current' Voldemort's history.

The main downside to this tactic though is that you give your enemy years to plan. The plans themselves couldn't really even start until you've already been sent back, as operating knowledge up until that point needs to remain the same, but this could be counteracted if you send them back far enough. What kind of intricate 'plan' can survive centuries of time and happenstance without a cog of that plan failing to turn.

As for evidence of time operating this way, we have the time turners in book 3 and the insistence by Hermione that they shouldn't even TRY to change what they already know happens.

***** Not just plan, in book 3 they did a lot more precisely because it had already happened, they just hadn't been aware of it.

Voldemort risks this happening to him, as he's clearly not omniscient. Perhaps a second after he send hims back, Older!Harry finishes a spell he learnt in the past on the horcruxes and kills him.

After all Voldemort's advantage in canon came from age and experience, why give Harry time to catch up?

****** Oh, no doubt that it's not the best plan, but the main cons are mitigated the further back you send someone.

For instance, if you send someone back 1,000 years under the 'time loop' style of time travel, what could that person actually do to you? What kind of plans or preparations could survive the march of 1,000 years? Could you actually enact vengeance when you are so far removed from your target?

Overall I think the main failure of the plan in the summary is that it was only 200 years, that's still arguably close enough time wise to have an impact.

******** But not necessarily due to the premise, but to the execution of that premise.

Imagine if it was something like this. Voldemort finds a ritual that allows him to remotely send Harry back 1,000 years. A ritual that's possible due to a combination of the brother wands they share, and because Voldemort is willing to sacrifice his own wand as a requirement; and also sacrifice the protection of blood he stole during his re-birthing ritual. Voldemort would in essence see it as turning the things that caused his failure in the graveyard into his success in removing the threat.

But the ritual doesn't go as planned, instead of it sending Harry back 1,000 years, it's only 200. This is due to the fact that Harry has more than just his own soul, he also has the fragment of Voldemort's with him. The soul tether is enough for it to only partially work.

Now, Harry isn't so far back in history that he can't plan or prepare against Voldemort. Before that though, he must figure out what happened and why. He needs to delve into the nature of his connections to Voldemort and in doing so discovers the soul fragment within himself and the concept of horcruxes in general.

Overall, I find the above a perfectly plausible unpacking of the synopsis which could make for a compelling setup to a story.

** There's always [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/lovegoods-guide-to-lovecraftian-horrors-hp-oc-si-ish.388120/][Lovegood's Guide to Lovecraftian Horrors]]. The MC is Luna's insane older brother whose mind was fractured at a young age, combining two personalities into a singular one. Slytherin meets Lovegood and chaos runs rampant as a result. A few chapters in, he dabbles in runes and gains Mage Sight. Unfortunately, Mage Sight wasn't meant to be turned on 24/7 and Sol Lovegood begins to notice... things that notice him back.

​

Overall, it's one of my personal favorites, really. I wholeheartedly recommend it!
