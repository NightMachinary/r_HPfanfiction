Harry is a couple years older or more. He has some or many memories of his parents. He has some or many memories of Sirius. The night his parents died is burned into his brain, no Dementors required.

I think this could be an interesting divergence and I can't currently remember reading any fics that have done it.

Any recommendations?


** super great prompt/idea, but I'm sorry I haven't seen anything with this.

I mean I did recently come across one where he was a little older but it was a wrong boy who lives fic so it didn't hit on any of the notes that you mentioned, and of course in WBWL James and Lily don't die so yeah. not what you're talking about

** This would make his transition to living with the Dursleys way more painful as well as Sirius's betrayal (if he even believes Sirius is guilty). I wish I had recommendations.
