I'm looking for some good fic where Hermione is a healer/protector or obviously the power behind the throne so to speak. Any other factors are negotiable. I loved the portrayal of her as the orders healer in linkao3(Manacled by senlinyu) . Looking for her in that role again.

Edit: Fixed flair and bot summons. Thank you [[/u/Wirenfeldt][u/Wirenfeldt]]


** I haven't read Manacled, so I'm not quite sure how well these stories fit with what you want. I'm interpreting protector quite broadly, so I apologize ahead if these don't fit what you mean. I hope you find something you like.

*Healer Hermione*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23468659][Hunting Shadows]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TangentiaLives/pseuds/TangentiaLives][TangentiaLives]] has Hermione to be quite a prodigious healer-in-training. She actually does quite a lot of healing for a trainee.

*Protector Hermione*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3427109][Only a Moment]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Lotus_kiss/pseuds/KissOfTheGrimm][KissOfTheGrimm (Lotus_kiss)]] has Hermione acting as a protector to little children. It is a minor crossover, but you can just treat the crossover characters as OC's.

If you aren't squeamish, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9148492][Do I Look Like Your Hero?]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/SeeEmRunning/pseuds/SeeEmRunning][SeeEmRunning]] is a Slytherin!Hermione fic that has her BAMF and really cunning and competent. She is a protector of sorts. Please mind the tags though.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6766210][Will you?]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/SinBin/pseuds/SinBin][SinBin]] is a short and cute one-shot that has her making a mess while doing the protecting.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27254014][Oath of Silver]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/i_shall_wear_midnight/pseuds/i_shall_wear_midnight][i_shall_wear_midnight]] is a Witcher AU with Hermione as the Witcher. She acts as Fleur's protector.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24935455][tired of fighting the good fight]] has a morally gray Hermione who is acting as Harry and Neville's protector.

  Fresh off finishing a hectic third year at Hogwarts, Hermione embarks on a new summertime adventure in Bulgaria with Sirius Black as an unlikely companion, where she begins a new internship as a Healer's apprentice with the Bulgarian National Quidditch team. Although Hermione and Viktor, the team's star Seeker, have a rocky start, they quickly find themselves becoming entangled in each other's lives both inside and out of the Quidditch stadium as they grow ever closer. However, darkness pools in the edges of light, and Hermione's summer may be much much dangerous than she ever imagined...

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

  Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret, lost but hidden in her mind, so she is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve until her mind can be cracked. Now illustrated by Avendell.
