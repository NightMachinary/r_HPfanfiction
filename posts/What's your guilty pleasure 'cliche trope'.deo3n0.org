It was once Lord Harry, but now I think it's just Political fics in general. Not sure why it's a 'guilty' pleasure. But that's what comes to mind when I think of it. Feel free to link good fics for your trope.


** I don't have any preferences in fanfiction I'm ashamed of (which is what guilty pleasures are), but the trope I like the most that is somewhat clich√© is Peggy Sue time travel stories.

I used to have a guilty pleasure in Snape-apologism. Nowdays, I feel no shame over my preferences for SS-centric fics -- allthough I prefer fics that tone down the apologism (as in "Snape did nothing wrong", not fics where he shows actual good characteristics), while at the same time not portraying him as a cruel bastard. Basically, I prefer fics that portray movie!SS in terms of morality -- not a paragon of virtue, but not nearly as cruel as the book version.

** Reluctant pairings that eventually turn into romance. Yes, marriage contracts, soul bonds, and so on and so forth are inherently creepy and borderline or /actual/ abuse, depending on how they're done. I just like the dynamic of incredulity, discomfort, or even outright hatred slowly fading into uneasy acceptance into actual romance.

Even though it's basically Stockholm Syndrome forced on (usually) underage kids, for life.

Also, I'm not sure if this counts, but focus on canon compliance (not including the epilogue, Pottermore, or Cursed Child) and mockery of fanon are also up there.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Heroic Sacrifice. There's something about the hero giving their life for someone else that just hits me. I don't care about the overall reaction to it, but when I can see what's going on in the Hero's head, it brings me chills. I'm not a fan of people setting up others for making a heroic sacrifice (ie. Dumbledore), but it can have it's place if done right. Personally, I think the canon scene of Harry walking to his death was almost bland, with the only real emotional part being bringing his parental figures back for support. It could have been a far more impactful scene if we had seen him struggle with moving towards his death.

And, on a more plot-related level, it's not a good look for Sirius. Molly criticizes him in OOtP for not being able to tell Harry and James apart. If he's always referring to Harry as "little James", it's kinda proving her point :/

**** (I read a lot of next gen, but I will admit that there's little to recommend in the "has adventures at Hogwarts and fight big bad" mold, since even my favorite ones tend to not be good, so you probably know about these.)

Probably not, since the adults always have to be out of the way or incapable of figuring out the mystery for underage wizards to do anything. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8255131/1/Ignite][Ignite]] by Slide at least had a good excuse why the teenagers were handling it and what I read of the sequel kept Harry, Ron, and Hermione as supportive and good parents to their recently of age kids.

Otherwise, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3435601/][NoahPhantom's]] series, perhaps. (Though I admit it's the best Albus series, I'm not the biggest fan, mostly due to the magical theory introduced and certain plot points in the sixth and seventh works.) Harry's parenting didn't seem bad, he just didn't solve too much so the young characters could do stuff.
