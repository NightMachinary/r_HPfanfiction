imagine if Lucius is sat on the chained chair in courtroom 10 and they stick ol' floppsy on his head. A hat that can see all his thoughts and memories. The wizengamot can list off the crimes and the hat can respond Guilty/Innocent/Not Guilty. The hat is a non bias judge that can't do anything with the knowledge it learns other than determine if a person has committed crimes. Also i'm not sure if the hat actually keeps the knowledge it learns and is capable of complex thoughts or is powered by the person wearing it. It's very likely that Dumbledore writes a song for it to sing every year and charms it to sing the lyrics.


** Unfortunately, the hat is enchanted only to use that knowledge to sort people. It starts sorting people into Innocent, Guilty, and Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity. Eventually, people remember that the hat takes your choice into account, and start asking it to sort them into House Innocent.
