i read this fanfiction AGES ago, and now i can't find it.

basically (from what i can remember: i read this at like 5am a couple of years ago) harry is sent to the beginning of time through a fluke of magic when he was hit by the avada kedavra.

he was a baby, of course, so he grows up in prehistoric time. he's also immortal, because he hasn't lived until his death and (?) he's the MOD. i believe.

the most vivid bit i remember is that harry basically just lives lives as different people. jesus, merlin, i think slytherin? he was also logan from wolverine (which is why this should be easier to find lol).

y'all wanna help a pal out? i made a reddit just to ask

edit: to further narrow it down, the book is most likely on ffnet. that's where i read all my fanfic

  Voldemort intended to kill the whole Potter family, but something unexpected happened. Now, the Dark Lord must face the result of a severely twisted Prophecy as well as a very old... thing. What history can Harry have after this? What history can he make?
