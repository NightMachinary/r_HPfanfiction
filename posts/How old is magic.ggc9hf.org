Based off [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g9qmnw/prompt_techobsessed_muggle_born_is_furious_theres/fovf6fy/?context=3][this]] comment thread. It got me wondering about how/when the ability to use magic came about.

My personal headcanon is that aliens came to Earth, one way or another, bringing along with them magical plants and animals. They crossbred with Homo sapiens at some point (possibly leading to the extinction of other human species), possibly around 10-15 kya, or even as early as 5,000 years ago, since that's when the earliest (known) writing was created.

Current witches and wizards are descendants of these alien/human hybrids and have relatively the same abilities.

** I think when you contemplate the HP universe for too long, you arrive at the conclusion that it's probably an anthropocentric universe.

Stuff like the human-relative idea of "food" being part of the rules of Transfiguration, the fact that we know that souls are real and an afterlife exists, the fact that moral qualities such as "goodness" are not opinions but rather matters of magical fact (per JKR that Voldemort taking Harry's blood into him put goodness in his blood such that he could have redeemed himself, had he wanted to do so), the Messianic nature of Harry's role in the story in combination with the fact that JKR is a Christian. All of this leads you to the conclusion that the very nature of the universe is built around humans, presumably by "God".

This is the bit of the HP universe I dislike the most and I try to make things less anthropocentric in my worldbuilding. For example, in VP I had Draco specifically note that while souls exist, wizards don't know what happens to them on death, and it's entirely possible the soul just disappears with no afterlife.

** I think natural magic has been around since the big bang and there's random bursts sometimes which on earth allowed some species to mutate magical abilities, like some dinosaurs becoming dragons and some humans gaining some magical abilities. Humans would have been doing very simple magic since the caveman days but with relatively little success and a high rate of mages killing themselves with a misstep in the rain dance. Eventually when civilization developed and education started to become a thing magic was obviously also taught and developed to be more capable, potions and things like that were developed but much weaker than modern day. I don't think battle magic was really a practical thing until the wand was invented by chance somewhere in ancient Greece or Rome (probably the Greek invented it and the Romans copied and improved it). Then with their primitive wands and attack spells the Romans had a huge advantage and conquered all of Europe, at least until some barbarian druids managed to reverse engineer wands and fight back, which caused the expansion of the Roman empire to stall and eventually collapse. Things slowed down in Europe with only a few rich magical families having access to ancient Roman knowledge until Hogwarts was founded and progress started to gain steam again. By the Renaissance there were plenty of explorers traveling the world, bringing back knowledge of foreign magic (the Chinese wizards made some progress too after all) but Europeans still had the best wands and the best combat magic, which meant the native American wizards had no chance. Around the same time muggles made progress in gunnery and wizards started to conceal themselves even more than they had done previously, since now an armed muggle soldier could actually have a good chance of defeating a wizard (guns are useless against a simple shield charm but pulling a trigger takes less time than casting Protego). After all the (European) wizards agreed to keep magic secret, they made sure to enforce that everywhere else too, so the Australian wizards got captured and forced to let the European muggles conquer their country without being able to use magic against them. I'm very sure that the traditional Aboriginal shamans in the Outback and the wizards of European descent who live in Sydney really don't get along with each other even today, so I doubt that Voldemort would risk sending a team of Death Eaters into the Outback where they might get attacked by completely unknown magic (the shamans have wands now too) just to kill two muggles, even if they are the parents of Potter's friend.

** My personal headcanon about magic is not that magicals came after, my headcanon is that everyone was once magical, but the power hungry ones wanted to enslave earths magical powers for themselves in a ritual, but they failed completely and mother nature/magic/whateveryouwanttocallit took away their magic, in a some tens of generations they started fearing/hating magic wielders due to them having something they had records of having but lost due to stupidity, this started the witch hunts, I believe that magic made the universe and we have no fkin idea how old magic is, but older than the current universe.

This headcanon is a combination of a very very /very/ large amount of fanfics, but the main parts are from the ones with amazing worldbuilding, that I remember but cant find

*** Definitely explains the hate between wizards and Muggles, and shows how both sides were in the wrong.
