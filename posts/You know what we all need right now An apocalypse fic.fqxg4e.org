If you feel overwhelmed by the last few weeks and the distinct lack of knowledge about the future, well, I have a fic recommendation for you!

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Guardian Wand)!

A completed fic about what would happen to the British Wizarding World if electricity was wiped out across the world, this is a story about a situation significantly more dire than our current circumstances. Somehow, rereading it made me feel more better about things (while also pushing me to pick up new skills like how make flour out of acorns).

Pros:

- No bashing. Seriously. I mean, unless you really like Voldemort. The story starts off right at the end of the 6th book. That means that our characters are dealing with Dumbledore's death and the Horcruxes while also facing catastrophe. It's definitely an ensemble cast with a Harry focus, but there's so many other characters that are often missing from fics that get to be involved.

- There's the tiniest bit of canon shipping, but it's super minor. Surprisingly, when the world goes to hell AND there's a dark lord on the loose, it's not a huge priority. No matter what your ship is, you'll probably enjoy it

- The author has a nuanced take on how different skills and traits would be useful in this situation. If you don't like OP Hermione or Hermione Bashing, you'll like this fic. If you'd like to see people like Neville be recognized for their brains, you'll like this fic

- If you like innovative magic systems integrated into the Harry Potter lore, you'll love this! Goblins, Dryads, and more.

Cons:

- There's a 30% chance you will want to become a doomsday prepper after reading
- I'm not a huge fan of how the situation comes about but it's a minor part of the overall arc
- Not many slytherins and some supporting characters that are usually more important are just not at all relevant.
- Harry does end up a bit OP but not much beyond canon

  Dumbledore's dead. On the train ride home, cars are at a standstill, the electricity is out, fires burn unchecked from Scotland to London, and chaos reigns in muggle Britain. Somehow Harry has to survive this new world while destroying Voldemort.

** Definitely not a fan of the instigating situation myself, but it is a very interesting premise and so far it seems well-written. I'm also weak for apocalypse anything, tbh.

*** Having now finished this story, I can safely say that if the author had rated it above T or thrown in some pairing that people go nuts over it would probably have well over 3000 reviews by now.

Like... Seriously. It's amazing. The ideas about Harry's scar/curse, the wandlore, and Snape (who I don't even actually care for as a character however necessary to canon plot he may be) are each, individually, enough to make this story great, but the way that they're tied together puts this over the edge.

10/10, would recommend to anyone looking to read a fantastic large-scale adventure to try and stop Voldemort and preserve the Wizarding World.

**** I'm really glad someone actually read it! I totally agree -- I'm usually a snob about reviews but this fic is really high quality and deserves more attention. There's some great ideas and better execution.
