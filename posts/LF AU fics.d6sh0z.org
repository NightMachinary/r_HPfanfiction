:END:
Looking for fics where the world is fully AU. Something like the Firebird Trilogy, or Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome.\\
Preferably long and well written.


** Well, it's not very long yet, but I'm writing a very AU story called Holly Potter and the Witching World, in which 90% of the magical world is female. (It was a setting I kind of stumbled upon through some online RP settings, and when I discovered that the Firebird trilogy had a superficially similar idea I tried reading it... didn't really like it, so I ended up not taking a lot of inspiration from it aside from the word "coven.") linkao3(12861492)

If you want something longer, and not written by me, then I wholeheartedly recommend Reign of the Serpent. It's set in a world where Salazar Slytherin rules the wizarding world as an immortal emperor, and wizards are sorted into castes based on the Hogwarts houses, with the Serpent caste as the ruling elite, and the lowly casteless Mudbloods as worthless cannon fodder in the war against Grindelwald.

Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix are outlaws and revolutionaries, Tom Riddle is a former war hero and the disgruntled Headmaster of a much more warlike Hogwarts, Gilderoy Lockhart is a radio personality and propaganda spreader in a constant feud with Rita Skeeter, Sirius and Snape are both teachers at Hogwarts, Lily is alive, and Harry is not the Boy Who Lived but just the son of the deceased war hero James Potter... Hermione is at least nominally the main character, but as the fic goes on it becomes more of an ensemble cast thing. linkffn(9783012)

  All Holly Potter wanted was to know was what strange and mysterious secret was hidden in that cupboard under the stairs, which her aunt and uncle never let her go near... and what did it have to do with "those lesbian freaks" Aunt Petunia would complain about? (Total AU, in which 90% of the magical world is female.)

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

I think the fic handles her pretty well, especially since it takes care to show just how OUTCLASSED she is for the most part, and when she makes a bad decision people she's actually called out for it.
