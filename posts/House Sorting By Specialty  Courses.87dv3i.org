So a month ago I came across [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7ycqvh/lf_fics_that_have_sorting_based_around_talents/][a thread]] that was asking for stories where students are sorted by their magic speciality, and I thought it was a neat idea. I figured one's specialty could be determined by the most common magics used in their accidental magic uses (and maybe their wand's too).

One issue I'm having is how to fit classes into this. If Gryffindor is for (among other things) those whose accidental magic involved more transfiguration (especially human Transfiguration) and Slytherin for conjuration transfiguration specialists, how should this affect their classes? Since those aren't taught until 6th year, I wonder if the idea might seem trivial if it doesn't have an effect on the classes one decides to take by second or third year.

Like I plan on putting Neville into Hufflepuff because Herbology (and for doing some earth-based magic), and he'd probably be happy doing less Transfiguration. But how would this manifest in classes? Would he not take the full period or something? Starting to wonder if this idea is more trouble than it's worth to implement...


** I tried to figure out the class schedule from the books (just for first year) and found that there are not enough teachers for all seven years to get three hours a week each subject. Even with each class being with two houses, and sixth and seventh years being all four and classes running from just after breakfast to right before dinner.

The school isn't functional as written. You could just wing it, there didn't seem to be a set schedule in the books. I'd recommend that you give the first and second years and hour or two extra in their specialty. Third years pick classes based on it. Maybe let them drop a class or two outside of their wheel house.

*** Great stuff, but one thing. Shouldn't take be 3rd years and above who have the option to take an extra hour or two? Usually specialization in education increases the further along you get.

**** I meant that students that suck at, say herbology, should get to drop it in favor of more time invested in their speciality.

** Lev Grossman sorts houses by disciplines with his /The Magicians/ series (which is based, in part, on /Harry Potter/). Perhaps you might find inspiration there?
