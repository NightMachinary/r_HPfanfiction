Basically fics with developed duelling mechanics like spell chains and shit like that (precise I know). Maybe some Flitwick mentoring going on. I think there was a wrong BWL story where Harry went and became a famous dueller on the European circuit or something but I'm not sure. Anyway, open to suggestions.

  Some call him the next Dumbledore. Others, a thrall of Grindelwald. Not even Harry himself is sure of where he belongs, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a dangerously magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way. Massive!Wizarding World, No!BWL.

*** Can confirm, Untitled Tome is good stuff. Seconding this underrated fic.

Edit: Other than being solid writing all around, it has a fairly strong focus into a what I thought was a novel approach to Dueling and this happens early on in the story.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea.

** I'll add my bit: Have you ever checked out the trilogy by Green Gecko? The fics feature Harry and mentor Snape - starting in year 6 and then moving on into Harry's auror training which has been really well thought up! You will encounter new blocking techniques and new curses as well as completely new ways of using magic. It's just really well done. linkffn(1795399) - completed linkffn(2569561) - completed linkffn(3470741) - unfinished

And then, a completely different fic which sees Harry go to Durmstrang and among other things develop his own spell chain for a school project: linkffn(5353809) This fic is not completed unfortunately!

Hope these are maybe something you might like ;)

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea.
