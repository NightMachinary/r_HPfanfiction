Stomach hurts from laughing so much is the kind of fic I want to read at the moment. Though not exactly crack fics. Well written, good plot, and characters written in character would be great.


** Bad Education by magicspacehole on Ao3. Basically Voldemort gets the DADA job, but he's to teach kids, and let's just say. It does not go well. It's hilarious and gives a peek into the teachers lives at Hogwarts. The story is fun. And I couldn't stop laughing .

** Can't work out how to link from phone but.

When in doubt obliviate- Lockheart raises Harry, I particularly like the characterisations of Lockheart and Neville.

Like a red headed step child- Harry has red hair and keeps getting mistaken for a Weasley, he doesn't mind.

Harry the Hufflepuff- Harry is really lazy and keeps finding innivative ways to avoid work

Seventh Horcrux- a favourite here, Voldemort is possessing Harry, or Harry has Voldemort's memories its never clear which it is but funnier than the summary makes it seem.

Oh god not again!- a redo fic Harry falls through the veil and gors back to his 11 year old body.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

**** Not anymore it's not. I mean, nostalgia makes them /seem/ pretty good, but when I went back to check one I remembered enjoying, it just ... fell apart. Looking through a few more of their stories, there seems to be a trend where they start out as a fun little thing, crack-adjacent if not outright, and then gradually steer right off the edge of crack and into the valley of insanity. And not the dada kind either, but instead that dull, boring insane, like trying to read that script in The Shining. Sure, you can look past all the flaws that keep piling up, but at that point why not read something better? The fandom's evolved. We've got actual professional level writers who get barely a hundred views.

** There are five fics that I love that I haven't seen recommended below. They are well written with great stories, balancing humor and plot advancement well. Seventh Horcrux and Black Comedy have been recommended by others, but they would be my top two recommendations for this request.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/825875][All Life is Yours to Miss]]: Professor Malfoy's world is contained, controlled, and as solitary as he can make it, but when an act of petty revenge goes horribly awry, he and his trusty six-legged friend are thrown into Hogwarts life at the deep end and must learn to live, love and let go. (Complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2304488][Draco Malfoy: Toilet Supremo]]: It must be a vision brought on by eating cheese sarnies too close to bedtime, Harry thinks. There's no way that Draco Malfoy can really be standing on his doorstep, calling himself a Toilet Supremo, and expecting Harry to buy not only this unlikeliest of scenarios, but also a new loo. But no: Harry's eyes do not deceive him. Malfoy, Lord of Toilets, is really there. Which begs a very important question: what the hell is he up to, and what evil scheme is he about to unleash? Because there must be an evil scheme . . . mustn't there? (Complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296][Blood Crest]]: Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there. (This one is heavier on plot than humor, but still pretty damn funny. Regularly updated WIP)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]]: As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job. (This is for fans of the Absurdist philosophy. Still a regularly updated WIP with 425,194 words)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162][The Devil You Know]]: All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas. (first part is completed, second part is regularly updated WIP)

Happy reading!

#+begin_quote
  It must be a vision brought on by eating cheese sarnies too close to bedtime, Harry thinks. There's no way that Draco Malfoy can really be standing on his doorstep, calling himself a Toilet Supremo, and expecting Harry to buy not only this unlikeliest of scenarios, but also a new loo.But no: Harry's eyes do not deceive him. Malfoy, Lord of Toilets, is really there. Which begs a very important question: what the hell is he up to, and what evil scheme is he about to unleash? Because there must be an evil scheme . . . mustn't there?Career Choices: Harry: gentleman of leisure; Draco: toilet salesman.

  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.

I'd also like to point out that pretty much everything else on the author's page is well worth reading, including several alternate universe versions of Lily, such as one which puts her in the Naruto universe, another where she journeys to the Star Wars verse, and even some side stories where she goes back in time.

There are some funny fics I can recommend, none are hidden gems like that one though:

linkffn(Where in the World is Harry Potter? by nonjon) and its sequels I remember being hilarious but it's been a long time since I read them.

linkffn(Amalgum -- Lockhart's Folly by tkepner) has Harry's soul travelling back in time to save the world but ending up merged with Lockhart in second year.

linkffn(Healer Harry - A Fanfic by SalTalStudios) is basically a Harry Potterish version of the TV show House focused on clinic hours.

linkffn(Inspected By No 13 by Clell65619) I can't really remember other than Voldemort being offended at being called a "necromantic abomination".

linkffn(Lessons with Hagrid) is a little oneshot with a good ending.

linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) is famously recommended a lot on this sub.

linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise by AutumnSouls) is incomplete and not funny in a light-hearted like the others way but there's a lot of fem!Harry being sarcastic to Dumbledore/Fleur/Karkaroff etc. that can be entertaining.

***** Hey, just finished reading linkffn(Harry Potter, Geek of Magic) and although it is not as funny as the other two, it also feels very wholesome and nice to read. Harry's personality is very different to canon and his friendship with the gryffindors has a very nice dynamic. It is also incomplete but I thought maybe you would like it :)

** Oh. My god. Yes. Funniest fanfiction I know, and also with amazing world-building and characters and plot, it's just gorgeous.

linkao3(survival is a talent by ShanaStoryteller)

It BEAUTIFULLY written and the humor is on point. It's a soulmate fic, but it doesn't focus on it, it's just the catalyst to all sorts of amazing friendships and adventures. It's perfect.

Unfortunately, it isn't finished, but I think it updates pretty regularly.

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Daphne Greengrass was walking in the dungeons to her dormitory. She was reputed to be the most beautiful witch in the castle. Her black hair flowed over her shoulders and only stopped at the middle of her back. Her blue eyes promised pain to everyone that dared to mess with her. Her figure was perfect, something that was not well known since the school robes hid a lot. That is one thing Daphne was grateful for. Otherwise she would have even more attention.

Murder, Teen Pregnancy, and Coups prove that Pendragons have no chill.****The first 7 chapters are reposts of some of the other works in this series. I realized that my series of oneshots had developed a plot when i wasn't looking so now its a multi-chapter fic. ****Here's a quick guide if you want to just start with this fic rather than reading all the one shots. It's bring you right up to the start of this fic in like 2 minutes.

  Joining the Order was easy, a chance to die for their beliefs. It was much harder to live with his own choices, each worse than the next, until all he had left was to face the person he had become.This is the story of a man who survived, like a cockroach. This is the story of a man who did the wrong things for the right reasons, a man who betrayed everything he was and is now trying to make things right. A Peter reincarnated as Harry redemption fic you didn't even know you wanted. No character bashing---Peter's character is very relatable. Falling down the slippery slope of your own decision-making is so much more human than rat.AN: No Horcruxes AU. The pairings are tagged, so slash-haters are forewarned of some fleeting teenage crushes, but there won't be any underage relationships. Betad by Eider Down.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.
