please no fics where his name is hadrian or some other bullshit that isnt harry


** I can absolutely recommend

linkffn(Brown coat; Green Eyes by nonjon)

It's one of his earlier works, and it kinda shows, especially the characters from Firefly are a bit flat, and some mistakes where he tries to be fun when it isn't fitting.

However, the worldbuilding is pulled off extremely well (I haven't seen strictly better worldbuilding tbh) the story is extremely intriguing (and it isn't obvious after Chapter 1 what the end will be) and it is definitly a fun read.

Most of the time the humor is on point and I genuinly laughed multiple times when reading it.

Also, there are multiple instances where Harry is (rightfully) regarded as Godlike.

You don't have to have watched "Firefly" (or the movie Serenity) for it (I did not during my first read), nontheless I did both and enjoyed it. Some stuff in the fic gets better after watching them, some stuff gets worse.

*** I second this. This was an extremely good fic, with a professional-grade storyline where everything of importance ties into something else and recurs later in the story. Too few fics have a plot that is truly 'woven' but this one does and pulls it off very well.

**** Yep, the way he merges the concepts of both worlds is exceptionay good. The introduction of magic explains a lot of the stuff that happened in Firefly extremely well and nearly without drawbacks.

You never get the feeling "Oh, this is from Harry Potter and this is from Firefly" in the universe, both things simply are - which is quite amazing.

  COMPLETE. Firefly: :Harry Potter crossover Post Serenity. Two years have passed since the secret of the planet Miranda got broadcast across the whole 'verse in 2518. The crew of Serenity finally hires a new pilot, but he's a bit peculiar.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

** linkffn(11035459) has Harry as the remnants of a Daedric Prince - so basically a sort of god. It's unfinished, though, and will most likely stay that way.

  He's not the Boy-Who-Lived. He's not the Chosen One. He's not even a hero. Quite the opposite in fact. He's a being of such terrible greatness that at one point, those who were hated as devils and worshiped as deities, saw fit to seal him away. Now he's back and he wants his throne. Let Order reign...

  Lily uses a dark ritual to protect her son which has long term ramifications for him. Not that he's complaining about the perks of the matter. Harry/Multi, obviously. Very dark and may offend delicate sensibilities. More information inside. Reposted after accidental deletion. Don't ask even though someone end up will doing so.

  The night in the graveyard, produces a very different result as Harry discovers things he didn't know about his heritage. Before he only had a castle, now he has a whole wide world to get himself in trouble. At least he has his responsible godfather along for the ride. That should help... right? Or not.
