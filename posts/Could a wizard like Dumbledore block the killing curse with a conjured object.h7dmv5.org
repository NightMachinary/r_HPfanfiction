*** No, he uses stuff that's already around. (In the books, haven't seen the movie)

Still, the implication in canon is that a conjured object and a found object should be the same, so not only could he, but canon-level Harry could, too. Maybe conjuring would be too slow in most situations, so one could prepare a battlefield, but not conjure on the fly?

** I think it's up to the author.

On the one hand, physical objects are known to block the killing curse, if they are of the right kind of object (hint: clothes aren't).

However, we know that the nature of conjured objects is one of non-being and that they disappear after a period of time. Even if they are physically identical to objects whose fundamental nature is that of being, they are not magically identical, and that gives you latitude to do what you want.

*** I would think, given Voldemort's conjured silver shield and that he thought Dumbledore was trying to kill him, that a conjured object could indeed block the Killing Curse.

** I remember one fanfic basically had characters conjure a cloud of circling butterflies for the express purpose of blocking Unforgivables.

** The killing curse is stopped by solid objects, so anybody who can conjure a large enough object could block the killing curse with it.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Tonks conjures glass to save Pansy in my current fic.

I'm with others. I don't think it's a matter of great skill. To me it's a question of speed. You can do it if you're quick enough.
