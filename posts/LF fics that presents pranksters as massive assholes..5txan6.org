Please no Snape shipping, wrong boy who lived, Birth of a Nation AUs, or slash.

I don't mind bashing that much as long as Dumbledore isn't turned into a crime lord running a child prostitution ring using the first years, the chamber and obliviates.

*** There's one where Snape collects all the girl's dirty underwear. He has a huge collection of them, with Dumbledore's blessing. I think they tried to trace Hermione after she ran away, or something like that.

*** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_a_Nation]["The Birth of a Nation"]] is that (in)famous movie which was originally called "The Clansman". The plot basically glorifies the KKK as defenders of the "poor oppressed ex-Confederates" and especially their women against the "evil African-Americans".

I'd imagine that in HP Terms that means a "Slytherins/Pureblood Bigots/Death Eaters are the good guys" plot.
