My favorite fanfic is Here Be Dragons by shosier. linkffn(959412) . I'm looking for more fics (preferably long) where Charlie confronts his sexuality or comes out as gay. I know he's also interpreted as ace, and that's fine, but I like fics with him and a male oc. Also, just general Charlie fics are great too. I love him and there's not enough fics on him. Give me your recs, thanks!


** I unfortunately don't have any good recs for this but feel free to double post over at [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]]

** I liked "Hearts over Draconitas". Charlie and Luna are confronted with a mystery murder of dragons.
