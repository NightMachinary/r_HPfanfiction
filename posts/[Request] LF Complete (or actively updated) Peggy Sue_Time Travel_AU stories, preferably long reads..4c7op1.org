Yes I've searched for them but most of them are long since abandoned. I'm new to the scene and I'd rather get advice for stories worth my time rather than sift through the slush of drek that most fan fiction seems to be.

Thanks.


** This is a pretty common request. Here are a couple of links to other threads with similar requests [[https://reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/36n3zb/looking_for_time_travel_fics/][here]], [[https://m.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/31fyg3/favorite_underrated_time_travel_fics][here]] and [[https://m.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2n0lt7/timetravel_recommendations/][here]]. These are not necessarily the best threads, I just gave you the top three Google results. You may want to dig a little yourself; there was a pretty good thread within the last two weeks asking for "Harry going back with his partner" that I'm too lazy to dig up now that had some off the track fics.

Also, I'm obligated with these requests to pitch my all time favorite fic of any stripe, linkffn(One Hundred and Sixty Nine by Mrs J's Soup). Hermione goes and meets the marauders 169 days before Halloween, 1981.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** I should mention I've already read/am reading "The Accidental Animagus", "The Arithmancer"/"Lady Archimedes", and "Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past" (really wish this would get updated more often but what can you do?).

I'd prefer no slash and as long as it's not Laurell K. Hamilton/Anita Blake levels of sex scenes I'm ok with them, but would greatly prefer them absent but isn't a requirement.

** linkffn(4068153). Wastelands of Time. Complete, but the sequels aren't. That said, it's quite a long read and one of the most well-written stories I've encountered.

linkffn(4778694). To End in Serenity. Complete. It's good, but I can't think of anything specific that stands out at the moment.

linkffn(3584221). A Twisted Timeline. Complete. The writing's not the best, but this story has its moments. Possibly a crackfic and nears parody territory a few times. The sequel is not as good, but might still be worth a read.
