Basically I'm looking for fics like Crazy Little Things [Link below], where the magical animals featured are like actual wildlife and fauna (Luna goes hunting for a Magical Lizard thing in Kerala) rather than sentient and sapient talky-things like Acromantula or Centaurs or (a significant portion of the fics about) Dragons (the non-sentient/sapient dragon fics are okay though). The more David Attenborough/Steve Irwin the fic, the better, but I'll take anything with interesting content about magical animals really (even just a lot of Care of Magical Creatures classes). :)

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).
