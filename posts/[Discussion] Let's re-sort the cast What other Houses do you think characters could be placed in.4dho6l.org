Just as the title says! Do you think certain characters would be better suited for a different House?

The obvious one is Hermione in Ravenclaw, but I've never really been drawn to that idea. Personally, I think she doesn't gain knowledge for the sake of knowledge, but rather for the recognition and attention. More than anything, ambition seems to drive her to be the best, be the smartest, be the teacher's pet, etc. Thus, I think Slytherin is my "other House" pick for Hermione.

Ron and Draco can stay in their respective Houses, in my opinion. Crabbe and Goyle would both be humorous picks for Hufflepuff too!

So what do you guys think? Who goes where and why? If you have any fics that reinforce your claim, please post them!


** I could see Dumbledore as a Slytherin. Not the Dumbledore of Harry's time, who has matured due to his sister's death and Grindelwald's betrayal. But before that? Sure, Grindelwald's influence might have prompted him to reason in ways he wouldn't have otherwise (the enslavement of muggles, etc), but the fact is that he was fairly receptive to ideas where he had power. He even became a teacher because he didn't think he could be trusted to have power, so strong was his thirst for it (and yes, he refused to be Minister, but that was only after he matured).

My knee jerk response was Ron as Hufflepuff. But while he was often loyal, I'm not sure it was that much of a defining characteristic. He didn't stick by Harry in GoF, nor in DH. Whereas he did show a lot of bravery from the start (taking on the troll, sacrificing himself in the chess match, following the spiders--the list goes on).

** Ron: Hufflepuff. I don't think he's particularly brave, his bravery seems to be fuelled by his loyality to his friends. He is a hot-head and not particularly hard working though, so that's the other side of the coin. I do think though that he would do better in Hufflepuff, since it wouldn't nurture his less desirable qualities as much.

Dumbledore: Why the fuck is he a Gryffindor? Is it just because it's the "good guy hero" house? He seems like such a Ravenclaw.

Draco: Needs his own house for the pathetic. He doesn't belong in any. The hat should be able to refuse students.

Harry: Hufflepuff. I never really understood the Slytherin thing. Yes sure, he wants to prove himself to a certain degree (but I think anyone would considering his background), but in his core he is loyal and the what he desires most of all is family. Again, Gryffindor = Hero-house?

I actually agree with your thoughts on Hermione. She doesn't belong in Ravenclaw and it always irks me when AU fics attempt this.

*** Thirded on Hermione. I wrote a super-long blog post back in the day, laying out all of the evidence in the books that supports Hermione having Slytherin has her "House of other choice". Other HP fans have also noticed Hermione's Slytherin traits.

As the series progresses, and gets darker and maturer, Hermione also becomes even more Slytherin in nature, with one big point being her learning to lie so well, that she fools even Bellatrix when being tortured with the Cruciatus Curse. If she can outwit and out-con someone who was /Sorted/ originally into Slytherin, that speaks volumes about Hermione's true nature.

That being said, Pottermore implies that Tom Riddle, of all people, might have otherwise been Sorted into /Gryffindor/. His wand is Yew, with a core of Phoenix Feather. Pottermore says on Yew wood, "However, it is untrue to say (as those unlearned in wandlore often do) that those who use yew wands are more likely to be attracted to the Dark Arts than another. The witch or wizard best suited to a yew wand might equally prove a fierce protector of others. Wands hewn from these most long-lived trees have been found in the possession of heroes quite as often as of villains."

In my view, Pottermore is implying that Tom Riddle had a choice - to be a hero, or a villain - and he chose to be a villain. However, it is also quite telling that Rowling thinks that Riddle "might've equally proven [to be] a fierce protector of others".

***** Thanks for the suggestion! After reading the story, however, I do have one criticism: Ravenclaw doesn't equal intelligence. It's not "the smart house". Otherwise, Hermione would be in Ravenclaw, as would Tom Riddle, and that simply doesn't happen in the books. Being a Ravenclaw is far more than just being smart or intelligent. "Knowledge is power", in my view, would be something a Slytherin would say, not a Ravenclaw.

*** I can see why you would say Hufflepuff for Ron, but I think his fits of mostly irrational anger towards his friends and "screw it, I'm leaving" attitude make me less inclined to place him there. Ironically, I actually see Snape possibility being Hufflepuff due to his neverending loyalty to Lily, though Slytherin fits him just fine.

Dumbledore I agree with! Draco has ambition, at least haha. That's about the only thing going for him though.

I also agree with your thoughts on Harry. While I enjoy fics where he's sorted into Slytherin, I think canonically it doesn't fit despite the Sorting Hat's initial opinion. I don't even think he necessarily wants to prove himself either, moreso he just wants to fit in and do the right thing.

** Although I love the /Alexandra Quick/ series as it is, I think if the main characters were in Hogwarts, this is how they'd be Sorted.

Alex - either Slytherin or Hufflepuff. She's a bit lazy when it comes to schoolwork, but extraordinarily persistent when it comes to things she's passionate about. /However/, she often betrays her friends in pursuit of her own goals. I believe Inverarity himself considers Alex a Slytherin.

Anna - Ravenclaw or Gryffindor. I don't know which - she's very clever and bookish, but she has the guts to stand up to Alex in books 3 and 4.

David - definitely Hufflepuff.

Constance & Forbearance - Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, respectively. In book 4 we see them start to individuate - Constance is the more "constant" one, whereas Forbearance is willing to delve more into esoteric things (Astrology).

Max - even though he's a morally ambiguous character, I'd say Gryffindor. [[/spoiler][The end of book 2]] all but confirms his sheer bravery.

Julia - probably Hufflepuff, maybe Gryffindor.

Sonja - Ravenclaw, I think, or Slytherin.

Innocence - Gryffindor.

Larry Albo - Gryffindor (according to Inverarity).

Lilith Grimm - Ravenclaw. It's evidenced by her monologue in book 4 ("I was the bookish one" and suchlike).

Diana Grimm - probably Hufflepuff. She's ruthless and brutal, but supremely dedicated to her job, and has a strong moral compass (in a way).

[[/spoiler][Hecate Grimm - Slytherin or Gryffindor (leaning towards the former).]]

Abraham Thorn - One would /think/ Slytherin, and there's a lot of evidence to back that up, but there's also some Gryffindor elements in there (the house-elf rights protections he passed, the determination to fight for his cause) despite his obvious evilness.

Livia - she's pretty cryptic, but I'd say either Hufflepuff or Gryffindor.

*** See, I don't necessarily agree with this. We don't know a lot about Regulus, but based on what we do, I've always inferred he was sorted where he belonged. Sure, it's possible that he was upset at Voldemort on Kreacher's behalf, but it could equally have been just that he was annoyed that anyone else dared to touch his things (yes, even a Dark Lord.)

Like, we know that the Blacks were (or at least considered themselves to be) wizarding nobility. We also know that Regulus was an arrogant little fucker with a flair for the dramatics- I mean, his note to Voldemort was essentially "I want you to know that it was ME, REGULUS BLACK, who fucked you over! ME!" In a three sentence note, he says the word "I" seven times. Lol. (Also, DO NOT ENTER WITHOUT THE EXPRESS PERMISSION OF REGULUS ARCTURUS BLACK!!!!)

Regulus kept his head down through most of his Hogwarts years and did what he had to to save his own skin, which doesn't seem very Gryffindor to me. Sure, he eventually went out with a 'bang' and stole the Horcrux, but part of me feels like he figured out the Horcrux thing and was then like "Well, I'm going to fucking destroy that motherfucker, you fucking half-blood upstart who fucked with my house elf!" more than "My dear Kreacher, I must avenge you!"

It could just as well have been the other way, I suppose, but with what limited information we have about Regulus I find it pretty impossible to say that he /should/ have been a Gryffindor. That's like saying Peter Pettigrew /should/ have been a Slytherin, or what have you.

I am not really sure what I'm trying to say with all that, but I think about Regulus a lot, lol. SO there's just some of my thoughts on him.

Her knowledge and abilities come through hard work, she's loyal to her friends, she accepts the weak and unwanted (early books Neville for instance), she is "fair" and egalitarian - the rights and equality of others are very important for her as a principle. I don't think she belongs in Ravenclaw, because she isn't artistic and has quite a close mind - her need for knowledge isn't exactly an intellectual pursuit. And neither in Slytherin, since she is too egalitarian and fair for the house that basically embodies capitalism.

Ron: Hufflepuff if I don't get to pick Gryffindor. He is neither cunning, nor thirsty for knowledge and not exactly a hard worker. Ron is more of a "pure" Gryffindor than Harry.

Malfoy: Just like Ron, there is none better for Slytherin than Malfoy. He is ambitious and becomes more and more cunning throughout the series (then again, what eleven year old, realistically speaking, is especially cunning?). However, if I have to put him somewhere else, it would probably be Ravenclaw. We hear once or twice that he isn't half bad in class, and he repairs a complicated magical artefact in HBP.

I can see Ron in Hufflepuff because of his loyalty but let's not forget that bravery isn't lack of fear, but the willingness/ability to face your fears despite them, which I think Ron has shown throughout the series. Hermione could be in Slytherin, because of the cunning she has shown throughout the series. Neville could have been in Hufflepuff, as while he showed courage, it wasn't very evident until the end of the series. Draco was Slytherin through and through, but he might have been a Ravenclaw if his father hadn't been so...himself. Like you said, Crabbe and Goyle would be interesting Hufflepuffs because they stuck by Draco even though he insulted them all the time. Ginny never really showed courage until the end of the series either, so I can see her in Hufflepuff. Percy would have been an interesting Ravenclaw. Fred and George would be good Slytherins with all of the cunning they showed with their pranks/inventions. Lockhart was a Ravenclaw, right? I can seem him as a Slytherin.
