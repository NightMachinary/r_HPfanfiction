Oh, let's shoot Voldemort with a sniper rifle! Nobody could have tried that before!

I hate that cliche.


** Because canon (or in this case, fanon) is a golden calf and if you want to write a good story you need to know when to slaughter a few of them. Slavishly adhering to a preset of ideas makes for a boring story. You need to know what tropes and devices are going to serve your story, and what are going to hinder it.

Setting aside the fact that the books and movies never explicitly state that wizards and/or spells are immune to fire arms, you have to decide what will help your story. I have two stories I am writing at the moment. In one, a drunk wizard who isn't looking for a fight manages to put up a shield charm powerful to deflect a point blank shot. In this story, any wizard or witch is essentially immune to anything a muggle could throw at them, because I want to play up how powerful and scary witches and wizards would be to muggles. As such, Voldemort could never be killed by bullets, because that's not the sort of story it is.

In another story, guns can shattered most shield spells with enough focused fire, and firing from ambush is a sure way to kill witches and wizards. There are even special weapons that muggles have to beat magic. Why? Because that's what the plot called for. In this case, I can tell a more interesting story with wizards having weaknesses and magic being flawed.

Fanfiction is about exploring new ideas. You can take any cliche or trope and build a good story around it provided you write it well enough. There needs to be room for stories where wizards could destroy the muggle world in a day because magic is beyond mortal ken and no muggle could hope to stand against it. There also needs to be room for stories where wizards live in perpetual fear of muggles, because they could be crushed by them at any moment. Both those situations have a lot of potential drama and stories in them. Just because you don't personally enjoy those stories doesn't mean that they cannot be excellent and engaging to the right audience. I personally can't stand Dramonie stories, but by God I support the right for those stories to exist and for their fans to enjoy them.

So true! If it doesn't serve the story and further the plot or enhance the world the writer is building, then there's no point. In one of my stories, Harry gets his dumb ass shot because he was overly confident in facing a de-wanded wizard. Anything can happen! I dunno that I'm with you on that Dramione business tho ... :D

** Healing magic aside (we'll assume this is a battle situation where no one has time to spare with things like that), I think guns would work with the element of surprise. If you can hide a gun in your robes, and when at point blank quickly get it out and shoot a killing blow immediately --- you stand a very reasonable chance of offing even Voldemort. By the time the wizard realizes what is happening it's far too late to cast /Protego/.

But again, that can only ever be a one-time attack. As soon as the Death Eaters know what to expect, they can wear magical armor, keep shield charms up, begin each battle with /Accio Firearm/, any number of things.

There is no way you could open your mouth and say ANY spell in the timespan of an EYEBLINK. So yes, guns can slaughter magicians easily, at least with surprise! Just like anyone in the real world goes up to someone on the streets and just BAM they are dead in an instant.

The people here who argue that "Oh why did no one ever try it before?" have no argument because the answer is PLOT. They never tried it because the story was never written to have an incident like that in it. So they have no argument.

Advancing against a hostile position armed with them stopped working by 1914. You could maybe shield a few bullets, but hundreds? Could you sustain the shields until the defenders run out of ammunition?

Or just imagine Muggleborns baiting the taboo and killing the Snatchers with AK-47s.

As for mobility, there are shrinking charms and since most weapons are mechanical they should be unaffected once restored. Or simply use Hermione's bag to carry around enough firepower to level Malfoy Manor.

******** I agree with your complaint that there should be more terms to describe the magical population. What I disagree with is your reasoning. Being trans should not be a huge deal in a world which has a potion that replicates another human down to the cell and magic which can turn you into animals and inanimate objects. There are some who can do it without any sort of aid. If Tonks can morph a pig nose then she can certainly morph a cock, if not multiple. There might be some social stigma attached but from a medical/biological point of view, there is no reason to differentiate. Either trans people are accepted as changed and use the terms associated with their chosen gender or they are not recognised and called a slur. There is no point of a positive/neutral term reserved for trans people if there is no difference between them and anyone else. Trans people change their gender because they feel "wrong" with their biological one. They want to become the other gender. So not using the matching term is at least disrespectful.

You're not comparing like-for-like. You're comparing the speed of a bullet vs. the speed of draw and casting a spell. You /should/ be comparing the speed of draw of gun + trigger + bullet vs. speed of draw of wand + casting a spell.

Speed of draw is likely similar, though perhaps wand being a bit faster, given that we've seen some wizards draw their wand so quickly that it was too fast to see. And then you have to compare the speed of pulling a trigger + bullet travel vs the time it takes to /think/ a word on instinct.

It's nowhere near as clear-cut as you would think.

And this isn't even starting on all the reasons why the comparison is silly in the first place: lack of Muggle access to wizarding locations and individuals, higher wizarding resistance to physical harm, the possibility of accidental magic, the possibility of pre-existing magical protections which mean you don't have to actively cast anything to defend yourself, etc.

** Firearms can accurately strike a target and kill a person at ranges inconceivable to a wizard who must be no more than several dozen feet from their target. The best snipers in the world can strike a target at ranges where the curvature and rotation of earth must be taken into account.

Bullets are supersonic, meaning they are faster than sound, by the time a target hears the report of the firearm the bullet has already struck its target.

There are weaknesses of course. If a shield charm can stop physical objects then it should be able to stop a bullet. However we don't really have a knowledge base for how long such a charm lasts. Some stories have a shield charm work until its broken but as far as I remember canon only has it last a single spell. So in theory a machine gun should overcome this.

Dragon hide or other armor could stop bullets. Possible but a character wearing armor is more fanon than canon. The only canon "armor" I can think of is the dragon hide gloves for herbology. Assuming there is armor the answer is to aim for the unarmored areas.

A simple accio spell to collect any nearby firearms. Would definitely work against closer opponents, but what about the rifleman 200 yards away? That's 600 feet away when the opponent usually deals with people 30 feet away.

What about missiles and drone strikes? Missiles can be fired from further away but may give a fast spell caster a chance to put up a shield. That might help against the physical body of the missile, but what about the fire and overpressure of the explosion?

Unfortunately we don't have really enough information to predict one way or the other how effective Firearms will be. However based on the information that we do have, the careful and strategic use of firearms should have a severe impact.

And is Volde going to cast accio in every direction before every fight? Does here only need to cast in longer direction? Two? Four? How wide spread does a general accio go? 45° on each side of the wand?

** Cliché? I've read about four fics in which Harry uses anything firearm-like, and only one in which he uses a sniper rifle to kill Voldemort.

Like, the Weasley shield hats were innovative, so you don't have everyday magical armor. And the Statute of Secrecy was enacted when wheellock firearms were common and flintlocks were newfangled, and there hasn't been a lot of contact between the two worlds since then. So normal people don't walk around with charms against firearms woven into their clothing. (The Weasleys might, since they use hand-me-downs for everything...)

On the other hand, Death Eaters and Aurors are both combat-focused, so they're much more likely than average to have protections against projectiles. And Voldemort probably built as many protections into his new body as he could.

** I think there are a few questions here.

Starting with what is, in my view, the biggest question....

1. How fast can a spell travel versus a bullet (or similar projectile)?

I think many view spells as slower than bullets. Does this mean a wizard can't react quick enough or have enough time to respond? Are spells actually slower than bullets or do spells have varying speeds based on certain factors? There are a variety of sub questions to this initial question that would, in my view, make a massive difference to your query.

A sniper rifles speed, power, and reach just magnifies the dangers... which then brings forward the second question....

1. What force is required to physically shatter a protego, or any such "magically created" protection?

A gun is NOT a spell, and so we have to view it as a physical force, not a magical force. That said, there are also possibly physical protections in the wizarding world like dragon hide. Could it act like bulletproof materials?

Then there is the third question....

1. How much does the average wizard know of guns and muggle weapons?

It may be easy to get the drop on a wizard with a firearm if they are ignorant of how it works.

There are bound to be other questions as well, such as would there be a way to ward against guns to either prevent their use, or nullify the gunpowder? Could a wizard heal a gunshot wound fairly easily, and how many wounds would be too many to recover from as a wizard with the healing advantages often seen within the wizarding world? And so on....

In my view, it is VERY likely that guns could kill wizards provided that the wizards are somewhat ignorant of them, and not expecting them to be used.

We know that "dodging" spells is possible, but this isnt the matrix so dodging bullets is a bit of a question mark.

And the power question definitely depends on a wizards power, but that also is assuming that the most basic of protego spells has the capability to stop physical bullets traveling at the speed they travel at.

I somewhat agree with your head canon, although I think that Dumbledore and Voldemort "could" still have been surprised by a sniper if you followed canon rules.

** "Why do people think that guns can kill wizards reliably?"

Simple - because J.K. Rowling has never written a situation that involves a gun vs a wizard/witch. I think there's been one instance in the first book and that wasn't even fired. So whatever science or extrapolation of known magics can give us, in the end it comes down to an interpretation by the individual writing it.

So until there's a canon source (which I feel might be quite likely in the future Fantastic Beasts films since it's all about Grindelwald's war against the Muggles) I suppose all we can do is give our own opinions.

** To properly use a sniper rifle you need training, which most if not all wizards don´t possess and those who possess the training are most often military personnel, then they have to be related to a muggleborn to even know about he conflict with the DE, which isn´t really that likely, then they have to find a way to locate DE to actually shoot them, but if those things are set up, Voldemort´s dead, and if the sniper has sufficient skill, his followers won´t even know what happened. It might not be a popular opinion, but I even doubt that a normal shield charm could block too many bullets, even if they get one off in time. Then Wizards fight completely different when compared to muggle soldier or even police, because they are trained for different situations. If a soldier would act or attack like a wizard in a war zone, it would be suicide so I would argue that even in an open confrontation wizards would lose and developing effective counter strategies would take months if not years and soldiers could also use the time to develop counter strategies to the wizards counter strategies. Also many of the counter strategies require some high level skills that not many, even highly trained Wizards possess like noiseless apparition, most can only accio a gun one at a time, and you can even safeguard against that, so I very much think that a gun can be a reliable weapon against Wizards, even if they know what to expect and especially in the hands of an expert or another wizard who has the necessary training.

** There's nothing in canon to say that it won't work, and it's plausible that it would work.

A typical reaction time for a threat that you are somewhat expecting - something like another driver on the road doing something stupid - is of the order of half of a second. For an unexpected threat it's more, and for a threat when you area already dealing with other threats - fighting another wizard, for example - reacting at all is ... challenging. Shielding spells and dodging only work against offensive spells because spells are portrayed in canon as moving slowly so the target has time to react.

Completely ignoring how long it takes to cast a protective spell, the time it takes to realise that you need to protect yourself is enough time for a rifle shot to travel a few hundred yards, a range from which an unskilled marksman can reliably hit a man-sized target with not much practice and which is outside the range that canon portrays offensive spells being used at. And now consider that the bullet is supersonic, so you won't hear the shot until it hits you. You've got to be /really/ lucky to see the muzzle flash, recognise it for what it is, /and/ you've then got to react superhumanly fast.

I can accept that if your wizard character has already got a shielding spell up it might stop a bullet, but in canon they are portrayed as only shielding briefly.

For any gun-bunnies in the audience, I'm assuming something along the lines of a .303" Lee-Enfield, which is I believe the most common class of rifle in civilian hards in the UK that is big enough to reliably put down a person from a distance, and going off my own experience shooting with one.

** I see a lot of people commenting on the use of shield charms or similar spells, wizards most likely do not have the reaction time to cast those. Instead, there are some documented cases of accidental magic that may suggest that a natural defense exists. Neville's first use of accidental magic made him bounce instead of splat. This can suggest some immunity or resistance to blunt impact forces. However, the magnitude of a 2 story fall is vastly less than that of a bullet. To supply an example of a larger scale force, we look to Hagrid's reaction to the idea that Harry's parents died in a car crash. Given that Hagrid rode a flying motorcycle, he should know that there isn't time to cast a spell to prevent an accident. He most likely believes that their accidental magic would have saved them. The question now is of the magnitude of Voldemort's accidental magic. If we assume that accidental magic scales with magical ability it is quite possible that he could stop bullets without consciously reacting to them, especially as Hagrid seems to view a car crash shield as trivial.

Basically, it is the combination of 'unfamiliarity with the technology results in it being more effective' (Magic being used on Muggle armies will be more devastating for the first few volleys of the war, and vice versa.

** To be honest, a sniper rifle seems to be a good way of killing a wizard. Unseen and unheard a bullet could just kill a wizard, given that he has no constant Protego charms on or other protections active.

The closer you get, the less likely it is for a gun to be effective against a wizard worth the name (unless you conceal it and/or have the element of suprise).

And once wizards are aware of the new threat, guns become exponentially less effective due to protection charms being used permanently. I would imagine Voldemort being very aware of the possibility, given that he lived during the Blitz and the second World War in general. He knows what guns can do, but he also knows that in the end they're but a piece of metal flying really fast. Nothing he couldn't handle.

Bullets still operate on the physical plane of the world, where physics - the laws of nature have all the power. With magic, all bets are off. First-Years learn how to break every existing basic law of physics in their first week at Hogwarts. I would assume that supersonic ballistics also make no exception to the laws that get thrown out of the window by magic.

But everyone's experiences are different in regards to what we stumble across. I have a hard time finding well-written magic is powerful and scary fics.

Witches and Wizards were captured by muggles all the time during witch hunts, despite using the Flame-Freezing Charm to protect against being burned at the stake. Not that it would help against drowning.

Your average witch or wizard would be vulnerable to guns, especially snipers. Even most, if not all, of the named death eaters would be. It's really just a matter of how competent you like Voldie. Full-Paragon is right, the real, the only reason for either cliche is the person's preferred story.

** I don't have a problem at all with the idea that Magic could very easily defend oneself from Bullets of all types and maybe even bigger explosives. If muggle weaponry were introduced at a large scale Wizards and Witches would adapt and come up with very effective spells against them.

I doubt very much though that any dedicated spells for this exist in canon, since Wizards seem to barely be aware of firearms (or anything similar) and live isolated from muggles. I cannot see Voldemort researching defenses against Muggle firearms: he's incredibly arrogant and considers them to be below him, he's certainly not going to conceive of any scenario where he would have to fight against *Muggles* or Muggle weaponry.

  The difference is soooo immense, that it would make shields some kind of ex-machina spell if they were able to withstand bullets. That is why I believe that it is not possible for a shield charm to withstand a bullet.
#+end_quote

Why do you think that science, let alone energy, actually matters here? If you think that Protego would be an "ex-machina spell" to block bullets, then you must really be overrating the power of bullets.

Especially since many, many spells have been canonically shown to surpass the power of bullets. You don't need to be a scientist to know that Wormtail blasting an entire street with a single use of Confringo is more destructive than a bullet, and while Wormtail's skill is underrated, he doesn't come close to someone like Snape/Bellatrix/McGonagall/Kingsley/Flitwick/etc, let alone the likes of Dumbledore/Grindelwald/Voldemort. So blasting a street doesn't take any real skill for a wizard to do, so it stands to reason that any of the aforementioned wizards would be capable of a far more destructive Confringo.

Likewise, it doesn't take anything greater than common sense to know that stuff like Aguamenti, Fiendfyre and Apparition produces far more than a bullet. Especially in the case of the latter two, given that Fiendfyre is too hot to be put out by Aguamenti and completely destroys things beyond magical repair (and by default, beyond muggle repair).

*The fact of the matter is that objectively speaking, even if magic cared about energy, magic produces more "energy" in canon than a bullet ever could.*

You could make a case that most wizards wouldn't have the reaction speeds to react to bullets. *However there is a difference between saying that wizards are not fast enough to react to bullets and suggesting that the Shield Charm cannot withstand gunfire. The former is true, the latter is objectively wrong.*

You overestimate the energy of bullets when compared to the magical feats shown in canon. *The energy produced by a bullet means jack-shit; the actual speed of the bullet is all that matters.* Meaning that yes, the Shield Charm WOULD be capable of blocking bullets with zero difficulty. The only actual challenge would be that most wizards (i.e. anyone who isn't Dumbledore, Voldemort, or Grindelwald) wouldn't have the reaction speed to cast their nonverbal Shield Charm before they get shot. That is because the speed of thought is slower than the speed of sound, and thus, slower than a bullet. *A wizard whose reaction speed was equal or greater than that of a bullet would be capable of using the Shield Charm to casually block bullets. However if a wizard isn't fast enough to react to bullets and/or gets taken off-guard, then it doesn't matter if the Shield Charm blocks them or not since they'd get incapacitated (likely killed if nobody heals them) before they can cast it nonverbally.*

*TL;DR: Magic overrules physics and stuff like "energy". The Shield Charm would be effortlessly capable of blocking bullets provided the wizard was fast enough to react to bullets. If they lack that speed, they get shot before they can even cast the Shield Charm. Meaning a wizard killed by bullets would be killed entirely because their reaction speed was too slow to cast the Shield Charm.*

**** Firstly, Centaurs are magical creatures.

Secondly, there's nothing about arrows in the paragraph you just quoted.

Thirdly, you're making a rather large assumption about the shield charm when you assume that more physical energy equals harder to block. Prima facie this does not seem to be logical since the shield charm does not operate via physical means but rather by magical law which tends not to pay much attention to physical energy.

For example, we know that the shield charm is not very suitable for preventing crushing type injuries from the DH Gringotts scene. That doesn't seem to be much to do with energy: the weight of those coins etc. was well within the range you'd expect wizards to be able to levitate, for example. The problem wasn't the power behind the "attack", the problem was using the wrong defensive spell for the wrong type of danger.

I would not be surprised at all if an arrow shot by a centaur is significantly harder for wizards to block with a shield charm than a bullet. The former likely has some magical significance behind it, even if only the inherent magic of a centaur's nature as a magical creature, whereas the bullet is as Muggle an object as you can get.

Here you go.

You are making a rather large assumption that Centaur bows and arrows are in anyway 'magical'.

You are making an even bigger assumption that magicals could only be physically hurt by other magicals. Name one canon instance that can justifies your assumption.

I think it's telling that you didn't quote it in your original post. You rather oversold it, didn't you? It mentions only that wizards were surprised and moved out of the way. Not a single mention to an arrow actually successfully harming a wizard.

That assumption is nowhere in my post. Obviously if a Muggle attacks a wizard who has no magical protections in place, the wizard is going to get hurt (though less than a Muggle would in the same situation).

What is unsupported by the books is the idea that non-magic can overcome magic. Not only has JKR explicitly stated this on Pottermore, but it's a theme we see running consistently through the books as magic completely runs roughshod over the scientific understanding of the universe and indeed basic logic. Wizards continuously manipulate physical forces and matter with trivial ease. The idea that a bit of kinetic energy with no magical significance to it could pose a threat to a prepared wizard is somewhat absurd, given the defiance of physical law we consistently see from magic.

You missed my point. My point was that they don't need to be, for them to pose a greater threat to magical defences than bullets. Being fired by a magical creature is sufficient. We see in the books that everything that magical beings do carries some form of magical significance - situational context is a magic all of its own. Events have their own power. The whole ending of DH revolved around this fact.

******** It's eminently googleable, but here, let me do your work for you:

#+begin_quote
  Having decided that magic could not raise the dead (even the Resurrection Stone does not truly return the dead to life), I then had to decide what might kill a wizard; what kind of illnesses they could catch; what injuries they might sustain, and which of the last two could be cured.

  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override ‘mundane' nature, but not ‘magical' nature.

You may also be interested in hearing that JKR recently said that summoned objects move at close to the speed of light. Fun times.

*** ...

1. You're doubting the ability of magic to stop a small (in cosmic scales) amount of kinetic energy, when this same magic can bend time and space, create matter, create perpetual motion, etc?

2. Speaking of creating matter, there's more energy in the matter created by an Aguamenti Charm than was released in the largest nuclear bomb ever detonated. /Much/ more.

3. Treating magic as energy is silly.

** For some people, fanfiction is about the focus upon characters and their interaction - the centre around those individual relationships, their axes and their orbits. For others, fanfiction is about plot: utilizing canon characters and places and creating a whole new set of events within them, whether in the canon time period or in another one.

And then for others, fanfiction is a power fantasy. Within the fanfiction, their main character, their protagonist, needs to /win./ This means, for example, that we some authors might, for example, take a character like Hermione Granger, change her character in various ways, and let her win over the same kind of oppression in multiple stories. For other authors, they might write a version of Harry Potter where he collects women like Pokémon and have a harem fic. The actual tropes at play can be completely different from one writer to the next.

One of the best ways to /win/, if your main enemy is normally somehow unbeatable, is to introduce a tool we don't see within the canon. Wizards don't even know how to wear /trousers/, and think that guns are a type of "fireleg". They undoubtedly do not know how to protect themselves against guns, and if you took the canon and introduced a character with an interest in firearms, they would have an abruptly unbeatable edge. None of the wizards or witches would ever /expect/ a firearm the first time, and after the first shooting, it might take them some time to mobilize and learn more, particularly if you were fighting against purebloods with no Muggle or Muggle-influenced allies.

Bang. Your MC can win with nothing but a gunshot. And if you're looking for that power fantasy, you probably go, /Yeah!/ And if you're looking for anything else, you probably roll your eyes.

That's why this argument comes up again and again and again - it's super easy to wank over whether guns would be the "ultimate tool" or not, because their main edge is foreknowledge. The reason guns would initially work against wizards is because they'd have no knowledge of them, but if you had any sort of competent wizard leading the defence, something could be cobbled together to work against them pretty fast, I expect, whether it's some variation of a wearable shield charm or what. Wizards are bodies made of meat, and if you shoot 'em in the head, they probably die.

But Jesus, what a /boring/ idea.

You're right when you say it's a cliché - although no one in-universe (canon) has likely ever tried to shoot Voldemort, people on the outside come up with it all the time, and act like it's a huge, unexpected idea. Wow! It's not about whether guns could kill wizards, it's about whether it'd actually be an interesting thing to happen in a story. Whether it would feel /genuine/, or hackneyed and silly.

Why do people think that guns could kill wizards? Because with the element of surprise, they probably could. Why do people write about it again and again? Because they're the NRA-wanking equivalent of someone writing a self-insert who shows up to Hogwarts with a fucking samurai sword, speaking Japanese and ready to kill Voldemort in the powered-up way only a weeaboo could.
