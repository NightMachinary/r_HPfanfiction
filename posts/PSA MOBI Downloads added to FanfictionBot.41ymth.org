** Oh gosh, this is great! (I would like to report a possible bug however ... downloading epub or mobi from "E.S.S Requirement" works, but the download links for "Magicks of the Arcane" and "Emperor" all link to "Worth It" by xvector.)

#+begin_quote
  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

**** Alright, thanks for explaining! I have to say, though, I didn't expect the Kindle to be so popular. It's been pretty successful, has it not?

*** Thanks for the gold! I'm glad reading on the Kindle is a bit easier for you.

But the real credit should go to p0ody-files (and AO3) for making the downloader! (I just implemented it in the bot!)
