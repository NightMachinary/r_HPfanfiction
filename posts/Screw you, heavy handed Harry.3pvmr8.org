OK. Any fic suggestions that include Harry educating himself, but no harems, no awful bashing, no terrible nicknames, and no ridiculous heavy handed Harry?

I guess point of departure; omf magic!? I will learn it all!!!!!

PS no super!Harry.

I have low expectations but hope for decent suggestions =^{D}


** Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow is the fic for you.

*** I thought that one was nice.

But... judging by the early chapters, I thought it was going to dwell right into the grim and the dark, with an evil Harry and what the hell not. Thankfully, I was wrong.

**** This. I picked up reading that story like three times on recommendations only to put it down when I thought it was devolving into an angst-fest.

Then I finally powered through and. *It. Was. Awesome.*

*** Seriously might be my favorite WIP fic. It is nice to see self improvement from all three of the main characters.

***** The author is really bad about this, normally i would say abandoned but I have been following for years, and the update timing is usually about right.... I think there was about 15 months between one before.

** I presume that you've already read Harry Potter and the Boy who Lived. If not, go read that.

Also, linkffn(Emperor) has some of it. Harry definitely becomes a powerful wizard, but there is a lot of focus on warfare, intrigue, and politics. Also, very interesting AU.

#+begin_quote
  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
