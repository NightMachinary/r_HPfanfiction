So I've finally nailed down what I want my first fanfiction to be about: Hermione, not Ginny, getting a hold of Tom Riddle's diary. I'm trying to avoid doing a complete retread of COS, with only minor differences. Is there a good way to take a story in a completely different direction with only a minor divergence?


** Consider the things that are affected by Hermione having the diary. Most obvious is her being petrified and her part in figuring out the basilisk--how much effect will Riddle have on her involvement in the trio's investigation, and how does it affect Harry and Ron's discoveries both in terms of how they discover things and when. Also consider whether Riddle could have enough effect on Hermione to keep her from suggesting the Polyjuice plan.

You could also mix up who gets petrified. Everyone was saying Harry had reason to attack people in CoS, but all the victims except Justin had connections to Ginny--she liked Mrs Norris, she was Herbology partner with Colin, and Penelope Clearwater was her brother's girlfriend. With Hermione under Riddle's control, the victims could be people she has greater connection with. That also means either finding different ways for them to only be petrified or consider the implications of having one or more students killed, both to Hermione dealing with it and how Harry is treated--being suspected of murder is a lot more serious and parents or school governors might call for his expulsion.

** She's much closer to Harry and Ron, they'd notice something was wrong whereas Ginny never made friends in her first year, they all thought she was normally tired looking and obsessive about her diary. Hermione was the one to work out it was a basilisk, now personally I find it unreasonable that she was the only person to figure it out but that's what cannon suggests. We know Ginny is actually mentally quite strong so maybe Hermione is weaker and more open to possession, Tom wanted to meet Harry Potter, to talk to him, can he do that to her more often? Kill off Hermione and you have a more interesting series all round and I'd check it out. Would it drive Harry and Ron closer in their shared loss, would they split, would Harry pull the crape he pulled at Dumbledore's funeral and try to isolate himself? Come fourth year if you keep the triwizard this will affect Harry's preparation and spiral.

*** I don't agree that Harry and Ron would find her suspicious, the biggest argument being that she spent the very most of her 3rd year being at seversl places at the same time, disappearing and reappearing randomly and being over stressed and tired with only mild concern from her best friends.

**** Ron was on to her. There's several passages in PoA where Ron is trying to figure out how the hell she's doing what she's doing. Harry is the one that seems to, quite frankly, not give a single flying fuck about it.

**** They spent much of that year estranged due to Crookshanks vs Scabbers, they also knew that something was up. They would notice something, that doesn't mean they would know what or why, completely different things that you can play off in different ways. If you knew that something was wrong they would investigate but if the diary was kept in the girls dorm then they would never see it, there is no evidence but it is a source of conflict. Alternatively the writer could have the diary exposed early and play off that.

***** I agree that Harry and Ron would notice something. Especially considering how upset she'd be when she realised she might be responsible for the attacks. It wouldn't be like the time turner because the whole point of that was that it helped her hide what she was doing. If she starts looking upset and scared all the time, Harry and Ron (especially Ron) would demand to know what's going on, and I'd think she'd crack.

I think Hermione, especially at that point in the story, would also be more likely than Ginny to feel a burning need to tell a teacher. Even with the diary's influence, I can imagine her just screaming out a confession during the middle of a transfiguration lesson.

A more boring alternative is when Riddle finds out Hermione is Harry's best friend, he just manipulates Hermione to give Harry the diary ASAP and then the story become Harry with the Diary. And I don't think she'd keep it in the girl's dorms, I vaguely remember Ginny taking it with her everywhere (could be totally wrong), so I think the boys would see it.

*** Hmm. This comment has given me lots to think about. I won't be killing off Hermione in my story (to be honest, I don't think I could live with myself if I killed her off). My overall plan was to accelerate the Trio's development, and create an "Empire Strikes Back" moment for the Trio. Whether or not that means that Tom wins in the end by being resurrected, or it's some kind of Pyrrhic victory for Harry, I'm still deciding.

I think the way I'm going to counter Hermione's intelligence is by making Tom act in such a way that Hermione never has a reason to think he's suspicious (after all, he's merely a discarded NEWT Charms project that gives advice to students!). Once shit hits the fan, I'd imagine Tom would then shift to blackmail to force Hermione into compliance.

**** What you might consider is that the horcrux was made by carving up Tom's soul, his very humanity. If voldemort has no remorse/guilt/compassion etc is it because he's a natural born nut case or did they get carved off in making the horcrux. Remember how charming Tom was compared to Voldemort. If so you could diverge from cannon big time by having all the good bits of Tom in the diary but compelled to open the chamber. How are you going to get a Pyrrhic victory without someone dying, what else is the huge cost going to be? Remember a pyrric vitory is one in name only, in all other measures you lose.

Voldemort 1.0 was revived by Pettigrew escaping in the third year, if you want that accelerated Pettigrew either has to get away earlier or you need a new way of doing it. Are you going to have two Voldemorts running around, how do they interact? What real difference does any of this make. If Ron dies for the pyrrhic victory then Scabbers doesn't go back to Hogwarts so nobody notices him leave. Is that satisfying? What changes without Ron? Harry might get closer to Neville or he might go super loner, would he blame Hermione for being weak, would she blame herself? These are kids and there is a track record of leaving them alone to wallow in misery after traumatic events. How does this affect them? Hermione doesn't have the same wizarding background as the Weasley's just remember the devil's snare in Philosopher's stone, she probably wouldn't even question a diary that talks back, if anything she might look up Tom Riddle and be honoured, he would appear to be a muggleborn who became head boy and set academic records.

***** I think having two Voldemorts running around will probably be the best course of action. As for Pettigrew, I'm not sure what to do with him. For the Pyrrhic Victory scenario, I planned for Colin Creevey to be sacrificed in order to bring back Tom, which I think would make the necessary character development for Harry and Hermione happen.

****** Are you going to make people care about Colin first or is it just going to be thrown in first? Would have said 'us' but I filter out any stories with Hermione listed so I'll probably never read this. Two Voldemorts eh, begs the question, does Voldemort share power with anyone, even himself? You might find Tom wanting to work with Harry against Voldemort in an enemy of my enemy sort of thing where both sides know that the moment this ends they're onto each other. Would Tom's life be bound to the diary still if Colin dies? Would Tom be mortal or would the other horcruxes apply to him AND Voldemort?

** Ginny really needed a friend, so Tom exploited that vulnerability, and isolated her so that she could only rely on him.

I see Tom bribing Hermione with knowledge. He might even be able to turn her against teachers and authority figures by casting them in a bad light. Censoring knowledge, supporting a system that excludes muggleborns, creatures, etc. He might even be able to get her to do a ritual with subtle consequences that help him control/ influence her more without her realizing it.

If Tom was smart, he would have a large amount of control over her before doing the first blackout, since she'd be more likely to go to her teachers or friends than Ginny was.

** It all comes down to how reasonable you can make it seem that Hermione wouldn't immediately tell an adult (Dumbledore, McGonnogal) about a Diary talking back to her. I guess Voldy could tempt her with knowledge at some point, but it doesn't get you over the hump of her listening to him in the first place.

It certainly wouldn't be a minor divergence though.

** Well, first you have to decide if Hermione would try to keep the diary a secret in the first place. She's not Ginny. She is very likely to reveal the diary by asking teachers about the spells behind it. She's also smarter than Ginny - see how she solves the basilisk question - and might not drag things out that long.

Basically, it would not be a minor difference. The whole diary plot could (and maybe should) be solved far earlier.

**** Even so Tom would need to be very persuasive to keep her from showing the book to anyone. That's not her style. And if she's using a Time-Turner, she'd be doubly careful as soon as she has memory losses.

** There are two ways for bits that are the same or almost the same: provide a summary after the whole thing happens, e.g. by having the characters discuss what happened, or show it all from the perspective of yet another character, one whose perspective will allow you to keep it fresh.

But there's also obviously going to be bits that are very different, and those you can put in your story with no worry.
