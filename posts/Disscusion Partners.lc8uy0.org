Im trying to have a decent conversation with someone about why they prefer certain pairings or why they dislike them, and some defences.


** I'm not a shipper, all I ask for is well written characters and chemistry between them.

** I'm avoiding writing at the moment. Did you have any specific pairings in mind?

Edit. Apparently not. Personally whether I'm writing or reading I enjoy pairings which feel realistic and compelling. Doesn't matter if we're talking noncon or a situation that's disturbing or upsetting, if the story is both those things then I will enjoy reading or writing it.

Although there are a few pairings that I simply can't stand no matter how well written they are. And a few I love so much I'll read them even when they aren't.

*** Sorry I was sleeping during that time since i messaged at like 12 and then fell asleep. And the only ship I will always read even if I don't like the fanfic itself is Harry/Tonks. The ships I don't like and cannot stand them are Drarry, and Ronmione. I know everyone loves Ronmione but I personally dislike it. Harmony has way too many cliches in them but a well written one can be treasured by me

***** Perfectly understandable. I just wasn't sure if I had misunderstood what kind of conversation you were wanting to have. Wouldn't be the first time that happened to me.

I like Drarry sometimes, but I have to be in the right mood for it. I don't really understand why they're so popular together. I've never liked Ron/Hermione. It doesn't feel realistic to me or at least I feel like it would end badly. I do like fics that show them divorcing.

I oversimplified things a bit in my comment. While I'm good with just about any pairing if it's well written there are two exceptions. I don't read straight pairings for Snape or Harry. I can't see either of them as anything other than gay. It's weird, because I routinely think of other characters as different things depending on the context but those two I get annoyed when they aren't portrayed that way. So while I love the idea of Tonks/Harry, I know they would be amazing together, I can't read those fics.

It's usually the background characters that I get really enthusiastic about pairing together. My friend and I decided recently that I should have Narcissa/Irma Pince in one of my fics and I can't wait to write that. And in another fic I'm going to have Dobby/Kreacher, which I love the idea of. I'm weird.

****** A lot of Snarry fanfics I have found usually just don't be careful on how they fall in love. Snarry is just a relationship I dislike as i've always seen Harry as straight (Partial reason why I hate Drarry.) and have always seen Snape as a heartbroken person who never got over Lily. I didn;t mention Snarry in my last comment because i've read an amazing Snarry fic with Snape as the master and harry as apprentice and I loved it.

I agree with you on the fact that background characters you always wanted to see together in canon, actually being together is cool. I always thought that Sirius Black should have had a pairing with someone or at least hinted with a serious (No pun intended) relationship in the past. I saw a fanfic that pairing Crabbe and Goyle together in the background and it was so adorable. Which was surprising because I always thought of Crabbe and Goyle as mindless brutes with no intelligence.

Sometimes for Harry/Tonks they change the personality of Tonks a lot so I undestand that even if you like the pairing you can't read it. Its the same with me for the pairing Dramione. I find the concept nice but its the details with how easily hermione fits is what annoys me and stops me from reading the fanfics.

​

How would you rank the following pairings from 1 - 5.

​

Ronmione 2

Snarry 2

Harmony 4

Honks? 5

Drarry 1

Dramione 3

Fanon Slytherin/ Harry 4

​

The last one is purely just how authors take fanon characters like Ice Queen Daphne, The joyful Tracey Davis, or Gossip Queen Pansy. The last one idk if it is canon or not, i think it isnt tho.

******* I love the idea of Snarry and I'm very forgiving of that pairing even when it's terribly done. That's the main one I write in fact. Although I also write a fair bit of Harry/Voldemort. I love taking people who hate each other and making them change their minds. It's difficult to do realistically and I like the challenge. I understand why most people hate the idea of those two pairings though, the dynamic can be really gross. Which I enjoy writing too, but I have made myself shudder with certain things that I wrote.

I've never been very fond of Sirius but I like him in some fics. Crabbe and Goyle I've always liked, but I don't really have a preference for pairing them with specific people. I do like them as a couple though.

Dramione is usually terrible, but every once in a while I'll find a fic where I don't hate them being together.

Ronmione 1

Snarry 5

Harmony 2

Honks 4

Drarry 3

Dramione 1

Fanon Slytherin/Harry 2 - since we're talking girls. I rather like him with Blaise for instance. But even then I prefer him with someone much older so it would only push it up to a 3. Of course I tend to like older men, and women, in general.

******** I don't really enjoy fanfics where the two people in a relationship are far way in age. For example, Snape is old enough to be Harry's father yet they are a popular pairing. Then again Voldemort/Harry is extremely weird. Voldemort was old enough to be a grandfather when Harry was born. I find relationships with vastly different aged people weird.

Why don't you like Dramione or Harmony much? I agree Harmony is overdone and so is Dramione but the concept of the two is very nice. Also why do you not like Dramione but you like Snarry. The relationships are extremely similar. 1 is good, 1 is bad, 1 redeems the other. Also do you prefer Gay relationships over straight ones? Because it seems like you prefer gay couples and different age couples over others.

Also, what do you think of the pairing Drinny. I think it is very similar to dramione but I prefer Drinny more as it is more realistic. Draco malfoy bullied hermione for 6 years (In most fanfics) while Draco malfoy really didn't do anything personal to her, they just hate each other because Weasley vs Malfoy. Ginny is also a pureblood so it makes sense she would make more sense with malfoy.

********* I do prefer gay relationships. I'm bi and I find women attractive, but I can't really see myself with a woman. I lean more towards the masculine. So for me anytime I'm reading or writing a fic about two men, preferably with an age gap, I'm putting myself in the place of the younger man, although I'm trans non-binary. Any other type of pairing and I'm reading about strangers, and I don't enjoy it as much.

With Harmony my problem is mostly that I can't stop seeing Harry as gay, so any fic where he's with a woman I can't stop seeing him as being in denial and it makes me sad. It's irrational, I know.

Dramione I just haven't really liked the majority of the fics involving those two that I've read. So I stopped trying to read them.

I love a lot of straight pairings though. Drinny is a good example, those two can be really good together. I love Neville/Luna, although I also love Ginny/Luna. I like Ginny/Blaise and Theo/Hermione. Dean/Ginny can be good too.

I also love triads. Harry/Snape/Voldemort is an extremely underrated ship in my opinion. And I love the idea of Sirius/Remus/Tonks.

********** What makes you see that harry is gay and thinks that he is in denial? In the original stories harry has never shown a hint of gayness? He would've probably noted that Cedric and Victor Krum were handsome if he was. I do not believe he had any thoughts like that. Besides that he has always shown continous intrest in girls.

​

Neville/Luna should be considered canon but they aren't idk why. Well, they haven't shown anything much in the actual books but Neville/Luna is probably the largest fanon thing people want to be canon.

I don't exactly like pairings that feature Voldemort. Voldemort is a person who literally cannot love and I find the idea of a 65+ man being with a young adult and teen extremely weird.

​

My favorite gay pairing and probably 4th or 5th pairing overall is Sirius/Remus. WOLFSTAR IS AMAZING. It made so much sense to me that the two of them were together when I read book 5. Then Sirius died, but I still thought they were together. Then in book 6 tonks canonly liked Remus and remus did too. Wolfstar is still amazing in my mind.

Sirius and Tonks are related.... Very closely...

​

Triads are weird for me as I've always thought that a relationship is between two people. Adding a third person is weird.

*********** He kissed Cho and then described it as wet. He was obsessed with the Half Blood Prince and at the same time absolutely convinced that the Prince was a guy.

I'm not saying there's proof he's gay but even as a child I read him that way. After almost two decades it's a bit hard to see him any other way. As far as him not lusting after other boys he also isn't shown doing that with girls. He admires them but there are plenty of young gay boys who do the same. He isn't shown doing a lot of the things he would have to have done during that time period, such as having wet dreams or masturbating. A lot of that you just have to assume happens in the background. Everyone else may have assumed he lusted after the girls but I assume he did it to the boys, even if he didn't realize what he was doing. Which is more common than you might think.

When it comes to Voldemort...eh, I like them old. I think Minvera is sexy too and she's about his age.

Wolfstar is a great pairing, I agree.

They're cousins. I grew up reading Victorian novels and marrying your cousin was extremely common back then. It's not like they grew up together anyway. He's been in prison for twelve years. I don't think of that as being incest but I don't have a problem with fictional incest anyway. Real incest squicks me out. Although actually now that I think about it, they aren't cousins, she's his niece, right? I honestly don't remember. Either way they're in the age range that most families would consider them cousins. That's the way my family handles it anyway. My own niece has an uncle about six years her junior, it's just easier if you think of them as cousins.

I also like foursomes and poly relationships. There's no reason you can't care for more than a single person at once. But I know a lot of people hate the idea of them. To each their own.

************ True, whatever one likes they may write or read. No one is stopping them.

​

As for the topic of Tonk's and Sirius's relationships.. its best if you just simplify it to cousins.

​

For Black family tree history (in detail)

Phineas Nigules Black (Headmaster) had 4 Children. 2 would go on to become the main branches of the Black family tree while one would become the Bustrode Family tree and one would be the father of the first trio of black ladies.

The two who would become the main branches of the family trees are Sirius Black II and Cygnus Black I. Sirius II would have 3 children, Regulus Black I, Lycoris Black, and Arcturus Black. Arcturus had 2 children Lucriata Black and Orion Black.

​

On the other hand Cygnus Black I had 4 children. 1 was a squib and 1 didn't marry. He had Pollux Black and Dorea Black who married into the Potter family.

​

Pollux had 3 children, Alphard Black, Walburga Black, and Cygnus Black II. Cygnus Black II had the second trio of black sisters. There was Bella who didnt have any kids and married into the Lestranges. Narcissa who had a child named Draco and married into the Malfoys and Andromeda who married a muggleborn and had a daugter named Nymphadora.

​

Walburga Black married Orion Black and had 2 children Sirius Black III and Regulus Black II.

The first trio of Black ladies were ladies who married into the Longbottom, Weasley, and Crouch families.

​

Thats all of the important lineage stuff about the blacks. They are bound to have so much hidden incest besides Walburga x Orion. Example, a Longbottom can marry a Weasley or Potter in the future and that would be incest. Ginny Weasley marrying harry potter is incest.
