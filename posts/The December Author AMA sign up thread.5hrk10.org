** I'm probably available, if, for some reason, you guys want to hear my shitty opinions.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1549688/Zeitgeist84]]

Edit: If you need a particular fic, I'll have to go with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11804414/1/The-Lesser-Kindness][The Lesser Kindness]]. Even though it's a crossover, it's the fic I'm actively working on the most right now. So, I guess if there are any prospective HP crossover writers, I can be of some help.

Still haven't addressed the fact that the main character is a bigot, self destructive and cares little for anyone that isn't very close to her. The main character has massive flaws and yes, the character grows as a person but that doesn't change the fact that the base of this character is Lucius and (Narcissa) Malfoy. You definitely haven't read the fic.

"Graces" even has mythological background as the collective name of minor Greek goddesses. I think it's unfair to call a fic SI wish fulfillment without even checking it out. And even if it were SI wish fulfillment, that doesn't make it pitiful.

  Teddy Lupin thought his fifth year at Hogwarts would be just like all the others: full of fun with his friends, work, and perhaps a bit of drama. Then the muggleborns started disappearing, and everything changed. The war might be over, but the darkness remains.

*** Holy crap! You're on Reddit! I was a HUGE fan of your Pureblood Princess and Vitam Paramus stories! Although they had their flaws and my qualms with them, they're both stories I just sat through and binged in a day!

For Vitam Paramus, have you ever thought about a one-shot or an epilogue about the Falcolns going through the rest of the Quidditch Season and World Cup?

ALSO! Do you have any recommendations for other fanfic stories that might be similar to Pureblood Princess?

**** There's about half of an epilogue of Vitam Paramus done. While it touches on some of that, it deals with something else as a whole. It wont be completed until I run into a wall on Limpieze De Sangre and need to write something else.

I don't really read fanfiction. It takes too long to write it to devote time to reading it. I've read maybe five or six fics in my time and none of them are remotely similar to Princess and all of them are repeatedly recommended here. Sorry I can't help more with that.
