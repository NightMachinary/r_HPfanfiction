  For as long as he could remember, Ron had always been a boy. The problem was, he had the name and body of a girl. He knew that he wasn't Veronica Weasley, first girl and second youngest of the seven Weasley children. But how could he convince his family and his friends of that when, even when he tried to tell them, they always reassured him that he was, in fact, a girl?

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

  Ginny was wrong. So very, very wrong. Harry looked amazing in glitter.or Harry comes out as trans, and though Ron doesn't quite understand he's trying too.
