Something I've thought about occasionally and have happened to hear repeatedly in the last week is on the danger levels of the average wizard.

A society where nearly every individual can be considered armed at all times would naturally have... a different society. Not sure what the possible effects that could be. Maybe a stricter level on what magic can be learned in order to curb everyone from being even larger threats. Who knows?

But back to the question, how dangerous do you think they are? I doubt the majority of wizards remember more than a fraction of what they learn, but it doesn't take very advanced magic to be lethal. Lifting a step by a couple inches can make someone fall down the stairs with just the first spell they ever learn (in a school filled with stairs, no less! how irresponsible).

But it would most certainly be safe to assume at least half of them are capable of casting a spell that is lethal without specific circumstances. Fire spells, water spells (which even Hagrid could do well enough to stop a fire in an extremely flammable house which is maybe why he was so confident about raising a dragon on second thought), conjuring lethal snakes, summoning anything larger than a small chair, and so on. And anyone who thinks a teenager won't remember the word "incinerate" when saying it will set stuff on fire is hilariously out of touch. None of us can even use magic, and we could all name at least a dozen spells in a couple seconds.

I feel like the average wizard would be... exceptionally dangerous. Wizards don't seem to be any more durable than a muggle, so it's not like they would be particularly protected if one person decided to let loose.


** I've been thinking along similar lines. In my mind, because magic and magical creatures are so inherently dangerous wizards have a higher tolerance for danger if you will. I like to think this is why there was not more of an uproar from parents/ teachers about a troll in the dungeon. There was an issue with the basilisk however so it seems that one-off dangers are less of an issue than a sustained threat. Additionally, most of the Hogwarts teachers (Defense notwithstanding) seem to be more powerful than the average wizard in their field so there is some of the safety in that.

In a story I'm planning, this also leads to some of the even higher risk jobs having ways of coping with the mental trauma from situations that are putting them in peril because a higher tolerance only gets you so far.

** I'd imagine they're very glass-cannon. The Weasley Twins made shielding hats because a lot of wizards couldn't cast one, so they're not all universally protected against anything, but I'd imagine more can cast attack spells and be dangerous that way, even if they can't manage the bigger Killing-Curse level stuff and such.

** They're at least as dangerous as a muggle with a handgun. The Severing Charm is lethal if you use it on somebody's neck, and that's taught to young kids.

*** I'd agree at the bare minimum, they should be considered approximately as lethal as a muggle with a gun. Of course, a gun that can do almost anything lethal and you have very little way or predicting whether or not you'll get a firecracker, nuke, flamethrower, or stun gun being fired.

** The Average Wizard can probably take out 5 Muggles in a fight supposing they don't get lucky like Wormtail and hit a Gas line with a Fire based Explosive Spell.

Why 5? Swarm potential, most wizards are REALLY good at single target fighting, once it's clear that he needs his Wand to kill people, that becomes the target, tackle him and take it.

****** Yes, but in my case, the caster doesn't actually need to survive after casting the spell. I'm just trying to say that Feindfyre can be compared to nukes. One spell has the /capacity/ to destroy the planet.

***** Did Crabbe control it after casting it? No he read something in a book and just did it, he killed himself because he didn't know the spell he had just heard about it.

** This might be the reason the magical population is low, despite their seeming superiority to muggles. The sort of drunken brawl that would just leave muggles bruised would leave wizards dead. Good thing for muggles that magical folk mostly keep to their own kind.
