** Not what I expected, but this was incredible! I actually read your fic a couple weeks ago, before you posted it here.

I love it. Your writing is strong, the plot is like nothing I have ever read before. It truly is a very interesting idea. I really like everything about it and I cannot wait for the next chapter. Thank you for sharing!
