So I was doing some research for my own fic (blatant [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12404980/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Alchemist-s-Tale-Book-I-Calcination][self promotion link]]) to make sure I had the right references and things for the early 90s. And I noticed that just a couple of months before Harry starts Hogwarts, Helen Sharman became the first British woman to go into space. I know there are a fair few sci-fi crossovers already (and I've read a fair few of them!) but I was wondering if there are any normal 90s-set fics where Harry is just a massive geek about space =^{.^{=}}

I can imagine him already, being bullied for being a nerd by Dudley, then going to Hogwarts and trying to make his own magic-based one-wizard space program. Who knows, maybe his developing knowledge of rocket science could end up being the Power the Dark Lord Knows Not?

Even if there aren't any, I'd be well up for a general discussion :3


** I actually had this idea before (or at least being inspired by it on Spacebattles), but it had Ron featuring as the space nerd, Hermione as the enthusiastic assistant, and Harry as the one guy that's going "wait guys you haven't even done any safety checks yet and the heat shielding charms are falling apart and what the heck do you mean that the recovery site is the Bermuda Triangle"

It also featured a somewhat international magic space race, with the Fleur and Krum as spies for their respective countries, hoping to find out just how three teenagers got into orbit when nobody else could.

And then, after a considerable amount of shenanigans, they would defeat Voldemort by pure accident. Somehow. You can tell that I haven't fully plotted this out.

Here's a link to the drive folder that has my notes on this (it's admittedly kind of short): [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B35G2ug44jLmTWQ0NmF5b0tQODA][clicky clicky]]

I second mathematical_Lee btw; you should probably upload it to a fanfic site and change the link unless you truly do not value your anonymity whatsoever.

*** It's awesome story /beginning/. However typical to Esama it's not really finished, doesn't really go anywhere and just leaves you frustrated and raging for more.

But it's still worth the read!

** Undetectable extension + featherlight charms :)

I am pretty sure bubblehead charm works by filtering O2 from air or water, so presumably it wouldn't work in space, though. although it has obvious applications for generalization to filtering gases from each other, at the very least.

I have given this so much though :)

*** Cursing hydrogen with geminio that activates if it is ignited is a great way to have truly ridiculous propulsion. Just remember to charm it so it vanishes itself a few seconds after duplication, and charm the containment unbreakable.

******* Although, obviously, one of the most terrifying things about transfiguration is that it becomes trivially easy for any wizard to go "poof. doomsday weapon".

I mean, based on the math I did for waíse néiat from the Inheritance cycle, transfiguring 35 kg of antimatter (half an average adult male's mass) (so you get 70 kg of matter annihilated)... Well - just look at the math I did: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/62kym8/self_wa%C3%ADse_n%C3%A9iat_inconsistency_spoilers_for_the/]]

Furthermore, you wouldn't even need to scale up the amount of antimatter that much to achieve the effect of an actual doomsday weapon (see [[http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2012/09/12/in-search-of-a-bigger-boom/]]).

So yeah. I prefer to assume that Transfiguration is applying magic to matter to create a structure that has altered physical properties as desired, but does not change the chemistry of the matter. I imagine it being akin to the way quantum dots are written in some sci-fi novels. This neatly explains Gamp's Law (at best, transfiguring a rock into a steak means that you have a rock that you can chew. Also, taste would be off, probably).

In other news, the googling I did to research the above mean I am now on more watchlists, lol.

** HPMOR is pretty decent and kind of has this. Petunia marries a scientist and Harry grows up loved by his adoptive parents and reading science and science fiction, including about space. The story has a hilarious beginning and absolutely awesome ending but the middle definitely sags --- the fic is about twice as long as it could've been. Note, however, that this fic is not very well loved around these parts.

*** I've read HPMOR and can diplomatically say I can see both sides of the argument :p haha

I can see why you suggested this, though, so thanks for your input! After posting I remembered that the internet first started to be pieced together in 1991 as well, at CERN. Harry's gonna love the sweet sweet sound of modems in a few years :')
