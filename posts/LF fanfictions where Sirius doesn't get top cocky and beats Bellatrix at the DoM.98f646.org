  Post-OotP - Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. The war is escalating outside and the Order of the Phoenix needs to rise to the challenge to prepare themselves for a war of the ages. OR What if Sirius never fell through the veil but lives instead? No slash/bashing. Harry and Sirius family fic. HBP Semi-canon compliant.

**** Yes. The first few chapters are honestly not that great. This is my first longest story. But, I get them beta-read now and it's vastly improved quality in my opinion.

The story sticks close to canon, so if that is your cup of tea, you can have a read.

****** Thanks.

It's a necessary evil. To get noticed by the targeted audience when it can easily be swallowed under 800k stories is very hard.

I swear when I update, within five minutes it's pushed out of the front page list. The influx of new stories is unbelievable. HP doesn't go out of style, I see.

******* Yeah, the thing is, most of them aren't good. But writers need space to develop but it's a pain searching through to find the good ones.
