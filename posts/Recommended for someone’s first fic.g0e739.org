I was talking to someone who is a big Potter fan, about what book I am reading at the minute (Still Basilisk Born if anyone is interested lol) and they seemed pretty interested in fan fiction and asked for a recommendation. I have read a bunch and I am pretty hooked, but I don't remember what got me hooked and I want to make a good impression.

What fic would you recommend I tell them about as their very first foray in Harry Potter, or actually any, fan fiction?


** Find out how they think about the books and choose a fic consistent with that.

For example, if they find the books to be deliberately funny, something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] which isn't so long and is a canon rehash might be a good option. But maybe they're thinking the books aren't grim enough, in which case you'd probably want to find something more like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]]. I don't read these fics so much though and I'm not sure Stages of Hope is a good starter fic since it's a dimension hopping fic, but yeah. And, just re-reading the summary Stages of Hope probably doesn't fall into the grim category with that Dark Humour tag.

If they're interested in the world of Harry Potter the next question should probably be if they'd like to go back in time or forwards. If they want to go forwards I'd suggest something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] or [[/u/floreatcastellum][u/floreatcastellum]]'s [[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/NextGen][ficlets]]... basically anything canon compliant. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647/chapters/15327019][The Conspiracy of Blood]] is a good option if they want something more depressing. If they want to go backwards I guess the question is which era? There's a good "how Snape became a Death Eater" fic (broadly canon compliant) called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2970716/1/Into-the-Fold][Into the Fold]] that I read earlier this year, for example.

Then there's the whole shipping angle... and the related question of how X-rated they're willing to read. If they like Harry/Hermione and don't mind what would be called Adults Only on TV, consider [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6574535/1/Unlike-a-Sister][Unlike a Sister.]] But that's unfinished, so a bit risky. I would consider [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]] if you want to convince them to not ship Harmony. It's (a) massive and (b) not a shipping fic, so really it's only worth considering if they like the summary. But really there's just so many different things someone might be looking for here... a more x-rated one that I really like (albeit a WIP, but not abandoned as with Unlike a Sister) is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21848851/chapters/52142821][Wood for the Trees]] which is about James Sirius Potter. If they've got any interest in time travel and want a shipping fic, consider [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=306311][And Love Prevails]] which is Dominique/Ignotus.

Another good option is one shots, which is a little different to ficlets that (as far as I can tell) are mostly intended to belong together. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7512124/1/Lessons-With-Hagrid][This Occlumens!Hagrid fic is hilarious, for example.]] [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=8935][But then there's also this deeply sad seriously ill Harry fic.]] (It has an uplifting ending.)

Finally, just chuck HPMOR at them and see what happens... as far as I remember it was the first one I read. Took me years to start reading fics seriously, but you never know.

** My first fanfic was [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]]. I haven't read it in years, but I remember it being really good.

** My first fic was linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle), but that's not really fanfiction.

After that I think I read both of White Squirrel's fics, which were really what catapulted me into HP fanfiction proper. Then it was Vekin87's next-gen series.

But I think linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) is probably the best start for someone new to HPFF. It has good writing, drama, romance, isn't terribly offensive to taste, and is written by someone who was an ingrained member of the community. Although it's incomplete, it's not the longest, and I think it's a great example of illustrating the difference between fanfic and canon and the possibility for what fanfic can do.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** My first fic was all the young dudes. It's marauder ear from Rems' perspective, it is wolf star but not much. There are around 250 (ish?) chapters and it follows Remus from just before his first year at Hogwarts all the way through to summer of goblet of fire and I loved it all (and hated it because damnit it made me sad)

Haven't found anything as good

** I introduced [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]] to my mum as her first HP fanfic, she loved it.

Though my first foray into HP fanfic was linkffn(Harry is a Dragon, and That's Okay) because I was following the author's other works.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
