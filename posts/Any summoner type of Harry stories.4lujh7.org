One where Harry uses monsters or others to fight for him, cause he is weak with a wand so he uses his mind strategically.


** Linkffn(the art of self fashioining) is exactly what you want. Harry (who doesn't bear a lot of resemblance to cannon Harry) is a transfiguration master and makes himself rat friends and an eagle friend that do his bidding.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
