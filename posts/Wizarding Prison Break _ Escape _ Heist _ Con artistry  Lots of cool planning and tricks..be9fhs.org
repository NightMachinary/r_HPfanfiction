Essentially what's on the box. I would like any story focused on planning for an escape from somewhere or a heist (these are basically the same type of plot). Assembling a team, staking a place, dealing with security features, fooling people, etc.

Magic should play some part of it, I don't just want The Great Escape or Ocean's eleven with the name of the characters changed xD.

​

X-overs ok, gen preferred but any pairing ok as long as it's not the main story. Fell welcome to consider this a prompt if you don't know of any fic fitting the description :D.

​

Thanks for your help.

** The Stygian Series has a lot of this, one of my favourite aspects of the story is all the awesome scenarios in the story (the characters jokingly plan to one-up Harry, Ron and Hermione). However, it's mostly in the second story and beyond, though there is lots of cool planning and tricks in the first novel:

linkffn(8255131)

Oh and there is pairings, but the main focus is still the plot by and large.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Hermione becomes a thief and breaks into Death Eater manors with Sirius and Mundungus, first on missions for Dumbledore to steal Dark Magic books needed to kill Voldemort despite his Horcruxes and later just to get their money and weaken their influence in the government.

Harry becomes an auror after defeating Voldemort and becomes increasingly frustrated as that weird cat thief constantly escapes him.

** linkffn(11191235) Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin has this as the main activity at the start of book 3, and the new magic used/developed in the second half of book 2 is basically the "setup" for the heist.

It's pretty deep in, so LMK if you want me to just summarize it for you in spoiler tags below

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
