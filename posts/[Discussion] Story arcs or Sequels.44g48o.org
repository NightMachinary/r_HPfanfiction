I was reading a (not very good) story yesterday, and after about ten chapters, they broke off, instructing the reader to head off to the sequel. I thought, /Well, this is unnecessary./ After all, they had resolved one story arc, but nothing else, no character or subplot arcs, and ten-ish chapters wasn't exactly collapsing under the weight of its own bulk.

On the other hand, I have read other stories (usually very, very long stories), where I thought it could have been split into a sequel, since it seemed to come to a natural end, and then just...kept going.

When do you think it's appropriate to split a story in two? It seems rather arbitrary to do it by number of chapters, so what story developments make it natural (or not) to make a sequel? Are there signs that it's time? I don't understand people's choices when it comes to this. :/


** I'd say that if you have a time jump, a sequel makes more sense - provided the main plot has finished an arc at that point as well. Further, if too many side plots are unresolved, and won't be resolved "off screen", then continuing makes more sense. Basically, if you could stop the story at a point, and not feel like something's missing, you can do a sequel.

*** That makes sense. I have often felt like a story could have ended while reading it, and then it meandered for a bit before finally picking up a major arc, with no real reason for the stuff in between. Do you think the length of the time jump matters? A week, a month, 12 years (in Azkaban)?

**** Length of a time jump matters if there's no other "end point indication". Basically, when the time jump is long enough for lots of changes to have happened, a sequel seems feasible.

** I think stories should end with the main arc and the big climax. If a story moves along evenly with no twist/surprise/head-turner, then it's not over. If it's passed that big climax and now all that's left is a series of little upheavals, it's gone on too long.

I usually run into those gone-too-long stories. It's often a result of the main arc being finished up before the subplots. While it's possible to have subplots end in the epilogue, most of it should be done before the climax of the main arc.

Sometimes, the writer keeps adding more stuff just because they have more ideas. That's when I think there should be a sequels. Take all the little ideas, create a new big arc, maybe leave one thread hanging in the last story, and merge them into a sequel. Otherwise, the action is uneven and there's really nothing to look forward to.

*** I usually run into gone-too-long ones, too. I completely agree with you, it makes a lot of sense to gather all the little ideas into a big new one and start a sequel, rather than dragging a formerly good story on into boredom.

** I debated whether to start a sequel ("Heart and Soul") or continue with "The Power of Love." Breaking made sense, since it was the same time point that JKR did. But I also continue with the very next day, so it's less of a break than hers.

Authors have some incentive to stick with one story, because it leads to a lot more reviews on that one story Anyone who sorts by reviews will be more likely to see the longer story.

On the other hand, two separate fics may also give more chances of being seen. Also, a single uber-long fic may be too intimidating for some.

So, it's a toss up as to what is better or worse. I agree with not breaking off after a really short span, not unless it's a natural breaking point (like end of the school year). I think I probably made the right choice, but there were reasons to not do it that way.

*** That is very true. I've been turned off from trying fics when I see that they're 120 chapters. I like your point about the review counts vs. visibility through more than one fic.

I suppose it /is/ probably easier if you're writing in school years like Rowling, since like you said, it's kind of a natural breaking point.

** For me, I find that /if you have planned your story/, it becomes very obvious where the breaks are, where plot points/arcs come together before there is a break and the start of the next arc. The natural story end is when the major conflict is resolved. It's the end of the journey, of the battle (either literal or figurative), the happily ever after.

When authors start with a great idea (or even many ideas), but don't really have a plan (and therefore a conclusion) they don't know what the major conflict is. So it just goes on... and on... and on... and things might resolve, but it doesn't feel like an end at all. The other side is when the conflict resolves, but it hasn't been hard enough, major enough, leaving the reader feel unfulfilled.

*** So, since I'm asking this as a reader, you feel I'm encountering either unplanned or poorly planned stories, leading to my confusion over why they did or didn't break off to a sequel? I can get behind that. I do read a lot of former WIPs after they're finished (or nearly so), and there's no guarantee that the author worked from an outline.

With the one where I wondered why they stopped and made a sequel, I don't think I was unfulfilled by the major arc's resolution, but rather by the lack of resolution to any of the subplots or character arcs. Although it wasn't very good in general, so it's hard to say, you could be right.

**** If you feel like the subplots are more interesting, that tells me that the author didn't concentrate on the major conflict enough for it to feel major. For example, in the first HP, the major conflict is Voldermort after the stone. The subplots which lead to this (what was in the vault, what is in the corridor, what's up with snape etc, etc) all lead up the major conflict. The other subplots, like the dragon, are resolved beforehand. The subplots which aren't fully resolved (Snape), still fell like they have reached a conclusion of some kind. There can be a hook for later (why is Voldermort after Harry), but as a reader, everything important feels complete.

If you wonder why they are cutting the story because things aren't resolved, then yes, I think it has been poorly planned. And I don't mean that everything needs to be known beforehand, more the author has to say, 'where is this going? why am I writing this story? what is the point?'. If they know that, then they know the major conflict, and they know how they want it to end. The easiest stories to see this in are romances, because the point of the story is to get together two characters. Once they are (happily) together, that's the happily ever after, the conflict is resolved.

** If a story can stand on its own, I think sequelisation is generally a good idea. For example, linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty) ends with a tragic scene, but this is a very effective ending to the story anyway. There's a short sequel, which is essentially a "happy ending"; this (at least for me) made it feel very different.
