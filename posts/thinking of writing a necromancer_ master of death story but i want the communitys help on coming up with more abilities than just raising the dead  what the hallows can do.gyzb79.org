** Hmmmm interesting question. I would say that uniting the Hallows would:

- grant immortality
- raise the dead as 'thralls' i service of the MoD (not full resurrection; think more like spectral being similar to what attacked Voldemort in the graveyard)
- allow the MoD optionable incorporeality (walking through walls/wards/etc (upgraded invisibility cloak)
- manipulate people with apparitions of their deceased loved ones (imagine MoD!Harry raising a spectre of Merope to taunt Voldemort)
- The Elder Wand becomes an /Eldritch/ Wand, capable of employing energies from beyond our plane of existence.

Holy shit. I think I just talked myself into writing a Master of Death fic! Thanks OP :D :D

***** Most fics with immortal MoD Harry make it so it's more of a curse than blessing eg. He is suspended in his age as a teenager, spends eternity watching as everyone else dies, eventually after death he has to live another life, be it time travel or dimension hopping, making it in a way very sad kinda pointless existence. I would be interested in seeing this trope handled differently eg we know from canon that Harry came back from almost-death to life after taking AK to the face, so maybe he can /choose/ the time or his death/ unmade any untimely demise of his. Harry like that could be practically a human shield against anything, without a risk of becoming bitter and insane from old age - we aren't wired to live as long as we currently do, hard to tell the repercussion to being immortal.

** Certain kinds of divination can deal with death. There's /bone throwing/, where small bones that are collected by the caster in a bag or basket are thrown onto a table to read the future in the way they fall, or /oracle bones/, where questions are written on bones that are then burned in firepits and the answers are either read in the flames or in the crack patterns that the heat forms on the bones themselves. Something similar could be done with turtle shells and its called /plastromancy./ Also /scapulamancy/ where you prepare a feast and eat a large animal (like an ox) then clean the scapula and look for dark spots (shadows in the bone meant that the outcome of the next day's battle would be death or survival). The Romans used to sacrifice animals and read the future in their entrails and livers, and that is called /haruspicy/.

Harry wouldn't be telling any prophecies with these kinds of divination but it would also be easy to keep him from being super powered too. And I think they all fit with a necromancy theme even if it's not a human death, and if it's important to your story that it be human deaths for your Master of Death then those practices can be adapted easily to fit (maybe not the turtle one lol).

'Albus, you should really look for new Divination teacher', Minerva was pursing her lips, gazing discreetly at Trelawney, seated few seats down from her. The woman was snoring quietly into her breakfast and smelling distinctly of sherry and incense. 'I know she is your friend, but her drinking problem is getting out of hand.'

'Ah, Minerva, Sybil is simply... Asking dear departed Cassandra for second opinion. After all I requested her help to divine us the best new Defense teacher, my dear.'

** - Speaking with the dead

- command of ghosts, dementors, boggarts, & inferi - in the last case it might be a battle of wills between the MoD and the person who created the inferius

- able to stop or take control of certain spells like the Unforgivables and Patronus Charm

- I wouldn't give them the power to restore life to someone already long dead, but able to keep someone dying from finally passing, which may be more torturous than helpful (cf. Miracle Max re: Mostly dead vs. All dead)

** A sacrificial aspect to Necromancy is always interesting IMO. Like, using the dead as more than zombies. In my fic "The Dark Lady" I had my MC learn to use the flesh and bones of the dead as all sorts of weapons -- be it as bone-spikes impaling people or merging the bodies of multiple dead to form flesh-/bone-golems. You can go completely nuts with your imagination. You can also have your MC spread sickness and disease with curses and spells. Be wild.

But good on you that you don't just want your MC to raise the dead.

** Necromancy is a Dark Art, of course. I would say one of the Forgotten Ones, as probably the Ministry (and Dumbledore) would have banned any knowledge pertaining this topic.

In order to be a necromancer your protagonist must have a Library with obscure knowledge (or a person proficient in the Art) --> Perhaps in the Chamber of Secrets, or the Black Library would suffice.

The Necromantic Arts surely are difficult to master.

The dark sorcerer could cast:

- Spells where the necromancer can manipulate animals to his bidding (and are better than just transfiguration, of course, due to Black Magic).

- Spells that can destroy everything in an area with decay and death, for example due to poison 💀 and then raise the living that were in such area

- Ancient curses that have extreme impact on the body and soul of the afflicted.

- A different method of apparition

- Elemental manipulation: perhaps the necromancer could manipulate black energies, spreading death and decay

- Soul magic

- Spells (or rituals) that summon creatures or even demons from other planes of reality

** How about being able to see or just know the death count of an individual, like how many deaths they are responsible for. Not a hugely exciting ability but it would give MoD certain insights into people; depending on your characterization it would be interesting to see what Dumbledore shows up as.

*** Or similarly to see count of how many yrs/days (maybe in minutes to make it more abstract) someone has yet to live. It could count a lifespan - time to someone's natural death - and if they are hit with a lethal spell, it could dramatically slip down, unless countercurse is provided. Or someone can be on borrowed time - if Harry saved them from certain death, it could be certain amount of time given by him or count backwards basically making them timeless - eternally indentured to MoD - unless Harry would fix it.

** Maybe the Hallows have Synergy.

The Cloak allows you to escape death, maybe making the person stop aging and become intangible/invisible to most methods.

The Wand allows you to cause death, through regular spells and Eldritch ones.

The Stone allows you to reverse death, though it takes training and it`s not perfect.

Maybe plague or miasma spells, bone sorcery, shadow attacks, blood attacks.

** These are from Dragon Age Inquisiton Necromance specialization (playing the game at the moment so this came to mind), might be interesting to look at, though not sure how well all these can be used in HP universe or in what you are thinking of writing as these are mostly for damage/killing etc..

Horror: Unleashes spirits of fear, terrifying all enemies close by.. In addition could cause them to cover in fear..

Death Siphon: When enemy dies close by you get health and mana from that, not sure how to use it in fic..

Blinding Terror: You leave enemies vulnerable in terror, those who are panicked take more damage..

Power of Death: Killing enemies, attracts spirits that strenghtens your spells

Simulacrum: If you pass out, spirit you are controlling takes on your likeness and fights in your stead for a while, you can only come back when the spirit leaves.

Spirit Mark: You mark enemy with attaking spirit doing damage while it's active, if they die with the mark, the spirit mimics the victim and figts for a while.

Walking Bomb: You curse the enemy, with on-going damage, then trigger the curse for exlosion doing lot of damage. If this kills the target it spreads the effect to others nearby.

Haste: Speed boost to you and others, while active enemies are slower..

** just a note since this post seems to be attracting interest! (thanks btw for all the great suggestions) it would be a dark harry story were after 2nd year he would start hearing the voice of one of the peverell brothers telling him to find out about his true family . he doesn't return to his the dursleys but stays in the wizarding world finding out about his ancient family lineage that his ancestors became necromancers. going into the bank claiming the vault which only contains books on necromancy he begins to study in godrics hallow while Thier he slowly gets corrupted like voldemort did but in the beginning it was a noble cause save others from death but obviously that goes out the window . during this time he considers what voldemort said about them bieng able to do extraordinary things together the greatest necromancer in history & a powerful lich so goes out to find him during 4th year

story starts 4th year graveyard scene harry already has both the wand (he summoned it to himself ) and the cloak & seeks the ressurection stone so he can gain Knoledge from the dead & complete the hallows he can't summon it due to a soul being inside it

another note i thought would be fun. the peverell & flamell family despise eachother & seek to wipe eachother out . they were boen fairly close timewise

plus i thought it'd be intresting lore wise one family focused on undeath. the other. immortality

the flamells would be alive & would be Harry's equal. just as voldemort & Dumbledore have that duality

also thought it'd be intresting if the hallows had a secret cult following so harry could have his own death cult like followers. ppl like luna & her dad. the unspeakables who study death. old grindlewald supporters

what do you all think?
