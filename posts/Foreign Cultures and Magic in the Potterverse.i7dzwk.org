How exactly do you think that Foreign Cultures and Magic in the Potterverse should be handled? So far, I have the following ideas:

1. Just a copy+paste of the books. This simply requires practically no effort, however, it simply breaks the setting's plausibility.

2. Minor adjustments to make the Potterverse magic system make sense. Wizards from countries like Japan won't be casting in Latin, because intent, confidence, exactness, and power boosts from items like wands are what matter with casting spells rather than saying specific words that are somehow magic. This requires minimal effort, especially if you have whatever foreign wizards there are cast spells silently. This is decent if there is no focus on foreign cultures and magic...

I think that the first option is in-line with what Rowling says it should look like, and the second option is in-line with what she showed it looked like, although I could be wrong.

3 . The third option that I have come up with is that there are distinct differences between the magics used in Magical Europe and the rest of the world, and that the cultures are similarly different if only due to being built off of that. This would ideally reflect how different cultures have different mythology and folklore, and thus, different focuses in terms of magic. On the other hand, this would make Wizarding Britain look flanderized compared to what Rowling showed, with countries such as India presumably cherishing parseltongue whereas Wizarding Britain would revile it, and Hogwarts' lacking historical education would have worsened Wizarding Britain's international standing due to international history being extremely relevant, among other issues. Oddly enough, this does make Wizarding Britain out to be quite the powerhouse, given that they would have likely supported Imperial Britain against foreign wizards. Now that I think about it, it is a bit odd that no foreign newspapers were referenced in Harry Potter, only the Daily Prophet and Quibbler. There are definitely points supporting the idea that Wizarding Britain may have poor outlooks on foreign magic and cultures, to an extent that could be considered arrogant, but that would be seen as flanderizing the Wizarding Britain.

Personally, I think that third option is how it should ideally be handled.

Do you have another idea? Perhaps any ideas on how specific foreign magical cultures might work in the Potterverse, or a fanfiction that you would recommend that illustrates how you think some culture or cultures may work?


** Personally my view is that magic is universal, but incantations may vary. That is: the content of a spell is its conceptual apparatus, not the word used to invoke it. The concept of "summon" is the same everywhere, regardless of what language you use to express it, and therefore the spell behaves the same everywhere. But a different label may attach to it.

If you do want to make varied foreign magic systems, however, I think the most important thing to keep in mind is Newcomb's Rule:

#+begin_quote
  I think a good question to ask yourself whenever you're adding foreign magic to your story is, "why is this not widespread in magical Britain?"

  If your answer isn't a common-sense, basically reasonable one, if it feels like you have to contort yourself around your premise or force it, or if the answer ends up using any variation of the "wizarding Britain is actually very backwards and dumb" trope, re-consider the magic you're trying to introduce.
#+end_quote

Basically: don't fall so in love with a foreign magic system that you make it OP. Because anything that was OP would naturally spread around the world as wizards everywhere adopted it for its utility. See: wands in canon.

To add to this rule, I would say that you can't pay too much respect to foreign cultures.

A while back there was a Twittergasm around JKR's use of American Indian folklore in a way that didn't accurately reflect the real-world belief systems (historical and contemporary) of American Indians.

The problem with this is that the essential approach of the HP magic system towards folklore, myths and legends is to subvert that mythology. With very few exceptions, the HP universe takes mythological things and changes them dramatically:

- In mythology, Pegasus was a unique, legendary figure, the offspring of a god. In HP, winged horses are used to draw carriages and they drink whisky.

- In mythology, dragons are majestic, powerful creatures. In HP, they are kept in reserves and farmed for wand/potions ingredients.

- In folklore, ghosts are terrifying malevolent spirits. In HP, they are mascots who celebrate their death like a birthday.

All of this fits with a magic system where magic is principally used for cooking, cleaning and office work. The tone of the HP series is one of taking magic and grounding it in the normalcy of day-to-day life, while retaining the spark of romanticism that makes the magic feel magical.

With this in mind, I think that paying too much respect to the folklore of various cultures will result in worldbuilding elements which fundamentally contradict the established tone of the canon worldbuilding. If you want to produce material for non-Western magical cultures which matches the tone of the HP worldbuilding, you need to change and subvert that mythology, /not/ just stick it wholesale into the story, without alteration.

*** You could also argue that Canon shows Harry's views. As a young person not exposed to magic growing up, even the "mundane" things would be magical to him and thus mentioned in his point of view. It's the narrator that limits the universe not the universe is for sure limited.

I believe with the right context and characterization foreign magic and culture could most certainly exist within "canon". Just IMO. I love the idea of diversity in magic and magical cultures across the world, different than mundane boundaries and views.

*** I mean, I could make an argument that foreign cultures simply don't get along with Wizarding Britain due to it's previous status as an imperialistic power... and that Wizards and Witches have a long memory due to their long lives.

I went into more detail on this in another comment, but can you name a single foreign newspaper from a magical culture mentioned in the Harry Potter book, for instance? I can think of a reason or two why they would be brought up, but to my knowledge, they simply weren't.

**** I'm not really sure what relevance newspapers have to magic.

In any event, it would also be extremely odd for a foreign newspaper to be mentioned. People typically do not read newspapers from other countries, nor are they generally available for purchase. Certainly in Muggle Britain foreign newspapers are not obtainable as a matter of routine - only really in certain areas of London, and even then only the NYT and El Pais.

***** I agree but how would the general wizarding populace receive information about what's happening in other countries? I highly doubt everyone has connections in other countries to hear news from. Word of mouth is very unlikely. So maybe there is a section for international news on the Daily Prophet?

****** There is the radio system, and for years people did not have access to news of what was happening in other countries off hand. The internet is still a relatively new invention, especially the prevalence of it. Generally, you only had easy access to what was in your local newspaper, and thus what the editors of that paper felt fit to print for you. Other ways that happened in metropolitan areas were in coffee shops, breweries, etc.

In many circumstances yes. However, the Tri-Wizard Tournament and Quidditch World Cup were both big international events that should have had foreign correspondents present. Plus Victor bloody Krum, one of the most famous wizards alive, is competing in the Tri-Wizard and nobody from eastern Europe shows up to cover it?

**** But Britain isn't the only imperial nation so previous colonies wouldn't get along with many countries including France, Spain, Portugal, Germany etc. That would create a lot of problems in the ICW. Then again it might explain why we don't see a lot of communication with other schools. They had to revive the triwizard tournament and we can see that they was a lot of bad blood between the countries.

That'd mean Barty Crouch Sr. (or anyone who knows a lot of languages, or anyone who changes his knowledge-base significantly) would need to learn different spells, and there'd be fluency specific schools, with priority given to non-verbal / "instinctual" spells.

An easier way around this is to just assume that in most parts of Europe (or maybe what is called "Anglo"), Latin was upheld and magic was practised the way it should have been, while in other conutries despots subjugated "lesser" wizards to muggle culture.

** 1) The wizarding world is heavily euro-centric. Wands were created in Europe and slowly spread around the globe, quite similar to firearms. Those who do not use the wand (such as some Native American and African tribes), specialize in their local magic but tend to be unable to compete with the average European/Asian wizard. This is also why there are only 11 'ivy league' schools, with 4-5 of them being in Europe. Large wizarding schools tend to focus on the use of the wand, aka 'eurasian' magic.

2) The ICW is dominated by european and asian countries as well, as they are the main supporters for the SoS. They have heavily-handingly shoved the other nations in line. You have exceptions for various tribes around the world, but overall the ICW makes sure the SoS is being enforced.

3) Latin is the main base for most of Europe, due to the wand coming from Italy, and the fact that the upper nobility tended to be able to speak it. As the SoS was enacted in the 1600s, we are looking at a completely different world, ruled by a few large empires. The exceptions of 'latin based' spells would be Scandinavia/Baltics, Russia, and maybe the germanic nations (if you want to go that route). Eastern Europe would be dominated by the Turks, which use Greek based spells (very similar to latin) with some war-like curses in their own native languages, and Arabic.

4) Outside of Europe, the magical world is split into smaller nations, as in no magical india (instead various regions), tons of tribes and groups in Africa and South America (which is split between muggleborns from colonists and the native wizards). Some groups may be better at small sections of magic, or focus on certain aspects of it (perhaps some groups are dedicated healers), but overall magic is roughly the same. All groups still need summoning charms, curses, and more.

** Supporting Points on why Wizarding Britain would have once been the most powerful Wizarding Nation:

1. Magical Britain should generally have matched Imperial Britain.
2. Grindelwald was at least on the level of an international terrorist, and with magic in the equation... Europe would have produced some of the best Wizards in the world, along with Dumbledore.
3. There are a disproportionate number of Wizarding Schools in Europe to Wizarding Schools elsewhere in the world, at least listed on Pottermore.

Supporting Points on why Wizarding Britain is likely more on par with other countries in the modern age:

1. With the Statute of Secrecy, it is doubtful that Wizarding Britain would have been able to lead wars against other countries to keep them subjugated underneath them.
2. Due to Binns status as a bad history teacher, such that most students sleep in his class, Wizarding Britain probably has had a bad education in terms of World History, and thus international relationships, for quite a while. Combined with inherited arrogance, this means that Wizarding Britain would have had disproportionate trade agreements and unfamiliarity with foreign magics.
3. Finally, this last one is a bit of a doozy. Given the curse on the defense position, outcomes like the average adult being unable to cast even a basic shield spell should be taken as the likely and natural conclusion. Aurors would be trained from an irregularly bad base, and magical research will be negligible in this field. Thus, while other countries will have grown disproportionately faster due to factors like their previously subjugated state and Wizarding Britain practically being served up to them on a silver platter, it can be concluded that foreign countries will have grown stronger and that Wizarding Britain will have grown weaker.
4. Due to the culture of arrogance from Imperial Britain towards other cultures having likely been sustained till the modern day, with the supporting evidence that something like "Harry Potter slandered by Magical Britain's Ministry of Magic" likely being brought up in foreign newspapers. Of course, given how this was never brought up, not even for a citation in the Quibbler, /and/ how other such newspapers were never mentioned... this has interesting implications.

** Before you look at the other end of the World, I'd be a lot more interested in the situation around Europe. The magical world diverged in 1692, long before nationalism, the industrial and agricultural revolution and all related effects. Back in those days, Belgium was called the Spanish Netherlands, most of Poland(-Lithuania) was way east of where you'd find Poland today, there was no Italy, what became Yugoslavia or Germany and...

[[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/35/28/27/352827a83633f426d23ffa733fa51b08.png][well Europe looked like this]]

So how exactly did things change in the magical world without the influences of muggles? There was no French Revolution, Napoleon and Vienna to change the political landscape, no world wars, imperialism and decolonisation and so on. Hell, most of what would become the US was French or no man's land, so I am pretty sure that whatever Rowling came up with for FB is not well researched.

I am not sure that you can answer any of these questions to the satisfaction of everyone, and defining who owns what and which conflicts resulted is pretty important to figuring out what a culture looks like. The World Wars impacted Europe very deeply in that regard, as did the French Revolution. So whatever magical France is like, it ought to be very different from what we know today as France, including its people. Nevermind the other side of the globe.

** I've been working a while on how would Magic work on this world and so far I got this:

Magic through the World:

Africa The first humans appeared in África millions of years ago, it took them thousands more to understand Magic. As the tribes grew in size and power wizards also became more powerful, the Modern Magic system taught in most of Africa was based on the Tribal Magic system, but evolved to use written language, Uagadou (the largest african school) have particulary specialized itself in Astronomy, Alchemy and Self-Transfiguration. Wands are primarily a European invention, and although African wizards have adopted them as useful tools, Uagadou students prefer to cast spells simply by Handweaving, which makes them versatile wizards but less powerful and limits their overall spell knowledge.

Asia As the first Tribal Shamans expanded through Asia, not only their Tribal Magic adapted to their enviroment but also to their philosophies and practices, the birth of the first cities, organized religions and societies as well as the arrival of written language, gave birth to a new type of Magic as well as the first recorded "Spells". Mesopotamia, Egypt and the middle/near East cultures put a strong emphasis in "spellcasting", transfiguration/conjuration, Alchemy and Warding. The Far East cultures instead, while developed a strong political/religious sociocultural system, mantained their Tribal approach to Magic while focusing in self-transfiguration (as well as Alchemy), through breathing and Martial Arts, Warding, conjuration and basic elemental evocation. Asia in general prefers the use of Focii of the "Pentagram/Sword types" (Jade rings, Magical Circles, Jians, etc).

Europe The original indo-european settlers that traversed Eurasia were purely knowlegded on the Tribal system, however, with the influence of the near-asian Magical cultures and the advent of the greek Polis and the philosophical thinking, greek wizardry grew and developed to an extremely advanced stage, becoming the basis for Modern Western wizardry. The Greek Magic School, specialized in Spellcasting, use of Foci (particulary Wands and Chalices), elemental evocation, transfiguration and some minor use of conjuration. The greeks developed the schools of Mysteries, secret covens of Wizards devoted to study and orally transmit the knowledge of certain powerful forms of Magic, these are the precursors of the currents Departments of Mysteries. The first effective Wands were developed in the days of the ancient greeks.This Magic School of thought expanded through Asia with the great armies of Alexander the Great, but reached it's peak not by itself, but by Serving as the Grand base of the Roman School of Magic. The Romans begun their Magic work as a Confederation of Tribes evolving towards a proper Magic Society on top of the Roman one. The Romans specialized in whats been called the "interpretatio romana", the cultural trait to adapt into their own culture others' cultures by finding local equivalents and renaming after it. This trait key in the formation of the Roman Expansionism, was also key in the formation of the Roman Magic system: a unified Magic system copying others cultures'magic and renaming them with the Latin language as the base. The German invaders arrived carrying many types of Tribal Magic, but just as the Nomaji german Tribes slowly became vassals of the Romans, so did their Shamans, slowly turning their knowledge towards the Roman Magic. The fall of the Roman Empire heralded the rise of the Germanic Kingdoms, a hybrid of the Roman and germanic cultures, and so the wizarding SPQR relinquished their power to the new Wizarding comunities appearing in Europe.Europe in general prefers the use of Focii of the "Wand/Pentagram types" (Wands, Staves and sometimes Magical Circles).

America The original inhabitants of the American continent were all well verse Magic Users of the Tribal system, with the arrival of the European Nomajis/Wizards conflict ensued and the strong european colonization, the Magic system that has rooted in the continent is the "Classical one", particulary the European system. In Latinamerica and mostly in the Azteca Empire, the magic users specialized in Blood Magic, particularing using human sacrificies to fuel wards and offensive curses. America, by the tradition inherited by Europe usually prefers the use of Focii of the "Wand/Pentagram types" (Wands, Staves and sometimes Magical Circles), but Handweaving and other focci are used.

Oceania The modern "continent" of Oceania comprises Australia, New Zealand, polinesia and micronesia. The whole area is populated by seafaring aboriginal nations characterized by their use of Tribal Magic, with the arrival of the Europeans (particualry in Australia and New Zealand), the Classical school became one of the most practiced.
