The [[http://www.greyblue.net/MidnightBlue/story.php?storyid=2][Mirror of Maybe]] is great, but abandoned. It was so famous in the fandom that I have to believe someone has taken a crack at writing their own ending by now.

I've already found [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=1925][No Way Back by Meri]] and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1362757/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Mirror-Of-Paradox][Harry Potter and the Mirror of Paradox by Yih]].

I'm really hoping for an actual fanfic of the fanfic, that completes it, rather than just "inspired by." Though I'd take "inspired by," for sure.


** Why is Mirror of Maybe good?

** /No Way Back/ would be at the top of my list for certain, but I'll do some poking around the Snarryficfind comm on Livejournal and see if there's anything tagged there. If you haven't visited it, it's a great repository of Snarry fic requests. There's a chance someone has asked the same question and had it answered.

** As promised, I checked the comm. I wasn't able to locate any continuations of /Mirror of Maybe/ and the go-to fic is /No Way Back/. I suspect that the reason no one has attempted a continuation is that the author still hopes to finish it someday. Wish I had better news.
