****** I don't see it as that unlikely. Muggle medicine is so unknown to the wizarding world that Arthur's idea to use stitches for his wounds was considered completely insane.

And the historical way to "treat" werewolves seems to have been death, marginalisation, and ostracism. The potion is a very recent invention.

So I think it's quite believable that nobody ever tried it.

****** This subreddit's hate of "mugglewank" astounds me. I've never actually seen it to the extent you guys hate on it, and I can say, after more than 15 years of fanfiction readership, I've read all of the completed stories that feature non-slash Harry (Written in English, not that proto-scirpt that some of the FF "authors" use to show they never made it past the first grade).

It's stated in cannon that Wizards and Witches think Muggle medicine and techniques are lunacy and terrible for you. Why would they try Muggle (or even magical) pain meds on Werewolves, when the Magical World thinks of them as a disease that deserve to live in squalor, if not put to death?

******* Wizard kind holds werewolves in such a low regard that it's not much of a stretch to have them used as guinea-pigs for some tests. Also wouldn't half-bloods and muggleborns be aware of muggle medicine and its uses? Isn't Remus a half-blood? Totally possible that he knows of Tylenol and such, and may even try it once in a while.

** Wouldn't the crippling pain from the transformation still an issue? I mean, he wasn't having off days because he was transformed, but rather because the transformation feels like getting hit by a doubledecker bus.

There was also some fic where Harry got adopted by some crime boss and Lupin was a bigshot forger who only pretended to be poor to hide the fact that he has a job.

*** It actually seems to me that the wolfbane is what's making him take days off.

The only time we see him transform normally, he was very up and about before the transformation, and still able to do things (like pack and walk to the carriages) by noon the following day.

I don't see a normally-transforming werewolf having to take off on a Friday (or whenever Snape taught about werewolves) and then also not being able to attend a Quidditch game on Saturday.

Transforming alone where you bite yourself and knock you body into walls and all, that will definitely cause issues. But transforming out in a forest doesn't seem to cause issues for the actual werewolf. That's probably why Greyback's ideas strike with so many werewolves.
