Some details I still remember: When he got to Gringotts he said something to a guard, that if I remember correctly was a quote from a game, and the guard too him to Ragnok I think. They showed him some kind of puzzle that he was helping solve, and somehow got a time turner; Snape was kind of friendly with him; He was friends with Draco, Blaize (who I'm pretty sure was a vampire and was taking classes at a special night schedule) and the Twins (he called them his Twins); Hogwarts had students working for their masteries, and Harry was helping one of them (don't remember his name but I'm pretty sure he went by a nickname); The Twins got atacked by brownies(?) or hobgoblins at the Halloween feast and Harry's magic went wild when he found them.

That's all I can remember.
