I don't know if this is a prompt as much as it is canon, but there's a ton of evidence for Voldemort being a giant nerd who read way too many books. So my idea is that when he entered the magical world he started reading as many books as he could Hermione style. But lacking her moral compass, he bought all the already existing propaganda about house elves/ goblins/ centaurs without even thinking. And it just furthered his idea that wizards are superior.


** While he canonically despises Muggles, I don't think there's very much evidence that he thinks more lowly of nonhuman magicals than he does of wizards, for all that his Death Eaters also tend to be prejudiced against them. He doesn't think much of House-Elves, no, but no one does; note on the other hand that he is willing to ally with Fenrir Greyback and with the Dementors of Azkaban.

*** Hah. So Voldemort freed the Dementors in canon, and didn't the Order also say Voldemort offered the goblins wand rights and shit that the Ministry denied them? Might be nice to write some fics from nonhuman perspectives that show Voldy as a revolutionary to them...Seems like he never had a problem with nonhumans - just as long as he was the on on top.

Hm... "freed" isn't the word; the reason the Ministry made the Dementors' island into their prison and 'hired' the Dementors as guards is that they were /not at all confident/ in their ability to win if they tried to expel the Dementors from Azkaban. It was a mutual agreement, an uneasy truce with which neither party was happy but also too scared of the consequences to break the cold war. Voldemort offered a better deal than the Ministry had, so the Dementors switched allegiance. But they were never slaves in the way of House-Elves; it's more akin to the situation with Goblins, where they had been denied many things, but are also granted privileges (the Goblins have a monopoly on banking; the Dementors get to feed on /some/ wizards, so long as they're criminals, and otherwie keep their island to themselves), because the wizards were afraid what would happen if they made them angry.

*** The goblins seem terrorized during Deathly Hollows and the centaurs willingly fight during the battle of Hogwarts. I think it's very obvious that under Voldemort, wizards are the only respected people. Also he refuses to give Greyback a dark mark due to him being a were-wolf.

**** I'll agree that he's no friend to Centaurs, but Firenze's dialogue in /Philosopher's Stone/ suggests Centaurs are just culturally extremely set against Dark Magic (especially the extreme kinds practiced by Vodlemort), so I don't know if the mutual dislike between Voldemort and Centaurs is any more evidence that Voldemort hates nonhumans than his mutual dislike with Phoenixes means he hates birds.

One can similarly explain Voldemort's vendetta against Goblins by the fact that /Voldemort managed to break into a Gringotts Vault/ back in the first book, which the Goblins, of course, would never forgive him for; presumably he offered a more advantageous deal to the Goblin King but was proudly denied, prompting his outright oppression of them.

As for Greyback, the Dark Mark's seen as a honor among Death Eaters, but it's also a branding iron of slavery; so is Greyback not getting one a punishment, or a privilege accorded to one Voldemort sees as a useful ally rather than a servant? There's room for alternative interpretations, is what I'm saying. More simply, it could just be about maintaining an /air/ of caring about human superiority in front of the Death Eaters, as opposed to Voldemort's actual personal beliefs; he's clearly no stranger to claiming to espouse views he doesn't believe in if it makes his servants more devoted.
