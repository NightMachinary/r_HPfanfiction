Pretty much any fics where a metamorphmagus is the main character and the ability is a focal point of the narrative

By virtue of the way JK writes certain things, we know next to nothing about the upper limits of a metamorphmagus. Hence I'd love to read some fics where there (effectively) aren't any.

Or any fics that cover the potential gender fluidity that comes with being in complete control of your physique.

Also, I read a fic where Harry was some kind of metamorpmagus, but he was able to sort of copy abilities and traits of individuals he transformed into. He then transformed into a girl but had Hagrid's strength (in a much smaller body), any help finding that one would be appreciated.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Metamorph) is a pretty good one. Involves Harry and Tonks, doesn't push the bounds of metamorphing like you said but it does seem to go further than most fics.

Linkffn(Jaime Evans and Fate's Fool) covers a bit of the sexuality question. It's a small part of the fic, but I'd highly recommend it anyway.

  Harry decided that the only way he can win this war with his sanity intact is to train his own way without interference. But then he discovers an ability that he needs help with and only one person can provide that-Tonks. They bring the fight to the DEs in their own way so that the war will finally end.

** Victoria Potter: linkao3(13795605)

Main character is a Metamorphmagus. She pretty much uses it how you'd expect - just an easy way to do one's hair, hiding the ugly bits of oneself, and at one point get out of trouble by impersonating a teacher.

It's not the central point of the story, but it comes up quite a few times as a Thing Victoria Does™.

Her abilities seem to grow as she ages and the fic's only partway through second year, so it /might/ come up more often in the future - so far, not really "pushing the boundaries" though.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.

** I don't know that specific story. Here's what I know of.

linkffn(One Misfired Spell Later by losthpfanficwriter). Pretty good story. Sequel planned but not up.

linkffn(Morphed Secrets by nightkitty555). Harry has been unconsciously using his metamorphmagus abilities to hide the abuse he's suffered. It's also hidden something else. I didn't care much for this one.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Metamorph by hermyd). Harry runs away to America, gets metamorph training from Tonks. Not one of my favorites.

linkffn(Metamorphose by salus gem). Terrorists hit Gringotts while targeting Harry. He and the Malfoys go into hiding in NYC. Morphed-into-female Harry gets involved with Lucius. Again, not one of my favorites.

[[http://home.exetel.com.au/jaina/TBWT/TBWT.html][The Boy Who Tonked]] by Jaina. Only a start, but I enjoyed it. Tonks skips out on her final years of Hogwarts to locate Harry.

Transforming Harry by DrT. This is on ficwad, and I'm not going to link it because there's a lot of smut (more than I care for), so I don't know if it can be linked here.

​

The following stories I have on my "to be read" list, so I can't say anything about them, but my notes say that a metamorph (not always Harry) features in them.

linkffn(To Date a Metamorph by Just A Lonely Lorekeeper). Andromeda isn't happy that Tonks is after Lupin; tries to get her involved with Harry.

linkffn(Under Suspicion by Ottilchen). Harry escapes Azkaban after 14 years, is multi-animagus, metamorphmagus.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Metamorphmagus by CanonConvergence18). More than a year after Voldemort's defeat, Tonks helps Harry find his place in the world.

​

This last one isn't quite a metamorphmagus story, but it may fit:

linkffn(Kill on Sight by plums). Harry and Tonks are "shifters." More capable than normal metamorphmagi, but feared by the Ministry. Unfinished, and only a start, really.
