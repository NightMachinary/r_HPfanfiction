Can anyone recommend a 100,000+ word fanfic that would be really mature? I really want to be on the edge of my seat and the characters to be in danger (or even die). All help is appreciated!

*** Another of that author's works, *Patron*, linkffn(11080542), also gets pretty dark in some parts of the storyline. It's a fairly reliably updating WIP.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

#+begin_quote
  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
