I think by now we're all tired of Happy to Help!™ Goblins. I mean, we were bound to get tired of projecting our hatred of phylacteries onto the Goblins. So instead why don't we use Happy to Help!™ Dragons! In most fantasy works, dragons are significantly cooler than they are in the Harry Potter series. In HP they're kind of just regular animals, but Dragons being just animals is sacrilege! Dragons should be awesome, and what's more awesome than an innate talent for the destruction of phylacteries? Nothing that's what!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hyperbole may be present. Depiction of Lich's as weak may lead to torture or death. Comparisons of dragons to salamanders may lead to dismemberment. Dragons most likely do not speak snake language.


** Can we have dragon monologuing about the "debased and inadequate snake language which is incapable of the subtlety and power required to communicate draconic thought, but I suppose I'll temporarily lower myself to your level because you are a moderately interesting pathetic little mammal despite the insignificant number of neurons in that tiny head of yours"?

And then Snape and the dragon live together sneerily ever after.

*** No, we can have lots of Happy to Help! Happy Helpful Dragons. I spent far too much on marketing to ignore the trademark.

** Might just be me being a nerd, but basing interactions with goblins above the bare minimum on Ferengi from /Star Trek/ would probably work. Replace latinum with gold, and work in an analogue of Quark and you're set.
