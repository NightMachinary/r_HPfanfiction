I'm a bit down in the dumps at the moment and would like something that would raise my spirits. Good examples of such fics would be, "Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary by The madness in me" or "Favorite Things by Stanrick"

Links to previously mentioned fics since last I saw the bot wasn't working...

On a train, switching tracks

Draco and Ron end up learning about how celebrities become crazy from Harry on the train ride to Hogwarts as freshmen year and become determined to prevent him from the disease.

Really funny, light hearted fic. Not super long, but worth it.

Another funny one is Harry the Hufflepuff.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/]]

Harry is a very lazy Hufflepuff who tries anything avoid work.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

linkffn(Oh God Not Again!): possibly the funniest time-travel story out there. A personal favorite.

linkffn(When in Doubt, Obliviate): by the same author, Harry raised by Lockhart, hijinks ensue.

** Well, I have a lot of fics for such occasions.

I can't recommend Slytherin Harry enough -

Linkffn(What Would Slytherin Harry do? by Big D on a Diet)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/What-Would-Slytherin-Harry-Do]]

This one is a really humorous series. It has gems like - " Snape, it can safely be assumed, despised children. Most teachers do, but Snape had elevated it to a state well beyond normal boundaries. With his rather /unique/ training in certain areas of magic and absolutely nil instruction in the area of teaching, Snape was to education what Voldemort was to life insurance. It had been eight years since the last official complaint against him, which said much for his campaign of intimidation."

Linkffn(Mistaken Identity by Silver Pard; A Mistaken Sorting by Silver Pard)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2861750/1/Mistaken-Identity]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2870906/1/A-Mistaken-Sorting]]

Some really cool and humorous oneshots -

Linkffn(Voldemort's Secret Weapon by Senyor Fier Mensheir; To Enrage a Teacher by Padawan Jess Kenobi; And Bits of Fluff by Teufel1987; Not as Advertised by sasahara17; The Marauder's Howler by Brain Fluff; Revenge is Sweet by Janara; You're A Wizard, Little Us by slayst; Community Service by Balthanon; The Easy Way by Kolarthecool; Misundertood by Madrigal-in-training; Harry Chooses Stonewall by HarnGin; Ruthless Revenge by Yunaine; That Potter Boy by BadgerInMySoup; Functional Blood Protection by Right What is Wrong; Helpful Hints for First Years by BajaB; Skewing the Odds by Ruskbyte; The Wendell that wasn't by opalish; What if Harry had said by dbzdragonlanceman; I'm His Favorite! Me! by Madrigal-in-training; Out of the Fire and Into the Cupboard by HalfASlug; Albus Dumbledore, Accelerationist by Right What is Wrong)

** My own linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor). Hermione is a Parselmouth, which has the dual effects of making her start a nonhuman-rights crusade early, and make her respect authority less (since supposedly-authoritative Muggles got snakes /completely wrong/ all throughout their childhood). Hilarity ensues.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

  Not a lot of things could affect Harry's mundane life in the house of his abusive relatives. But then, you don't need extraordinary things to obtain extraordinary results. A seemingly simple step pitched his life into a direction no one had ever expected. Harry Potter, the Jack of all trades and Master of Misdirection. Intelligent! Harry.
