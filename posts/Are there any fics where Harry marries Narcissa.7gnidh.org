**** Not even Top 100. I mean, Harry/any Death Eater (like Snape, Lucius, Draco or even Bella) would never work unless you go massively AU and make +the magical Waffen SS+ hot actors the good guys. They were murders, traitors, terrorists and war criminals, not some misguided youth group.

At least you can fit Narcissa into the "got stuck here due to my husband" role since we do not have definite proof of her embracing racist ideologies and calling for purges at the tender age of 12 or calling your best friend a racial slur at 16. You can tailor a semi-plausible deniability for her, something that is impossible for anyone else on Voldemort's side.

Therefore I am happy to recommend this:

linkffn(10990939)

There is at least one other story out there where Harry and Narcissa get married but it is a weird mixture of harem marriage law fic and non-explicit smut.

  Harry and Narcissa romance, several years after the battle for Hogwarts, Harry's marriage to Ginny is on the rocks, a chance meeting in Grimmauld place changes everything. This is my first ever fan fic, I hope people like my effort, all comments, suggestions and story ideas welcomed currently updating all chapters (hopefully making it better)

***** I'm just guessing, but is that other story Harry Potter: Whiskey Accident? I actually stumbled upon this after reading "Why are you in my house?" and was looking for more harry/narcissa fics.

I didn't hate what I read, but the premise is something I grew tired of after seeing so many married in Las Vegas stories

****** No, it is "The Law". Marriage law fic and Harry gets Hermione, Narcissa and Kingsley's niece (14-year-old OC). The fic is supposed to be smut but skips over the smutty parts and has some weird moral implications like Minister Kingsley carrying a law that forces people into marriage (= Ministry approved rape) but then dislikes that his relative could get someone who might actually take advantage of the law he passed and pulls some strings so that she get's Harry to prevent her from getting traumatised (unlike the thousands of other girls)
