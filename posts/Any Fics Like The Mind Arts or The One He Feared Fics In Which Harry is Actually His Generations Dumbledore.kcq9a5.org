Pretty much what the title says. I'm looking for any fics in which Harry is on track to be on par with Dumbledore, Riddle, Grindelwald, etc. I prefer fics starting during Hogwarts. Here are some of the fics I think fall into this category that I've read:

linkffn(the one he feared, the mind arts, a Cadmean victory, Harry Potter and the international Triwizard tournament, honour thy blood, stepping back)

Less so the last two, but I'll count them. Bonus points if it goes in depth on magic and the like.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

*** Just to clarify, the Harry in this story is essentially the cannon Dumbledore of that verse, I would say Dumbledore is bashed in the story but truth be told he just doesn't play enough of a role for it to be considered bashing, it would be like trying to bash Maflada Hopkins (the one who sends the underage magic letters) only with cannon as basis.

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater. Good Dumbledore All Years

** linkffn(Dark Lord's Equal) linkffn(Ashes of Chaos)

Both of these fics have a prodigy Harry who's on the level of Dumbledore or Riddle. And he doesn't become a Super Harry either. He still needs a lot more to learn and experience to actually challenge or fight Voldie or Dumbles.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

Creative battle scenes, a slow build for Harry being powerful (he loses as much as he wins early on), heavy on transfiguration and conjuration in combat.

  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.
