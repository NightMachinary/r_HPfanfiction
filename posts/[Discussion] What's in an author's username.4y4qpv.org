I'm not very happy with mine. I chose it in a bit of a hurry when my preferred choices had gone and in the last year or so, a couple of people have said they picked up connotations - different ones - neither of which were remotely relevant to me or my stories. So as I consider changing it I'm thinking about what makes a 'good' username. When I look at popular writers, I can see a slight tendency for shipping/romance writers to have quite feminine sounding names and the OP Lord Black type thing to have harder-sounding, more masculine names. I'm unlikely to bother looking at anything written by (for example) dracoandmione4eva (sorry if that is anyone here; I'm sure you are a very good writer really! So I thought it might make an interesting discussion. And I might get some useful advice too.


** The name I want was taken, but hasn't been used in years, so I just settled for the name my edgier 10 year old self came up with back in the 90's.

** I don't notice usernames at all when considering reading a fic. I can see why an author might consider it carefully! But coming up with a username can be a stressful and frustrating experience-trying to find something that's not taken but is still clever and good... I hate it. Plus, people change so their username might not reflect them any more but they may want to keep it because that's how others know them.

** Mine is doxxy and I think I just assumed no one would read my stuff so it wouldn't matter. If I could go back in time I'd choose something else.

I think good names should be able to work for both dark and happy fics. I mean, I suppose if you only ever write one type it doesn't matter, but if down the line "AlbusDumbledog" decides to write a sensitive portrayal of PTSD it may feel a bit clumsy. Likewise, someone with an edge lord sounding name might look a bit weird writing H/G fluff

** Generally speaking I don't think it matters, but it should be capitalised and not have numbers/weird punctuation in it. Basically you should avoid anything that implies your English ability is poor.

*** That's interesting. I have never particularly noticed the use of capital letters or not - I suppose I read it like an email address. My current one is all lower case, but that's definitely food for thought. I would agree on the numbers and weird punctuation. And txt speak. But that's probably because I'm very old.

** I've been ScottPress since my CoD days. I usually give a bit of thought to a new username when I'm creating it so that I don't end up hating it in a week. Atm I'm using two primary ones, though there's a third one that I dust off on rare occasions. I quite like the nick ScottPress. It's neutral enough that it'll fit anywhere, but with a bit of uniqueness to stand out just a bit.

** I'd never noticed it before, but you're right when it comes to the two types of usernames most frequently encountered in the fandom. Good catch.

I try my best to not draw parallels between an author's penname and the quality of their work. I'm sure there are plenty of witty names regurgitating fanon dreck and other, less creative, pseudonyms with incredible, original ideas.

** Personally, I don't think too hard about people's usernames. It can be hard to be original when so many have come before you and picked the good ones already.

Though, if you give yourself one like RonMione4ever, I do feel you're limiting what people expect out of you. A username like that does cause one to think you'll only ever write Ron/Hermione as a pairing.

** I chose my pen name from a phrase in a song that was playing while I was creating my account: asecretchord.

** As a reader I have never given it a second thought. As a writer mine (Relish Redshoes) was a nod to the first (and trifle obscure) fandom I ever wrote for.

It definitely isn't gushy or shippy, but isn't a butch, maschismo one either.

I suppose it sounds /vaguely/ saucy? I don't know if that's a good thing or not.
