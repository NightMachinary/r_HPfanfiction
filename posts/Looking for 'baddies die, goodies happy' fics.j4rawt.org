I am in the mood for reading about all the baddies getting their due and the goodies (or at least neutralies) getting a good or normal life.

Reunion ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion]]); Larceny, Lechery and Luna Lovegood ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood]]); Make-A-Wish ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish]]); all by Rorschach's Blot and all with a lot of humor. Old Soldiers Never Die ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2784825/1/Old-Soldiers-Never-Die]]) is another by Rorschach's Blot without the humor.

Are there any others, with or without humor?

I really want to read about how, even in the Harry Potter universe where most everything is badly managed, those who do bad things get punished and at least some innocents get to live happy lives. Since the Death Eaters are natural targets, and the children and muggle-born are natural innocents...

For my mood, the important thing is we follow the protagonist(s) 'removing' the baddies, and without much trouble.

(I am sure this has been asked before. Feel free to point me to those threads.)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]] comes with the most comprehensive destruction of those you would call "baddies". Death Eaters and British blood purists are merely the beginning...

*** +I just read the Prologue and Chapter 1.+

For those wondering:\\
Prologue was a bad as I expected but not as horrible as I'd feared.\\
Chapter 1 sees them utterly avoiding any victimhood and (not to give spoilers) taking swift decisive action.\\
Chapters 2 - 4 sees a start on fixing up Hogwarts.

+I have no idea what the remaining 27 chapters might be about, but I have high hopes of no rape or victimhood.+

If I'd known this was not a mournful litany of abuse I'd have tried it sooner.

5 Oct 2020:\\
I just finished the fic. It stayed away from angst and rape and such throughout. It definitely is a heavily optimistic and positive depiction of events and left me feeling good for the characters and possible futures for everyone.

*** I've always avoided this fic due to finding forced marriage abhorrent, but maybe now is the time.

**** That is kinda the premise. The law was horrid so instead of complying with it, they started a revolution/revolt.

**** Now is definitely the time. It's a pretty good fic that does magical war really well.
