Hi guys,

So I'm doing this class at Uni about adaptation. This week we studied Fan Fiction and had to write a 350 word fanfic ourselves based on Harry Potter. I am kind of over Harry Potter after reading the books in primary school (elementary) and don't know it that well anymore. So i decided to just cross it over with Jurassic World for the lols.

My main question to you is does this kind of fit with the character's personalities and what not? Obviously it's not as fleshed out as i would have liked it to be, sticking to a 350 word limit and all.

Here's the story anyway:

It was a long final year at Hogwarts. Harry, Ron and Hermione were looking at taking a summer vacation away. Harry was most looking forward to this, as the idea of going back home to his Uncle, Aunt and his cousin Dudley Dursley was not ideal. They were very excited to be heading to the latest theme park that just opened, Jurassic World.

Upon arrival they were impressed at how the place had come together after the issues it had in the early 90's. “This place looks great!” Ron exclaimed with much enthusiasm. “I'm more interesting in how they have sourced their information on these creatures that haven't existed in millions of years.” Said Hermione, “I mean, you know these beasts are genetically engineered and not perfect clones.” Hermione seemed troubled by this. Harry attempted to console her and said, “Well, I guess life found a way.” “But Harry! They don't even have feathers!” She snapped back. “Gosh Hermione,” said Ron, “Save it for the message boards!”

It was late afternoon by the time they reached the park's latest attraction. A completely new dinosaur created by scientists called Indominus Rex. Ron was disappointed, “it says it can camouflage itself but I can clearly see it behind that tree.” Ron pulled out his wand and cast an invisibility spell on the creature. “Ron!” Hermione shouted angrily. “What? I'm helping!” he shouted back. It was at this point a park ranger named Chris Pratt walked into the enclosure with a helper. “Look what you've done, Ron. They think it has escaped!” screamed Hermione “Change it back, Ron.” Said Harry. “Fine.” He said sheepishly. Ron proceeded to make the creature visible once more. “Are you happy now?” He said as he looked at the others but noticed the shock on their faces. “Guys?” Ron looked back over into the enclosure and saw blood dripping from the mouth of the creature as Chris Pratt was desperately running for the exit. “Oh...” Ron said awkwardly. “Let's get the hell out of here!” Hermione screamed.

They made it out on the last ferry just as the alarm sounded. “Don't worry about it, Ron. They should have learned from their mistake the last three times.” Claimed Harry.

Wow. I can't even cover establishing a setting in that length, let alone sufficient conflict.

Not with Ron's statement about the message boards. Unfortunately, he's almost wholly ignorant of Muggle culture so it's extremely doubtful he'd know what one is or how to use one. That being said, I'm not sure how much it really matters. If you didn't notice anything awry it's highly unlikely that your professor will either. This subreddit is full of HP nerds after all. =)

Congratulations on finishing your assignment!

*** Thanks! yeah i know 350 really makes it read rushed. I went a bit meta on the message board thing as there were a lot of pissed people floating around the JW board complaining about a lack of feathers but I completely forgot about their world and a Muggle culture.
