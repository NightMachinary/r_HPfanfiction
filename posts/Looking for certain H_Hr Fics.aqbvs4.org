i already posted this in the Harmony subreddit, but i open it here so maybe some of you also knows Fics.

1. Snape survives the War. Well i had this idea for a long time now and i wonder, how post-Hogwarts fics (including H/Hr having children) would happen, if Snape would be alive. Considering the context, its not a real important change, but im curious how it would be, if he still teaches at Hogwarts (IF he teaches at all. maybe he go into retirement). Its not important, that he is unharmed, as this would be unlikely (but i would also accept this), but something like a crippled leg or something would be ok.

2. The Description of the Fic "A Darkened World" by sprinter1988 gave me the imagine of H/Hr happens during the last Book, but then Harry disappears after the AK (he lands in the world between, but when he decides to go back, he returns to the real world Years later) or some time later, he is said to be dead. Ron is comforting Hermione and they have a child in the following time. When Harry then returns, the suprise is big, as well as the guilt, that Ron and Hermione (especially Hermione) would feel.

​

1. H/Hr get a Visit from their AU Kid/s.

If this happens in the Canon, that might ignore the Epilogue or in an AU and the visit comes from another AU doesnt matter. Also the point of time, when H/Hr get this visit actually doesnt matter, but it should be at the Point that have them being together, so they are sure that they want to be (live) with the other one and marry him/her. Even a visit while they have their own children is fine. The AU visit can be either from Harry as the Father and a different Woman (example: Fleur.) or Hermione and a different Father (example: Draco.). Now, i realize that this request has similarities with "Harry or Hermione with their Canon spouses (or future spouses) travel into an AU and learn to know that the "brother-sister" relationship is deeper in that" and it could be the same way as "the nextgen travel into an AU that has H/Hr together/married instead of their Universe Parents"....Hmmm, that would be an interesting idea too. Let it be that Albus and Scorpius travel into an AU in Cursed child that has H/Hr married instead of the Canon ones. But thats from the kids Perspective. And i mainly want to know, what H/Hr would think, if an "illegitimate" child appears. I dont know, if i should open an extra thread for the childrens view, but you can post fics with this too. But it would be good, if you would note it as such a Fic, so i know, what i read first .

​

1. DH Fics that are mostly or in certain parts compliant to the Canon. H/Hr should start as in Canon, so Hermione is with Ron but during the Course of the Hunt (Rons leaving) they grow closer to each other and make love and some point to each other. Possibly even at the End of the War...you know, when Voldemort does annonce his Ultimatum and she sees this as the last chance to spend with him (well, if they or she ignore that Ron is still there. Please no Animagus stuff. Maybe Fics that have the Relationship built around Hermiones „that's nothing“ quote (when Ron confronts her about him saw them) and so Harry develops feelings and later on confess her with this before they get intim or so she would know.

​

1. Now it gets hot....can you tell me Fics that have them make love? I know that in „Time is the Fire“, „Notebooks and Letters“ and „Kissing Lessons for Beginners“ are atleast 1 detailed scene in each Fic. If it fits into the Story, you can give me the name. Im in the mood for this. Oneshots are also ok.

Adding as an subpoint: H/Hr having sex in the Bathroom or Shower would also very well be accepted. Although i can only imagine this when they are out of Hogwarts and adults, im open for Hogwarts fics, but no Smut without any Story Fics in that case as there should be atleast some emotions.

It would be good, if you could mark the Fics, you can give with the Numbers or make a note. Its ok, if a Fic contains more than 1 category.
