#+TITLE: LF fic where Harry is horrible at social interactions kinda similar to The Mind Arts. I’d prefer it if he is a bit more intelligent then canon and no prank wars.

** Never read the Mind Arts, but in Art of Self-Fashioning, he's both intelligent and terrible at social interactions. Neville and Harry switch their canonical places and Harry dedicates his life to restoring the sanity of his parents via transfiguration. Fantastic read.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.
