**** And does that make Hermione the Wonder Woman of the universe to complete the Golden Trio Trinity comparison? Harry is probably better suited to Batman as they're both orphans, although the fandom turning Ron's skill at chess into him being a master strategist does work with Batman as well.

****** Clark was raised by a loving family since he was an infant. He probably doesn't really think of himself as an orphan. But Bruce is known for being even angstier than Harry over their parents' deaths.

And the Dursleys are definitely not the Kents.

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.
