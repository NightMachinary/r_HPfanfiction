  Ever wonder what would happen if the Muggles found out about the Harry Potter world? If so, this is for you.In the movie version of Order of the Phoenix, Harry is filmed flying right next to a boat filled with Muggles when he is being escorted to 12 Grimmauld Place. Unknown to any of the wizards, an American soft drink company is filming a commercial for the 1996 Super Bowl from the boat at the time Harry is flying past. It's a pity the wizards never knew that Disillusionment Charms would not work against electronic video equipment.

** In "Patron" I've got French and Bulgarian cultures , some stuff on Jamaica and an upcoming excursion into the Magical Ottoman Empire, but most of the "culture focus" is on the AU Wizarding Britain. Though since it's very different from canon (it's much more progressive and liberal in some places than muggle Britain, and at the same time more archaic though tempered by custom in other areas) it might also qualify as "culture other than Britain".

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.
