** From Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. Harry realises that he could destroy Azkaban, and a phoenix appears to transport him there. Harry turns down the opportunity, asking it to come back another time, when he is ready. The phoenix vanishes, and Dumbledore appears.

#+begin_quote
  "The phoenix comes," said the old wizard. "To those who would fight, to those would act even at cost of their lives, the phoenix comes. Phoenixes are not wise, Harry, they know no means to judge us, save witnessing the choice. I thought it was to my death I went, when the phoenix took me to fight Grindelwald. I did not know that Fawkes would sustain me, and heal me, and stay by my side -" The old wizard's voice quavered, for a moment. "It is not spoken of - you should realize, Harry, why it is never spoken of - if the one knew, the phoenix could not judge. But to you, Harry, I may say it now, for the phoenix comes only once."

** Not so much a quote, but this is one of the most chilling pieces of dialogue I've read: a conversation between the Death Eaters guarding Luna and Ollivander at Malfoy Manor. It was the first thing to jar me into remembering that Death Eaters, as horrifying as they can be, are human with lives of their own.

#+begin_quote
  ‘I know. So they've been asking her all sorts. But she won't talk. So they got me in to try and persuade her.'

  Nott let out a low laugh. ‘It's your expertise, right?'

  ‘I suppose. So I went in, just thinking it'd be like it always is, right? You just go in, few curses, throw them about a bit -- they always talk in the end. But I went in, like I always do -- and there's just this little girl there. Tiny. Waif of a thing. A child.'

  ‘You're kidding.'

  ‘I'm not. She must have been about twelve, thirteen? Got these huge blue eyes, and she just stared at me. Didn't say a word. Usually they're a wreck by that point, but she hardly even blinked. And it got me thinking of my own daughter, and I just...'

  ‘You didn't do it?'

  ‘No, of course I did. What do you think? I'm not going soft. That's how you get killed.'

Something more lighthearted from [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307670][An Improbable Fiction]], which has a lot of quotables but they don't make as much sense out of context.

#+begin_quote
  Hugo did not know such things, mostly because he had no idea who the ghost boy was, but in Cedric's time at Hogwarts there had never been such a thing as a curfew bell. If he had not been wandering about in that tremulous ghost-space somewhere between present life and after-life, he should have known that in recent years the students of the Hogwarts population had been sneaking out after hours and funneling regularly through the last-standing secret exit way from the castle into Hogsmeade, where they had a monthly contract drawn up with Aberforth Dumbledore, who traded his secrecy for the business these late-night students brought him. Aberforth was no stranger to making deals with the Hogwarts populace, of course.

*** This is my personal favourite line from that story, mainly because I find Lily Luna's slang hilarious.

#+begin_quote
  Scorpius gazed at Harry, deeply impressed by his---what did Lily call it? His mellow. Harry's was a mellow that refused to be harshed. An unharshable mellow, that's what Harry had. And that? Was just chill.

** In the scene a Hufflepuff was standing up for Harry: " Harry was reminded that, while snakes and lions might be more purely dangerous, angering a badger was a really bad idea. Also, a badger was much harder to detach from one's leg."

No mouth, but some serpent's's by Lightning on wave (2nd book from the sacrifices arc series.) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/]]

*** no shit, [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=BE&v=Ua3M1O-WQrM][here's a video of a badger killing a motherfucking cobra!]]

Notice how the cobra did bite and poison the badger, he just doesn't care and continues eating the cobra anyway.

** Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle (by Inverarity)

#+begin_quote
  "Against my better judgment, I am going to suspend the aforementioned punishment," she said finally. "You may say nothing about it to your friends. You may not warn them or try to smooth things over with them ahead of time. Trust me, Miss Quick, if you do tell them, I will know." Her voice held a chilly certainty. "Let the rest of this semester pass with you knowing that one more act of misbehavior -- just one more, Miss Quick! -- will result in your friends suffering the most demoralizing punishment I can think of. But not you, Miss Quick. Oh no. You will go completely unpunished. Do what you please. Act up, talk back to your teachers, break the rules to your selfish little heart's content. I'll see to it that your friends bear the consequences fully, but there will be no more detentions for you, no more transfiguration curses, no more privileges withheld. You can get away with exactly as much misbehavior as you are willing to let your friends pay the price for. And after the very next time you cross the line, Miss Quick, then you can tell them. Oh yes, everyone will know that Alexandra Quick bears no consequences for her actions. She lets her friends do that."

** Pulled this out of my quote collection:

#+begin_quote
  Colin Creevey's enthusiasm and school spirit would not be held back. "But, Harry, everybody knows that Hogwarts is number one, then Beauxbatons, and then Durmstrang. Right?"

  Harry used this. "Beauxbatons is better than Durmstrang?"

  "Yes!" came a disgruntled group reply, as if any First Year student should know this.

  "And you're all absolutely sure?"

  "Yes!" The reply was much stronger.

  "Well, then... let me make sure I have this right... I should take the word of any one of you on this subject... because any one of you will tell me that... something you have never seen... is... slightly less good than something else... you have never seen."

** From one of sage's stories: "She was in the middle of drowning, of maybe dying, and she shoved him down to push herself up. It was a desperation beyond thought, for breath, for life, and using the only thing she could to obtain it. There was a basic, selfish core in the soul and instinct of every person, and it screamed for self when the mind shut down and emotions were lost."

It's not even overtly about a Harry potter character. I just like the quote. I was kinda like "whoah" when I read it the first time.

** "For instance, last year a young Aether told me that I would fall from the astronomy tower, but that the fall would not kill me. I found it rather encouraging, as it seems I am tougher than I look."

Albus Dumbledore -- Firebird's Son

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/19/Firebird-s-Son]]

As we know in canon, no, it was not the fall that killed him. Lol, I loved the wit in that line.

** Love this one from Jbern's "To Fight The Coming Darkness."

Just after we thought we lost Harry he busts out this

"Blowing a person out of a window does not ‘accidentally' happen, Mr. Abbott. Give him his wand back, Remus. He had his shot at me, now it's my turn. Get on your feet, Abbott and face me like a man."

Jbern really just is one of the best

** I went through my quotes list and found a couple of my favorites.

From [[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=87015&warning=5][This is the Last Song]]: Sirius runs through the house screaming about his "f***ing demented cousin Batty Bella McBatshit." I have a real love for that quote.

From [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5988542/1/A-Change-Of-Plans][A Change of Plans]]: "'Potter. Potter. Mini Potter,' he nodded to the other occupants of the room. Harry raised a hand in greeting, Ginny nodded back and James cooed."

From [[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=18143][Blood of the Heart]]: "Ginny continued to be impressed by how two such accomplished pranksters could also be such well respected, shrewd businessmen. It was almost as if that was the twins‘ biggest prank of all." This amuses me.

From [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?chapterid=245414][Battling Boundaries]]: "I have not been around a week, and already we are conspiring against your parents, making grandiose plans about refurbishing an ancient house, and have been involved in the start of an undercover operation! It's nice to know that some things never change!"

I thought I had some other quotes but I can't find them! :)
