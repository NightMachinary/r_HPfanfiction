Has anyone ever seen a story where The Powers That Be ends up giving Ron all the money in the world in exchange for being The Last Weasley, possibly after the GoF jealousy fit?

It should be obvious to most that Ron is sick of his financial situation and would like nothing more than to be rich, and by contrast that Harry would gladly swap the entirety of his vault for even one member of his family back.. But i've never seen anyone actually do anything with the concept..


** When Ron looked into the mirror of Erised, notably missing from his greatest desires was money.

Ron is embarrassed about being poor. It's about how some characters treat him as lower class, not about a lack of funds.

Ron wouldn't give up his family for money.

My story: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13105802/1/Singing-Crying-Laughing-and-Fighting]] starts with the premise of Ron doing something about his monetary situation. Infact the first sentence of the story is practically the same as the first one of this comment.

** Ron probably could have made some cash in chess tournaments if he'd been taught how to behave with muggles. Someone should have thought of that.

Frankly, Harry didn't need more people dying.

**** Sorry about that.

I was discussing it a bit. I think the impact just needs one death, and that's Arthur's.

Do you want me to find such stories? Preferably with a Ron that learns.

*** Probably not.. But he seems, to me at least, to be jealous of the things Harry has, and gets during the course of the books without /really/ realizing what he has lost..

**** Ron was jealous of Harry 2 times in canon :

- In 4th year when Harry is Champion, and he is less angry about Harry being chosen that thinking that Harry found a way to enter without sharing it with him. A good part of why they took one month to make up is also because Harry preferred call him an idiot than sharing with him Maugrey theory. He also had a chance to make up later in Common Room after Sirius Floo Call (and Ron was one of the 2 people in the castle to who he could tell the truth ), but he preferred to snap at him and throw a badge to his face.
- In 2nd year when he was insecure and afraid about Harry and Ginny. Not his best moment but there was any Horcruxe using this weakness, and after having to read about Harry ' s "monster in the chest " , I can understand/ forgive it.

​

Compared to this, he never showed any jealousie when :

- Harry enterred the Quidditch team as a 1st year
- Harry got a Nimbus 2000
- Harry got a firebolt
- Harry got a girlfriend

​

Ron is insecure because he is the 6th son and feel like he is always overlooked or the last in thought. So the mirror show him in a 1st position. To the contrary, Harry is known by everyone in the country, but he has familly so the mirror showed him his. Since you can only desire what you don't have.

Also Ron was never jealous of Harry money. He feels about being poor (unlike Harry who could loose several galleons without noticing it), but that doesn't mean he wants Harry money. Having enough money to be considered middle class (and escape the stigma of being "poor " ) would be more than enough for Ron.

***** Even when he was an immature eleven year old,Ron was perfectly content with eating a shit sandwich on the train while Harry got a pile of sweets and only took some at his friends urging

**** He's not jealous of things, he's annoyed to always be the second thought. He was never the centre of attention in his life up to Hogwarts (except for maybe his first year before Ginny's birth but he doesn't remember that) and had hoped to stand out. Instead, people treat him as Harry's sidekick.

****** It's not like Harry acted any better. He just got butthurt the moment Ron wasn't 100% supportive, refused to explain anything, called him names and even threw badges at him with nasty comments.

In fact, it kind of irks me that while Harry decided he didn't need to hear Ron's apology he never even once seemed to consider that maybe he had a few things to apologize for as well.
