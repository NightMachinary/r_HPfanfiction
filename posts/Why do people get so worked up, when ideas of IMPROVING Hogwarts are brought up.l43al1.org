Even in this sub, which is known to love exploring AU concepts and such, a lot of people seem to easily get worked up, when people share suggestions to /improve/ Hogwarts and/or the magical world.

I'm not talking about, e.g. give everybody a gun, because that would indeed be ridiculous, and it wouldn't even be effective. Instead, I'm talking about suggestions like the following:

- Scrap/Revamp certain subjects, like DADA or Divination
- Add subjects like the Arts
- Bring in more staff
- /Try/ to find a way to incorporate any forms of technology
- Remove the House system, or revamp it

And yet, quite a number of people get worked up (even offended) by such suggestions. They will get angry and hate them, without really considering them. Why? Not only could they improve Hogwarts and/or the magical world, but they could also flesh out the universe.


** Well, you've obviously got a fair bit or responses from the people that do get worked up over this idea.

For myself, I think Hogwarts is an incredibly flawed institution, and a lot of changes could be made to fix that. The problem is that fixing everything in the school doesn't make for a good story in general. The ways to fix Hogwarts are endless, but incorporating those into a fic is kind of boring.

For example, Snape. Snape is an awful teacher and should be fired. But as a plot device Snape is a constant source of conflict and storytelling. Compare Potions with Charms or Herbology. From all indications Charms and Herbology are well taught classes by proficient and professional professors. And we only ever see them when they are directly plot relevant for things like the levitation charm or mandrakes. In contrast, we see Snape and potions all the time, because those have conflict and drive the plot more. If potions was fixed, it would fade into the background more.

​

That's not a guarantee of course, especially if the plot of the fic intended to make greater use of potions. You could have a competent professor that Harry spends a lot of time with learning plot relevant potions and skills. That's fine and great and everything.

​

The biggest issue comes if you try to do this to everything. You fix Divination, you hire Grubbly-Plank, you fire Binns, you hire people whose only job is to be Heads of House so they can devote full attention to the children, you replace Snape, you add more subjects, etc etc etc. If you fix all of those things, 90% of them are going to fade into the background, at which point there's not a ton of need to change them in the first place.

There's really only three feasible ways to fix Hogwarts as an institution while maintaining the whimsy, fun, and plot drive.

​

1. Full AU. Make the changes before the story starts. Have Dumbledore revamp everything in preparation for Harry's arrival in order to give him the best possible education so he can face Voldemort. The changes are doled out to the reader as they become relevant. What is in the background can stay in the background. Conflict drive must come from somewhere other than the stations of canon, as those can't exist in a competently run school.
2. The Umbridge approach. Changes made over the course of the year. Trelawny for Firenze, Hagrid for Grubbly-Plank, etc. You have to avoid "The List." You can't have some character go an list off all of the bad things at Hogwarts and then have those get fixed. It's boring to read and kind of throws off the flow of the future of the story.
3. Post-canon changes. Have McGonagall enact the changes offscreen after canon. You can find out about them when Harry visits Hogwarts for some reason. At that point you're basically wrapping around to number 1. You get the fulfillment of knowing that Hogwarts is improved while being able to focus on the actual plot, which can no longer come from within Hogwarts.

*** There is a possible fourth way to push changes on Hogwarts, which would be without changing it specifically.

The route you'd be taking is a fairly recent graduate (probably an OC or a side character unless you run Harry post Hogwarts) feeling let down by the school starts trying to build their own school from the ground up to handle all the changes you'd want to see and as a knock on effect places like Hogwarts and the other European schools start having to change due to competition.

Of course running this route is one that's a long haul fic, even cutting out big sections of the grind, you'd have to have the characters plan, get funds, get lands, get materials, hire people, get students and a metric tonne of other bits and pieces. Unless you wanted to skip to the mid-point on the build for the 'new school' and focus on writing Hogwarts' view on what's going on, how they're dealing with students going elsewhere, whether they're considered among the upper ranks of schools, etc.

#+end_quote

Are you fleshing out the universe, though? Or are you /taking away/ from it?

If Hogwarts had all those things - hire more competent teachers including ones for stuff like English, get rid of that DADA curse, revamp the House system so there's no actual rivalries going on, get up-to-date on what the Muggles are doing so Muggleborn students don't get a horrendous case of culture shock, etc - then yes, as a school it'd probably be better.

It'd also lose something in the process. Hogwarts, as a storytelling device, comes from /whimsy/ - which is entirely lost if you try to "improve" it in realistic ways. No-one wants to read the minutiae of Harry learning middle-school level English, or solving all his problems by telling the competent teacher about them. Those things generally don't serve the telling of a good /story/.

It'd still be /possible/ to make a story happen, but for example if the Potions teacher isn't a jerk and Neville doesn't go through cauldrons as if they were Cauldron Cakes, you've just made Potions class a very dry read unless you fill it up with something else that works for the purpose. Most fanfic authors, regrettably, aren't very good at that - and thus, just start skipping over the class altogether.

Lastly, usually, "Hogwarts gets overhauled" is a trope that really doesn't serve any other purpose than to bash the existing school staff, and possibly filibuster for a bit about how much more efficient the Muggle education system is. Whenever I read a main character complaining about it, I go "oh, it's going to be one of /those/ fics..." and usually go read something else.

**** I think the failure of many of those fics is that they make the competent adults a fix-all device, which makes it boring. To use an example from my own fic, just because Harry gets adopted by the Tonks family does not mean that he'd not end up in the Tournament. I mean, based on Harry's track record, they might have considered the possibility of him being chosen, but what are they supposed to do, take the Goblet to court? Even if they sue the Ministry, that won't help Harry beyond adding a bit of gold to his vault, which is rather pointless.

Having a few good teachers won't do anything because they aren't everywhere all the time. Nor would it suit the personality of Moody to hand out detentions over every spat.

***** I doubt suing the ministry would work, they might be involved in organisation, but they don't control the possibly sentient magical cup, they also write the laws and therefore probably made sure they're not responsible for it.

Given the tournament's record I imagine there's a fair bit of "if bad things happen we're no liable" type legislation involved in the whole affair.

** Eh, honestly it is mainly a matter of skill at storytelling, the Hogwarts from stories like linkffn(Lords of Magic by Taure) -and actually pretty much all his stories, even without them being the same (which is quite impressive)- is a much changed which while not encompassing all your “Improvements” is definitely a more academically oriented and well-developed institution while still managing to create an engaging and attractive plot at the personal level of the characters life, this however is proof of the talent of the author at writing rather of a credit to the idea of improving Hogwarts.

In the hands of less skilled authors the end result is generally that to have any meaningful conflict where the main character have to interfere with actual stakes at risk either the MC and villain has to be powered up to a ridiculous degree until the advantages of an improved Hogwarts are rendered completely null inside the plot, the changes are much less effective in practice than they are on paper or there must occur such great amounts of plot-devices, suspension of disbelief (yes, greater than the expect on any fantasy story no matter how divorced from reality), hand-waving and Deus Ex Machinas that there is effectively no more stakes nor is there any significant plot under it all.

Then there is the issue of how much screen-time such changes would take, even in the plainest of the LordWTF!Harry kind of stories it is generally acknowledged (though not always applied) that a teen can't simply go around dictating terms for the entire government or even just the school, what it entails is unholy amounts of pages written about fictional traditions that end up in having everyone talking like they were around when Hogwarts was founded, completely useless descriptions of clothing that will never again be brought back and entire realms of writing that if printed could be used to build an actually viable bridge crossing the Atlantic.

Admittedly, this isn't that bad if taken with /some/ moderation and if the story itself has the rebuilding and reform of the world as a focus instead of trying to cram it all in a frankly impossible schedule while the MC has other, more satisfying and important things to deal with. The best examples of such things done right that I can think from the top of my head are linkffn(Novocaine) where the rebuilding and reforms are the entire focus of the story with very little thought being spared to other matters (at least on-screen) which makes for a very enjoyable read in a world-building, whimsical way and linkffn(Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament) where Harry upon being confronted with the schedule issues of trying to become a powerful wizard while maintaining political and financial power finds people that he can trust to handle the other aspects of his power-base so he can focus on building his personal magical power and skill.

  Scrap/Revamp certain subjects, like DADA or Divination
#+end_quote

Honestly you can probably get away without removing or revamping a subject, just give us a different view on what's taught. You mentioned DADA, the big issue with that is there's no coherent structure we see due to the always introduced new teacher with a new set of books, but having a new teacher refering to notes from past teachers or having them have a curriculum from the WEA would show there's actually something there that's /trying/ to ensure a proper education.

Divination and History are other courses that probably don't need a revamp or trashed so much as a different view. Just having another ghost brought up and giving a talk would break the monotony of 'always goblin wars' that canon seems to engender in many fanfics. Likewise Divination actually could be covering a lot from energy sensing to empathic visions from objects or far sight, just because all that's portrayed is astrology and 'card sharping' style future seeing doesn't mean that's all the subject is.

#+begin_quote
  Add subjects like the Arts
#+end_quote

Possibly a good plan, but while forcing non-magical subjects in would give the students likely to return to the main part of society something to run with, it doesn't really add much in itself. Adding bits that can lead in to magical things would be more useful, things like essay writing, basic/starter arithmancy, art leading to enchanted objects like the paintings or pensieve, ritual songs/dances, extra languages as a gate to alternate spells or rune sets, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Bring in more staff
#+end_quote

Okay, this one I'll agree with. Honestly they could do with having at least two per subject just so there's a spare on hand to take over should something happen, however a big thing here is there's the money spent without the obvious return, at least on its own. Having staff requested to have two subjects and having extra lessons could lead to more staff as a by product, plus there's how the ghosts and elves count in staffing terms to handle.

#+begin_quote
  /Try/ to find a way to incorporate any forms of technology
#+end_quote

While I've done this, it's not necessarily required to 'improve' Hogwarts, plus there's limits on what types of technology would be viable. There's two major issues for anything running electricity, first is how vulnerable it is to the magical build up around the school, the second is that you'd probably need to shut the school down for at least several weeks to months to run cables or you'd need to supply a generator local to what's using power and a stock of fuel for it.

Other types of technology... it depends. Yes there's the big issue of quills vs pens/pencils among things, but magicals can pull some tricks for those willing to pay, like quills with their own ink reservoirs that don't run dry or can change colour at the user's whim, plus even though pens are less messy, they're not completely free of issues. You can still have ink splodges on work from a normal pen, even a relatively good one.

#+begin_quote
  Remove the House system, or revamp it
#+end_quote

House systems of some description were still in use even in the '40s and '50s Britain. Heck even as late as when I was in secondary school in the 90s you still have inter-class competition to some degree, maybe not as volitile as it seems at Hogwarts, but still it's there, and this was at a modern (at the time) secondary school that wasn't running purely off the government payrole.

Having the system downplayed some might be more viable, though part of why it's more of a thing in Harry's time is because there's a lot of traditional assignments for certain families along with a lot of bad feelings due to certain events like Voldemort and a number of his sycophants giving a particular house a bad name.

Heck part of what we see, it wouldn't surprise me if there were out of school issues encouraging things, certainly Malfoy and his goons cause problems for the Weasleys, even if we don't see the full extent of said problems, the fact that there's the classism still about and Lucius and Arthur probably would have had a full on brawl had Hagrid not intervened in CoS shows that.

** Personally, I'm resistant to the idea of ‘improving' Hogwarts, primarily because of of how it is ‘improved' rather than why. Each time I've seen ‘improvements' being made it feels less and less relatable to the school experience I had growing up, and I find as I age I like to go and reminisce.Each thing you ‘improve' feels less like the stories I grew up with, which is important personally, because I got into fanfiction to see how that could be expanded upon. Over time my tastes changed, but I still like some canonical elements there, be they even just aesthetic. Now, I find the discussions on the flaws of the Wizarding World etc to be fun and interesting but that does not mean I want to see it ‘fixed' because the stories would lose their value as stories. That's just some personal opinions on the matter.

I believe sometimes, that it gets forgotten that there is a certain nuance for handling things and ‘fix-its' tend to trying ‘improving' things by hitting it with a sledgehammer rather than a scalpel.

Addressing the example points you listed, most of which are issues of suspension of disbelief.

1) This one sort of has a canonical basis. Dumbledore admits that he considered removing Divination from the Curriculum, if not for Trelawney's Prophecy. The DADA position was literally cursed by Voldemort, which evidently leads to subpar performance. I would argue that that was the point of the curse. Furthermore, if the curse could have been resolved by ‘revamping' the subject then it likely would have already been done, which leaves itall a bit nonsensical.

2) Half the issue there is finding Teachers who are qualified and willing to teach those subjects. Classical Portraiture (Oil on Canvas, old paintings of people that sort of thing) is a rather specialist subject that would likely require many years of extra training. Magical Portraiture is likely similar.

3) As in point 2, its not easy to source qualified staff members especially if we presume that the current teachers are world class experts.

4) This one is the one that I would say gets the most push back especially from me. The canonical world works with its pseudo-anachronistic setting. It feels timeless. Magic provides the sense of timelessness. The incorporation of technology removes that, though it depends on the type of technology. Stuff like ‘The internet but it's magic' I find to be rather uncreative, boring and lacking in any form of whimsy. There is also the matter of direct correlation between the two worlds. There shouldn't be as its not a one for one parallel. If however, it's a technology that a Wizard would feasibly come up with then that's fine. I.e. a wizard would, to my mind, not make a mobile phone but perhaps a ‘Floo Candle' that fills the same role. The key point is maintaining whimsy, why would a witch need a ballpoint pen, when she has a self inking quill? Not every ‘problem' requires a solution, and not every problem is a problem to begin with.

5) I have, in the past, written at length as to why the House System need not be abolished, neither is the system itself problem in isolation. Attempts that I've seen at ‘revamping' it fall woefully short. On a more meta point though, huge swathes of the fandom took to identifying or sorting themselves into the four houses, they are one of the cornerstones of the series, so changing that may feel like changing things too much, like the point at which Harry Potter is no longer Harry Potter.

The question of what constitutes improvement is quite philosophical. One man's improvement is another man's detriment.

It also comes off as very condescending, by calling the school, and by extension the entire society stupid, the writer shows how they're smarter than the wizarding world/JKR. Congratulations, you're smart enough to realize that the education system is trash, but not smart enough to understand why JKR wrote it as is.

There's nothing wrong with the idea of doing this, but I've yet to see an example of this done well. I wanted to compare this to how schooling is described in Alexandra Quick, but I realized that the author doesn't really describe it all that much. I think fanfic audience is a bit older than JKR's target audience, so they just don't care about the actual school, so it's not explored much beyond "there are classes, homework and tests are still a thing".

3: The staff-to-student ratio at Hogwarts is absurdly low, which is probably part of the reason for their chronic discipline problems. Some of those staff are wearing too many "hats" and spreading themselves too thin. Also, if one wants to add more classes, they have to be taught by /someone/.

4: Quills are nice for flavor and all, but they're hideously impractical and haven't been used except for fancy calligraphy in centuries for a /reason/. Hard pass on fluorescent lighting, though.

5: The house system, as shown in the books, promotes division and stereotyping, which leads to bullying and other discipline issues. Real life shows plenty of examples (many quite recent) of how dangerous it is to allow groups to fall into an "Us vs. Them" mentality. When the rivalry between Gryffindor and Slytherin went from friendly to hostile, the staff should have stomped on it /hard/ and seriously reconsidered if the system could work better. Abolishing the Houses entirely would be the nuclear option - getting rid of the House Cup might be a better idea (collective punishment is shit).

The second is infinitely more appealing. It keeps the world fantastical; it adds quirkiness and surprising, strange, curious aspects to the story. And most importantly, I'd argue it's also in the spirit of HP, so it's fundamentally /kind/ to the source, whereas the first is neither.

Obviously quite a few fics handle this poorly, ham-fistedly having massive changes rammed through after a passionate speech in the Great Hall or via Harry somehow inheriting Hogwarts. Then again, is there anything /not/ handled poorly by a bunch of fics?

A really good "reforming Hogwarts" fic could focus on the social and political struggles against traditionalists and other "I went to Hogwarts and I turned out fine" types, as well as on the staff having to honestly confront ways in which they've failed their students. It's pretty obvious in canon that pretty much all of them save Snape and Filch do care about the children to at least some degree, and it would be a hard thing for them to realize that they've been inadvertently endangering or harming them in subtle ways for years/decades.

For further drama/conflict, no way are all of the changes actually going to be positive. Whether it's something the blood-bigots slipped in, well-meant but poorly conceived, well-planned but poorly-implemented, or just the Law of Unintended Consequences, there are plenty of ways for things to go wrong, followed by struggles to make them right.

I assume you're talking about Luna. There is no indication that Flitwick wouldn't take action if the bullying was "severe," as Luna says herself that it's all "in good fun." She believes they aren't actively malicious--and given she's fought Death Eaters, she clearly knows the difference.

They call her "Loony Lovegood," which is not something Flitwick can stop as he isn't constantly following Luna around and they hide her possessions--but Luna is never being described as /missing/ clothing so the bullies, who are almost certainly her dormitory mates, have some restraint.

But if they wanted to actually /hurt/ Luna, there would have been very little she could have done to stop it.

** Depends entirely how it's done.

Often it strays straight into Mugglewank when the idea of technology is brought in (like people think "just have a phone that works around magic" instead of coming up with a muggle-inspired magical solution).

Also, people treat Hogwarts curriculum as really narrow and get really hung up on "they don't study maths" - if you want to world-build, look at how maths could be incorporated into existing classes (like astronomy, transfiguration, potions).

If you want Hogwarts students to study the arts, incorporate some into transfiguration (transfigure this item into a statuette, closest to Michelangelo's /David/ gets extra points) or charms (how might Botticelli's /Venus/ be recreated using everyday charms like Wingardium leviosa?).

Or "how historically accurate is Da Vinci's portrayal of wizards in the /Adoration of the Magi/?" Actually, scratch that, History of Magic is one subject that I 100% agree needs an overhaul.

The other way to broaden the education of kids at Hogwarts is to assume that there are more extracurricular clubs that Harry simply never makes use of because he's busy with Quidditch and heroics.

I think the thing that puts me off all the "how I'd improve Hogwarts" stuff is the assumption that Hogwarts is shit in the first place. Starting from a point of hating on the focal point of where most readers develop their love of the magical world is generally not going to go down well.

** Well... Voldemort tried to remove the House system in canon and look where it got him. Truly a visionary before his time who ended up a martyr in the name of progress.

Now, in all seriousness, I feel that while people are keen to explore what if scenarios, the stories are more or less set in the same universe as the one established by JK. A universe where wizards are live in a conservative society with a lot of resistance from the majority (save from a few such as Arthur Weasley or Hermione) to the new. So including technology is off the table.

Dumbledore tries to scrap off Divination but I think that's unfair of him since even in real life, when you think of magic you think mostly of seers such as the ancient Greek oracles, the Gypsy fortunetellers or some magician who will predict what card you'll pick from the deck. And DADA was definitely needed since the story happens mostly during a war against dark magic.

With regards to additional subjects, I believe JK mentioned that there were (either extracurricular or optional) classes of Arts, Mythology, Muggle Arts and so on. And additional staff for a class of 40 people is not really necessary because other than the flying and apparition lessons (and not even sure about those) happen with 20 students (two houses at most).

** I'd assume you're gonna use the same one-liners every indy!harry uses, like "dragging the wizarding world into the twentieth century kicking and screaming if need be".

I don't like it for a simple reason. Not only is it not Hogwarts anymore if you're just making the "perfect school", but it's also sad to think you'd know more than a whole communauty of wizards what wizards would need in their own schools. And, let's be honest; if you were magical, would you really want to learn such boring things as biology? Physics? Please, they regularly eat the lax of physics for breakfast, why would they need to learn them?

"Try to find some way to incorporate technology" is just a cheap way of saying "mmmh yes everyone is bad in the wizarding world, either bad as in bad guys or bad as in idiots". The muggles' finest technology doesn't work inside a magical place, that's all there is to it.

Sure, Mr. Weasley is able to work on a car. But you know what? Play with it! This shit gets a will, turns into some kind of magical creature, i don't care, but don't make it the ultimate proof that all wizards always have been dumb fuckers or mean fuckers hating on muggles since times immemorial.

​

THAT is why we "hate" the idea of improving Hogwarts. Why would it make it better? Why would your ideas make it so much better than it is now? You know nothing of wizards!

And here's the kicker: even if you did know better, would you come to an indigenous community just to tell them "you suck, your ideas sucks, your whole society sucks, here's how to improve it"? And it's the same for wizarding society!

#+begin_quote
  Because it doesn't have to be one or the other. You can have Hogwarts not be an offence towards educational standards and logic, while still keeping it magical and fun.
#+end_quote

Not if the reason it's fun is the lack of logic and the completely different standard as to what constitutes "good education" in the first place.

Hogwarts isn't an IRL school that needs to conform to IRL standards. It's a place to dream, the place you always wished as a child your school would be, and this backwards-fitting projection is the source of the powerful fascination of the series that keeps me and others trapped.

Leave your logic at the door. Leave your /adult brain/ at the door. HP is not the place for it. In fact, many of the best fantasy worlds aren't the place for it. Bringing it with you can only lead to dissatisfaction: You see "flaws", or, if you try to "fix" them, others see their world crumbling to dust.

This is what people have been trying to say, in dozens of different variations.

.

The approach to take, if you want to expand or explain the world, is not to "fix" what you see is "wrong", but rather, accept what you see without judging, and then come up with reasons for why it is so. As an example, if you consider it odd that wizards use parchment and quills, then what to do is not to have your self-insert try to "improve" the magical world, but rather, as an author, come up with reasons /why/ wizards prefer quills and parchment (say, there is an inherent (literal) magicalness in the process of /writing/, and putting letters in ink on parchment can capture that, while ball pens and paper can't), and then write a scene explaining that.

Basically, your job as a FF author should be to be the very first defender of the Canonical world, not its wrecking ball. Be kind to the source, not antagonistic. Build up, don't tear down.

These are the two approaches, and people instinctively notice which mindset you chose when reading. And I'd posit that most enjoy appreciation and kindness of the world you are writing about much more than dissatisfaction and ridicule. Many of the best stories, even in moments where they deal with the most serious of topics (e.g., discrimination) are nothing but declarations of love to the world that captured their imagination.

And it's this mindset that makes people say the "fix-its" are obnoxious, and (if they are so disposed) get "worked up" over "improvements", as it boils down to taking the most wonderful natural meadow, and declaring it would be very much improved by landscaping and a road or two.

#+begin_quote

There is no "fun" in Snape screaming at his students and insulting them to their faces. That is not "a different standard", that is a person abusing the power that they have over others.

My dream school didn't have Dementors roaming the grounds, or teachers possessed by magical terrorists. My dream school didn't have a Basilisk wandering the halls for nearly an entire year because the smartest people in the country couldn't identify the thing a literal /twelve year old/ did.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Agreed. There can be logical, if magical, reasons for such things. Quills might take enchantments better, so they're the go to for Quick Quotes Quills or the like.

But at the same time, why not just use a pencil for your everyday schoolwork? Sure, the quill might be better for /magic/, but if you're just writing a normal, non-magical letter, then I'd think a perfectly normal pencil would work just as well.

#+begin_quote
  your job as a FF author should be to be the very first defender of the Canonical world,
#+end_quote

Disagree. An FF Author should be the very first defender of /fun/ and /wonder/, not of "Canonical World". The best authors, in my opinion, are the ones that don't shackle themselves to canon, and dare to dream of /more/. They're the ones that will reach out to the new authors, the unsure writers that have just posted their first stories, and say: "Don't worry about it, just write what you want".

That is the job of a FF Author: not to defend canon, but to write stories that inspire, that entertain, that amaze. And to help nurture those things in others, so the cycle can continue.

#+begin_quote
  And I'd posit that most enjoy appreciation and kindness of the world you are writing about much more than dissatisfaction and ridicule.
#+end_quote

Combining this with the next point.

#+begin_quote
  declarations of love to the world that captured their imagination.
#+end_quote

But "fix-its", to use your term, can also be declarations of love. To that end I point to two posts right here on [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]]. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bkcp8q/harry_potter_and_the_class_curriculum/][Harry Potter and the Class Curriculum]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c46bl2/hogwarts_curriculum_worldbuilding_resource/][Hogwarts Curriculum World-Building Resource]]. To state that all the work that clearly went into both of these posts were not "declarations of love" would be baffling to me. Why else would someone spend so long working on this, and share it amongst others, if not because they loved /something/ about the world of Harry Potter?

#+begin_quote
  as it boils down to taking the most wonderful natural meadow, and declaring it would be very much improved by landscaping and a road or two.
#+end_quote

Maybe this is me being a bit pretentious, but as someone planning at least one HP story that you would call a "Fix-It", this is far from the mindset that I'm employing. I see it as trying to improve the meadow by adding another patch of flowers, or maybe a simple bench on the hill so that you can look down on it. But at the same time removing the weeds, the rotten old tree that's more of a hazard than anything else, pruning back the thorny bushes, etc.

** Judging by the comments, the answer to the question in the title is "Because a lot of people want to read about Hogwarts as it's portrayed in canon, even though it's a deathtrap and would completely fail as an educational institution if not propped up by some of the staff being brilliant at teaching their subjects."

Coming from a family of teachers, if I think at all about how Hogwarts is actually run it just makes me cringe at the negligence and incompetence on display. It's not as unrealistic as I'd like, sadly, but the casual disregard for student safety is really galling.

**** 1. Essential topics such as basic math, civics, geography, and English aren't taught at all. These may not be purely magical, but they're kinda important if you want to do things like balance a budget, vote, travel, or write an essay that doesn't hurt the Professor's brain to read. Phys Ed would probably be good for the students' health, even if they do get plenty of steps in on those staircases.

2. Other topics aren't taught that, while not necessary to everyone, are at least potentially valuable on an individual level and definitely valuable on a societal level - topics like Art, Music, Literature, Writing, foreign languages, etc.

3. Several core subjects are taught poorly or inconsistently - History, Potions, and DADA we know for certain, and among the electives Divination and possibly Muggle Studies can be added to the list. Care of Magical Creatures is a bit iffy as well - Hagrid knows his creatures, but he frequently fails to grasp the concept that they can be dangerous to people without giant blood.

4. Consistent issues with discipline and bullying hardly promote a healthy and effective learning environment.

The places where Hogwarts seems to do particularly well are Transfiguration, Charms, and Herbology, with the rest of the classes falling into the category of "competently-taught but not exceptional." Potions makes this list as well under Slughorn, who both knew his subject and could teach it. Snape, well... don't get me started.

It doesn't even have to be /that/ big a thing. Just dedicate a few hours every other day so that the students can do a lap of the castle or something.

As to the classes: those are /comedically/ lacking.

I read a story recently where Harry literally skipped every single history class between years 1 and 3, and none of his teachers realised until they were /told/ by another student.

Potions is a /joke/. How many students have given up on potions because of Snape? How many dreams weren't realised because their teacher was more interested in tearing them down rather than building them up?

DADA is... weird. There seems to be little consistency or logic between the years, something not helped by the parade of teachers. Lupin was apparently teaching about creatures, "Moody" taught the Unforgivables, Lockhart rambled about /himself/, and Umbridge didn't teach anything practical at all.

Divination could easily be so much more if a writer was interested in it. Divination doesn't /have/ to exclusively be "seeing the future". How about crystal balls that see other places? How about Psychometry (the ability to see the past of something)? How about sensory sharing?
