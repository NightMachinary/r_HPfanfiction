So I was wondering if there was a genre that talked about the darker side of magic? Death eater life, people who invent dark magic, etc. The more detailed the better! I don't really care if there are OC characters so long as it's not terribly Mary Sue-y. Thanks!

This is about Harry discovering "dark magic". It's mostly culture, and how it's not about murdering and such. It may not be what you are looking for, but it's really very interesting.

*** I really liked that one. Pity is unfinished. Probably the authors didn't have a clue how to tie up all those loose ends. Anyone willing to share the burden and start plotting something awesome out of that fic? PM me
