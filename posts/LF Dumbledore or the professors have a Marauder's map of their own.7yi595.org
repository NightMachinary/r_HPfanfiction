Spent some time on the Harry Potter's What an Idiot page and this got brought up. To be honest, if several students can make a live map that isn't fooled by polyjuice etc, why wouldn't the teachers have one as well. So basically fics with this premise and many events that happened in canon are prevented.


** I think the thing is that no one /thought/ of it. Dumbledore, Flitwick and Snape working together could probably have kicked a decent Map together, but the original Marauder's Map was a /secret/, and you gotta admit a Marauder's Map is a pretty off-the-wall idea. As to recommendations, the closest ones I've got is Dumbledore and later Quirrellmort /getting/ the original Map from the Twins in /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/, and Hermione making her own, new and improved Map in /The Arithmancer/.
