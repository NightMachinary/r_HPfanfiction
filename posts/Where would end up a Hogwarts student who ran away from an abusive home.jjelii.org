Hi, just thought about that. What if Harry had ran away from the Dursleys half-way through his Hogwarts time definitively? Like, if the Dursleys had been physically violent (more than they already were) and Harry just was done and ran away one summer and refused to come back at all. What do you think would happen? Dumbledore wouldn't possibly send him back.


** He would. Harry ran away in the third book and still ended up at the Dursleys anyway later.

*** That's true, but I was imagining that they would go further. Like really beating him up. But, well, Dumbledore did nothing while they still starved him and psychologically abused him... I shouldn't be surprised.

** It depends on how manipulative you imagine Dumbledore as. In what I believe was the first book, Dumbledore said that Harry had to go back, because of the wards.

The thing is, the wizarding world considers family more important than anything else. MAYBE, if the Dursleys were more abusive (In which there wouldn't be much more needed, as they were emotionally and physically abusive) and others found out, there would be enough public outrage that they'd move Harry elsewhere. The question then is where he would move to. Hogwarts isn't allowed, as both Tom Riddle and Harry asked to stay, it can be believed that there are no magical orphanages, as they likely would have moved magical orphans there, so the only place Harry would be able to stay is with a relative. The Evans are believed to be dead by this point, and it can be assumed that Petunia had no immediate family. Harry is the last Potter in Brittain unless someone falls under a different name. Sirius is still on the run, so he is out. The closest living relatives I can find from a quick google search would be the Blacks. Harry would either be stuck with the Tonks or the Malfoys. the Malfoys, being high ranked, would be able to gain custody of Harry, because the ministry is very corrupt. After that would be up to your interpretation.

This is just my view of it though. If I missed anything please say so.

** Lots of fics have Dumbledore or someone else obliviate him and send him back.

There really should be some magical orphanage. Why would Wizarding Britain let magical children be abused by filthy muggle animals?

*** I'm so disgusted. I can't believe it never crossed anyone's mind that sending a child back to where they'll obviously get abused is not okay. What kind of message is it sending? "Bear with it until you're old enough to leave"? That's really... disgusting. There should be magical orphanages, adoption talks, maybe even staying at Hogwarts during the summer...

**** Totally agree with you.

Thing to remember: JKR is a British writer whose story is set in Britain = Dystopia.

I think she intentionally made the society as bad as could be while still reflecting regular British society, including bringing in all the tropes of dysfunction she could manage.

To cure the disgust, there are 2 good options. 1) revenge fics, where the baddies just get killed or tortured almost constantly. 2) crack fics, where writers rif on the setting for comedy.

I would like to think that, but it's not true. And I'm saying that because of the epilogue (Malfoy being free, "Albus Severus"). According to Rowling, the only thing wrong with Britain is Voldemort. According to her, Dumbledore is perfectly good and there's nothing whatsoever wrong with what he did.

This... seems a bit insane? Voldemort was himself a product of a messed up society, as you touched upon (abusive muggle orphanage) and as JKR wrote - he was refused good jobs due to not being pureblood I think?

And the Gaunts... so /much/ dysfunction there.

And the society has horrible sapient-rights legislation...and that can't be due to Voldemort since he was actually willing to enlist them for his combatants?

And a banking system that relies upon beings who hate you and your people to run and even administer it...that is just madness.

My brain is kind of cramping up with just how much is wrong with Wizarding Britain society.

That said, I think the epilogue was meant to show that things can be made better if people, even children, stand up to do what is right despite the difficulties.

But that's the catch; /they don't./ They're seemingly blindly doing the same things the earlier generations did.

Draco Malfoy committed /so/ many war crimes, was openly a bigot, /yet he still walked free/ along with his family just like last time. His last act before the epilogue was to try to capture Harry and hand him over to Voldemort, even though he was given the option to evacuate the school; this despite everyone knowing he's a Death Eater. He's never shown repentance, only cowardice.

Ron /openly/ admits to confunding a muggle to get his driving license /in front of his Head Auror friend./ Who does nothing. It's just a muggle, right? /Right?/

Harry names his second son after his most abusive mentor and his most abusive teacher, both of whom conspired to manipulate him into suicide. Shows what JKR thinks of that.

She's writing from her own "moral" perspective. It's just that I find it absolutely disgusting. I totally agree with you on the rest.

******** I guess the epilogue is interpreted variously depending on one's perspective. I only intended to say that that is what JKR /meant/ it to mean.

  "The ultimate problem was that the first few books imply that the overall story would be about a boy growing up to be a hero, and what we ultimately got was the story about a patsy who was manipulated into fulfilling someone else's overly complicated scheme to preserve the status quo of a society that didn't deserve salvation."

The only real divide between us is maybe what JKR thought the ending meant.
