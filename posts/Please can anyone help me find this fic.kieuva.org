:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi, I'm trying to find a fic I read ages ago. It was quite long and completed. Harry was a Lord level wizard, one of a few around the world. I remember he interacted with a Dark Lady from Scandinavia who used the Dark to harness storms and weather, and another Lady (possibly from Australia or China?) came to see Harry and explained some of the etiquette the Lords and Lady's used to interact with one another, for example her coming to visit him at Hogwarts was etiquette because she was supposed to greet him as soon as she entered Britain because he was the Lord level wizard of Britain.

Now here I might be mixing it up with another fic, but I seem to removed there being a Lord level wizard who had survived for hundreds of years by maintaining balance between light and dark and never declaring for either. The fic often mentioned exploring the â€˜paths' of the Dark magic. He was a Greengrass or Parkinson from memory, but very very old and definitely using a surname we are familiar with from Canon.

Any help would be awesome? Thank you!

** Sounds like the Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283][Saving Connor]] is the first but it spans all seven years. The lord stuff shows up in the later books.
