It recently struck me that, given how poor the professors at Hogwarts seem to be (Snape, Binns, the rotating incompetence of DADA), as well as him in danger every single year, a sane Harry would seek other options for his continuing education. So, I'm looking for stories with that, where he leaves the school because he doesn't like being in danger, and would prefer to be in an fulfilling academic environment.

** HP and the Irish Choice is a pretty good one in which Harry transfers out of Hogwarts pretty early on in his first term.

  After his second year, Harry begins to realize Hogwarts isn't everything it could be. Are there other options available? While the Hogwarts characters belong to JK Rowling, the story is obviously outside of canon.

  Despite how impossible it seemed, Harry was sure his dad had saved the three of them from the dementors. After Hermione's time turner took them both back three hours, he was desperate to discover if who he'd seen casting that patronus was truly his dad. Harry certainly wasn't disappointed when his mum turned up instead, and changed the entire course of his life. Harry/Hermione
