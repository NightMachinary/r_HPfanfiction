As the title said, does a student have to go to a class to take its OWL Exam? In canon, we know that several student got 12 OWLs (including Bill and Percy Weasley, and Crouch Jr).

This mean that these students passed an OWL in the 7 core classes, plus the 5 options. Yet, we see in PoA that Hermione already needed a Time Turner to take all these classes, and that it proved to be too much work for her, giving back the Time Turner at the end of the year. So, did all these people who passed 12 OWLs also got Time Turners (I think it's implied Hermione's case is an exceptional one) without giving it back, or did they just took 2 or 3 options and worked the rest in their free time?\\
While some subject really need the presence of a Teacher (Care of Magical Creature), Runes seem to just be the study of an Old Language (like Greek or Latin I guess) which can be worked alone, and I don't understand why Muggleborns would not take the free OWL that is Muggle Study.


** I'd imagine you could go to the Department of Magical Education and sit your tests there. How do the people who don't go to Hogwarts take their tests? There are other options of schooling.

Edit: Also, I suppose it's JKR being bad with numbers. But I stand with my above statement.

My guess would be that when JKR came up with those numbers she was thinking of an OWL each for the written and applied portion, but then ended up doing just the one.

**** Nope, when Harry and co got their OWL results it was a single grade for each subject

** Probably, or else I don't see how Percy and Bill managed. Since the above examples were wizard-born maybe they had a better chance of studying the subject ahead of time (in the case of Arithmancy and Ancient Runes) or had more exposure to magical creatures (in the case of COMC). Or maybe they took some extra OWLs in 6th and 7th year (there's no rule against that in canon, I think. It's probably not used very often though.)

** Canonically, the implied answer is yes. Not because of Bill or Percy's 12 OWLs, but because we know that there are parents who choose not to send their children to Hogwarts and homeschool them. Therefore, there must be a way for students to earn those qualifications outside of the Hogwarts curriculum.

In the case of Bill and Percy, it is almost certainly a case of JKR not really thinking those numbers through.

** Perhaps they do it for every student that has a full schedule although it seems extremely irresponsible and unlikely. Then again besides being a necessary plot device I don't get how Dumbles could have just given a time Turner to a student who wanted to take every class. No sorry random 13yr old you can't physically take every class now pick a couple and study the others on your own time, sure I could give you a device to manipulate time but I'm not going to do that just so you can take extra classes why should I make an exception just for you and not for everyone else?
