Hi! As the title says, I'm looking for fanfics with politically interested and active Harry that has lots of influence. I can't stand Slash. I'd like it's if your recommendation has a nice m/f pairing idc if it's HHr or any other but no slash pls. It should be novel length meaning 100k+ words. It'd be better if Harry works hard. Thank you!


** Do you mind one where he destroys the system or would you prefer ones where he dominates it but it remains intact?

  Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.
