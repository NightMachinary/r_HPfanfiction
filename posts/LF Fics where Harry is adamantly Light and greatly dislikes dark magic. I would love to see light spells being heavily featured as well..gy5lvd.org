** Obligatory if you read canon, you'd realize that light magic does not exist in canon. Lumos - the most powerful light magic every invented.

Pretty sure [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor]] and its sequels have a system that involves the existence of light magic. I recall it being centered around consent. Dubious quality though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5333171/1/The-Weapon-Revised]] has Harry avoid dark magic but there isn't really a light magic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8769990/1/Second-Chances]] has light magic in its magic system but it's also straight up bad.

An Old and New World - full version archived at ff2ebooks has light magic employed by Hermione and Dumbledore, but not Harry.

Honestly, I would just search for well-developed magic systems. They probably won't have a class of "light magic" because the best fics usually don't make changes from canon without good reasons.

** I want to say linkffn(to shape and change) but I haven't read it recently so I don't remember how well the details match up.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
