#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

**** I really disliked the beginning with the assassin and Harry somehow being proficient at wielding a gun despite never even touching one before in his life.

Also Harry's threats to the guy seemed OOC despite that the fic was apparently canonical up to HBP.

Harry changing his name and all the OCs in general seemed corny. I also don't really like the "Britain is a magical backwater" trope that this fic heavily leans on.

Eventually just gave up for these reasons.

** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) - There's a lot of alternative mind magics, exploration of potions and alchemy.

linkffn(Princess of the Blacks) - There's normal magic, but there are various rituals and White and Black magic, which are granted by Powers, which are kind of gods.

linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero) - Awesome applications of Divination, but unfortunately seems to have been abandoned.

linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist) - Demon summoning, basically.

linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) - super OC story that takes place in America, shows how Alex uses magic without proper incantations. Also deals with a few supernatural themes, especially in further books.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.
