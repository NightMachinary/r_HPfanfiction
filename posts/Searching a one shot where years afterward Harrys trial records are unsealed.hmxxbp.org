:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this story some time ago and thought I had it as a favorite but can't find it anymore. It was on ffnet. In the story a woman talks to Harry about the things she saw in the trial records, in this case it was memories, and asking questions about the things he did. The twist is, that Harry is a time traveler and he didn't kill Voldemort or the Death Eaters, but Dumbledore. Harry explains his reasoning and in the end it's revealed that he talked to Myrtle who is married to Tom Riddle, if I remember correctly. Anyone know what the fic is. Would love to recommend it to a friend.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
