All I really remember is Sirius had this expanded trunk somewhere in the forest, he shows it to Remus who ends up kissing him and Sirius completely freaks out. Some delicious angst follows and I /think/ its the same story where Sirius decides to "test" a relationship with Remus? Saying the least he can do for his friend is to try and love him like he does? Might have been a different story though.

I'm fairly positive it was on FFN.net too, but it /could/ have been live journal.


** Hi! I've been active in that section of fandom since '99, and I've got a lot of stuff saved and bookmarked. It doesn't sound immediately familiar, but I'll look around!

Do you happen to remember anything else about it--rating, length, when you might have read it? LJ is notoriously hard to search--lots of old journals from the height of fandom there have been deleted or banned--so any further details would be super helpful.

*** It definitely wasn't higher than a T rating, I don't think they ever did anything more than kiss.

It's a multi chapter story, but no more than say 20? Definitely not more than 50,000 words I don't think.

The more I think about it I'm fairly positive it's on FFN.net, I just can't see it in my mind as being on LJ or something else.

I was several years ago, maybe 2011-2012? Might have been 2013 or even as recent as 2014.

Man that wasn't helpful at all was it?

As for the story itself I think this is accurate.

Sirius has a secret trunk in the forbidden forest. When opened, it has a ladder down into a cozy little room. I don't believe he ever told James or anyone else about it, and I think the first time he showed it to Remus it was during Christmas holidays. I believe Sirius brought some sort of drink (could have been butterbeer or firewhiskey) and Remus thinks to himself as the room getting really hot and ends up kissing Sirius.

After wards Sirius freaks out and they spend the rest of Christmas holidays avoiding each other.

I don't remember if it's the same fic or if I'm merging two together in my head, but I /think/ Sirius ends up feeling bad about how he reacted, and even though he claims to not be gay, he decides to try it for Remus' sake.

That's all I can remember unfortunately. If worst comes to worst I guess I could always just search through FFN.net for the next two years straight, looking through every single Sirius/Remus fic ever posted. My only fear is that it's been removed for some reason and I would never know.

Thanks for keeping a look out though, it was a favourite of mine. I just wish I had saved it.

**** That's MASSIVELY helpful, actually! Those are all filterable categories on FFN--rating and length and date. Cuts out a LOT of fics--especially knowing it's not a one-shot, as that's the vast majority of the fics on there.

It may take me a while to find, even so--especially since I'll have to read them all to make sure I've got the right one! :D

***** I hope you have better luck than I. Thank you for helping.

I just really hope I haven't miss remembered anything about it, but I'm pretty sure everything I said was accurate.

Blast my crappy memory!
