** I like /Under a Watchful Eye/. There's tiny hints of maybe -- /maybe/ -- some pre-slash, and the update time isn't good, but the author is now into GoF. linkffn(10917272).

  A character reads the books story heavy on Sirius and Harry. THERE IS NO ACTUAL RECITATION OF THE BOOKS!

*** It takes a really long time to get anywhere - they go one canon chapter per chapter (if that makes sense?) and I end up just skipping most of it.

**** The reactions are pretty over the top as well. Harry is cuddling with Sirius in tense moments, Sirius runs out of the room crying and shit. I dunno, too much for me.

***** Agree on that part as well. What killed me was the spanking bits. But I skipped over those parts for the most part. Thinking back, one of the things I really liked was that I happened to be reading it at the same time as I was reading the books for the first time to my kid. Reading them aloud was strange, because it gave me time to really think about what was happening (and it also took forever), so I started reading one chapter of UAWE a night after reading the canon chapter in question to my kid.

**** Yeah, that's definitely a fair criticism. I mostly liked it because I thought the author highlights things that other fanfiction authors hadn't noticed. It's super-careful and meticulous and showed me some points and ways of interpreting things that I had never thought of.

***** I get that, but I gave up after the 8th chapter or something. Also, I'm afraid of how Harry's romantic overtures would be handled - I hate reading about embarrassing/awkward situations.

** There is linkffn(10390949) and linkffn(5881274). Mind you, they're both probably abandoned at this point, just so you know.

  What happens when a magical computing device gets transported from the future, and the marauders (plus Lily) discover interesting stories about them and people they know? And what happens when they attempt to write so-called Fanfiction themselves?

  It's the Marauder's 7th year and Lily still refuses to give James a chance, but will that change after Lily discovers a book that reveals what lies ahead for both her and James? JP/LE, SB/OC, RL/OC
