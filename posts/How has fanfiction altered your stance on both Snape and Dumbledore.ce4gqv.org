Given that both characters have extremely ambiguous means and motivations in canon, it is quite plausible for well-written fanfics to either turn them into pariahs or tragic heroes, depending on the author's whim.

So, how do you clamp down on this issue? Have any stories drastically altered your perception on the characters, or do you strictly adhere to what we see in canon? Given the ambiguity, I can't help but lean towards the influence of fanon in this matter and now see Dumbledore as a well-meaning manipulator and Snape as a grey character who was ultimately playing both sides.


** For awhile, I considered Dumbledore as some cruel god-type character that did everything selfishly. Then after rereading the books, I kind of realized the whole point in pointing out the flaws of Dumbledore was to show he was HUMAN. I think he was doing what he thought was good, and just made some bad decisions, which no leader has ever avoided.

** Honestly, my opinion of Dumbledore hasn't changed much. I don't mind the bashing of him or when someone completely sidelines him to irrelevancy. I get somewhat annoyed when they make him this super evil being because I feel like he becomes an Umbridge that takes slower to deal with. It also feels a lot like a crutch when someone uses him this way so that the protags can have some sort of adversary before Voldemort comes into play.

All that to say, I like Canon Dumbledore.

Snape, in my mind, can't be fully redeemed. He's an asshole, plain and simple. He insulted children and went out of his way to torment and bully them to the point where he became Neville's greatest fear.

Yes he was bullied, humiliated, and isolated but that doesn't excuse his behavior. He knew better and didn't /DO/ better. There are very few times I see someone make me like Snape, if at all.

*** My opinion of Snape will always be "A bad man who did the right thing ". I can understand why Harry wanted people to know which side he was truly with, or why he fought for Snape to have his own Headmaster portrait, but to give his name to one of his sons ? Being on the same side doesnt magically erase years of hate and abuse, (not to mention, calling his son Albus Severus is just asking for him to suffer ).

** The extremes of certain Greater Good fanfiction Dumbledore's have shown me just exactly how neglectful Dumbledore really was, as nobody in their right mind would leave an twelve month old outside on an autumn night, when it would be between 5 and 15 degrees Celsius.

** Let me also clarify this: I love stories which make them either heroes or absolutely detestable scumbags, if they are written well. My thoughts in the original post are how I think of them in canon terms.

*** I liked Alan Rickman's Snape. He's what I think he should have been in the books. Dumbledore is a bit of a prick for ignoring child abuse (he suspected, but did nothing). Snape is a dick for sabotaging children. But at least they did something.

Yeah, that's the way I view Snape. People rant and rave about Book!Snape abuse, but I think Rowling was really seeing Movie!Snape in her cartoonish villain teacher. A strict teacher on the mean side, but not as bad as the books seem to make him to be. Which is why Harry could forgive him and name his son Severus. I see it as Harry is an unreliable narrator and embellished in his own mind the cruelty of Snape as a child. Looking back at it as an adult, Harry was more rational and realized it wasn't as bad as he thought it was. AKA child!Harry saw book!Snape, but when Harry grew up into an adult he realized he had been looking at Movie!Snape the entire time. That's the only headcanon that makes sense. Other than that, blame Rowling for writing one thing and then falling in love with Alan Rickman in her own mind.

***** Exactly!

Now don't get me wrong, I'll vehemently argue with people who try to mix the two characterizations or whitewash book Snape.

Harry is also an unreliable narrator, but the books are written from the third person.

** It hasn't changed my opinion of Dumbledore much. Though I very much enjoy Dumbledore Bashing fics purely for the entertainment, he's one of my favorite characters in Canon.

As far as Severus Snape is concerned, I didn't think of him much even though JKR "redeemed" his character in Deathly Hallows. However, this changed when I started reading Fanfiction. I definitely have more respect for him now as Fanon writers have changed my views.

**** It's probably him admitting him liking Bashing fics, Because everyone knows that bashing fics are objectively bad and enjoying them makes you worse than umbridge.^{/s}

I do think that's the reason though.

** Sorta? Its not like it made me hate them when I used to love them or vice versa.

When I read HP growing up Dumbledore was pretty much infallible as I got older the whole ya he should have done more to help Harry could have done more was more of a sentiment for me. And seeing fics with him as a villain helped really show that. I still do really like him but i see him as more flawed. I definetly dont consider him anywhere near evil but I do think he would make a great villain and when I see him as a villain in fanfic I like him as a villain more than canon Voldemort was. Not so much his history or what he does but how he goes about things and his behavior. I dont think of him as a villain in canon though just a flawed man who did his best but made many mistakes.

Snape I was somewhat meh on by the end. I felt bad finding out he was bullied and I hated him for killing Dumbledore and then I was back to neutral ish for him maybe leaning towards liking him after his redemption. I read alot of sympathetic Snape fics. But I also read alot of Meta. And my view on canon Snape is he was kinda a dick. I dont consider his love for Lilly much of a redeeming feature when its not shown how much he grew as a character outside that obsession with her. Not having the clarification that he would have taken the high road even without his love for Lilly doesnt help. Neither does his abuse of his students and his pettiness with Lupin and Sirius. Even Draco showed signs of independent character growth and he wasnt even getting an active redemption arc.

The sympathetic Snape isnt how i necessarily see canon Snape. But Snape has certain personality quirks I like and like seeing that archetype as sympathetic. Fanon sympathetic Snape is kinda maybe Snape done differently or better in the way JK Rowling maybe wanted him to come across even if the execution wasnt botched. Or maybe its just a different character all together. But I do like that character and want to see stories with him sometimes. And sometimes i just want to see him be an asshole.

** I never thought much about Dumbledore when i read the books (the first time i was about 9). He seemed like a powerful Grandpa to me. But when i got older (I'm 18) my opinion of him changed for the worst mostly because of fanfiction. But i still think that he's neither good nor bad. He was a flawed man fighting for the Greater Good. But he certainly is quite annoying in most of the fanfics I've read (usually he's used as someone who tries to break up the main couple or something)

As for Snape, I've always had a weird fascination with him (even when i was 9). I sympathise with him because I really don't like children and the Golden Trio sure was annoying as hell. But he didn't have to be so cruel. So fanfiction hasn't changed anything for me except that now i sometimes like to fantasise about being his girlfriend (cause I'm gross like that, i know)

** I always feel DD and SS are more nuanced in fanfic than canon, but that's probably because they get so little screen time in the books compared to an entire fanfic that focuses heavily on them and their relationships with Harry Potter or Hermione Granger.
