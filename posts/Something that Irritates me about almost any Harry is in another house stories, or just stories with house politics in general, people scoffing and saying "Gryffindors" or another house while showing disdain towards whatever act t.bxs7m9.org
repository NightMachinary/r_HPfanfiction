So I'm reading a WBHL story right now and every other sentence is "blood Gryffindors that" and "don't be such a gryffindor." theirs an interaction where Neville says something was awesome and one of his slytherin friends just shakes her head and says "Gryffindors" and in my head i'm like...these are 12 year old kids, why is it so wrong for a kid to think "oh someone lighting a wall on fire is awesome" or "yea he did something heroic he's cool" but no instead we just get "hur dur stupid Gryffindors" or "Slimy snakes" and its kind of bothersome.

I get that this happened in the books too, it was stupid in the books also


** Cultures are weird like that; humanity is inordinately prone to boxing people in ready-made categories and then convincing themselves by confirmation-bias that yes, those categories and stereotypes are indeed accurate. That's how anything from “/Lawyers/, amirite?” to “/The Chinese/, amirite” to names I won't dare repeat gets started.

Ergo, you don't have to agree with it (in fact, it's best that you don't), but with such a system as the four Houses in place at the school everyone goes to, it's entirely realistic that inhabitants of the Wizarding World would find themselves thinking in those terms.

*** Add to the fact, families might be generationally in the same house

Making the sterotypes even more pronounced

Slytherin's get the worse deal, whats the point of being sneaky and cunning if every expects you will be sneaky and cunning because a hat told everyone you where sneaky and cunning

*** Yeah, that's because by and large, those stereotypes are indeed accurate. We have developed a keen sense of pattern recognition for a reason, and it's crucial to our survival on both an individual and societal level.

This modern demonization and derision of those who notice patterns, of disregarding their lived experience and beliefs is a cancer, in my opinion.

Just because something is a stereotype does not mean it must be discarded, but rather the opposite! It should be examined with careful hand for veracity, and even with a complety impartial study of the subject (something highly unlikely), I would still not brush aside personal account.

Because the exception does not disprove the rule; life is a series of games at every turn, and consistently guessing right even 51% of the time means that knowledge - that stereotype - has heuristic value.

** To be fair, this same overemphasis on houses is present in the source material. Rowling has Dumbledore say "sometimes I think we sort too soon", rather than "sometimes, I realize that people are more than being sorted into one of four buckets".

***** same. my private school had another, shittier private school down the road.

And they were all cunts! Our teachers were right when they made fun of the teaching quality, intellectual capacity, and prestige of that school when in class.

Of course, I don't know much about that school and haven't actually met anyone from there, but I'm sure they were right.

*** That might be the 1954 Robber's Cave Experiment. Where sociologists ran a boys' summer camp, putting 12-year olds at random into two groups, then seeing how conflict could be very easily fostered by making the groups compete, then defused by making them co-operate for a common goal.

Hogwarts does seem to be almost deliberately set up for this.

** I don't know how mature you are as a kid. But children can be horrible.

Growing up in a school that has sections I guarantee kids can be horrible fucks about it. Playground fist fights and other events happen especially when there is a school event. Competitiveness is so strong rich kids doing money to show up the other class. I remember my friend scoffing at section B for being stupid trouble makers and being referred as having sticks up in my ass, teachers pet since I'm in A and I don't even talk to them but they hate me. We don't change up the splitting of sections as well so there's a strong sense of community in a section and a us vs. them in against others. But there have been situation where a kid is bullied thus placed in a different section. Though even in our section, we still have our own factions and while our group of friends never participate there was a huge drama of fights and falling out, ostracizing a perceived traitor and the likes.

Log story short. Kids can be Petty, one group bashing the other is normal. These fics seem to focus on those since politics is about relations, Canon!HP is about the stereotypical Heroes Journey so Harry's adventure is more important that his relationship with others not directly within Harry's sphere.

*** I like stories (like the one you mentioned below) that are done to make an AU, of sorts, but a lot of these fics are writers that feel more personally convicted towards another house, and make excuses as to why their favorite character should really have been in that house. So like with anything else, a good writer can do a really good job with the premise, but bad writers run the trope into the ground.

Summary:

​

Hermione's eighth year at Hogwarts is already going to be difficult in the aftermath of the war, but it is further thrown into upheaval when Headmistress McGonagall orders a re-sorting of all students to promote inter-house unity. But when the Sorting Hat sends Hermione to Ravenclaw with Draco - and without Harry or Ron - how will she cope? [AU, Dramione] Prevalent alchemy.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12021325/1/Antithesis][Antithesis]] 's Harry becomes increasingly creepy. The story starts out a bit cliche, but increases in quality as the story goes on. Harry has a twin who is seen as the golden child while he's abducted by Voldemort, etc. A lot of unnecessary James/Lily/Dumbledore bashing, but enjoyable nonetheless.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15832620/chapters/36865599][The Fire that Swallowed the World]] has a creepy, weird femHarry. The real Harry died when she was one. The Harry that continues to live afterwards is implied to be the physical form of the horcrux that was left behind. No evil, but definitely not human.

** You gotta understand these qualities arent just what the houses are defined by its whats celebrated, by the other children and the heads of houses. Naturally all children can be courageous ambitious hard working and intelligent.

But to have behavior thats more like the behavior of a different house makes you feel like you dont belong. And to promote the idea of belonging and make you feel proud about those qualities you gotta promote the qualities of your house. Which makes those qualities seem better than those of different houses and also fuels interhouse rivalry which is seen as good hence the house cup being a thing.

Is this a good system? I dont think so considering the hostility it encourages in canon especially between Griffindor and Slytherin. But is it entertaining and good for creating drama? Absolutely. Which is why it was likely in story.

** This is quite a valid concern. There is a little too much weight given to the houses and the houses are mistakenly taken to represent a character's core personality trait, which is not the case. And there have been issues regarding the house prejudices as well.
