I was reading through the Top Posts of All Time on this subreddit and saw a prompt for Snektongue, which gave us one of the funniest threads ever and Supreme Danger Noodle in Like a Redheaded Step Child.

That prompt had a second request though for Doge Padfoot but no one replied to it. I wondered if anything like that was ever written afterwards and if not, to repost this prompt.

Would have been nicer if Lycantongue was Doge language but I won't be picky since I can't write my own fics.
