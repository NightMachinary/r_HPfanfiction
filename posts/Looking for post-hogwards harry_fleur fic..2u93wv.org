I vaguely recall a fic where harry has to flee Britain after defeating Voldemort and ends up in France with fleur, i believe the departure fro. France was caused by Dumbledore betraying him.

Does anyone know what fic i'm thinking of? Or am i getting a couple confused?


** Is it [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5683562/1/Salvation]] ?

Or this? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4525701/1/The-French-Affair]]

*** I've read part of the first chapter of Salvation. Does the spelling improve at all?

**** I didn't make it past the first chapter but I might give it another shot when I'm in a forgiving mood. The French Affair seems better but it hasn't updated in years.
