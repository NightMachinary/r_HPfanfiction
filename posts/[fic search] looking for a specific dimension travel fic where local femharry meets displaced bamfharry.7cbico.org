More details about the fic, spoilered for safety: [spoiler]Fic is about fem!Harry meets older, Dumbledore trained slytherin!Harry who was forced off his home dimension (in which he was in love with Daphne Greengrass) in some accident I can't remember. Once arrived, he makes contact with his local female equivalent to help her off Voldemort and in the process he starts dating Fleur Delacour.(/spoiler) Pls help. Sorry if I messed up some rule, I'm new.

  Voldemort is back, he can be stopped but all things come at a price. Someone called for a hero but he said no, ripped from his own reality he jumps again. Will he be more helpful this time? AU femHarry.
