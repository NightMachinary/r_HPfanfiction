Instead of Tom, any other Noble/light character can be used, like Harry for example. Well, depending on what you think about it, i would say, he still more or less became a Dark Lord, but without changing his appearance to a Snake. I thought that he maybe try to change the Magical World for the better (he is definetely a good one at the Beginning), but situations slowly drag him into the abyss and he becomes more and more a Criminal. Maybe he is trying to outlive "his" era to start anew in a new one so he seeks for possibilities for Immortality.

But he would keep his charming look, since its a good Mask to hide his ambitions and for better access to the People around.

As in Canon, Bellatrix or a similar character (maybe even a Rival) would be his loyal Partner. Maybe Tom has many Women, but she remains his No.1

I will leave the possibility open, that the Canon Characters are in this Fic aswell, roughly around the same age, but rather younger, than him.
