By request here is my examination of Albus Dumbledore and some of his actions and possible motivations thereof.

This essay is quite long so I'm posting it in multiple parts, please bear with me. Also, these are just my interpretations of events as portrayed in the books. They are just my opinions, I respect the fact that many absolutely adore Dumbledore. Also, I only classify the seven books as canon, nothing else. Now to the point of this whole thing.

The Lies and Crimes of Albus Dumbledore

In any crime you have to eliminate the distractions and distill things down to the unholy trinity; motive, means, and opportunity. In addition to these questions are who, what, where, when and why. Herein lie the details of the crime, oftentimes the two important questions that will lead to the person responsible for the crime are, who had the most to gain from the crime? Who had the most to lose if the crime had not been committed? Answer these questions and you will likely have found the guilty party.

​

There were many, many crimes committed in the Harry Potter story. Many of them by the so-called “dark side.” But surprisingly a great many by the light side, and nearly all of them were committed by, or at the behest of one man, the recognized leader of the light Albus Dumbledore. In this essay, I examine many of the events in canon with an eye toward spotting inconsistencies and illogical behavior.

​

We start by examining the events immediately after the deaths of James and Lily Potter. Our first questions are:

1. How did Dumbledore know that the Potters had been attacked?

2. How did he know that only Harry had survived?

3. Why did he send Hagrid, who is not allowed to do magic, to collect Harry?

​

Hagrid tells Sirius that Dumbledore has decided that Harry is to go and live with his maternal aunt. This strongly suggests that Albus knew from the get-go that Harry was an orphan and he unilaterally made the decision of where Harry would be raised. As for how he knew, he had to have placed wards around the home that would tell him that both James and Lily were dead and Harry had survived. I think that the Potters were set up, Dumbledore knew that they would be killed, and more than that, I think Dumbledore was counting on them being killed. How else would he know that he would be able to quickly assume control over the toddler Harry?

​

More than likely Dumbledore made the decision to send Harry to the Dursleys long before the child's parents were killed. Why is this the most likely scenario? Because Dumbledore sent Hagrid to pick up Harry from the ruins. Sending Hagrid only makes sense if Dumbledore knew exactly what had happened and that Voldemort brought no one else with him and that the danger had passed. I think that there were possibly wards to allow Dumbledore to monitor the situation and perhaps let only certain people through. Why wards? Because Dumbledore had to be absolutely certain that no one else was going to be able to get Harry or attack Hagrid. If Dumbledore had the slightest doubts he himself would have gone to get the child. So why Hagrid? The only thing that makes sense is that Dumbledore expected Sirius to show up. With Hagrid there to collect Harry, Sirius would not want to risk a fight and possibly hurt a baby.

​

So what was Dumbledore doing and why did he not go to the Potter home himself? Well two possibilities, one is that he was there and that's how he knew what happened. Or that Dumbledore was somewhere that he could monitor something very important to him. Something so important that he would risk what he knows to be the child of the prophecy. The possibilities are that he's trying to protect something or someone. It can't be Harry that he's protecting because he sends someone who can't do magic to pick him up. I can hear it now, Dumbledore apologists are saying, “he was concerned about what the DE's were going to do so he was watching them.” Maybe, but if that was the case then surely he would have actually done something to ensure they were punished or I don't know, maybe actually enforce the laws. No, I don't think he was watching out primarily for DE activity. The only thing that makes sense is that he is either trying to cover something up or he's monitoring Voldemort, perhaps both. As for what he could have been covering up I'll explain that later. But monitoring Voldemort is possible. I think Dumbledore could have gone back to Hogwarts, and perhaps performed some sort of ritual to find out about Voldemort. To make sure that Voldemort doesn't immediately regain a body. While this is going on he sends Hagrid to kidnap the child and bring him back to Hogwarts.

​

If Dumbledore had been on the scene then the logical question is why did he leave Harry there and not bring the child to Hogwarts? If he examined the boy and discovered the soul shard and remnants of whatever magic Lily used to protect her son, Dumbledore may have been afraid to move Harry for fear that Voldemort could somehow use the child to come back immediately. Dumbledore might have wanted to return to Hogwarts and do some fast research. At this point, he could have put up some wards to allow only certain people into the house. The theory is thin but it is somewhat plausible.

​

Despite what the child's parents may have wanted or regardless of what provisions they made Dumbledore ignores all of it and abandons a toddler around midnight on the night of Nov 1-2. The low temperature on that night was between -1.6 Celsius or 29 deg. Fahrenheit and -4.6 Celsius or 23 deg. Fahrenheit. Ok, he could have put a warming charm on the blankets, but I doubt it. There is no mention at all of any warming charms or any spells designed to keep a toddler from waking up and wandering away. The sun rose at 6:55 the next morning that means that a baby was left on a doorstep on a cold night for at least 6 to 7 hours, if not longer.

​

Think of that for a minute and substitute the names Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall for Cornelius Fudge and Dolores Umbridge, or what about Lucius and Narcissa or Voldemort and Bellatrix. Is it wrong to abandon a baby if it's someone other than Dumbledore and McGonagall or some other so-called “light” witch and wizard? If so, then it was wrong no matter who did it.


** This whole "explanation" rely so much on unreasonable assumptions it's not even funny. Anyone in the surrounding of the Potters house could have notified him, like Bathilda said a poster before me. Godric Hollow always was inhabited by some wizards.

Also it's possible that he had a monitor to notify him if something bad happen, but that's not obligatory manipulative or whatever, the Potters where targeted so it's not unreasonable. I do have an alarm at home too mate.

And maybe, just maybe, Dumbledore trusts Hagrid and there is nothing more under that. Of course he was weary of Sirius since he was supposedly a traitor by this point.

Also just because a warming spell was not mentioned doesn't mean it wasn't used. The old man can use it non verbally and wandlessly, so there isn't really a reason for the narrator to mention it. The sorcerer stone isn't some fanfiction with 600k+ words, it always was pretty terse.

*** I agree the assumptions in this are too numerous. If the OP made only a few assumptions, I could see this. But there are so many here, including 'wards' and their capabilities. Most people forget that 'wards' specifically aren't really Canon. There are 'protective enchantments' but nothing that is classified as it's own category: ward.

This is perfectly fine for a fanfiction. But as an interpretation of Canon, it's too many things that while possible in their own, put together are extremely unlikely.

  How did Dumbledore know that the Potters had been attacked?
#+end_quote

Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hollow.

#+begin_quote
  How did he know that only Harry had survived?
#+end_quote

The prophecy and Snape's begging.

#+begin_quote
  Why did he send Hagrid, who is not allowed to do magic, to collect Harry?
#+end_quote

Because Hagrid is a half giant, making him immune to most spells.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe, but if that was the case then surely he would have actually done something to ensure they were punished or I don't know, maybe actually enforce the laws
#+end_quote

In his memories of the Lestrange trial, was he in the stands or sitting with the Wizengamot?

#+begin_quote
  So what was Dumbledore doing and why did he not go to the Potter home himself?
#+end_quote

He was at the Ministry, something he did in every situation in the books: deal with the ministry first then sit down with Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Despite what the child's parents may have wanted or regardless of what provisions they made
#+end_quote

You mean leave him with the godfather they specifically told him was the Secret Keeper? Or the werewolf in poverty? Or the deceased Peter Pettigrew?

There are a few things Dumbledore should be taken to task for, specifically not curbing Snape, not checking in on Harry for a decade, and abandoning him again in his 5th year, but a lot of what he's accused of is reasonably explained in the books (no, I don't find the explanation for his 5th year actions reasonable.)
