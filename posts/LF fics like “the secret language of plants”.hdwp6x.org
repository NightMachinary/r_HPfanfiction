I loved the casual and real adaptation that Endrina used to tell HP's story. Is there any other fics with that same kind of storytelling?


** Fics with a stoic Harry who just does what he has to, to get by:

  Life has given Harry a lot of lemons: dead parents, a cupboard under the stairs, horrible clothes, Harry Hunting. The result should have been a downtrodden, sad little boy. It isn't.

  What if instead of locking Harry in his cupboard whenever they didn't want to look at him, the Dursley's had locked him out of the house instead? Maybe this. Self-Sufficient, Independent!Harry.

** Her other fics Twenty-Six and Twenty-Nine are also fantastic. They're both slash fics but Twenty-Six is gen almost the entire way through, if you're not into it. Twenty-Nine is a great mystery but the slash is noticeable earlier on.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhkäse.
