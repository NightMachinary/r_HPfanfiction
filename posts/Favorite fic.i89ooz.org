Looking for more fics to read so what's your favorite sweet happy ending fics? I like angst with happy ending but not slow burns. If your favorite is more than 75,000 words what's your smaller favorite fic, also?


** Does an open-ended, wistful ending count? Linkffn(Stages of Hope) is equal parts angst and fluff for most of its run, but the ending is purposefully vague, though it's pretty clear that it's supposed to be a happy ending.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  'It's not just Death Eaters that kill Muds. After the Second World War, the Muggle civil rights movements got started. Black rights, and feminism, and gay rights. We -- wizards -- we never had the sixties, because we just kept replaying the war, over and over again: Grindelwald in the forties, then Voldemort in the seventies, then Voldemort again in the nineties. I just hope this time it's really finished, and we can sort out our own fucking house.'Hermione is back at school after a summer in the Muggle world, and everything is changing. But getting closer to Harry doesn't get her any closer to the war - until she's unexpectedly enrolled in the Order of the Phoenix, and meets Hestia Jones, the founder of Mud Pride.

** [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7056][Angelica]]

Harry/Hermione. They find Avalon and Excalibur while on the Horcrux Hunt, Harry dies killing Voldemort, leaving behind a pregnant Hermione. Years later, Avalon shenanigans bring him back, but Voldemort isn't completely dead either.

Significant smut, violence, fluff involving cute kid. If any of those are turnoffs you should probably skip it.
