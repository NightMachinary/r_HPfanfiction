There is a story I remember reading and was hoping if anyone could help me find it. It involves Snape showing up to see dead James and Lily after that Halloween night and baby Harry apparating back in time to Hogwarts when his parents were students.


** Is it this?

*** That's not it but it seems similar so I'll read it. The one i'm thinking about starts just after lily was killed on halloween with snape in the room.
