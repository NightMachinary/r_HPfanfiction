Why is Goblin magic so glorified in fics? I mean they can change your race, remove Horcruxes with surgical precision (despite Horcruxes being extremely rare and the accounts on them are shady at best), accurately determine your entire ancestry from a drop of blood. I know it's fanfics, but if they are so powerful why don't they just rule the world or exterminate the wizards (especially since they 'love' wizards so much)?

In the books all it's implied is that their magic is just different from that of humans, not better or worse. And it's only fair that wizards would not share the secrets of wandlore with Goblins if Goblins don't share their secrets on magical metalwork with them.


** I always found the goblin magic thing to be odd.

I think people like the idea of another powerful race and latch on to the idea of Gringotts being some invulnerable bank. Surely then, there must be some powerful goblin magic defending the bank.

Of course, the most effective protection in the bank against Harry's bank raid was the geminio curse, so this doesn't really hold up under scrutiny. And goblins lost the rebellions.

But it's a great way for authors to insert some lazy writing. Too lazy to write a realistic legal system? Goblin contracts! Too lazy to write a trip to the hospital? Goblin healers!

**** I think the victories were quite decisive since goblins are depicted as bitter towards wizards, while during Voldemort's reign they are portrayed as servile by the wizards. And in fact, that portrayal is not far from true considering how they present themselves to Voldemort once they inform him of the Gringotts break in.

** While I totally agree that they're used as a “magical” solution to way too many problems. I kinda disagree on a few points. I think them being able to help with the horcux is kinda justified by the how the goblins from what I remember employ curse breakers and the like as a legitimate part of what they do that alone justifies it to me to a decent extent the only thing that bothers me about it is how often authors make it seem like every goblin knows about them that bugs me. I can't see all of them knowing about such a rare thing having anyone beyond the more advanced cure breakers know about it seem pretty sketchy to me. For inheritance tests they have a vested interest in it so that's also justified to me to a good extent as well at least for the lineage part, you can pass that off as them actively researching it while wizards haven't. Though a single drop of blood magically giving ever detail down to the last time the had a hang nail is rather annoying.

** The Horcrux handling issue mostly comes about IMO due to two factors. That the spell is considered something egyptian in nature (eg first ones to discover/use it) and two the goblins curse-breaking/tomb raiding and hence have come across it before in the goblins search for treasures.

Of course, it usually needs a discussion on it's "unknown" weaknesses otherwise why isn't the wizarding world overrun with old egyptian dark lords.

It often appears in fics that have some level of Dumbledore bashing to highlight/criticize his habit of keeping too many secrets or setting Harry up to die by Voldemort's hand when all he had to do is reach out to the goblins. Or reach out to Bill Weasley and ask him if he has ever heard of a horcrux.

*** It doesn't need any unknown weaknesses. Look at Voldemort in the first book. The only reason he was even around was that Quirrel stumbled across him and was possessed. Add to that how many tombs were said to be cursed, or that the place the evil wizard was felled was cursed.

There was also the Egyptian belief that people would live for as long as their name existed, which is why they took such pains to erase the names of people that were demonised. Who's to say that this isn't true of horcruxes too, and part of the ritual is writing your name on the object that will hold part of your soul?

I think there are at least three Goblin rebellions mentioned across the books... probably they lost in numbers. Wizards could essentially exterminate Muggles (at least until the late 1930s when the Allied as well as the Axis powers developed nuclear science) and yet haven't done so...

If you ask me, the Goblins are happy with their niche - managing the Wizard society's money. One might even argue that that is actually the more powerful position given that stuff we Muggles see as standard (e.g. basic financial education) isn't even a subject at all in Hogwarts... both races depend on each other.

*** I don't think financial education is really a standard subject taught in school in the muggle world either. It's something I see as something both worlds see as something you pick up from your parents/family.

In my country, the US, all we had on financial education was a finance fair that was a thinly veiled advertisement for a local credit union. In my parents' country, they learned from their parents as well. I learned from my parents about the ins and outs of managing my finances, not school.

**** Well that explains a lot. Just to be clear I'm not trying to rip out Americians but from what you said the education system seems to miss everything that would allow young people to make educated decisions in things like finance and politics. Can I ask what was covered in the social sciences like history, sociology, geography, politics etc. Not just like the topics that were covered but was there any explanation and more importantly debate into the causes, consequences, ethics and social issues of opinions, policies, places and events?

***** In my area (northeastern US), I found that I got an excellent education in the humanities and the sciences. My history teacher was great; I received an excellent well-rounded education in American history. We spent days debating on on the ethics of US policies, present and historically. There was no whitewashing either. We learned about slavery, the atrocities committed against Native Americans, presidential scandals, the founding fathers, etc. We covered everything really.

We also spent class time covering how to analyze documents, speeches, press for bias and accuracy. All in all, I would say that we did receive everything we need for educated decisions in politics.

But the issue is not with the education system but the students. There are always the students who do not pay attention or do not care and their retention of the material will only last until the class ends. Even worse are the students with parents who actively teach their children the wrong information. Parents are sources of socialization that shape children through their formative years, meaning that the children will often be very similar to their parents when it comes to their ways of thinking and beliefs.

If the parents don't see any value in learning about foreign policy or the dark spots in American history, their children won't see that value as well. And to be fair, it's something that won't be of value most of the time either. People are busy and going in depth about each candidate's beliefs takes time. The issue is that when a resurgence of a movement like nationalism happens, the ability to look in depth at something becomes very important. It's certainly not something limited to the US either. It's in part psychological, in part sociological.

****** Too true parents play such a massive part in students education and family values for better or worse often end up been instilled generation after generation. Talking to other americans I have met over the years I noticed there is quite a difference in the quality of education from state to state even school to school depending on socio economic factors but this isn't just limited to education but job prospects, realistate and healthcare. However this isn't just a problem in America like you said it is a problem all over the world. Sorry if my comment seened to target you personally that was not the intention. I would however say the extremes of in america can seem more drastically due to high press coverage and large population size, upcoming election and as you said the resent resurgence of nationalism. Not to mension the interesting shouting matches covered as presidential debates.

It is hard to change the ideals of people who genuinely believe in something. America also has some fundemental democratic issues relating to the electoral collenge skewing the importance and integraty of votes and the low turnout of voters. Hopefully the more education is provided them more people can break this cycle over time.

** Fics (especially later ones) are written by people who are concerned about the way in which Rowling depicts the relationship between wizards and centaurs and wizards and goblins.

Particularly concerning seems to be Harry's complete lack of interest and awareness in these areas which seems pretty bizarre given that he wasn't raised in wizarding society.

So I'm not surprised the authors are interested in nonhuman society and magic. Or that they are putting these societies on a pedestal.

** I think it's sort of an example of Out of Context Magic. Magic A is Magic A, but the goblins exist outside of said magic. It's not that goblin magic is actually stronger than wizard magic, it's that it functions as something of a loophole because it's different from Wizard magic.

Actually out of all those examples, the ability to map out all one's ancestors with a drop of blood doesn't seem too far fetched to me. We can almost do that without magic, IRL, so it doesn't seem like much of a stretch to me that they can fill in the blanks with magic.

Cursebreaking. At the time of canon, they were doing stuff in Egypt. What did Ancient Egyptians do with their dead? Embalm them. Remove the organs. Canopic Jars. Mummies. Just because horcruxes themselves are pretty rare and accounts are shady, doesn't mean that they are the only source of immortality with soul magic. Goblins are the money hungry warrior people. Why destroy something worth money, when they can remove it? Why kill a possessed warrior or cursebreaker? Remove it. Training them up costs time and money. And time is money, so it's money and money.

Harry wasn't a horcrux. He had a soul shard stuck to him. A horcrux is a soul shard anchored to something /with protections./ Harry had none of the protections cast, so it should be ridiculously easy to remove.

Then you throw in the fact that they do all sorts of archaeological digs all over the world. The knowledge they must have collected from ancient civilizations alone could potentially pertain to soul magic.

Because they look down on humans, and can have them do the gruntwork and if something does kill them- oh well, at least it wasn't a Goblin!

I subscribe to Goblins doing shamanistic ritual magic, with some cantrips thrown here and there. Soul magic and cleansing rituals being one of them.

Them cleansing horcruxes? Seems plausible to me. They are only as strong as what you protect them from. And I don't think Voldemort knew about Goblin magic. Well, enough to protect from them.

******* I don't think this point has as much to do about racism as it does with money AND those who can bring more of it back to Gringotts, species be damned. Remember, Bill was a Head Boy at Hogwarts and talented as Hell, with at least five N.E.W.T.S. and he was selected by Gringotts into their curse-breaker program right out of school. That alone shows that he has hellish skills and talent, as well as the fact that he's still employed by them after the dragon event in which he had a family member involved.

In terms of Goblins and their magic - I have no problems in general with the fanfic interpretation simply because we see in canon that wizards possess an arrogance which would allow them to think that they're superior to all others and that if they can't devise a solution, no one else can. (Three examples: Horcrux removal, apparition and the Avada Kedavra. There are obviously ways to defeat/block that Curse, house-elves prove that you can Apparate through warded-off areas, and just because Dumbledore can't find a way to remove the soul-piece from Horcruxes doesn't mean others can't OR that they can't find ways to do an end-run around the problem. (I can't remember whose fic did this, but the Goblins had a procedure where they could move the Horcrux from the object possessed to a non-sentient creature (they used pigs) and after completed, they killed the pig and had a barbeque. )

There was a line from the first line of the 'Star Wars' series 'The Black Fleet Crisis' (I think) where Luke told his partner 'The Force is a mighty river from which many cups can drink. If we didn't know that before the witches of Dathomir, we certainly know it now.' We know that there is Wizarding magic and the magic of house-elves, Veela, Goblins, and that of many other creatures like Dragons, nifflers, Thunderbirds, Swooping Evil and so forth; it is only our own myopia that lets us continue to think Goblins can't do things on a magical level any better than wizards... and we know that's simply not true.

As long as a story doesn't go totally overboard with the use of Goblins as asspull specialists - I'm perfectly fine with them being capable of feats wizards can't do or won't for various reasons (such as it's beneath them - and remember, Augusta Long bottom felt that Charms was 'a soft option' because she herself failed in the same O.W.L. that Neville passes). If it helps the story, I'm in. Otherwise, toss it.
