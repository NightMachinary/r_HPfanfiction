:END:
1. Dumbledore tells Harry about the Prophecy after first year and he distances himself from everyone. Story starts years later with Hermione getting rescued by Harry in the forbidden forest. She is there because of a mean prank by Lavender .

2. Hermione spies on Harry with enchanted earrings. He distanced himself because of the usual manipulative Dumbledore, everyone got paid to spy on him stuff. He just ignores it for a while, but when she keeps nagging him he explodes on her - and explodes the earrings.

3. Timetravel. Harry tells Dumbledore his whole story including Dumbledores assisted suicide by Snape. That leads to Dumbledore questioning Snapes allegiances and killing him for some reason.

If any of those sound familiar to you please help me find them.
