:END:
I'm looking for ron/hermione fic from back in the day on either FFN or Checkmated. I don't remember the title or author, but I do remember bits of plot. My sister swears the fic is Anam Cara, but it's not. Here's what I do remember:

--Hermione brews a potion that repels the killing curse. She adds a little something extra (her virgin blood) that essentially means she and Ron are married--The person who gets hit with the killing curse either staggers about as if drunk or passes out, but they don't die--She pairs the potion with amulets that they both wear for added protection. Ginny freaks out when she sees Hermione's because back in the day this was used to protect a witch's chastity, essentially equaling enslavement or something like that. But it's ok, because Ron wears one too--Ron at one point gets jealous when someone (Draco?) bothers Hermione, and makes her amulet repel Draco across the room--Hermione has of this pairing potion (minus the virgin blood) and gives some to Harry and Ginny and to the twins to keep them from dying during the final battle.

Please, which fic is this???
