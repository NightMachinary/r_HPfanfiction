I think it was on ao3, and it was like, had that sort of bit where Ares knows that Harry's no demigod and masqueraded as one to figure out what the hell was going on or something, and the first chapter i think had him sort stumbling and almost getting assaulted by a demigod out of reflex and he only escapes by the feather because he sort of say he's like him, and anything beyond that, I don't really remember.
