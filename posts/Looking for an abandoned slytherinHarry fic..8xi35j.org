Hi everyone, lately I've been wracking my brain and google for a fic that I can't remember. I remember it started with Harry being sorted into slytherin and him becoming friends with Zabini. And it was Zabini that told him not to look for the Mirror of Erised. Also, random tid bit that I remembered is; Draco has Tottenshell Tornado PJs which caused Harry to not take Draco too seriously anymore.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks so much.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*
