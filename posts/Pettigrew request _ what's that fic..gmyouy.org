Looking for any fics that make Pettigrew a more complex person or really add any emotional depth to anyone. It doesn't have to be major but I'm reminded of one where Peter didn't just betray because he was a coward, but because he was protecting Marlene Mckinnon. If you onow this one or ones that have a little more humanization I'm interested. Same with Snaps. I want a dislikeable character but still understandable one


** linkffn(11191235) Prince of Slytherin has my favorite Pettigrew in fanfiction. It's not like the example you gave--Pettigrew is still evil, but is much more interesting than in canon, and it makes him a better villian.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  There's a reason why a coward was sorted into Gryffindor. Also, there's always a reason for betrayal - and sometimes the reason isn't what you think it is. Unlikely, but could be canon.
