I was just wondering, the wards that keep Harry save from Voldy are tied to his blood relatives, got that, but why the hell didn't like any other relative take him in? Purebloods are all related to some degree and the Potters gotta be closely related to SOMEONE! who is on the Order's side! Snape is a Prince, Lady Longbottom maybe? Or what about Andromeda? Anyway, I just never got that, how the wizarding world could've forsaken their savior like that, how nobody asked after Harry in 10 years. :(


** What you need to understand is that the one who sent Harry to Dursleys to isolate him from the magical world was not Albus Dumbledore. It was JK Rowling (yeah, sounds dumb but hear me out).

The entire story hinges on the fact that Harry and Voldemort are so similar to one another. Both of them were orphans and grew up without being loved. Harry was feared for his magic by the Dursleys, much like Tom was in his orphanage. Harry was isolated from the magic world up until the age of eleven, much like Tom was. Both of them had the qualification coveted by Salazar for his house (as demonstrated by the hat wanting to put Harry in Slytherin). Even their names were similar in that both of them were quite common.

Had Harry followed the hat's advice and went to Slytherin, with his fame and abilities (specifically parselmouth), he would have grown up to become a very different wizard. Perhaps, not dissimilar to Voldemort. However, he chose Gryffindor instead, and made friends who helped him and supported him and the rest is history.

So you see? Rowling engineered the situation so that she could make Harry's childhood the same as Tom's. And that was done to illustrate her point, it is not our abilities or situations that define us, it's our choices.

** First, wards aren't canon. They are fanon elements that don't exist in the HP universe. What Lily had done was a powerful protection charm (or a counter-charm to be more precise).

So, why wasn't Harry taken to any Wizarding home? First, as MasterofDebt said, it might be because Lily was the one who made the protection, so the relatives must be related to Lily, not James. It may also be because the protection might be stronger if the relatives are more closely related to Harry. But that's all conjecture.

The reason stated in the canon is that it was because Dumbledore, at this point, believed (correctly) that living in Privet Drive was the safest option for Harry. This was because of two reasons.

1) After Sirius' "betrayal," absolutely nobody could be trusted. After all, Sirius was James' best friend (and a part of the Order). So, if he was a betrayer, anyone else could be potentially dangerous.

Of course, Dumbledore could have made Harry's protectors make an unbreakable oath of not harming Harry or something. However, this can further be explained on the second point.

2) At this point, no one was safe (as proven by the attack on the Longbottoms a few days later). Even the Fidelius Charm, which was known to be the most potent protection, failed at this point. Voldemort's fanatic followers were still at large, and there was nothing that could guarantee Harry's safety 100%, other than Lily's sacrificial charm.

So, canonically, we can conclude that being sent to the Dursleys was the best chance in Harry's survival. While Harry did not have the best childhood, at least he was alive.

*** Thanks , some things make more sense to me now! And the wards are fanon? I thought the protection is canon, but saying they are blood wards specifically is fanon ... I think I've read to many fanfics if I already mix up stuff in my head - on the other hand keeping half a dozen books straight in my head isn't easy either :)

**** Glad to help ;)

Yep, there isn't a single mention of wards in the HP canon (books, movies, games, pottermore, interviews, etc).

Actually, I lied. It is used [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Janus_Thickey_Ward][once]] in OotP, although it refers to a different kind of ward :P

Anyways, it happens to most people who read fanfiction, so you're not alone. For me, it helps when I take some breaks from fanfiction and re-read the canon every once in a while. Helps me appreciate the canon more and refresh my mind from all the bad fanfic tropes.

**** Wards aren't canon, true, but in this case it's "a rose by any other name" type of thing. Wards aren't a class of magic in and of themselves, but any charms or jinxes combined with a trigger (such as motion past a certain line) which are then used to defend a stationary target, such as a home or a piece of land, are essentially wards. Without the trigger, you've just got a cursed house. Since Harry's protection is centered on Harry, and Harry is not stationary, it can't really be called a ward.

***** Is it centered on Harry? It's only valid when he's staying at the Dursleys, and there are times in canon he's told not to leave the house, and in the fifth book, the dementors are able to come after him outside the house. I think the protection might just be centered on the house.

****** The protection is centered on Harry. The reason why he had to stay with the Dursleys was because doing so was the /condition/ of the Bond of Blood. However, this does not imply that the protection is centered on the house. It protected him from Quirrell in Hogwarts (which, certainly, was outside Privet Drive).

The reason why he was told not to leave the house was because 1) breaking the /condition/ (not location) of the Bond of Blood will disable the protection and 2) the Order was on their way to get Harry, and they did not want him to do anything rash (like try to run away as he did in PoA).

**** Thing is, the wards used in fanon are often things used in canon itself, like anti apparition/disapparition. Or Fidelius. Anti intruder jinx. Imperturbable charm. Muggle repelling. Basically charms/spells/hexes that affect an area or protect an object.

Fanon just goes overboard, turning into an entire field, when the word ward isn't really used in that context at all in canon. It /works/, but it's not a thing.

*** It just, I always thought of it being there to protect Harry, therefor it being tied to HIM through his mother, but he himself is genetically half his father ... erm ... if that makes sense. Like his mom said 'I am his relative i want him protected' and he'd be protected by anyone related to HIM. HIS blood relations. - though thats probably a stupid assumption.

** Another plot twist: you'd want a Muggle relative. Let's ignore the "famous in the Wizarding world" part, although that's certainly a concern. They just went through a civil war. People are lying about what side they're truly on - yeah, Peter was the traitor, not Sirius, but still. If you try to find a distant Wizarding relative, you don't necessarily know what their true politics are like, if they're just trying to collect a paycheck. I remember in one fic, Dumbledore told Harry that he did manage to find a distant Wizarding relative, but he didn't actually know her, so there were all of these questions of whether she could be trusted, and if she would handle the responsibilities well. Those questions make a case for just taking the safer route and leaving Harry with Muggle relatives.

** Even though Lily would have had to have a magical relative at some point in the family tree, how far back would it have to be before it didn't count? Go back far enough and I'm every redditor's distant cousin.

Even if that magical relative's other descendants counted for the protection, who's to say they'd actually be any of the families in the UK? In that region they're basically all related, but this one relative could've been from a different part of the world entirely, where their only magical relatives are in, say, Brazil or Canada. I don't really see the rather closed off Ministry, or even Dumbledore, sending their cherished prophesied one to some distant country for the next ten years.

It wouldn't matter that Harry almost certainly has magical blood relations through his father's pureblood line (assuming his line is from the British wizarding world). James didn't use the sacrificial magic, Lily did. So the relative had to be on Lily's side.

We know his grandparents were dead by that point, that Lily had no other siblings, and there's no mention of any other family implying their parents could have been only children (which is entirely possible).
