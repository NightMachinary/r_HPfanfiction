** So, some tough love here: I would rewrite all of Chapters 1 and 2.

Don't scrap all of it. I can see the ideas of where you want to go. I would get rid of the whole Goyle subplot to bring Harry back (unless that plays into a somewhat vital role later in your story). The first chapter should be Harry and just Harry himself. It encases the reader in the isolation he puts himself in. It removes any other characters from influencing the story yet. If you really want to have a story of Harry finding himself, then begin and end the first chapter with just him. You can give some background into how he got there. Maybe some thoughts of what his friends had done and how he left them. You could even go through the mundane of what he does every day down to an agonizing details. But it should start with him and it should end with his decision to come back. It all goes too fast right now.

The point is you want Harry alone in the first chapter. To have him alone, then dueling a stray Death Eater, then returning in Chapter One sets a strange pacing (IMO). I think it would be much, /much/ better if Harry's thoughts were all to himself in the first chapter.

It makes his sudden inclusion in the second chapter all the more jarring. Here is a man who has been alone for some time and slips right into the feel of things like he's in Hogwarts again. You need to get the style of how you want to write and not just how the story happens. Right now, it seems as if it is in a going-through-the-motions state. This is what happens. This is how he gets reconnected. This is how he finds his niche. This is how it ends. There's little source of conflict there.

Of course, there are some other grammatical things you should brush up on. A beta always helps, but there's never enough and it's not the right fit all the time. Brush up on our dialogue work.

This is not intended to demean you or your work. It's hard enough to start writing without some stranger on the internet telling you to rewrite everything. But if you can take some of this advice and start asking yourself some questions, you can hopefully find some ideas of how to go forward.
