This is a story I have long hoped for, as H.P. on NZT is a fascinating concept and right up there with H.P. on the Spice, Melange(another story type that is too rare, but will hopefully be remedied by Jason Momoa and his newest upcoming movie). Any takers, or any x-overs not on ffn that I have missed?
