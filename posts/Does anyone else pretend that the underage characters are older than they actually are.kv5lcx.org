**** A breakdown or two are perfectly fine, especially if the fic addresses abuse, the war or other trauma. But one of Harry's great traits is his resilience, so it should not be more than the metaphorical hand to pull him back up when he's down on his knees.

Although Snape playing that part would feel as in-character as him double-tapping Harry with a 9mm while NWA's /Fuck the Police/ plays in the background.

My brother read a meme once that was something like 'one day your parents put you down and never picked you back up again' and my Dad was like 'oh yeah??' and picked him up. My brother was 6'6" and 250lbs+ at the time and my Dad completely threw his back out. His doctor scolded him and made him do physical therapy for six weeks.

Whenever I see stuff like Snape carrying Harry to bed to tuck him in, I always think of that and can't stop laughing. I know they have charms and spells but that's still what I picture in my head.

Or other less overt childish things.

I know off a 14 years old that lingers by his 7 years old foster sister room, at bedtime, and just listen to the bedtime story the foster parent read, as if it was for him.

Basing my thinking of that, I guess we can have Harry trying to have childish things that he didn't have, but being way more subtle than "sitting on lap at 16".

Maybe, he picked up some magical toys in Diagon Alley, and found them fascinating, and plays with them....and no one tell him that they're actually for the 6-8 years old age range.

We could have Snape read the newspaper or some article about potion aloud, because something make him angry or annoys him in the piece, and Harry encouranging it with some questions or "can you repeat that, not sure I understood well", because maybe it isn't bedtime stories, but at least he is read to.

Older teens can and will try to recapture childhood they didn't have. But not exactly in the form they would have when they were actual children. And it can be sweet and all. But They have some self-awareness and they are very self-conscious. It's always more subtle than "let's just have him act like a 6 years old".

That doesn't sound like something any sane person would want, regardless of childhood trauma. But in any of the scenarios that you just described, It's a bit subtler and sadder, more realistic.

***** As a not particularly sane individual, I'd have no problem sitting on someone else's lap in a public forum, except in my case it'd be for a gag or something, not because I didn't sit in mommy's lap enough as a child. My mom was in a wheelchair because of leg injuries so I literally COULDN'T sit on her lap without causing her pain, and by the time my aunt and uncle adopted me (because my mom was slowly losing the ability for self-care, let alone childcare) I was "too old" to sit in laps or be picked up. And the only people to seek out hugs in my childhood were all either wheelchair bound, really old, or both, so picking me up or dealing with a hyperactive brat in their lap just wasn't feasible. Even for Santa pictures I'm only sitting on Santa's lap in about 6 photos, and I'm in 26 of those things, given that it's literally the one time a year me and my cousins are ever in the same place for long enough to consider commemorative pictures viable.

** Ok, when I'm reading Fics,

I've gotten a lot more picky with time. Generally I skip or speed read through years 1-2. It's usually the same things in a different presentation, so unless it's really good writing, I don't enter it too often.

I read from year 3 onwards.

Generally Fics - most with the heirs and whatnot, are extremely focused on politics and power play; it eases it when I try to imagine them as older and fortunately the "Date where you meet your soul mate" A.K.A Yule ball isn't until year 4, so I don't need to go through much romance at that point and you can ignore the weirdness.

When I write stories or fanfics -

I was in boarding school as a kid, all the way up till graduation, so the dynamics and how kids work in boarding school generally makes it easier for me when I write.

My school was in the mountains, and unfortunately or fortunately from where I'm standing now, we didn't have good connectivity with internet and phones.

Landslides and what not.

So I have a lot of letters I wrote home so I can remember the things I did and was interested in from when I was a kid.

So when I write, I can imagine the characters as a kid.

But if I'm feeling particularly lazy, I write from 15-16 years old; because it's a lot easier and you don't need to worry about the age and maturity as much.

Also it's easier to do divergence from year 4/5 onwards with fanfics because changing things from below year three has a rather large ripple effect.

** I think Hogwarts works best when aged up - because most of the stories people tend to want to tell are more adult than the books.

Personally I'd make it either start at 14 (so that students turn 18 at year 4, which would then make OWLs a good point for education stopping/ the equivalent of a secondary education), or start at 18 (for more university age). The former allows for a year or two of still essentially being children, but more mature + more actual adult years than canon. This can also open up for more advanced magic with either one.

I'm not sure why some people don't want to do that TBH - if wanting to do a story that simply doesn't work with 10 year olds (eg, politics focused) just bump up the ages.

It's hard to write characters at the right age sometimes. Add in things like Harry's lack of normal socialization and Hermione's precociousness, and that complicates matters. I suspect that's why some people write time travel: Harry may be 8, 11, 15, but his mind is anywhere from 3 to 50 years older and thus he speaks/acts older. Throw in some characters marveling at his maturity and it's all good. Theoretically.

I'm uber bad at estimating people's age so it really doesn't help, but I developed some kind of trick in which I imagine them as they were in a movie closer to the canon age, so CoS for PoA, PoA for GoF, and so on and so forth.

** No, I just remember how randy I was at 14 and assume boarding school allows more opportunities than living at home. 13 years olds used to be married off and mothers... Why would it be hard to believe a society that clings to such outdated dress and social mores wouldn't also allow older/younger relationships that make modern folks feel squicky?

** I am guessing it is more difficult to write dialogue for younger characters than older characters. Does the same thing not happen in some movies and TV shows, where the children's dialogues are very superficial.

** Sometimes I pretend that since the age of majority in the Wizarding world is 17 so their age of ~consent~ 'I can legally have sex with people much older than me' would be 15. Fanonically speaking, Ginevra Molly "Howarts' slut" Weasley sometimes is... seeing places.

** If I find a fic like that, I just pretend Hogwarts started at say 13/15 based on how they are behaving and I don't find much of an issue after that.

** I think I unconsciously do. Because when I read a 4 year old Harry Potter with a cute lisp, struggling with big words and who mixes fantasy with reality I get annoyed. 11 Year olds you can basicall treat/read as mini adults.

...And now I feel like Matilda's principal Trunchbull.

** You know there was a Harry Potter fan made movie where a girl in her twenties tell Tom Riddle "I'm just a second year student, Tom". The comment section was hilarious. A guy justified that she's a student who had to go through Hogwarts without Hermione tutoring her!!!
