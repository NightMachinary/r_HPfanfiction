Ideally, I'd like to see how Pettigrew went Dark and him keeping it from the other marauders, feeling the strain of keeping it secret.

Also as a bonus I'd be curious to see from Petigrew's POV him meeting Sirius in PofA. But more interested in his pov on why he went Dark. Thanks!


** I haven't read a story that showed things from Peter's POV as to why he became a death eater. But I have read a story that hints at how it may have come about.

The story is a time travel fic where Harry goes back to the Marauder's Era. He basically tries to make things better for everyone including peter. There are a few scenes where you see the initial approaches to Peter. There are also several scenes where Harry helps Peter where you can imagine if Harry had not done that you could see how Peter would go "bad".

The story is called Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  This is the Peter reincarnated as Harry story you didn't even know you wanted. Give it a try! No character bashing---Peter's character is very relatable, falling down the slippery slope of bad decision-making is so much more human than rat. Peter's mam had always said he'd been born under a lucky star, but none of the stars' tales ever struck him as being particularly lucky.Peter counted them off in his head. Canis major, forever chasing the rodent Lepus. Orion, the hunter who fell to pride. Lupus, impaled on the centaur's spear. Aries, sacrificed so his golden fleece would save the prince's life.No, it was better to be a nonentity. Someone relegated to the forgotten parts of the history books. Someone small and inconspicuous, crouching in the corner like a rat.(In the farthest nook of the cupboard under the stairs, three Hallows sat, waiting.) AN: The pairings are tagged so slash-haters are forewarned of some fleeting teenage crushes, but there won't be any underage relationships. Betad by Eider Down.

** Chapter 20 of Remain In Light.

The whole story is amazing but chapter 20 is just Peters angle and it really changed the whole view and outlook of his character for me. It's bloody brilliant.

It really outlines his origins and what happened during the war to force/convince him to change and why he felt like he had to and what he had to do to do it. It's eye-opening and really sad.

Chapter 20 could possibly be posted as a standalone oneshot. Peter thinks he's doing it to keep them together. To keep James safe. He thinks its the only way they'll all survive the war. It's his job. It's just such a good insight into this character

** Linkao3(The Age of Lies by TheDivineComedian) has probably the best Peter Pettigrew pov I've ever seen. It's split with the other Mauraders and Regulus Black though.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
