This is an idea that I've been sitting on for a while, but I haven't gotten around to writing a mock-up of it yet...or any of my other ideas I'm sitting on, for that matter.

Basically, imagine a world where instead of Chocolate Frog Cards, there's Chocolate Frog Figurines. Or figures, whatever. They walk around, they do stuff (like that little dragon figurine Harry got for the First Task in book 4), and the Figurine Collection Guide tells all about the different characters you can find and their place in history.

Ron is, naturally, still a collector of these, but Chocolate Frog Figures are a lot more fun to play with than cards. So when History of Magic class rolls around, Ron the 11-year-old takes out some of his collected figures to play with them.

And this is where the funny happens; when Harry gets interested, the two of them start arranging the action figures, using parchment to make walls and castles and whatnot, and getting them to act out action scenes.

This is a LOT more interesting than Professor Binns; Harry and Ron soon get the attention of the entire class, which leads to Ron trying to explain what he remembers about the history of each character each figure represents, and, arranging impromptu dioramas on his desk to physically illustrate what he knows.

This, naturally, gets silly when, for example, when trying to explain the famous duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, Ron has to substitute a Phyllida Spore figurine for Grindelwald (which he doesn't have) which leads to The Tale Of How Dumbledore & "Grindelwald" Dueled By Throwing Turnips.

Or when trying to put together a diorama of the goblin rebellion Binns is droning on about, using Otto the Shuffler in place of Urg the Unclean leading to a retelling of the famous Breakdance Rebellion.

--------------

Basically, tell stories about the history of magic in Harry Potter, with LOTS of historical inaccuracies (/You've got it all wrong, Morgana didn't marry Merlin!/, Hermione complained), and a young teenager Ron as narrator occasionally helped by other students.

Think it'd be funny?


** That sounds hilarious! Write it please!
