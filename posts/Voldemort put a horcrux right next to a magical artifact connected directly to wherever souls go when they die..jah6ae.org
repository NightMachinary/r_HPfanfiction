It seems to me like connecting the two would suck voldemort into death like pulling the plug on a basin of water. Does the Stone have a magical one-way valve?


** i think it was on the ring itself was it not? the stone was the indestructible force, but the ring was open to it.... but yea it is odd you might think that if in any way that the hollows were part of death that they maybe would sense his twisted and broken soul and attack it.

** Ehhh magic isn't so cut and dry as far as we're shown. A lot of people to apply x + y = z logic to Potterverse magic, where it's more along the lines of x + y = the taste of the color green
