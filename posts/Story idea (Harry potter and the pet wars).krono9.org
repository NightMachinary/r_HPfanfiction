So... I had this idea for a story and wanted to know what you guys think.\\
Also wanted to know if something like it exists. (its pretty crack)\\
Here is my short brainstorm of what I want to put in it.

The title would be something along the lines of "Harry potter and the pet war" or "Petmageddon" or something more stupid. More stupid=more better!

Ron and Hermione have the cannon argument about Crookshanks attacking Scabbers.\\
A few days later Crookshanks captures and kills Scabbers. (when you die in you form you stay in your form so peter is never discovered)\\
The whole common room observes the gory kill.\\
Ron is pissed off and wants revenge.\\
Ron spends the next few months saving up for a new pet (or maybe loans money from harry for a new pet).\\
Ron gets a great discount on a dog/crup/blink dog because it killed 5 cats in the pet store.\\
Ron names hit half crup "Killer" or "Revenger dog" or something more stupid.\\
Lots of hilarious arguments and conflict ensues.\\
Like Ron parroting all of Hermiones arguments about it just being the animals nature and that he can't be expect him to control his pet.\\
Killer kills Crookshanks!\\
Harry still refuses to pick a side and both Ron and Hermione end the friendship with him.\\
Hermione gets a lion and a it kills Ron's dog.\\
Ron gets a cerberus that kills the lion.\\
This escalates to more and more extreme pets.\\
All the pets are charmed by the store not to attack humans... but....\\
At some point one of the pets eat a black dog (Sirius is never seen in the story).\\
At some point one of the pets eats a wolf in the woods during the full moon. (Lupin disappears)\\
At some point one of the pets eats a cat wandering the halls at night. (Minerva disappears)\\
At some point Hermione gets a pet dragon and the dementor population decreases dramatically (apparently dragon fire kills dementors)\\
At some point one of the pets kills a bunch of owls including Hedwig.\\
Harry now joins the conflict.\\
The pet store refuses to sell him a basilisk because they can not be controlled and are only good for potions and useless as pets.\\
Harry thinks he can control all snakes because of his parseltongue ability.\\
Harry goes to the chamber and creates a new basilisk pet.\\
The basilisk ends up going postal and kills every pet and half the students and Hogwarts.\\
The basilisk then rampages in Hogsmead.\\
Harry, Hermione and Ron become friends again while sharing 10 years of 'detention' at Azkaban.

The end.


** This would be amazing. I love this prompt.
