Hey all. I'm hoping you can help me out.

I'm looking for a novel-length fic (or series?) posted on FF.net which chronicled the life of a young Severus Snape. It was fairly canon-compliant, but also featured several OCs, including a friend named Ophelia (?) who was several years younger than Severus but had a persistent crush on him. The story was probably well over 100k words and, from what I recall, consisted of a great number of fairly short chapters. I read it about four years ago - it was still in progress and when I left off Severus had graduated Hogwarts and it was exploring his early adult life post-Hogwarts, being a Death Eater, etc. (Voldemort had not yet fallen and he hadn't returned to teach yet, so it was probably around 1980).

There was definitely not any time travel, no modern characters (e.g. non-baby Harry), and no pairings involving Snape (despite the admirer). It was also not "A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles" by Rannaro which I do not recall ever reading despite my understanding that is the consensus best fic within the genre described. Any help would be greatly appreciated - I've done some searching on my own but I'm concerned it may have disappeared from FF.net.


** Here it is.

*** Wow, nice work, thank you!!

I haven't read much Snape-centric fanfiction at all, but it amazes me that over a million words on the man never generated more of a following. It was also written a bit earlier than I thought, and seems to precede some of the very popular stories in its genre that I've seen recommended, so perhaps it inspired them in some way.

Disappointingly, the author's personal issues seem to have derailed the series. I gave the original story a bit of a reread and paged through some of her later work, and while there are some obvious flaws, I appreciated the chance to reconnect with a work I remember thinking was very unique at the time.
