For those who don't know what fort knox is, it is the place most publically known where the United States keeps it's physical gold to back the paper dollar. The security is so excessive it becomes a metaphor for high levels of security.

The hogwarts express carries the heirs of the wizarding government. I'd like to see a story where when they attack the train, they don't even get through the windows or something similar.

Thanks!


** There is this one really crappy fic called Harry Potter and the cursed child where the trolly lady is done kind of robot demon or something to keep students from leaving the express

** If you don't know what Fort Knox is you should really sit down and watch “Goldfinger” (the James Bond film).
