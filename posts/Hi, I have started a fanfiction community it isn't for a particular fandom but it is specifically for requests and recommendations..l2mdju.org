*** Hi basically the subreddit is for any fandom as i said in the above post you can request or recommend from any fandom including the ones where there may not be a specific subreddit for recommending and requesting its also a good way to introduce people to different types of fanfiction and is less complex than [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]]
