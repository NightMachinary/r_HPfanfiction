Hey redditors, I've been seriously looking for weird HP Fanfics recently but I'm not quite finding what I'm looking for. Basically, I'm looking for evil Slytherin Harry. I know there's aplenty of those, but honestly I love genderswapped Harry. Any good ones you know about? Peace.


** It's not "evil female Harry in Slytherin", but it's pretty much "evil female Harry who should be in Slytherin":

#+begin_quote
  Her whole life has been about gaining power through struggle and sacrifice and manipulation of the only thing she has going for her (Charlotte's a terrible person beneath the pretty face and she knows it). Charlotte wants to be more than the girl from the cupboard and she's not above using others to gain power.
