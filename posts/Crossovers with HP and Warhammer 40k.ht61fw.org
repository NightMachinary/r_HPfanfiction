As the title says, I'm looking for the extremely rare and specific crossover of Harry Potter and Warhammer 40,000. I absolutely love this combo mainly due to the way magic and technology mix in the two settings along with the way the absurdity of 40k compliments the illogic of the wizarding world. Both due to my belief that it is better to recommend somethung whenever you are also asking for something, and to give an idea about what I'm talking about, here is the long running (in progress) series that inspired my love of this combo and made me want to read more.

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.
