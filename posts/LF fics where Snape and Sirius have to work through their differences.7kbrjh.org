Looking for good fics that feature Sirius and Snape, for some reason (possibly to protect Harry? a mission for the Order where they have to work together?), have to work through at least some of their differences.

Preferably as adults. I'm looking for something that doesn't gloss over the many, many complications of their youthful hostility. They don't have to be real friends at the end, and realistically I'd prefer they not be.

Slash is fine, but not between Sirius and Snape (though if you've got one that really, really explores their vitriol well...)


** There is quite a bit of that in linkffn(The Never-ending Road by laventadorn). Its a fem!Harry fic (it's entirely gen, no creepy romance or thoughts right now even though the author says there will be future Harriet/Snape pairing). There are multiple instances where Snape and Sirius end up working together to save or help Harry from one thing or another despite them continuing to hate each other. Sometimes against Dumbledore's wishes which also makes things interesting.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. Future Snape/Harriet. Sequel "No Journey's End" (Ootp - DH) is now posting.

** "Walking the Monochrome"- linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1058100/chapters/2119774]]) is really good. It's pre-slash so no actual romance.

**** You're welcome! I love it too. It's heartbreaking to the point where I find it difficult to reread often. I adore his moments as Padfoot, the way he uses it to connect with Snape, and [[/spoiler][how that connection is so strong even after Snape wakes up]]. It's one of the first fics that made me realize how much more there is to Sirius.

***** I can't recall any other story's Sirius that comes close to this Sirius, honestly. Maybe [[http://wotcher-wombat.livejournal.com/5719.html][Scenes from the Hogs' Head]], but it's been a while since I read that, so I can't say. What is essential to me, while reading about Sirius, is for the story to capture that /edge/, that feeling that Sirius is always one short step away from losing his sanity. Then there's the guilt and depression and capacity for cruelty and rebelliousness and hypocrisy and self-destructive impulsiveness and unflinching loyalty. I think he may be the second most complex character, after Dumbledore, though Snape has a longer and more detailed arc. Yet so many stories don't give him any more depth than as someone who will fuck anything that moves :/

That said, I don't really read much of Sirius, for whatever reason. He and Remus are two characters I love in canon, but tend not to interest me too much in fanfiction. It doesn't help that the two most common Sirius pairings are Sirius/Remus and Sirius/Hermione, neither of which I'm all that interested in.

I wrote a longer take on Walking the Monochrome [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Psych0Geek/bookmarks][here]], if you're interested.

****** I've often thought that Sirius was just as damaged and petty as Snape, and I think they have a lot in common which is why I'm on the lookout for fics with any interaction between them (though I do have a Snape bias). I don't know where the characterization of "perpetually high and energetic playboy" comes from, when by all accounts he was kind of unhinged and angsty before Azkaban itself. I also like the character in canon, but don't go out of my way to read about him.

"Stockholm Syndrome like codependency" is a great way to describe their relationship in the fic. I don't think it's actually possible for Sirius to have a relationship that's /not/ codependent. I've never seen any author use his animagus form as Padfoot in such a touching way either.

I don't know what it is about Hermione that makes her shipping material for so many characters.

  (WIP, updated on Mondays) What if Narcissa were dying and decided her son would be better raised by the Lord of her house: Sirius Black. With this one action, how different would life be for the wizarding world? Alliances, relationships, everything could be changed because of one woman's love for her child and one man's determination to grow up. (eventual het&slash relationships)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
