To borrow someone's summary of Draco's character:

/He spends most of the books being an awful person, but the final books reveal him as a schoolyard bully who was raised to have horrible beliefs, but he doesn't have it in him to truly be a villain/

So what if the death eater attack at the World Cup 4th year was more violent and Draco is witness to the Muggle family being tortured to death while several innocent wizards are reportedly struck down with the killing curse by masked death eaters?

The way I see it Draco justifies his bullying and bigoted behavior to himself because it's just in 'good fun' (look at what the Marauders did in 'good fun') and it's what he's been taught. But deep down he has a conscience and it won't accept any more excuses when he can actually see people being hurt and killed.

So this is a Draco redemption but /not/ Draco/Harry. In fact Draco's feud with Harry has nothing to do with blood purity so I think they should remain rivals - you shouldn't have to like Harry Potter to be a good person. What I envision is a slow redemption, focusing on Draco having to learn what is actually bad about blood purity/pure blood society beyond the killing he witnessed. Remember that he's been raised entirely in that bubble so he has no outside context with which to judge it yet.

So at the beginning of the school year Hermione finds herself cornered by an oddly behaving Draco who sputters out something resembling an apology for calling her a mudblood. Of course he's not really apologizing to her, she's just the only Muggleborn he's actually interacted with and he desperately wants to unburden himself of the guilt he feels about being one of /them/ (the evil murdering death eaters).

This leads to a slow redemption/friendship. Draco can't stand his common room because the other Slytherin kids are still joking about killing mudbloods like it's all a game and so he begins retreating to the library; Hermione thinks Draco is stalking her there (and is still puzzled by whatever nonsense he said to her before) and so she confronts him.

This leads to an ongoing series of discussions/debates in which Draco slowly gains an outside perspective that lets him understand why he was wrong while at the same time Hermione learns a lot about pureblood society (arranged marriages, parents making playtime about forming alliances, etc) that changes her view from a general 'purebloods hate me for being different' to a more politically active 'pureblood customs are one of the systematic ills in the wizarding world that I need to correct'. Along the way they become less hostile towards each other.

It could conclude at the Yule Ball. Draco angrily reveals to Hermione a letter he received from his father saying how it's reached his ear that Draco hasn't been doing his duty to build alliances (hiding from his house mates) and worse has been seen consorting with a mudblood. It ends with a strong reminder that as the Malfoy heir he needs to be seen associating with the 'right sort' of people.

This leads to Draco inviting Hermione to the ball (Victor probably saw Draco hanging around with her and decided not to risk slighting someone who was clearly a powerful aristocratic pureblood), not as a date or even friends, but as a political ally. He'll show his father who he thinks the 'right sort' is (after all Lucius was the one who heckled him about Hermione having better grades) and Hermione can make a visible protest against segregation between traditional purebloods and Muggleborn.

In the end the clich√© of falling in love at the dance is replaced with becoming real friends as the two of them whisper and giggle to each other at the reactions their dancing together raises from the aristocratic crowd and Draco finds how he can be something besides a death eater without needing to become one of Harry Potter's loyal minions.

** Honestly, sounds pretty similar to Draco in my fic. A pureblood dies during CoS, which initiates his redemption arc. There is a riot at the World Cup, not by DEs, but by angry fans when Krum beats the muggleborn Irish seeker and wins Bulgaria the Cup.

Instead ot Hermione, Draco ends up with a halfblood girl that he'd picked on since they were kids (i just don't buy D/Hr; too fundamentally different, given that canon Draco likes wizarding culture and tradition, just not the violence and atrocities associated with defending it. Meanwhile, Hr wants to change a lot about the WW).
