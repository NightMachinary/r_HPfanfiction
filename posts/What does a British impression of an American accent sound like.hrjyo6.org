** Absolutely terrible. As a Brit, every time I've attempted to sound American I get laughed at because I sound western (or southern? I think western) and very exaggerated. On the other hand my accent occasionally slips and I sound American anyway, because I used to have a lot of American classmates and teachers. And then there's when anyone sings...

*** Brits tend to sound Southern. Like Tennessee southern. Not even exaggerated just thick. It depends of what comes to you mind when you think south. If you're thinking Georgia then yes it's going to sound exaggerated but if you think Alabama it tends to be perfect.

** Bad ones sound mixed up, like one word will be from Texas and the next one from Boston. I have to give credit where credit is due, though: Kate Winslet sounded EXACTLY like she was from Long Island in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I heard her natural British accent in an interview and was very surprised.

*** ... Are you being sarcastic? Or are you serious. I can't tell which. But yes, Americans have accents.
