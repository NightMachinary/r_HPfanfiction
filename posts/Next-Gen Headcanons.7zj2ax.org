  The Potter children are about to learn what it means to really be a family. Maybe getting stuck in an alternate universe can actually be beneficial. (CC-compliant)

** No canon pairings because honestly I cannot see either of them work. Hermione married another muggleborn or half blood since her views on magical culture just wouldn't sit right with most purebloods, not even on the light side. She chose work (composing a magical encyclopedia Britannica) over children and her daughter Rose is four by the time the others are at Hogwarts.

Harry ended up living with Tonks, who did not forgive her husband breaking the "in good and in bad times" part of his marriage vows. Harry wasn't interested in a relationship after living through the war and dying, Tonks was not interested in a relationship after the divorce and so they just became platonic friends, each helping the other heal. On nights out, they are each others wingman and they are rising Teddy together. They also have a "if we are both single by forty, we are getting married for tax reasons" deal.

There's no Scorpius Malfoy since Draco is enjoying the comforts of Azkaban Resort and Spa, which even without the dementors is a throughly unpleasant place (barren rock in the North Sea with a daft castle on top). Anyone with a Dark Mark ended up there, the inner circle having fallen in battle. Narcissa left for Italy, where she bought herself a villa and enjoys the good life.

With the Lestranges dead, Andromeda is raising her sisters daughter (without any Voldemort in the gene pool). Delphi and Teddy grew up as siblings, even though she is technically his aunt. They are best friends with Victorie and are all in Hufflepuff, which led to a rivalry with the younger, but more numerous Weasleys children from Percy, George (triplets) and Ron (who is happily married to Lavender Brown).

No story recs because there are next to none next gen stories without canon pairings.

*** I'm not seeking Weasley bashing... (Unless it's Angst Snivellus, bash him all you want). In my AU world, the couples actually work (since it's AU, I don't care if it makes them OC).

*** I am not sure how well Ron and Lavender work together...but i really agree on Hermiones, Harrys and Dracos future. Are you planning to use your headcanon in a fic ?

**** If anything it'll be a oneshot because I have my hands full with my other stories [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12774582/1/Dawn-of-Darkness][Dawn of Darkness]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12745758/1/No-longer-alone][No longer alone]]. I've written a few drafts with the next gen AU, but those turned out far too angsty.

***** All of my next-gen turn out angsty because CC ruined it so much for me. Until then I could pretend Albus Severus was a joke.

****** I can say the same about the epilogue. So many issues in just one chapter...
