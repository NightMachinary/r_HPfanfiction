Title, thanks


** Also super interested in this.

I read an amazing one once that wound up being abandoned but followers of the Old Ways had secret face tattoos and Harry learned about it while hiding in Knockturn Alley. (I think)

** linkffn(on the wings of a phoenix by makoyi). It's not a major element, but it's there. Daphne Greengrass's father is a "priest" of the religion, but it's mostly just a background worldbuilding element used in the cliche fashion to show that Harry is ignorant to the world that he's supposedly fighting for.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

** In my AU "Patron", the wizards "went back to our pagan roots" after the SoS went into effect since they scorned the Christian faith after the witch hunts. Although, after a thousand years of Christianity, they didn't really know their "pagan roots" any more, so their actual faith, which also evolved over the 300 years since, is not quite accurate. Also, while there are splinter groups - one whose members take religion seriously, for example - most simply do the big ceremonies, like calling on the gods at the start of a semester at Hogwarts, yet don't really believe in it - like most people in Western Europe treat religion these days.

*** That I'd awesome. I appreciate you actually considered true history but real world and according the HP when doing that.

The pagan thing can be fun, but as you said, before the statute the church would have done a good job of stamping it out. Hell, the catholic church probably had magical monks and monasteries.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Again and Again by Athey linkffn(8149841) has pagan ritual magic on All Hallows Eve and such, as do many of Atheys stories, but it's slash so not everyone's cup of tea. I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a try even if that's not your thing as it's a masterpiece

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
