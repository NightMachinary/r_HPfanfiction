I'm currently rereading (just finished) Goblet of Fire and was reminded yet again how burningly i wish Sirius survived the books. Can any of you recommend some good Sirius-fics, where he lives? I've read through all of Draco Trilogy simply because of Sirius... Every kind of fic is fine, both AU and almost-canon, Marauders fics (though Shoebox Project probably shaped some of my understanding of Sirius).


** I'm a huge fan of the Innocent series, where Sirius escapes prison when Harry is 8 years old and kidnaps/adopts, then has to go about proving his innocence. The author is on the third installment and so far it's excellent!

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** There's "Returned" by ladyseradereturns. Sirius returns from the veil, it's SB/HG though. I recall liking it, but I can't recall the plot.

The "Living With Danger" series is a complete AU that diverges right about the Voldemort 1981 attack with prominent Sirius (important character throughout).

Once FFN is back up and i can access my favs I can edit in more of Sirius being alive.

linkffn(Princess of the Black) by Silently Watches (Dark and adult themes) has him alive as well.

linkffn(Cold Blood) by DerLaCroix has a living Sirius too.

linkffn(Forging Destiny) and linkffn(Embracing Destiny) by White Angel of Avalon feautre Sirius as a main character.

I tend to not kill him myself, when I start a story before year 5.

  Going to class reunions was never on Vongola Decimo's agenda, but under the combined effort of his former class president and Reborn, Tsuna had no choice but to go. After all, what Reborn wants, Reborn always gets. But with the reunion just weeks before the Inheritance Ceremony, it would be hard to prove Murphy's Law wrong.
