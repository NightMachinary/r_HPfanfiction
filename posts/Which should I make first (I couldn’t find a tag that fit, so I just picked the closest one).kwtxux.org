I don't know whether I wanna do a “what if Voldemort never existed” fanfic, a “what if James and Lily had lived” fanfic, or a “Wolfstar raising Harry” fanfic, and so I'm asking Reddit. And please, for the love of god, don't say ‘do whichever one you feel like,' because *why the hell do you think I'm asking?* (I couldn't find a tag that fit, so I just picked the closest one)


** James and Lily live! There aren't enough of them, and I don't think I've ever found one that was complete.

** I'd say the 'What if James and Lily lived', has a lot of room for world building and breaking a bit away from canon.

** Please a “James and Lily live” without bashing or LordWTF!Harry, there are not nearly enough of those.

** Well, why not combine them? like Voldemort never existed, so Lily & James would live. Make them bad parents or some unique scenario that causes Wolfstar to raise Harry (either due to child services or good old kidnapping for the child's betterment trope). Like, if J&L end up missing (but eventually return) or somehow end up on a very long term patient at Saint Mungos (and may or may not be healed eventually)...

** If you make a James and Lily survived fic could you make Neville the BWL and have him be the main rival in Griffindor to Harry!
