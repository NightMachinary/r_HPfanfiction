Primarily a Request post, but could also serve as a Prompt if need be.

I would like to read a fanfic where a wizard, not necessarily one of the established characters, goes on globe-spanning missions and gets into all kinds of weird hijinks on his mission to defeat, I dunno, some Dark Wizard that isn't Voldemort? This all came after I read /Imposter Complex, (/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/The-Imposter-Complex]]) where a Diary Riddle escapes and goes on a globe-trotting adventure to retrieve his Horcruxes because things have /seriously/ gone out of hand. The whole 'take over Britain by force' was totally /not/ Riddle's plans to begin with, and came after Voldemort went insane after too many Horcruxes.


** I've written "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis", where the trio are Curse-Breakers searching for Atlantis, which turns into a globe-trotting adventure where they also fight against a dark wizard who isn't Voldemort. It's more Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider than James Bond, but they do have to infiltrate/break into various locations.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

  "Let's cut the bullshit..." interjected Kingsley "You are here representing SHIELD a quasi military intelligence organisation that is so suspect that I wouldn't touch it with a six foot broomstick under normal circumstances..." An international magic/muggle operation sets an unlikely couple on a desperate race to keep an ancient source of terrible power out of the hands of HYDRA.
