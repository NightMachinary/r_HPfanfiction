I've heard it mentioned a few times but I don't know.


** It's a series, starting with linkffn(Living with Danger). I think it has 5 or 6 books. It's... Alright. I only read the first and partway through the second, I just lost interest.

** The premise is that Hermione has a 20-years-older sister nicknamed "Danger" who has a magical ability to control Remus's werewolf form, and they raise Harry and Hermione together. (This is all in about the first two chapters.) There are five stories in the main series, which is about 50% longer than the books, so it's a long haul.

On the pro side, the series goes into a lot of interesting deep magic and has pretty good plotting, and I thought the first two stories were entertaining. However, starting with the third one (and even the first two in retrospect) the constant juxtaposition of saccharine sweet and soul-crushing horror was too much for me to take, and I just skipped to the end.

** Hermione has an older sister named Gertrude (goes by the nickname "Danger") who raises her after their parents' deaths, and ends up meeting Remus and then taking Harry.

** It's an AU that starts out (IIRC) shortly after James and Lily die. Has some original characters, interesting takes on magic, and a kinda slow pace. There's like six-ish 'books' and a handful of one shots that help build up that universe.

** linkffn(2109424) starts with this I think? I've never read it myself.
