I'm reading 'The Handbook of Elf Psychology' right now, and it made me crave more stories where house elfs play a part, and not just as helpless victims.


** I once read a Dobby/Sorting hat crack fic. But that was quite disturbing. Can't recommend.

**** It was graphic enough for me. I should also mention that the sorting hat wasn't really into it.

****** I was trying to find it but it must've been deleted otherwise I would've linked it here but I will keep looking maybe I can find it again. I personally didn't find it very hot, but I suppose if raping hats is your cup of tea it's really hot.

******* Honestly; I have little interest in sexual relations with any kind of garment, be it consensual or not.

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.

**** No.

Harry returned to the past, into Dobby's body. So there's still that timeline's Harry.

It's sort of "Harry becomes his own Elf."

** I like Draco Malfoy, King of the House Elves [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/287633]] They sort of start out as helpless victims but get to the point they are pretty self reliant.

"After the war, Draco finds his own path toward redemption, with a little help from his major domo. "

*Dobby House Elf and the Popular Culture*

Harry makes the mistake of letting people around an impressionable poor house elf. Dobby takes his obsessions a little too seriously. Rating for violence. Yes, violence. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6443341/1/Dobby-House-Elf-and-the-Popular-Culture]] it gets a little strange but still fun.
