** Hermione is the most important person, and everyone would be dead without her.

Now I have a few things I disagree with. First, voldemort has no way of getting the stone from the mirror without harry. Second, voldemort would probably delay his return like after the fifth book since he had less followers at this point than three years later.

*** You can say the same for everyone. Without Ron they would have never cleared the giant chess-set or have convenient access to a brother who is a dragon tamer.

And without Harry they wouldn't be doing anything at all most of the time.

**** I think it's pretty clear Hermione was more important though.

** u/Teh_Warlus:
#+begin_quote
  Three days later and for no apparent reason whatsoever, Voldemort fully returned to power and made his first public appearance.

I giggled like a schoolgirl. Awesome ending.

** The maths on the last one is off. If Hermione isn't in Gryffindor she doesn't lose them 50 points sending Norbert off with Charlie. Although, lets be honest she was probably still in positive points for Gryffindor after that escapade anyway.

*** Yeah it just got hard to calculate since most of the ACTUAL schooling is omitted in the books in favor of adventure highlighting. I took some creative liberties.

**** Oh course! The maths just sprung out at me when I read it. Kids at Hogwarts must be really naughty to have the houses end up with scores below 500. In PoA Lupin hands out about 80 points in 1 lesson.
