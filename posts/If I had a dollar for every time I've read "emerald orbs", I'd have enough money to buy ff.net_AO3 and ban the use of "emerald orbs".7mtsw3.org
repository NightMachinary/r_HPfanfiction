WE KNOW WHAT COLOUR HARRY'S EYES ARE, YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY IT EVERY 4 SENTENCES. every time I come along "emerald orbs" in a fic, I have an unholy urge to aggressively exit the browser plsssss stop using those words Thank you


** Harry's emerald orbs were sparkling.

Ron looked at the narration above, then back at Harry's eyes, "Huh. They don't look sparkly to me."

"Ron, it's not talking about his eyes," Hermione pointed downwards, "it means those down there."

Ron looked down at Harry's pants and raised a confused eyebrow.

"No, I mean the gobstones on the floor!"

"Ohh..." Ron said with dawning realisation, before turning his (and the narrative's) attention to the ground in front of them; Harry was engaged in a simple game of gobstones with another of the (unnamed) Gryffindors, and his shining green emerald gobstones were easily distinguished from the gold-and-scarlet ones of his opponent's.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
