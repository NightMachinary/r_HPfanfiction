I need something to cheer me up. No need to recommend black comedy or 7th horcrux.

  No need to recommend
#+end_quote

Is that because you dislike them, or just because you're familiar with them?

I'll mention linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629]]) since no-one else has yet.

#+begin_quote
  /Dear Professor Snape,/

  /I know you do not like to be bothered during the summer holidays, but I thought I would/

  Harry crumpled up the note and started over.

  /Dear Professor Snape,/

  /I achieved an Outstanding on my Potions OWL, as instructed. I hope your summer is/

  Harry tore that one in half. Hedwig, sitting on her perch, hooted at him.

  “I'm working on a letter for Professor Snape, Hedwig. I'll have it for you in a minute.”

  /Dear Professor Snape,/

  /How are you? I am fine. I hope you are recovered. I was pleased to receive my OWL results and look forward to seeing you at Hogwarts/

  Harry studied that one, then crumpled it up too. Hedwig, bored, soared out the window.

  /Dear Evil Nose,/

  /I got an Outstanding on my potions OWL, so you're stuck with me. Everyone has been asking me how I am, and I look forward to returning to school so you can tell me I'm being an idiot. I've been trying to figure out what to put in a letter to you for an hour and this is sadly my best attempt, which I am now going to ritually burn./

  /My last myrtle potion demonstrated that if you're overenthusiastic about the tapping it explodes amusingly on the unwitting student./

  /Harry/

  Harry crumpled it into a ball and threw it out the window, where Hedwig caught it and flew away.

  Harry made a noise approximately like ‘gnk.'

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  “So, I was thinking---” Neville cut off, causing Harry to peer up curiously. Neville's eyes were narrowed on the flower, small frown marring his features. “Oh, how rude.” “What's rude? It's just a flower. Strange, since Malfoy sent it to me. Do you think he was cursed? I mean, it's not like him to be nice.” Neville snorted, mouth twitching rapidly. “No, it's not,” He agreed readily. “Malfoy sending this makes perfect sense though. The flower means, Beauty is your only attraction."- Or... the one where Harry and Draco have a flower war. Their tamest fight yet to date as they trade silent insults, cutting barbs and even a few compliments sprinkled in.

Following that, everyone expected him to become an auror.

  First year at Hogwarts is a time for self discovery, making friends, and possibly starting yourself on a horrible downward spiral where your exceptional abilities alienate yourself from everyone around you. Harry Potter, for reasons he's personally curious about, cannot seem to die or even be hurt. Draco Malfoy has been dealt the cruel hand by fate to have so little magical power as to be barely better than a squib. Hermione Granger is a deaf natural legilimens. And Ron Weasley has been inducted into the ultra-selective society known as the Sparrowkeet Lounge. One stop down the line is still a long way from canon.
