All I remember is:

- 7th year post-war? Or maybe AU with no war?
- Severus gets blasted out of the castle by a magical accident, everyone thinks he's dead
- He's in the Forbidden Forest, naked & wandless, and is found by a unicorn. He says that for all his life, unicorns have been drawn to him. He's like unicorn crack.
- He names the unicorn Bob
- Against Dumbledore's orders, Hermione takes off into the forest to save Severus

I've tried googling various things, but I'm getting too many results and I can't remember anything that's unique to this story. Anyone know the title?

Thanks!


** Now I want to read it too. Is there anything unique in the summary of this fic? For example, do you remember if it has the word unicorn in the summary, it's over 20,000 words, and/or it has Hermione and Snape in the tags? It'll help narrow it down if you can.

*** I found it! "Naked Journey" by PlaidPooka. I found it on The Petulant Poetess, not sure if it's posted anywhere else.

*** I don't remember the summary at all.

Other pieces I can remember: Severus, still wandless, had to fight off a hag (or maybe a banshee?). Dumbles threatened to expell H if she left the castle. H made some sort of tracking device to find Snape (blood or hair plus map, maybe?)

It was medium-length, for fanfiction.

I wish I could remember something unique to the story.
