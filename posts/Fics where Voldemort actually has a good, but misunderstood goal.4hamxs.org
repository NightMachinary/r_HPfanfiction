  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

** I'd like to see this too- I've seen fics where most muggles are depicted as uncaring or cruel- mostly harsh abused harry fics- fics where harry comes down against muggles or muggle borns for some reason or another, but never a good Voldemort was right fic- but from his point of view, maybe he was right.

It's been implied in a number of fics that he may not have been born evil, that his trophies burned by Dumbledore were from people that bullied him- that the suspicion and distrust from Dumbledore, being a halfblooded- presumed for a while muggle born in slythern all lead to his choices- to torture the pure blooded slytherns while killing the muggles and muggle lovers- and his hate of Dumbledore who kept sending back to the abusive muggles in a time that England was in turmoil.

The only fic that I know of that implies any of this that I can remember is a short oneshot, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/Doubting-Thomas][Doubting Thomas]], which despite the short length I highly recommend.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the descent into darkness)

Voldemort is still pretty evil, but his goals seem somewhat understandable and Dumbledore is shown to be more like the bad guy. However, I should warn you, there is some yaoi.

  When Voldemort attacked he didn't kill Lily and James. When he met his downfall they mistook Harry's twin as the GWL, they send their son away to the Dursleys but he doesn't quite make it in to the Dursley's loving care. Harry will take Hogwarts and his 'family' by storm and by the time the 'light' realize their mistake it will be too late for them to fix. OOC!Dark!Powerful!Harry.
