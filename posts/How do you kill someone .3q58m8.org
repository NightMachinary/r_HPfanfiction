I don't remember reading a fanfic where a main character was killed or died.

How do you kill a character ? How do you avoid making the fic plunge into a melodrama feast ?

If you have any recommandation of good fanfics where there are non minor deaths I am extremely curious to see how it is handled


** I am very, /very/ glad that you elaborated on your title. I don't think that this particular subreddit would have been the appropriate place to share murder tips, unless it required meticulous horcrux removal.

As to your actual question, I point you tentatively to linkffn(Recnac Transfaerso), and, more particularly, linkffn(Alternate Ending to Recnac Transfaerso). It's very angsty stuff, of course, but it's the most memorable fic in the suicidal!Harry genre.

** I kill them in very different ways. Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly, sometimes off-screen. As to avoid plunging the fic into melodrama, that's often handled in the reactions to the death, not the death itself.

*** Agreed - it's all about the reactions. I give time for the fallout, but I'm always aware of moments to pull the story back in. I fake-killed a major character [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?chapterid=486123&i=1][here]] in the height of a kidnapping rescue, but I think it would've been fairly similar even if it wasn't fake. It impacts each character - differently - but they're still in a life-or-death situation. And later I real-kill another character (end of chapter), which gets it own emotional fallout peppered through the rest of the story, but it was easier as it only directly affects one of the characters.

** Depends on the effect you want to achieve. Some deaths will be signaled to the reader far ahead of time so that when they finally happen, the emotional fall-out is already somewhat cushioned and doesn't impact the narrative as much.

Or a death can be a gut-punch, unexpected and explosive.

Or it can happen offstage, with the protagonist's reaction being the important point. (Maeglin Yedi, for instance, has Ron and Hermione die offscreen in "The Soul Adores," and Harry's muted response is a measure of how far Tom Riddle has come in corrupting him and changing his moral landscape.)

Or you can have deaths happen in quick succession, too fast for the emotional aftermath to sink in. JKR does this, actually, and I admit it's not my favorite technique, because it often feels as if the emotional complexity is scanted, and the deaths fall flatter than they ought to.

Or it can happen at the end, as the culmination of the character's destiny/plot arc/whatever. Which might mean we never get to see how it hurts or relieves or saddens the other characters, because the story ends once the MC is dead.

I'm not against melodrama on principle, btw. Sometimes scenery-chewing is exactly what you want, which potentially sets up the next scene to be retrospective or a total contrast or a numb silence in which you can practically hear the dust settling. It's up to the writer to control it.

(I may be biased, because I've written a very melodramatic death scene involving fake identities and wrong-headed vengeance, a potion-maddened son and suspicious circumstantial evidence, so it's all very overblown and high-pitched. If nothing else, I hope it's cathartic. The next section shifts immediately to the afterlife, so the story doesn't actually lose the MC (therefore undercutting the previous melodrama), and the mood changes as the story starts wrapping up its plot threads.)

*** Thanks for the answer. I really like the afterlife idea, I didn't encounter it much so far, it may be extremely useful to conclude a fic indeed

**** I'm always happy to talk about craft. It's interesting to see how different writers approach the same problem.

And good luck solving your death issues.

** linkffn(Forging the Sword) is an excellent story where Harry is forced to make the decision to kill Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets. It has realistic, in character ways that every single character reacts to it, and I'd love more stories where one of the many traumatic events Harry goes through during his schooling actually triggers a desire to learn magic properly.
