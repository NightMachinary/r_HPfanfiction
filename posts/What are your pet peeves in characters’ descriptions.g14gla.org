And I'm not talking about ‘orbs' and things like that but about how fic authors' description of character divergence from your personal view.

For example, I'm always a little annoyed when Malfoys described as having blue/blue-grey eyes. They're grey! Just grey. /Really/ grey eyes are much more rare then blue eyes, you know. I also don't like when Hermione mentioned to have big breasts and wide hips, because even before the movies and Emma Watson I always imagined her to be on petite, smaller side.

*** Especially since this is not what's described in the books.

Ginny is described as having flaming red hair, like the rest of the Weasleys, and bright brown eyes. She's also described as small for her age.

Lily has dark red hair, emerald eyes, and since her height is never commented on, we can reasonably assume she's at least of average height.

Ginny and Lily look no more alike than Seamus Finnagin and Draco Malfoy.

*** Canonically, though, Hermione /is/ described as beautiful. Not every time, of course, but the scene at the Yule Ball is a pretty marking one.

Otherwise, I think the other qualifier I'd put on your notion there is that having it be stunningly, effortlessly beautiful with everyone agreeing/viewing it that way can be a bit much - but if it's describing it towards the person that the MC/POV character is falling in love with and people around aren't reacting the same way, it's a bit different.

(To use Hermione as an example again, it's the difference between a Harry/Hermione pairing where Harry is falling and love and finds her breathtakingly beautiful, but everyone else treats her the same and one where all of Hogwarts thinks she's incredibly beautiful. )

** Marauders, definitely. James is described as 'tall' by Voldemort, who was (along with Dumbledore) disgustingly tall for anyone, so he must have been above average. Then there's Sirius, who's described as a tall man in more than one instance, and taller than Snape, who's taller than Narcissa, who's tall for a woman, so contrary to popular fanon Sirius isn't in fact average or under average, but /tall/. I doubt he is a 6'3 or 6'4 giant, but still pretty tall. Remus's height is never commented on, so I assume it wasn't such a remarkable feature of his, so he might be average. Then there's Pettigrew, who's pretty short.

In the Ressurection stone scene, Harry is the same height as James but the proof that Sirius is taller than both is that Harry described Sirius as 'tall and handsome'. So Sirius is taller than James, who's likely taller than Remus who is definitely taller than Pettigrew.

“he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man” - Prisoner of Azkaban, Ch. 17

“He was rather taller than Snape” - Order of the Phoenix, Ch. 24

“To Sirius's right stood Pettigrew, more than a head shorter, plump, and watery-eyed” - Deathly Hallows, Ch. 10

“Sirius was tall and handsome and younger by far than Harry had seen him in life.” - Deathly Hallows, Ch. 34

This isn't up to debate, Sirius is tall. You might notice that I'm oddly repetitive about this but I am tired of small, furious Sirius who doesn't have any other defining traits. Sirius is the tallest marauder, most probably. So Sirius > James > Remus > Peter.

If you want him to be taller than other characters, he sort of has to be. There are a lot of characters who are tall... James/Harry, Dumbledore, Voldemort, Arthur, Ron etc.

I think this is another Rowling is bad with numbers type problem... Fred and George have to (a) shrink to be Harry's "tall" height whilst also being (b) stocky. Tall and stocky is... well, to still look stocky you've got to be increasingly broad as you get tall.

Harry is short in books 1-3, average height in book 4, tallish in book 5, and tall in 6-7. He is always thin.

Ginny looks as much like Lily as Harry looks like Snape, who is hideous from every angle.

Also, not really character specific, but I have a limit for the number times a character's eyes can be mentioned. Ex. Dumbledore's twinkling eyes, Harry's emerald orbs.

**** Yeah, very much this. Based on how we know wizards and witches age, combined with how people look nowadays (thank you, skin care routines), I would imagine McGonagall to look like a thirty-something woman, maybe with a few wrinkles on her face from having the same expression all the time but definitely not an old lady. Snape, likewise, should be looking like someone in his twenties.

The one older people there whose movie depictions were in any way accurate were, I would say, Sirius and Peter. Both have really good reasons to look beyond their ages because of their experiences (Azkaban and a long-term rat trip). Remus doesn't, however, as I would say he should look just a bit beyond it and tired and resignated rather than the forty/fifty-something look he has in the movies.

  Excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach: it was as though he was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes. James's eyes were hazel, his nose was slightly longer than Harry's and there was no scar on his forehead, but they had the same thin face, same mouth, same eyebrows; James's hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harry's did, his hands could have been Harry's and Harry could tell that, when James stood up, they would be within an inch of each other in height.

** Agreed on the Malfoy eye colour. Outside of that, my biggest peeve would be when (usually male) characters are described as improbably tall - as if they had a giant growth spurt after Hogwarts - or super broad when they'd previously been described as normally sized or thin. It /could/ be justified in the text but usually it just feels like a way to push the character towards a certain masculine/romantic ideal.

I was taller than most guys in 7th grade (which would be second year) and then suddenly when I came back for 8th I remember being shorter than a lot of them. I saw this trend continue as my little cousins have gotten older, too. And you can see it in the movies where puberty has obviously smacked the entire cast in the face between CoS and PoA.

*** I think the case could be argued for James.\\
The books are mainly said from Harry point of view, and the character described as good looking are the one /he/ consider good looking. And Harry rarely describe himself (well I remember one in PS but he was really young there). Also,I don't see a teenager look into a mirror and thinks "Damn, you look good" (well unless this character is McLaggen but I kinda imagine him as the frat bro of Harry Potter and even there, there is a risk than fanfics corrupted my vision of the character).\\
Anyways, since Harry is said to look a lot like James, and that Harry could be good looking (not sure if Rowling ever said he was, he is rather popular with girls but it could just be because he is seeker and wizarding Jesus), James may be good looking.

Remus and Pettigrew are just normal though, maybe good looking but not too much (Harry has some high standard, there are like 10 "good looking" people in all the 7 books according to him).

**** Okay, so I've been trying to write a canon compliant fic and the heights of the characters was something that was really getting to me because of some of the stuff we were talking about. ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g14gla/what_are_your_pet_peeves_in_characters/fneb1gb/][See here]].)

To my mind, I've generally thought of Harry as being on the shorter side... probably because of the movies but also because the the whole seeker thing. And, yet, he's meant to be tall. Thus, I have based him on my brother who was this tiny little scrawny thing for ages but is now 184cm (i.e. just over 6'). Thus, in principle, I have put Harry at 182cm (just under 6').

(I think this works because these are set in the 1990s and while my brother doesn't feel "particularly" tall, if we move back twenty years earlier I'm sure he would've. Now, sure, there is almost an inch between 182 and 184cm but it's good enough.)

The next problem is that Fred and George are meant to be taller than Harry and stocky. I'd always envisioned them as being on the short side. But since Harry's got to be tall, Fred and George are obviously going to have to be very solid units. They also need to be sufficiently taller than Harry to noticeably shrink. So, why not make them 187cm (just shy of 6'2")?

This leaves us with the question of the rest of the family.

We know Arthur and Ron are tall. And I'm pretty sure Bill's meant to be as well. Given we never get the impression Fred and George are tall, I take that to mean they're shorter than Arthur. The problem is, if they're 6'2" there can't be all that much in it, otherwise there'd surely be more emphasis of Arthur's height. Thus, let's put him at 192cm (just shy of 6'4").

Right, so let's talk about Molly for a little bit. She's meant to be short. So, let's take that to mean shorter than Rowling (who's apparently 165cm) because, honestly, people are terrible at judging heights and we've already got this weird Harry/Weasley twins height situation which makes me think Rowling's no different in this regard. Given that Molly's short but not tiny and lives in a world where everyone is tall, I think it's reasonable to suggest something like 161cm (5'3") for her. This is, [[https://www.you.co.uk/new-study-says-attractive-height-men-women/][apparently, the real world average height for contemporary British women]] but, again, everyone is tall in Harry Potter except Mundungus, Molly and Ginny so I think it works.

Okay, right ,so if Ginny's described as being short in, iirc, OOTP that probably means she's a short adult. In my experience, girls don't usually grow too much more than they are around 14-16 and [[https://www.google.com/search?q=when+do+women+reach+their+adult+height&rlz=1C1CHBF_enNZ889NZ889&oq=when+do+women+reach+their+adult+height&aqs=chrome..69i57.5479j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8][a quick Google search suggests this impression is correct.]] Now, I think it actually works best if Ginny's even shorter than her mother. Let's go with 156cm (5'1").

Now... let's go back to the remaining boys. We'll make Charlie Harry's height because they're both seekers. And Percy can be roughly equidistant between the twins and their dad. Which leaves Bill and Ron... who's meant to be taller? I decided to go with 6'5" and 6'4" respectively.

***** Harry's height is kinda confusing. He's James height who's described as tall but this passage from Magic is Might contradicts that.

"We don't know who he is," Hermione said, passing Harry several curly black hairs, "but he's gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he's pretty tall, you'll need bigger robes ..."

She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry retired to take the potion and change.

Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and, from what he could tell from his well-muscled arms, powerfully built. He also had a beard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the other two.

"Blimey, that's scary," said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now towered over him.

Hermione noted that Harry should get new robes because of Runcorn's height, which is described as over 6 feet tall. That gives us a range from 5'10" to 6'4" for Harry's height.

**** Hey, I've answered your first question in some other comments in this thread but I think he was probably on the shorter side when he was 11 and then he grew, as one does. He was probably still reasonably skinny through his Hogwarts years, unlike someone like the Oliver wood or the Weasley twins, who were described as stocky. That would make him suitable for the seeker position, presumably even after he grew.

** Don't just describe hair colour, eye colour and whatever generic stuff. Find something that sticks out a bit, that makes the reader remember the character better, especially if it's a non-canon character.

For canon characters it always annoys me that people describe Harry as short. He might have been in the first few books, but in book 5 he is as tall as James, and in a flashback (book 7 I think) Voldemort describes James as tall. And Voldemort is tall himself, which might contribute to his impression of James.

** Generally, the only pet peeve that really bothers me enough to be called a Peeve is when writers describe female characters in ways that would very easily be featured in that [[/r/menwritingwomen][r/menwritingwomen]] sub. But on the other hand, it's usually stupid enough to make me laugh at the inanity/ridiculousness of it, so I don't know if I'd really call that a Peeve either. Everything else I can skate over and just picture the character however I want if it's not something I like.

** Snape is not good looking. I always figured his looks problems stemmed mostly from a lack of hygiene, so if he for whatever reason had a reason to clean up (some love interest/whatever), he would probably look /better/ and with a lot of work from a friend who knows his/her stuff he might actually look decent, but his looks would remain rather average at best.

I've never been able to take fics that describe how good looking he is seriously. I guess this stems from people with a hard-on for Alan Rickman?

And Ginny's only shared trait with Lily in looks is both being redheads. She does not look like her otherwise, and they don't even have the same shade of red hair.

*** While "some" of Snape less attractive traits may be changed with some effort, like his sallow skin or his greassy hairs, some would need a lot more work if not surgery.

I mean, uneven yellow teeth? Do the magicals have a spell for that or would he need to see a dentist for years? And no matter the rest, a large hooked nose is rarely a complementary trait.

I also funny how some fics describe Snape as low key really fit under his loose robe, usually the same kind of fic that talk about Harry's "Quidditch toned body".

** My biggest pet peeve is really just repeated descriptions of the same features in similar ways (eg, one reference to green orbs is fine, twenty in a chapter is too much)

Character wise, having greatly different appearances from canon for Harry, Ron, and Hermione is a tough one to stomach - particularly since they have pretty varied appearances throughout the books and movies, so it should be pretty easy to go with at least one there.

I don't recall if Lily's height is every mentioned, though.
