Just looking for something to keep my mind occupied while I wait for some of my WIPs to update.


** You probably already know of it but my favorite is Before the Fawn, its mainly a Jily romance but there are PLENTY of fighting and details about the first world war. I love it!

*** I don't already know it! I want to read them during the war because most of the James/Lily ship fanfics paint their relationship in a really obnoxious way. Mostly a much to bitchy and annoying Lily. Thanks for the reccomendation!

**** Well just a heads up the first 10 chapters or so really is that but once she gives in then it really focuses on the war, even a little bit before she does but you have to read the first few in order to get over high school Lily.
