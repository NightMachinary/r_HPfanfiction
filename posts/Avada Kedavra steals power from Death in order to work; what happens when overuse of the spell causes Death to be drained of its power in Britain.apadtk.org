Avada Kedavra is not a Killing Curse. It is a spell to steal power from Death.\\
It is a spell to take the power to escort the spirits of the departed to the afterlife, and use it to banish the souls of the still living into the beyond.\\
Invented in ancient times, first seen in Egypt, those magicians who could cast the spell knew to use it sparingly, only against the most terrible of creatures whom no other magic could touch.\\
Death has only so much hold in the realms of mortals, after all. If mortals frivolously consume its power, it would not be able to escort the souls of the newly dead to the other side.

Millennia have passed, now. When the ancient empires fell, so too did the knowledge of why Avada Kedavra was forbidden, even when the spell itself was rediscovered and used by dark wizards.\\
Now, in Magical Britain, consumed by civil war, perhaps only Voldemort himself truly understands how his favourite spell, the so-called Killing Curse works. He uses it freely regardless, taking pleasure in knowing that he is strong enough to take power away from Death.\\
The other Death Eaters savour using the spell too, not knowing or caring to know where the magic for their favourite instantly-killing, shield piercing spell comes from.

We open the curtain at the time the Battle of Hogwarts commences; Voldemort brings his army, the defenders of Britain's magical school prepare themselves to hold out until reinforcements can turn the tide.\\
The fighting is ferocious; green rays of light flying everywhere, basilisk gazes sweeping away dozens of fighters at a time...until they don't.\\
Despite calls of 'Avada Kedavra', despite the great serpents swinging their heads around, no-one is instantly falling dead anymore on either side. Mortal wounds are ignored, spectres rise from shattered and burnt corpses, ghostly soldiers raise their intangible wands and continue to fling curses.\\
Death is exhausted, the many castings of Avada Kedavra having sapped its power, and the departed spirits are simply not departing...and they aren't particularly interested in letting the Dementors on the field eat them either.

** This is a Good Ending.

You can end Death forever just by having people cast AK at some rocks regularly.

*** "And so, based on this improbable discovery, we developed a kind of magic device to constantly fire Death-draining magic at an easily repairable target. By placing them all around the world, as long as we use up this 'Death's' energy whenever it shows up, the entire world population is essentially immortal! Perhaps reduced to spectres in some cases, but immortal! And not only that, but we've just developed the ability to bridge the gap between worlds and bring back the long departed, so you can be reunited with your grandparents and long-dead ancestors!"

"But what happens if someone turns into another Dark Lord and there's no way to kill them? Or someone brings the dark lords of ages past back to life? Or, unlife?"

"FOOLISH WIZARDS! SEVENTY-SEVEN OF US DARK LORDS HAVE JOINED FORCES TO FORM THE EVIL LEAGUE OF DARKNESS! And you can bet we'll be using the Imperius and other mind-control magicks."

"Halt, evildoers! For we are eighty-four of the greatest heroic magicians in history, and we will foil your evil schemes!"

And thus the Earth became a place of forever war, as the living dead battled, good vs evil, for eternity.\\
It wasn't so bad, though, most people could deal by burying themselves somewhere with a magically everlasting pantry of snacks and an internet connection.

**** Obliviation and reeducation would provide victory conditions, albeit morally squicky ones.

Alternately, at least some of the Dark Lords probably are only so because they want concrete things, some of which are trivial to provide in a post-scarcity utopia.

Hell, even Voldemort really needed some really good therapy and not ripping his soul apart.

*** Good end? The Harry Potter universe has a rewarding afterlife.

In this scenario, they're now stuck on earth as spirits for eternity. Seems like a massive downgrade to me.

**** - There is insufficient evidence from what is observed in canon for that. Everything can easily be explained by hallucinations and ghosts, and the ghosts have never spoken of that which comes after, or even given any detail to how they remained.

- Besides, even if there is an eternal afterlife, it is not as good as eternal earthly existence if there are things one can do in the latter that one cannot do in the former, like have children. (For that matter, the afterlife /I/ believe in IRL amounts to a backup server God maintains for our minds until we figure out how to do immortality to ourselves.)

- The ritual of Bone, Flesh, and Blood indicates that it is possible to at least construct functional homunculi for earthbound spirits, and bind them to them to function as usual.

- Even without the aid of magic, we could clone humans if we really wanted to.

- With the aid of magic, we can use Muggle cloning methods to clone the bodies of the just-deceased, or just borrow and combine DNA from their relatives (e.g. basically do in vitro, but bind the spirit to it), and bind each spirit to a new fully-functional body.

- Going forwards, people will simply preserve some of their cells in multiply-redundant banks, and whenever they experience body death, they'll just show up in spirit-form to the nearest kiosk (which will be constructed all over the world, and enchanted to make them easy for disembodied spirits to reach and use), and order up a new body.

***** Harry's soul literally went to limbo and came back.

That's a gargantuan assumption. It's not as good as existing on Earth because you think there are things you can't do there that you can do here. Says who? Not to mention even if that's true, it's equally possible that you're missing out on infinitely more if you stayed here.

That's been done for someone with a horcrux, but we've got no evidence that it's possible for a ghost. Even if it is, you're still stuck on earth instead of being in the afterlife.

****** - There is no evidence of that - nothing Dumbledore says is information that Harry did not already have, or was readily apparent from such. Nothing differentiates that from a standard dream or hallucination.

- In the absence of evidence either way, I prefer to stay here. I am confident even IRL that we can construct a heaven on earth, and in HP-verse, with magic... even more so! Besides, if I am wrong, then we can only have a finite span in this universe anyway - 10^{10^{120}} years, at most, before entropy completely wins, by the most optimistic estimates. At that point, everything dies or is already dead, and we're in your scenario. Since it's unending, a delay of even 10^{10^{120}} years is trivial. Thus, it is logical to strive to make the most of this world as per my words, if only to hedge our bets. (Since AK must be cast regularly to stave off death in this scenario, once there is insufficient energy left in the universe to cast it (because even if the power comes from death, the mind casting it needs energy to think it and stuff), death will return at that time).

- Since the Horcrux works by tying the soul to a physical object, so that it cannot move on, it is reasonable that since the premise is that these souls can't move on, similar principles apply.

******* That interaction did helpfully inform him of what happened. There's Voldemort's mangled soul shard, he's staying here and it sucks to be him, you're going back.

I'm not trying to prove this in a court of law or write a peer reviewed article. If you truly think that it was a hallucination or something, go ahead. Doesn't change the fact that, IIRC, it was very clearly written that he did indeed go to Limbo.

If you'd prefer that, fair enough. But keeping that going means forcing everyone else to experience the same fate. Literally removing everybody's ability to die. Also I think that you're risking more than you know. It's possible you'd be stuck in some intangible existence indefinitely, or that there's some other awful consequence of having billions-trillions+ of souls build up in one place. Who knows.

I think there's still a significant difference. Voldemort's soul was bound to the physical plane, where these souls are being blocked from moving on. Without a horcrux to hold them "in place", maybe they'd go unstable and disperse. Maybe Dementors will go on an absolute frenzy at the slightest whiff of an unbound and free roaming soul.

** Well, here's to everyone in this thread forgetting that sometimes death is a kinder option than life. Imagine someone whose body has failed them, forced to live on in agony. Someone could be tortured endlessly, without the kind embrace of death for freedom. What happens when people don't die in regards to resources? Does this affect all life in Britian or just humans?

*** Tangential, but I came up with an idea for a Grim Reaper themed superhero...maybe they could be called Gentle Repose.\\
They'd actually be all pacifistic and nice and gentle and egalitarian and compassionate and et-cetera, with lines like "It is outside my domain to do harm. I merely provide relief and succor to the wounded and weary." and "Rich or poor, good or evil, it matters not. I offer my hand equally to all."\\
And one time before that I came up with an empowered-by-Anubis superhero who basically went "My job is to ensure the dead rest in peace, and the only thing separating the living and the dead is time, so I'm going to help people so that when they die they rest in peace." and Anubis is all like "What, you thought that was a loophole? Go right ahead."

Also-also, I thought of a campaign setting for D&D/Pathfinder/etc, inspired by Majesty 2; basically when your heroes die in that game, you can recall them to life from a graveyard or from a gate to hell, and enemy spawners on the map keep resurrecting foes until you destroy them.\\
I came up with a cosmological concept where you have the mortal world, which is normal and high-fantasy-ish, and the otherworld, which is places like heaven and hell and quite a bit more loose with the rules of mortality (plus a spirit world, a chaos realm of concepts, etc). And that basically even if someone were killed in the mortal realm, their spirit would just be returned to the otherworld and they could make their way back to the mortal world to try again.\\
The question, though, why bother to live in the mortal world when you have to deal with things like hunger and illness and aging, the answer is basically 'freedom', because big nasty monsters and tyrants and such in the mortal world are much easier to kill (and thus, banish back to the otherworld). So when a part of the otherworld is controlled by a mighty demon or long-lasting dynasty or something, the little guys like goblins and humans go to the mortal world instead (repeatedly) to try their luck at raising an army or a kingdom or whatever.

As for your actual question...I was thinking the lack of Death would be limited to parts of Britain, specifically those areas where Avada Kedavra and basilisks and other normally-instant-death things roam? It would probably affect all life in those affected areas, though, or more specifically all life with souls, so that's probably humans, magical creatures, most pets, maybe even some plants and insects depending on how a soul works or whatever. Probably not bacteria or individual cells unless you want to write a story about ghostly amoebas made up of uncountable amounts of microorganisms covering the place in thick ghostly ectoplasmic mist.\\
And yes, a problem with no Death is that people can't accidentally die under torture, so you can be as cruel as you want. And lots of people will probably experience agonising starvation until they turn into emaciated mummies.\\
(Also also, can you imagine if Death turned off throughout the entire universe because it was overused in one spot on one planet? That would confuse and terrify the heck out of aliens for sure...like the Thanos snap, except instead of half of everything suddenly disintegrating, everything stops dying.)

** Definitely liking the concept! Apart from your original prompt, I think it would be really cool to see the origin of this curse in detail. It's invention and so forth. Maybe it was originated with the other unforgivables? Seeing how it was first created and originally used. A ritual... a dance with death that first conjured the power of the killing curse. Maybe there's a story of ancient wizards who used it for good. Destroying beasts like leviathan, basilisks and so forth. Bring it around to corruption and users of dark magic... leading to its forgotten origin and how it became banned as an unforgivable curse in the first place. Create and build your own characters. maybe tie it in with pure-blood lines of the peverells... to hogwarts and ilvermorny founders ever. Seeing as in the tale of the three brothers... they literally meet death and perhaps the one with the elder wand not only received a wand of immense power but also create the darkest of curses. Although peverells were living in the 1200s... so perhaps the curses were first create far before in more ancient times... Only the story will tell. Origin stories leave lots of room for creating your own story and i believe with accurate research and an excellent writer... it could be something beyond brilliant. I'm mostly just spit balling here, but I think the overall idea is fascinating.
