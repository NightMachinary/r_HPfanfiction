So a week or 2 ago I made a post about any fics where Harry deals with the trauma of everything that happens post DH. I specifically wanted stories where he is an alcoholic or uses similar ways of coping. Someone replied that he escaped the war relatively unharmed and unscathed, meaning he shouldn't have any trauma. I've had similar conversations with people across different platforms and I don't understand how people can see it this way.

Harry lost so much during the war. I don't think people really realize and think about how it should effect someone to live the life that he lived. We only read highlights and the important parts but there are so many more small interactions that are never put into words that a real person would have to live through. Harry knew Lavender Brown for almost 7 years by the time she was killed in the Battle of Hogwarts. Actually there's much debate on whether she dies because it never specifically mentions her dead body in the books, just that Fenrir Greyback attacks her, but for simplicity sake let's say she's dead since the movies and wiki both claim she is. Either way, she might have been a background character for most of the series but there are 6 years of daily interaction of some sort. And surly Lavender and Harry got to know each other better than they previously did while Ron dated her.

Now let's go onto people we know for sure dies. Colin Creevey might've been weirdly stalkerish towards the beginning of his time in Gryffindor, but he grew on Harry as time went on, especially during the DA year. His death would've caused Harry at least some minor issue. Then there's Tonks. I feel like most of the reason people love her is because of our Fanon depictions of her not Canon, but she is still married to Remus and probably one of the most important people to Harry that we meet towards the second half of the series. Both her and Remus's death call parallels to Harry's parents, and now poor Teddy has to rely on his a member of his mother's family the same way Harry did, only this time he has a Godfather to be in his life. And Remus was so much to Harry. Every father figure Harry has in the books dies with the exception of Arthur. First James, then Sirius, then Dumbledore(more grandfatherly and manipulative but still an important figure), then Remus. The list just keeps going on and on.

Fred's death is just another blow to the family Harry always wished he had. Fred and George are probably the most important people to Harry outside of Ron and Hermione, with the exception of Ginny if you want to argue that his relationship with her for 2 years is more important than the years of brotherly love he receives from the twins. They gave Harry happiness and laughter at some of the series worst parts, always cracking jokes and trying to keep people's heads high. Fred's death is probably the one that hits me the hardest in Canon.

Then there are deaths of minor characters who are never named. While they aren't important compared to the above mentioned characters, they would still be on Harry's mind. The Battle of Hogwarts is the magical equivalent of a school shooting and Harry is right in the middle of it all. Why wouldn't he have issues that need working out?


** There's innate differences in how traumatized people are by bad events, even without magical excuses. I think I personally ended up with relatively high sensitivity for a lot of minor events, but low sensitivity for the deaths of acquaintances. Genetic lottery be like that sometimes. Anyway, I see no reason why you couldn't make up any plausible level of sensitivity for the Harry in your fanfic. He could need a lot of help or be totally fine.

** "Relatively unharmed and unscathed." He literally died. Yeah, he came back, but he walked into that forest to die and /did/ die. Not to mention the prior months of running for his life, constant fear, participating in a violent, deadly battle that claimed the lives of some of his close friends, and then killing a man (even if it was by proxy).

The idea of Voldemort's death flipping a switch and everything being just great afterward is asinine to me.

** The important point here is that Harry escaped /relatively/ unharmed compared to everyone else, not that he is entirely intact. It's just that most of Harry's major trauma's happened in the past and he already has mechanisms for coping with them. All his issues will have been there for some time. Acquainted student dying in front/because of him? Cedric Diggory. Mentor/Parent figure dying? Albus Dumbledore and Sirius Black. Close family being murdered in his defence? Sirius and Dobby. Contrast this with say, Molly Weasley who lost her son and has very little prior experience with such an affair. Or McGonagall, who had to maim her own students and watch students she had been teaching a few hours ago die.Or Andromeda, who lost her daughter and sister. Or Ron, who gets a taste of what Harry felt when he lost Sirius. It's just that compared to post GOF or OOTP Harry would be in a significantly better headspace after DH. He has closure with his parents and Dumbledore and just the general relief of /It's over/. His greatest issues are likely to be dealing with his own death and Snape's relevations along with mourning for Remus and Tonks and long term issues that would stem from all his losses and martyring. Would totally read a properly written Harry meets a therapist fic.

Agree with most of what you say, just wanted to push back a little here because both of Molly's brothers were killed during the first war. Albeit it's a different kind of pain versus losing a son, but I think she definitely has some experience dealing with grief.

** I think it's just another facet of the magicalism vs realism debate that marks many aspects of the series, such as the Dursley's abuse.

For some people, they can accept the epilogue at face value. All was well, Harry married his high school sweetheart and had 2.5 kids, and everyone lived happily ever after.

For others, the effects of a brutal civil war including class warfare, an insurrectionist government takeover, and child soldiers should not have been resolved within 20 years.

Harry's potential issues just become another point of emphasis for that debate.

** The Trio are mentally incredibly strong though, because the Troll incident alone will turn most normal people into nervous and paranoid wreck.

You should accept that there are extremely tough people out there, such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audie_Murphy][Audie Murphy]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Clem][John Clem]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauri_T%C3%B6rni][Lauri Torni]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyudmila_Pavlichenko][Lyudmilla Pavlichenko]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Wake][Nancy Wake]].

The Trio, as depicted in the series, are every bit as tough as these real world warriors. They will be traumatized, they will be suffering, but they won't become non functional PTSD basket cases, and they will go on to have successful careers and families!

They will, but the thing about PTSD is that it's easy to disregard. Such as yelling and probably certain words. They could trigger the same fear that others like Vernon and Snape put in him. He could sleep on the floor for a while while he works things out. Surprisingly, sleeping on the floor is related to PTSD due to it being "easier to react to" or something like that.

**** Was Harry ever scared of Snape? Yeah there might have been moments, like when he finds Harry in the pensive where Harry thinks "he's going to kill me", but I don't recall Harry immediately reacting to Snape with fear, only really anger.

** Harry has been written for books as the type of person who undergoes extreme danger yearly, and despite throwing himself into situations --- throws out good opportunities to plan ahead for the worst. And despite society, his own classmates, teachers, parents' old friends on both sides being too involved with themselves to actually help Harry --- he still is supposed to just. Care.

The DA lasts a single year. He never changes his classes to accommodate a different mindset from things like Voldemort's resurrection or having the ministry acknowledge that fact. HBP despite its danger, had a very teenage relationship focus that didn't feel like the start of an actual wizard war in the background. No adult ever gives him enough focus to actually become a meaningful mentor --- no, Dumbledore and Remus and Sirius do not really count. The Dumbledore lessons are just Tom Riddle History 101. He normally does not put special focus into training for his own goals of survival, outside of GoF.

In other words? JK didn't let Harry explore morality, independence, and the side effects of a lot of harmful decisions and let him stretch his identity more to accommodate growing up under these life events. And so he feels like he stands detached from a lot of his own history. His own failings from others. His own habits to just confront danger despite it never being his responsibility in the first place. All the issues that arise from his core personality. He just continues what he always had.

But that's? Probably just me? 😔

(I think Harry always had problems, and if those issues were properly explored as apart of his parallels to Voldemort, that would have been so good.)

TLDR: JK said “he's fine” and a lot of people went “sure 👌 “
