Looking for well written stories that go deeper into the dark arts. I don't really mind who's POV but I'd like to read a story about someone going dark or at least using black magic. Dark arts being misunderstood or whatever is acceptable, but real dark stuff is preferable. Also longer stories are normally better.


** Maybe death eater back stories, grindelwald or some other dark wizard?

Also: are there no stories where the chamber of secrets has some actual secrets? ...you know.. plural, useful, not just a pet snake belonging to a guy who likes snakes.

** Silently Watches 'Black Princess' series goes into different types of magic, i.e Black, dark, light, White.

I like the series, but it is a tad dark and not for everyone (rape as backstory, for example).

  Second in the Black Queen series. Last year, Jen had to contend with a deadly Tournament, a revived Dark Lord, a meddlesome Headmaster, and worst of all, reconciliation attempts by her parents. Surely her OWL year can't be anywhere near as complicated. Can it? NOT for children!

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** Linkffn(darkness ascendant) it's in the name, though Harry delving into the Dark Arts won't be until after school and it'll be mostly unpracticed. (edit: since it's mine, while I believe it is, well written will be your purview to decide)

One spell, though, is used by Harry before he even leaves school. Fiendfyre (cantrip: MAL-ig-nis) will be a spell he heavily experiments with as he tries to force his will over it and his attempt to create a Light Art version of the spell that only burns the Corrupt, leaving all else undamaged, much like the magical version of a neutron bomb, designed to destroy the enemy and not its holdings.
