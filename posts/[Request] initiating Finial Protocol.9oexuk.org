In which the end is near and as there last stance, they initiate a final protocol. Got this stuck in my head from reading linkffn(12775205)

For example, exploding the floo network, crippling and damaging thousands of houses connected to it.

Hogwarts statue defence on a larger scale.

If you want to do crossovers, willingly bring weeping angels into reality and multiple them (mirrors, boggarts)

Albus had a darker side when he was in his younger years. Albus proves he did not forget what he learned(mass necromancy or something else)

Ect ect

Fanfic plz


** The only one I know of is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8288341/1/A-True-Daughter-of-the-Black][A True Daughter of the Black]], linkffn(8288341), in which [[/spoiler][Andromeda Tonks initiated Hogwarts's self destruct after being overwhelmed, taking down thousands of her enemies with her.]]

#+begin_quote
  Susan Bones, permanent nurse and bodyguard to the comatose Harry Potter, is commanded to execute the Order's final protocol. As hoped, Harry and Susan are transported to the past. But, Harry's recovery is only partial, so Susan must add to her duties the role of foot soldier as the two use their knowledge of the future against Voldemort. H/S. Time Travel. Subtle Soul Bond
