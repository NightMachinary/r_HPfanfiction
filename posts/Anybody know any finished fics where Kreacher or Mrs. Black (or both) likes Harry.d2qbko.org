  Kreacher is alone, his mistress is dead, his favorite Master is dead, the other has been locked away, so what's a house elf to do?In one reality, it's wallow in misery and failure.In this one, it's find the young godson of the locked away ungrateful master and try to raise him the house elf version of the pure blood way.It goes better and worse than he planned.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  The portrait of Cygnus Black I that hung in the Ministry reported that her firstborn had been sent to Azkaban without any trial whatsoever. It made Walburga furious. Not on His behalf, of course, but because of the utter disrespect shown to a scion of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. How dare they? If she let them get away with it, then next time those filthy blood traitors might think it was perfectly fine to treat that way a worthy member of the House of Black. After all, it had set a precedent. A bad precedent. It mustn't be allowed. Or, Walburga Black saves Sirius from Azkaban, and it changes everything.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** linkffn(11637611)

Fem!Harry with massively exaggerated Dursley abuse (the first chapter) which leaves Harry mute. The first few chapters are bad due to that (mute character = no dialouge), but it gets a lot better once people start to learn sign language. Cracky as hell, but so is your premise. A good subversion of many tropes (WBWL, everyone hating Harry, IndyHarry, surprise sibling, OPHarry)

*** This story is crushing if you like H/Hr...

The beginning seems like an adorable start to a relationship (in fact the cutest setup for Fem!Harry/Hermione that I have ever seen!), but Evil!Manip!Dumbledore decides Cassandra shouldn't have friends, decides to scare Hermione off, and successfully does it...

E!M!Dumbles should DEFINITELY NOT WIN at something like that!

It makes the sudden get together with Susan soon after feel wrong. It makes it very apparent the story was (by the author's own admission) written backwards from a triwizard where Susan was the girlfriend and Hermione was on the outs. (to be honest I don't know how the H/Hr friendship was at the start of the tri, I gave up before that.)

Then there's the boggart scene... Cassandra's worst fear is snapping and killing her friends, but when the bodys the boggart became are mentioned Hermione is not one of them, even though she was her first friend... That was when I stopped reading it...

**** It gets a lot better in fourth year with a proper reconciliation. No romance, mind you, but they get back to being best friends.

Which is one of the reasons I love this fic. It manages to spin the entire thing in a decent arc with a nice payoff and subvert a few tropes along the way. Which raises the question why a crackfic is the only one which manages this, but that's a different debate.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.
