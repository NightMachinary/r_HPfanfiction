I find myself growing tired of romance and in need of a good action adventure mystery something. Long and complete please.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë) - I think this ultimately qualifies as a fiction without romance but adventure genre.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
