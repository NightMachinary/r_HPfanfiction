Okay so I'm writing a fanfiction following young Tom Riddle. Should I include a sorting hat song? Does that seem too overdone already? I personally skip the sorting hat song whenever I run into them in fics.

If I should include one, does anyone have the poetry scheme that Rowling's sorting hat song used (like ababcdcd if that makes sense)

Edit: my freshman year English classes finally came back to me and I figured out how to get the rhyme scheme from the first sorting hat song. If anyone's wondering it's 8 blocks of text with four lines in each block and it goes ABCB, DEFE, etc

2 Edit: JK Rowling went a little crazy with the syllables tho, I tried to find a pattern and that just was not happening. Like the first two were 6,7,8,6 and 6,6,8,6 so I thought maybe it was a mistake then the third block of text was 8,6,9,5 everything I thought I knew when out the door


** I personally tend to skip over Sorting Hat songs if they're included in fics, as they're usually copy-pasted from canon and even if they aren't they typically don't add that much to the story. It would be much simpler to simply explain 'the hat sang about x', if you do want to have it mean something. That said, I've read so many fics that I've grown tired of the songs, so if you feel the song would add to the story, don't let me stop you!

*** Ye be warned it's a riddlexoc but its not listed as a romance because it's probably not going to be super strong on that front (it'll have hints but nothing too much sense it's canon compliant). it's very description heavy for the first 2 chapters but I balanced out the description and the dialogue in newer chapters. The next update is going be officially within the wizarding world!

**** I try to encourage more people to write what they like, but finding and retaining readers is an uphill slope, especially when it comes to making good first impression to convince readers to click to the next chapter.

That said, this fic needs more proofreading.

- Some sentences lack subjects and structure. ("Feeling overwhelmed peered through...")

- You change tenses in the middle of a paragraph. (Jenny looked around wildly... Jenny finally spots...)

#+begin_quote
  Jenny looked around wildly, startled to find herself sitting outside on icy concrete. Feeling overwhelmed peered through the crowd of people. Jenny finally spots what she was looking for, an old, tall, oak home; her home. Her stomach turns as she sees what's in its place.
#+end_quote

- Your punctuation is missing. ("the officers words")

- You use Americanisms. ("mommy")

#+begin_quote
  The small girl considered the officers words for a moment, then spoke softly, sure she was about to be scolded for being disobedient, "I wanted to surprise mommy and daddy by having the tree lit when they came downstairs."
#+end_quote

Your fic also has song lyrics, which would have been popular in fanfiction years ago, but dates your fic badly. The title of the fic "The Saga of Jenny" doesn't attract readers, who look at it and wonder who Jenny is. They have no idea what the fic is about, and even the fic summary is confusing. (" Love, lost, and lust shall drive us all our own personal brand of mad. ")

1. *What does the summary mean?* ...I don't know. I read it over and over and my impression is that there's a missing word or two, but I can't parse it.

2. *Do I want to find out more?* ...I don't know, not really. I'm not given an immediate reason to like Jenny and find out more. I might be interested because I like Tom Riddle as a character, but I'm not drawn into it because other stories have him and are written more coherently.

Maybe English isn't your first language, or this is your first ever written work, but I highly recommend you to polish up on the technical aspects of writing before trying to tackle big picture narrative structure.

***** Fair enough. I have been doing all my editing on my phone, because I mostly write at work so I probably need to go over it a bit more thoroughly. I definitely do find myself swapping tenses a lot,but I think I've gotten more mindful of that with the new chapters.

With the lyrics dating my fic, I did take a pretty big break from writing and when I did stop that was still really popular, so I'm sort of like the grandma using outdated lingo lol. I'll definitely need to reconsider that for any future chapters.

With the title and the large use of songs lyrics, it was mostly based off where I got the idea for the fic. There's this song from the 1940's called The Saga of Jenny and it follows this arch, starting with a little girl that burns down her parents house and following her as she grows ending with her death at 76(? Idk can't remember exactly off the top of my head) which is a a few years after Voldemort dies. --- To be honesty I've sort of gotten tired of going back to the song lyrics to double check if I've forgotten anything. So I might just take your advice, restructure the story, and remove that whole layer.

In my personal opinion (and I wrote it so that probably saying a bit) one could skip the first chapter and be able to follow the story with out much trouble, so I should either remove the first chapter or rewrite it to give it more meat (and definitely introduce Tom right away too).

As for the summary, oof, I liked it :/ but the end of the summary was more paying homage to how I plan on ending the fic, so I could change it up. I usually rewrite the summary several times before I find one that sticks, so this summary probably isn't The One.

***** Update: I took you're advice and rebranded the story and edited the first chapter. An hour later got a new review! I plan on taking another look at the rest of my published chapters but thanks for the push to take another critical look at my work!

** If you're confident that yours is good, I don't mind it; but a badly-written one is doomed to be skipped by most everyone. That being said, just because you don't actually write a Sorting Hat Song doesn't mean you shouldn't acknowledge their existence; they're a pretty important part of the Hat's characterization. It adds a lot of color, for example, if during a conversation with Dumbledore, you show the Hat on his shelf absent-mindedly composing the next one and interrupting the conversation to ask for rhyme suggestions.

As for the syllables, don't think about it too hard. First, we are explicitly told the Sorting Hat isn't as good a singer as he thinks he is, it stands to reason he would also be a pretty bad composer. Second, not all songs are in regular verse; it all rather depends on what tune it's set to.

** I think the song was supposed to be different every year, sometimes short and other times long. If you Google sorting hat song lyrics it should pop up.

*** Unfortunately I wouldn't know because I skip over them, but I actually got bored during work and decided to write one of my own, so I'll probably throw it into my fanfic. Unfortunately it was written by a person who barely writes poems and completed in a two hour period so it's very mediocre lol

**** I did a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12564837/8/A-Distant-Storm][fic]] where the Sorting Hat did the third-year Sorting Song to the tune of American Pie. It was promptly lampshaded by Hermione.

The second-year [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12357124/7/Rising-From-The-Shadows][song]] was rather more generic but the fourth-year [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12831094/7/A-Challenge-Unexpected][song]] was set to the music of Bohemian Rhapsody. Once again, lampshading ensues.

Basically, the Song can be fun and should either be amusing in some way or plot-relevant, foreshadowing the upcoming events. I'd also advise trying to keep it fairly compact if possible. If you have to page-down multiple times to reach the end, then something's gone horribly wrong with either the writing or formatting (and you'd better hope it's the latter since that's generally easier to fix).

** I'd say skip it. Doesn't really add anything meaningful to the narrative IMO most of the time, and even if you want the Hat to sing about something specific, you can always address it in dialogue.
