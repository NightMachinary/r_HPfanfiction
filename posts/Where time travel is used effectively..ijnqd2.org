Basically having access to a pocket sized time machine should be ridiculously overpowered, so anything where canon style (not cursed child) time travel is heavily overused to solve literally every problem and beyond. Bonus points if multiple people have access to time travel and make things chaotic.

Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.
