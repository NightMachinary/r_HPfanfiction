I kinda wish in a fanfiction where Harry was forced to keep a secret that after a while he just snaps one day and spills his secret to his friends in a full blown rant. Like, keeping in a huge secret, and having to lie to your best friends will weigh heavily on you, and eventually you're gonna snap and reveal everything.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.
