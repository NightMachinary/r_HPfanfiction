This is perhaps the most common explanation for why it makes sense for Hermione to end up with Ron, but I reread the books very recently and I don't see what gives way to this idea. I can maybe recall 1 or 2 times where Ron made Hermione laugh over the course of the series, which in my opinion, is not enough to back up this belief. I certainly can't name a time when Hermione felt more relaxed, because Ron was in the room; though I can name times where she felt the opposite. The only reason I can think of that people would stand by this theory is with the mindset of "Well, Ron's the fun one and Hermione's the bookworm. So surely Ron must make her feel relaxed by default." But I don't think that's the case at all.

Granted, we have no idea what they're like when they're alone, completely Harryless. And while it's technically possible that they could simply have the best of times during those moments, I struggle to picture it, especially based on what we do see of them.


** JKR tends to skip their interactions if they are not fighting. For example in DH, before Ron left, they were talking behind Harry's back all the time. Harry actually got quite paranoid about this. Later, after Ron came back, Harry became increasingly obsessed about the Hallows, while Ron took over the leadership in Horcrux Hunt. The situation became increasingly Harry vs them, until Harry blurted out “Voldemort” in an argument with them.

But you don't see much text devoted to this kind of moments. They generally get skipped in a paragraph or two, despite lasting weeks or even months in actual story time.

By weighing the amount of text differently towards these events or moments, JKR also warps the perception of readers, if they do not think more behind the lines.

Harry was very pissed at them because they didn't write to him about Voldemort and Order matters (they wrote him, just not about some sensitive matters, unlike so many in the fandom seem to think), and Harry instructed Hedwig to pick on their hands as retaliation.

Then when they finally met, it's all CAPLOCK Harry.

Throughout Year 5, Ron and Hermione were on quite good terms, and it was actually Harry who couldn't stand their bickering. When Harry blew up at them, they would “look offended”.

** “She'll (Skeeter) twist everything he says,” Harry said under his breath.

“Just as long as he didn't import those skrewts illegally or any- thing,” said Hermione desperately. They looked at one another --- it was exactly the sort of thing Hagrid might do.

“Hagrid's been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledore's never sacked him,” said Ron consolingly. “Worst that can happen is Hagrid'll have to get rid of the skrewts. Sorry . . . did I say worst? I meant best.”

Harry and Hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly more cheerful, went off to lunch. (Book 4, Ch. 21)

Or this.

“What'll happen to it, do you think?” she asked. “Will it be all right?”

“You sound like Hagrid,” said Ron. “It's a dragon, Hermione, it can look after itself. It's us we need to worry about.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, I don't know how to break this to you,” said Ron, “but I think they might have noticed we broke into Gringotts.”

All three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult to stop. Harry's ribs ached, he felt lightheaded with hunger, but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was raw.

**** I think a lot of negative opinions are formed about Ron because people only consider the things Harry says in the books instead of looking at everything Ron's done. Moreover, since the movies can only show so much, they often cut out the parts that make the characters who they are.

All through the books, Ron has been the one to take care of Harry and Hermione, whether it is standing by Harry's side through each of his obsessions or helping Hermione step out from the world of books. He is sassy and smart. In terms of grades, we don't know Ron's exact grades but he passed all the subjects that Harry did and got the same grade as Harry in Potions, at least (E).\\
However, there are times where JKR has written Harry's perspective as such that it makes Ron seem lesser. I remember thinking this in GoF when Harry and Ron are arguing over Harry's name being in the goblet and Harry is agnry at Ron or after the second task when he talks about Ron enjoying the limelight. I still don't think these instances mean Ron was inferior to Harry but that JKR made it look like it or at least had Harry feel it on some level.

Ron likes Quidditch and Hermione likes books. They are independent people with their own interests. Ron likes to turn life into a joke, and Hermione likes to approach things seriously and logically. Ron can make Hermione laugh, can make her take a break from whatever she has decided is all-consumingly important, and appreciate the moment. And Hermione... she can make Ron appreciate some of those serious things he might not otherwise. She can help him grow up a bit more. I'm not saying that they're perfect, or that they wouldn't have issues to work though, but I can entirely see them together. Perhaps you are asking.. Is love enough? In my opinion, it is.

***** I think you got it twisted mate,

Yes Hermione needs someone who can get her to loosen up

Yes ron needs someone to ground him and mature him

But they aren't those people for each other.

Ron needs someone who can not only get him to take things seriously but will also give him the affection and SUPPORT he needs (caps because its important) because of his enormous inferiority complex. For this reason I've always liked lavender for him. In canon she was used as a plot device, but I beileve she can commandeer the relationship and get ron to do things but she also coo's over his accomplishments, and immediately sees him as Ron, not anybody else.

Unfortunately Hermione has come not to expect much from ron, not entirely her fault given Ron's attitude over the years but the best example is in ootp where hermiones shock at ron becoming perfect (which was a shock let's be honest here)

For Hermione, I'd have to go with either harry or one of the weasley twins. The twins (one not both but I'm not going to choose) for many of the reasons you listed for ron. Can help her have fun and add choas to her organized demeanor. Despite appearances the weasley twins are very intelligent and can challenge hermione. I will always ship harmony. It's a shame their relationship was botched in the last two books so that the big happy weasley family ending had a clear road ahead. They have so many sweet moments especially in ootp. While canon harry doesnt have the care free attitude the twins or ron have, hermiones always been there for him, will I g to throw away caution and logic.

You cant build a relationship on jealousy and maybes, which is all jk gave us for those two. Ron acts the same way to dean and Ginny that he did to Hermione and krum, maybe those two would make a great couple. You can sit here all day and say, "but those two spent so much time together behind the scenes!" And, speculate all day about how Ron's mere presents calms down hermion e but from what were given that's far from the case.

****** You have fair points there, but you're discounting Ron so quickly. There's nothing in the books to suggest he's stupid in any way. His grades are on par with Harry's. He works hard. You brought up the prefect thing... I do want to take that to point out that aside from Harry, Dumbledore thought Ron was the other best person for this job. Certainly it's not because he's an idiot.

Hermione with Weasley twins... honestly, they interacted so briefly I don't give it much thought. I can't agree with the Harmony shipping though, sorry! To me Harry and Hermione are way too platonic. Way to brother/sisterly. I can't see them together at all. It just feels... wrong. To me.

Anyway, to your other points. Yes, Ron does have an inferiority complex, but it seems unfair to assume Hermione would not be able to give him support just because she assumed Harry would be the one to get the prefect badge. Circling back to this. I think we were all a bit surprised when it happened, as Harry was the logical choice. Ron is... like the representation of, I think, most of us. He isn't perfect, and doesn't always do the /best/ thing, and makes a lot of mistakes. But he does the /right/ thing. The good thing in the end. Hermione can lose track of the good thing in favor of the great thing. I think Ron helps her with this. Like when she wanted to free the house elves against their will, and Ron set that right. And that was, at the time, right. And then Ron came around to respect her views on house elves --- wanted to save them in DH. Beautiful bit of character development there. It seems like Ron was never afraid to come back from his mistakes. Hermione, I think, was more so. I think he shows her that it's all right to be imperfect. Ron and Hermione /have/ spent time together, behind the scenes or not. Plenty above have listed all the many instances, so it seems silly to do it again, but you can't deny that they have a friendship, a relationship based on that friendship, and chemistry --- something Harry and Hermione have never had in all 7 books.

I don't think their relationship is built on jealousy. I think their relationship is built on believing in love, even when it seems hard. I love that Ron and Hermione went and fought for that love, and they took it --- they took something many people believe to be impossible just based on all the downvotes in this thread, and they made it real for them, in their own corner of the world. And I love that. It's inspiring.

Either way, you can ship Harmony, or Fremione, or Georgemione... or really anyone. I mean the whole fandom is out there shipping Hermione with EVERYONE and their mother. And these are all things I read and enjoy, I should mention. Even some Harmonys, though this is more rare. But either way, I'll be over here, believing in Romione and hoping they pull through. Like they did. In canon. :)

******* The prefect badge was just the best example on how Hermione doesnt expect much from ron. Which is fair, not saying hes "dumb" but you cant expect much from someone who doesnt even care to try.

As for why ron was made perfect, probably the same reason 95% of our heroes are in gryffindor and 99% of death eaters are in slytherin if you catch my drift.

That out of nowhere house elf line in the middle of the battle of Hogwarts makes me roll my eyes. It was an obvious metaphorical bone to ron.

Like it or not the relationship was built on jealousy, harry and ginny's too, I think you're making alot of assumptions but I'm just sticking to what's in the books.

These are all assumptions I've pulled out of the books. They are based in canon. And if I'm making assumptions, I think you are making just as many, really. :) Which, by the way, is fine. Everyone interprets what they read differently. That's the beauty of it.

How is Harry and Ginny's relationship built on jealousy? What, because it took Ginny going out with someone else for Harry to realize he loved her? Something that seems to happen, I have to say, a lot. People often take things for granted, don't realize what they have until it's gone.

I have to say... it sounds like there are many things about canon that you dislike... that's a shame. But I hope there are things you enjoyed too.
