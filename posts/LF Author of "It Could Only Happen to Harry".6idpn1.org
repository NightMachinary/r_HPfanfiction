The co-hosts of the comedy podcast -- The Potterotica Podcast (they read erotic HP fanfic) are trying to get ahold of the author, HoosYourDaddy, to get permission to read their story for the next season of their show.  They've tried a few different ways, but figured it was worth a shot to see if someone on here had any connections. Does anyone know him/her or could introduce them?  If so, please message me or email hi(at)potteroticapodcast(dot)com. Thanks in advance!
