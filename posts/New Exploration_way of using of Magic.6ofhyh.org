looking for HP stories where Harry learns of Magic and either invents a new and good way of using it or ignore the sheeples beliefs on its limits and taskes it to the next level like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][For the Love of Magic]]

or this otherone i cannot remember where he becomes a magic programmer and finds this girl being chased and adopts? her then only goes to hogwarts if she can follow

or is adopted and or taught a diff system like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9586702/1/Fate-s-Gamble][Fates Gamble]]

Needs minimum 150K words anything else is too short for an even remotly good for what im looking for unless it already has sequels

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

*** Thank you so much, this is my new favorite fic. Like wow, the wide-eyed wonder in this thing is off the charts. It's fun, quirky, tone consistent, grammatically correct, doesn't trip over its own plot, has great supporting characters, uses its limited wordcount extremely efficiently, and is just generally a lot of fun. Wow. Also thank you!!!

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) is an underrated gem. Solid amounts of world building in a much larger magical world combined with a good amount of magical theory that's different. One of my favorites

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.

  People say that the past is in the past and you should learn to move on. Oh if it were only that simple for one Hyoudou Issei who's past seems to want to drag him back to the world he escaped from. Harem of course, or it wouldn't be Highschool DxD.
