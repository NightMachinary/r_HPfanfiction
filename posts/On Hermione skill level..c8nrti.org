So, apparently we're not to discuss or comment requests in the requests thread. So here goes.

In [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c8my6t/lf_fics_that_properly_place_hermiones_skill_level/]]\\
Hermione's skill level is mentioned.

And well, nothing much, I just wanted to point out that I am not sure if we actually know the OWL scores of the three mentioned (Barty Jr, Bill and Percy). So it seems a bit weird to "bash" Hermione for getting one E?\\
For all we know the others got plenty of Es and As as well in their OWLS.\\
I mean sure, she got 11 instead of 12, but I do not think anyone doubts she could have gotten her divination one if she had decided to not give a damn about being serious and started making shit up like everyone else.

As for the rest, iirc she's consistently shown performing magic way ahead of her peers, protean charms, space extension charms and she also seems to dabble in her own spell tweaking (cursed contract).\\
Beside having her time wasted by doing Harry's and Ron's homework half of the time along with making sure they all stay alive and such.

In comparison it sems to me that Hermione has way more 'hobbies' and ocupations than the others that were mentioned. Who at best were prefects like her (Bill was also quidditch captain, but we do not know if that was before 7th year I think? And I'm skipping 7th year for obvious reasons).

So while she might not be the best of all, and might not really compare to Dumbles and Tommy, she's definitely in the same tier as the others.

Can't recall where Bill's and Percy's came from, but I have no reason to doubt that we did get them.

I'm explicitly trying to avoid bashing recs. And yes, her skillset was not that impressive. I like Snape as an example, who is so ahead of her in potions, that an annotated book from his sixth year boosts Harry, at best a passable brewer, to the absolute top of the class.

I'm not trying to bash her, but look at it on an A,B,C system. She was mostly an A student, but ended up with a B. And the magic she did was at best NEWT magic at her OWL to NEWT years. It was above average, but extraordinary? No.

You do reach a cap with comparing school achievements, but Barty's skill after being under the imperious for 13 years is enough to confund the goblet of fire, capture Moody, steal from Snape (who admittedly has crap security), and fool Dumbledore.

Edit: Magic has levels to it. Plenty of people can probably cast the Fidelius Charm. Skill is determined by how well it's done. Just because Harry was able to master the spell at 13 and teach others how to do it at 15 doesn't mean it's not hard. As we see, few people could do it as well as he could.

********* I'm not sure the two extra classes mean *that* much. Sure, he was good, but as I said before I don't think we know the marks. Hermione got all O bar one on those she took. For all we know Bill had a bunch of As and Es in there? Is that really enough reason to say he was *better*?\\
(Leaving aside the fact that iirc the two missing classes are muggle studies and divination. I'm pretty sure had she wanted she'd have gotten them. She dropped divination cause it was bloody ridiculous and from what I remember she dropped muggle studies so she didn't have to double up with a timeturner anymore?)\\
For all anyone can dislike her I don't think you can deny she could have gotten at least an A owl in the missing classes? She simply chose not to.

I do not think qualifying as head boy counts either. Hermione was never given the chance. For all we know she would have been head girl? This is why I'd only really consider her achievements up to sixth year.

Sure, Barty is a genious, but again, basically all you're bringing is stuff he did after leaving Hogwarts.\\
Even if we consider the debilitating effects of Azkaban, we don't really know how much of the goblet of fire plot was done without help? It's not too much to assume he had a bit of help from old Voldy in bewitching the goblet. Assuming it was *that* hard to begin with. In my opinion it was just something noone ever tried before. Keep in mind that the only real comment we have on how to do it "a very powerful confundus" is from his own mouth. So it might not be entirely truthful. And even then I think the baseline was "a confundus more powerful than a 14 year old could muster" rather than "something few adults wizards could pull off".\\
He's still great. He's definitely no slouch. Especially considering Azkaban. But I don't really see his feats of magic that much better than Hermione's. Because it's those that matter: the owls, bewitching the goblet, and kidnapping Moody. Everything else has little to do with magic. And of those three I don't really see anything that Hermione couldn't have achieved if she had the will to? Or at least nothing so far off as to put them in two entirely different tiers.

The others, eh, who do we have, Snape and the marauders?

Sure, again all very talented. But not so much more than Hermione, the way I see it. Also, all growing up knowing about magic, which surely helps?

In the end all I want to say is: yes, Hermione isn't the second coming of Merlin. And she's probably not even comparable to Dumbledore. But to all the others? Yes. She may not be at the top of that list, but she is *on* that list along with them.\\
The way I see it she's just a generalist. She's good at most things but excels in none.

And she's not without her achievements. Consistently performing newt and post newt magic way ahead of the curve; brewing polijuice in her second year, in a lavatory no less; surviving altercations with grown Death Eaters; creating a curse that a trained and experienced mediwitch couldn't revert; successfully infiltrating both Gringotts and the ministry (granted, she didn't do those on her own, but she still had a somewhat big role, didn't she?)

********** That entire post is just poor speculation. That hurt to read.

Again, no school age child could have done it. Funny enough, Barty mentioned how he did it. No speculation there. No help from Voldemort.

You're making very bold assumptions. It's safe to assume if someone took a lot of classes and ended up as Head Boy, that he did very well in said classes. It's possible it's not all O's, but at least he wasn't a nervous wreck like Hermione third year.

You can argue a similar ballpark yes, but even then, only at the same age.

Again, what did Hermione do that compared? You're saying things. Nothing she did showed that innate talent. It showed she was very studious, but becoming Animagi or modifying a potion or inventing spells? She brewed Polyjuice as a second year and it's laudable, but she just followed a recipe, so it shows she's a great brewer.

She seems to be an excellent student, but a once in a decade talent? No.

I think we can agree Rowling is very bad with consistency though.

************** That is an ad hominem attack. It is not an accepted argument tactic, as you are going after character rather than refuting the argument. No evidence? 3 underage Animagi with a unique magical artifact. Unique Potions modifications (which you may be able to argue Harry's mother as able to accomplish as well) and invented spells. A fooled Goblet of Fire and subduing "The ministry's greatest Auror". She doesn't seem to be the once in a decade talent's you see with other characters.

Hermione is a disappointment of a character. Rowling made her provide all the information, but could not make her too smart, lest the plot not exist. You attack me because she's supposedly female. Nope. Blame me all you want, but when is a single woman's birthday mentioned in canon (aside from a gravestone with Harry's Mother)? Good job Rowling with your strong females. Downplay Hermione's abilities, nope. I want them placed in proper context.

Brilliant? No. Harry's mother could be described that way in charms and potions, but she's glossed over in canon for most of the books except for her sacrifice and her eyes.. For all Hermione's vaunted skill, Mrs. Weasley ended up taking down Lestrange, not the trio of Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, with Bellatrix having a disadvantage of an unmatched wand. Bellatrix Lestrange is definitely brilliant. Molly Weasley is arguably brilliant, if a bit overbearing of a mother with a slight ethics problem (love potions anyone?).

Despite my personal misgivings with McGonagall, she won multiple awards while in school and trained under Dumbledore personally. McGonagall is definitely brilliant if a terrible administrator.

I objectively dislike Hermione's character. Because she's female? Nope. Just because she's super static and overhyped.

*************** I wasn't making an argument so much as pointing out that it's weird for you to ride so hard for some relatively minor (all dude, and BELLATRIX?) characters and make certain allowances for them that you aren't giving to Hermione. Like Bill being able to cast the Fidelious Charm a decade out of Hogwarts, but Hermione does something in her 2nd year that people don't learn until years later isn't an achievement? Figuring out the Basilisk situation in the CoS at age 12 before DUMBLEDORE isn't an achievement? The Marauders were definitely some smart kids, but Hermione certainly showed a level of magic similar to them in that she was able to whip up potions and charms (and even excel in them) before most of her classmates. She also was a part of a group that took down Voldemort. Harry could not have done it without her.

PS HOW IS BELLATRIX EVER DESCRIBED AS BRILLIANT? We know nothing about her abilities other than torturing and killing people which isn't a strong indication of abilities?

PPS What exactly does a woman's birthday have to do with writing strong female characters? You've already made a few great points that Rowling did have strong female characters like Lily Potter kicking butt at Charms and being a part of the slug club and defying Voldemort THREE times? McGonagall also being an Anamagi and just a tough lady who took some stunners straight to the chest and survived. Molly Weasley on the housekeeping front was supposed to be pretty talented and a good mother.

TLDR: I totally understand not liking her character, but your arguments don't stand up in terms of Hermione not being the genius everyone makes her out to be. Personal distaste should not wipe out her many achievements. Even if she can be a bit of a know it all. I don't think there are too many people who would say she is the /smartest/ character in the book. There are plenty of fantastic wizards and witches to compete with, but that doesn't mean she wasn't fantastic in her own right.

**************** *Sigh* You prefaced with that statement as an attempt to refute what I was arguing. It's like if I said you probably see yourself as Hermione, hence why you defend her so vehemently.

What can I say? Canon really doesn't have that many female role models. Lily is shunted to the side.

The basilisk is a testament to her excellent research skills. Magical, not so much, but her research skills are impressive.

Canon Harry definitely could not have taken down Voldemort without Hermione's help. I don't disagree with that. Canon Harry is a walking disappointment in that Rowling dumbed him down so as to make him the average joe. He's motivated in book 3 to learn the patronus, then has major trouble with a summoning charm in book 4. You mix Hermione's drive with canon Harry's personality, and that's a protagonist that'd be interesting to read. Of course, if you had a Dumbledore that disclosed important information, the last 3 books would not have needed Hermione as a character, and she could have grown into something unique.

Don't get me wrong, she learned ahead with the protean charm, but a couple years ahead work just doesn't compare to something at most a dozen people did a century with the animagi or making a magical artifact that tracks people in Hogwarts. She was studious and intelligent, but did she really break the mold? Snape modified potions. Hermione simply brewed them to spec, and the annotated potions book provided recipes that beat her brewing prowess.

Bellatrix remains the only character besides Voldemort to block a charm from Dumbledore in the 7 books. She taught Occulumency, was well versed in the dark arts and charms, and was possibly Voldemort's most capable Lieutenant.

The birthday mention was more to mention that Rowling did not treat her female characters well. Hermione gets no backstory, Ginny is put into the background, Cho is just a sobbing, grieving girlfriend, Luna is pretty much ignored, Fleur had the worst performance in the tournament (I think that one may have been a subtle dig at the French). Lily Potter was known to be good at potions in the sixth book, and we knew that she was good at charms, but that's it. Being talented extended to being in the Slug club and escaping Voldemort is impressive, but never elaborated on. McGonagall was tough, and ended up joining the duel against Voldemort, but I wasn't attacking their brilliance and Mrs. Weasley has a surprising amount of talent if you look in the books, but I wasn't arguing that.

TLDR: I understand some aspects of her character being admirable, such as her intense drive to learn or her loyalty or her ruthlessness to her friends. But Hermione's character is static as best in canon. She gets over her breaking the rules issue at the first Halloween, then pretty much becomes a loyal female Percy except for situations that need her. She's skilled and a talented witch, but she's not like Snape or even the Marauders, who invented and explored magic to a degree she never did. Note that I'm using book Hermione. Movie Hermione is bad writing for a different reason (they made her character steal lines!). There's intelligence, which Hermione shows with solving the basilisk mystery and Harry piecing together where the chamber is. There's being studious, which Hermione shows with her knowledge for classes. There's magical skill, which is what Voldemort, Dumbledore, and even Snape show in excessive degrees. Hermione has intelligence, even if she doesn't show it later in the series (book 6 and Malfoy). She's very studious and she shows magical skill at the top of her class. Just not any other Hogwarts classes apparently.

I did not do so because they were guys, but rather that they had tangible feats of magical accomplishment in canon.

It's not just a few. You have a dark arts curse invented by a schoolchild, along with the countercurse. You have nonverbal magic to lift someone up by an ankle. Said nonverbal magic is displayed during their OWL year in the memory where Snape calls Lily a mudblood.

Again, later in life is a whole different ballgame. Perhaps she did end up inventing, but she seemed to have gone more for politics than anything in the Ministry, campaigning for creature rights and becoming minister. Noble and laudable, /but it has nothing to do with her magical skill/.

I'm not going to try to argue anymore. But in the future, citing specific examples from the books cuts down on arguments. You could have cited her 112% on a charms final. Her brewing Polyjuice. You could have cited her getting her needle right on her first day. Or you could mention her wiping her parents memories and bringing them back (not in the books, but mentioned by Rowling). But just paraphrasing sayings out of context is not the form of a good argument. Hermione quite a few things you talked about were statements in regards to her intelligence, not her magical skill in context. We tend to ignore the former because the plot makes characters idiots.

** I treat Hermione's skill level as akin to a really smart child. I don't see her as a genius or a prodigy. My headcanon is that every two or three years, a student with Hermione's level of aptitude comes through Hogwarts. The teachers are therefore not overly surprised nor impressed with Hermione, but they do acknowledge that she is very bright. They've seen students like her before, but they do reward her hard work and brilliance within the confines of the classroom.

I think Hermione and Cedric Diggory are not that different in aptitude. Hermione is lucky because she ended up friends with the character who is singularly important to the plot, so her talents and skills got both a bit of extra motivation to develop and a little bit more recognition. However, I think Cedric is basically Hermione if she had a more normal Hogwarts experience (though Cedric may have more developed social skills).

It's rather why I dislike Hermione-centric fanfiction, unless it's very clearly crack where everyone is OOC for the sake of humor (s/o to [[/u/Achille-Talon]] here). I specifically despise Genius!Hermione and in general despise H/Hr.

- It's totally ok to powerwank Harry, who can defeat Voldemort in a straight fight at age 15, who navigates effortlessly the Wizengamot at age 14, and who already has a harem by age 13. But if Hermione gets a little skill boost, she's a bloody MARY SUE!!!
- It's really fun to see Hermione physically assaulting Ron with birds and fists. But if Ron complains a little bit too much, he is an ABUSER!!!
- The Hogwarts resident Hitler Youth espouses magical Nazi ideology and actually carries out terrorist activities at the school, but doesn't have the courage to torture and murder his victims personally. "Oh, he must have a heart of gold. He's just misunderstood. Hermione should totally marry this guy!" Their best friend routinely risks his life and stands by them even in direst situations, but has gotten into arguments a few times. "What a traitor! This guy is a filthy devil incarnate!!!"
- This girl has only appeared once, and only because her last name is the next to Granger alphabetically. "But of course, Ice Queen of Slytherin must be the epitome of beauty and Slytherin cunning, the perfect mate for Harry!" Several other girls are depicted as physically very attractive, stand out in certain subjects, but are somewhat emotional as teenage girls should be. They also risked their lives for Harry's cause and fought against overwhelming enemy odds. "Meh, who are those annoying whiny bints???"

Improving her skill set is not a bad thing, but people then either treat her as perfect, which is a Mary-Sue, or they boost her negative characteristics, making her unlikable, which is also bad writing as she never grows.

Hermione is very good and learning and self-teaching but she's not an inventor. Two her priorities, while she is much less likely to arbitrarily break rules than Harry and Ron she has no problem defying authority when she feels it's necessary. I also find it interesting that so many fics will site the fact that she doesn't question Dumbledore as this, forgetting that none of them questions Dumbledore in canon.

Also something on an earlier point of yours, when you said that the adults had the prophecy well in hand were you referring to when Harry had to tell them that Arthur had been attacked or when the school kids where able to ride flying horses to London and beat the adults who had multiple ways to teleport (even if we assume they couldn't do so in the ministry itself they still should have been able to get the general area long before Harry and co).

************* People use the word manipulated in such a negative context because of Dumbledore fics, but here it's fairly apt. I'm not meaning she set him up to kill himself, but she did make him do something he didn't want to do, by having him meet people and ended up talking about Voldemort.

The first invented spells, modified potions, and knew more curses than most the seventh years as a first year, even if that phrase was a bit hyperbole.

The second group became Animagi and made the Marauder's map.

******* Every story is allowed to do so. I'm not arguing that. But, this thread was started as a response because I was looking for a fic where Hermione is similarly skilled to her canon self. A smart kid that's probably top of the class.

So, unless Rowling directly contradicts what she wrote in the future, in canon Hermione is magically talented, but not to the degree of what the Marauders, Snape, or Barty Crouch Junior accomplished. A smart kid, but a once in a decade talent? Nope.

********* Oh, interpretation is fluid. Hermione is certainly talented and driven. But the degree has precedence in canon. Top of year, not a special prodigy. That's what I was asking for.

Snape, despite my misgivings about his character, was a very impressive wizard. James and Sirius, both exceptionally bright, and the rest of the Marauder's did some truly impressive work. We have brewing 1 hour Polyjuice for Hermione, which can last from 10 minutes to 12 hours depending on how well it is brewed (check Pottermore), knowing a NEWT charm in owl year, and making a bag of holding her last year.

She's talented, but to the level of Snape, James, Sirius, or Barty Crouch Junior? No.

********** There we disagree. (Also, at the time of the books, Polyjuice lasted one hour, not up to twelve - hence Moody's constant drinking.)

Also, while the Marauders goofed around, she was crucial to defeating Voldemort - several times. And produced magic items as well.

So, there are arguments for and against - ultimately, the only reaosn people say Hermione is nothing special is a personal bias. They just don't like the character, so she's not allowed to be special.

*********** She's special. But I think it's ultimately her mind and single-mindedness rather than her magic skills, and that's where I disagree.

Rowling probably wanted to retcon a bit with the Polyjuice, and put that in for the feud between Hermione and Harry in Half-Blood Prince with the potions book. It's speculation on my part. And to be fair, it does fit something like potions to have variable effects based on potency.

She worked out what was hidden at the school. She was the only person to find out it was the basilisk (actually my favorite conclusion to a book, because then Harry carried it to find and kill the basilisk). She tried to save Buckbeak with research and she tried to free the House-Elves. She organized the DA, book 6 she took a break (book 6 has my least favorite Hermione), book 7 has her organize the hunt.

Was she perfect? No.

We're definitely at an impasse. I see your point, but I disagree. With that I bid you adieu.

Edit: I never did get recommended a story though...
