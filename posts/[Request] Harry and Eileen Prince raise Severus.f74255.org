I've seen some HarryxMeropes where they raise Tom, and I wondered if there were any time travel fics where Harry ends up falling for Eileen and rescuing her and Snape from Tobias. Fluffy is good, though angsty is okay if he doesn't show up until after Severus is already a little damaged from Tobias' abuse.


** :o This would be so fluffy and good! :) Yes if Harry has the heart and empathy to go back and raise Tom with merope he can do it for Snape too! :) :) This is such a good idea how has it not been done before?!

*** Probably because "going back to stop Tom becoming Voldenort" is something that would fit into Harry's overarching goal of stopping Voldemort in some way.

Apart from feeling sorry for Snape, what reason would Harry have to rescue the kid version of him? Why did he travel into the past? You probably need to set up some other motivation (most likely Voldrmort related) and have him realise that he also is in that time period where Severus is growing up abused and maybe he should fix that, too.

**** Yes that is how I meant he could do it! :) I have read fics like that too, where it is a time travel ACCIDENT and Harry realizes he can make stuff better if he tries. :) Maybe he does accidentally get thrown back in time and then he runs into Eileen. :)

#+begin_quote
  After Harry talks to Dumbledore in Deathly Hallows, he takes a little detour to Spinner's End, back before it was Snape's house, back when it belonged to a woman named Eileen Prince. Snape couldn't be angrier when he finds out Harry is his father.

** You may be interested in this story. It's a time travel fic with Harry as Snape's father. Unfortunately the author appears to have abandoned it but it is written very well.
