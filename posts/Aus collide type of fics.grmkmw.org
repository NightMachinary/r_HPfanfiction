I'm looking for fics that have characters from different alternate universes meet. I don't even know if they exist but I hope they do.

I'd prefer for it to be golden trio era or next gen but I'm not opposed to reading marauders era fics.

Hopefully no ocs, because most of them aren't done correctly (if they are I'll gladly read it)

I don't care if it's ongoing, abandoned, or finished. I'm desperate. Thanks in advance, even though about only 2 people will see this.

Hope you have a good day^{^}


** Linkffn(The Granger Principle)

There's two AUs, one with no magic where Ron and Harry are police and one that's just slightly different from canon in that the trio was far more active in the war. Turns out a lot of people are willing to do anything for access to dimensional travel.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU
