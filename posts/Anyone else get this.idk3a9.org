Sometimes you just want to sit down and read a badly written, massively predictable, plot hole ridden mess of a story. Just sit back and enjoy yourself as Lord Harrison James Potter-Black-Peverell-Griffindor-Flamel kicks ass with a pet Phoenix/Dragon/Basilisk. Where every canon threat just rolls over and let's him tickle its belly.

And dont forget HAREM.... ohh ohh wait... VEELA HAREM!!!!

Sorry just one of those nights, Good yard


** Somehow in those fics Harry always ends up with an extremely cool, three-bedroom, two-bathroom trunk, featuring a library, a potions lab, and a fully-stocked kitchen. And I love it. I love those trunks so much.

There's also at least one where Harry gets the Vanishing Cabinets and puts one in the trunk, so he can teleport in and out of it.

I don't get what you mean. Do you mean you have an aversion to The Wizard of Oz or Hostess cakes? Do you mean you hate when smut scenes use ridiculous terminology as if the author was trying to euphemize everything for the kids? Is it the smut scenes in general you dislike? (If so, no objection here.) Or is there some other meaning I'm too sleepy to think of?

...Ahem.

But yeah, Lord Potter-Black usually only really irritates me if I read too many in a row. Vicarious power trips are /fun/, lol.

Agreed on the harems, too. They /can/ be done well, it's just...I can count on one hand how many times I've seen that in nearly 20 years of fanfic reading.

I see that onomatopoeia thing sometimes, and I try to turn it into a source of amusement by imagining the object as actually saying it, but it's still irritating. And I've seen stories where I couldn't tell if half the dialogue was actual dialogue or the character's private thoughts because they put it all in the same type of quotation marks.

**** The Exclamation points come from a thing called Bang Path Notation.

Bang Path Notation used to be used for email systems back when the internet was very young (and not actually called the internet), where the majority of civilian computing existed in places like Universities.

The Bang Path represented the route that an email must take to get to that user. So if you're in the same site say, you may only need one Bang notation (say Physics!Name, is a different person than English!Name), while if you wanted to Email someone in another country you'd need a Bang notation for every machine that it'd need to go through to get to that person.

So Powerful!Harry or Dark!Harry are both Harry's they're just different Harry's

**** Current fave is Dobby's Deceit by morraine on AO3. It's got house elf awesomeness, too. The parseltongue, magical law, and ritual magic explorations are great....it has the Heir of Potter/Black/Slytherin stuff but it doesn't give Harry any extra powers. Plenty of bashing but the only one I don't fully care for is Snape as its a bit too creeptastic.
