:END:
I remember a fic that had harry teaching younger years defense against the dark arts while still in school and Hogwarts recognized him as a professor so he could give and take points and a exam he gave the students was a obstacle course. i was wondering if anyone else knows what it is or if it was taken down by the author.


** This may be linkffn(Taking Control), an older fic that is a bit dated, but admittedly that description is somewhat broad.
