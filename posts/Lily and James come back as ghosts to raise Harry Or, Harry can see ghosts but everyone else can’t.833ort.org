Are there any fics out there where Lily and James come back as ghosts to raise Harry? Alternatively, any fics where Harry can see ghosts but others can't? Perhaps he can see mundane spirits or is just generally clairvoyant. Some people can see the future so it's not too out of it that someone would be able to see the spirits of the dead.

  Thirty-seven-year old Harry Potter looks back on his life and finds how worse the world has become, thus he goes back in time to save his seven-year-old self from an event that changes his life, to entrust his legacy to himself. May sound cheesy, but a different approach. Minor to major Dumbledore and Weasley bashing. Snape Bashing. Grey Harry, time-travel, A-Universe/A-Reality...
