And with "background" I mean someone like Marlene McKinnon or Emma Vanity (Slytherin Captain), not the Black sisters or Lily.

No slash and no Death Eater whitewashing/"poor, misunderstood Snape".


** I remember reading one where he ends up with Emmeline Vance. Sadly, I don't remember the name of the fic, or any other detail, except perhaps him being MoD.

** linkffn(12021543)

a bit earlier than the 70s but i assume you were looking for this kind of thing. the romance is the whole point of the fic but imo it still ends up feeling a bit underwritten.

edit: is the bot down? heres a copy paste [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12021543/1/Retrograde]]

** It may be slash, but it's a Regulus and Harry interaction, where Harry saves Regulus right as he's switching the horcruxes (this is first chapter, not a spoiler).

**** It's not in the story at all yet (100k+ words), actually not even sure if it'll be slash...I think I had misread the tags

***** Then it would still be an 80s story, not one set in the 70s. And the 80s had an all out war and Voldemort's imminent victory, which is a vastly different story than anything in the 70s or even 60s would be.

****** It's set in '79, I think? So no, not 80s. War ended 10/31/81, so majority of 80s was peace time.

Dude, I made an error in reading the request thoroughly and the tags on the story itself, but someone might still want the rec. OP didn't clarify additional requests in the title of the post, only the body, and someone else might enjoy the fic.
