I think it could be a really fascinating place to flesh out a bit more, but authors rarely do (even when they set events there!). So, if you have any fics where we see the functions of the DOM a bit more (Hermione works there, Harry wants to know more about the veil for Sirius, or literally any other related plot point) I'd love to see them. Thanks!


** The DOM has already been fleshed out more than in canon in The Prince of Slytherin, and it looks like it'll likely be a major power in future events.

As for the details (most of which are spoilers):\\
* (chapter 19 of part 1) they held onto the Mirror of Erised (and thus it can be inferred, other such cursed artifacts) for study\\
* (chapter 36 of part 2) they were in charge of the training of heliopaths\\
* (chapter 19 of part 3) they have a number of warning systems for things like the literal return of the Old Gods\\
* (confirmed in chapter 35 of part 3, though its first appearance was much earlier) they have access to a potion that, in conjunction with a memory charm, makes remembralls (the main way of circumventing memory charms in the story) unable to detect the alteration)\\
* (chapter 44 of part 3, though it was alluded to earlier in the part) they posses the only time turner in existence, and have the duty of ferrying it to the necessary people\\
* Rookwood is an ex-unspeakable and genuinely terrifying\\
* (chapter 54 of part 3) They have access to lethal cognitohazards (information which kills you if you learn of it) and are requesting authorization to use them against certain Death Eaters

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  When an experimental spell goes awry, the spirit of someone long dead ends up stuck in Hermione's mind. Any romance that involves Fred Weasley is bound to be a bit unconventional, but even he never expected this.
