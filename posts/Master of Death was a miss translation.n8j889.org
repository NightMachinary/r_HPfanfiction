I'm not a writer so I'm just going to stub this out. Any writer who wants to use this idea may do so.

Opening scene is the day after the final battle. Harry, Hermione and Ron are discussing the deathly hallows and what to do with the elder wand. Harry decides to destroy the wand and snaps it in half.

Immediately a large rainbow light shoots down out of the sky leaving behind two people. The two people are Thor and Loki. Hermione recognizes them from legend. Loki congratulates Harry on being worthy of completing his challenge. Obviously the trio is confused about the challenge.

Loki explains that he gave the three brothers the wand, stone and cloak. The three brothers were followers of Loki in a time when most had forgotten the gods and so he had rewarded them for their faith. The brothers told all who would listen of the great gifts given to them by Loki. Since no one believed in Loki the story changed over time to it being death who had given the gifts. The brothers attempts at rekindling faith in Loki failed but they did stir up resentment and greed for their gifts.

Loki then proceeds to tell the trio that the original purpose of the hallows was mistranslated over time. The purpose was not to make one master over death but to test and find a husband worthy of Loki's daughter Hel Queen of Helheim. The candidate would have to reject the power of the wand, call loved ones from the grave and let them return and to give up the protection of the cloak and selflessly welcome death.

Loki goes on to explain that the cloak is what saved Harry on Halloween night. The cloak can be worn in reverse and the cloak will disappear so no one knows you are wearing it. Lily, knowing the story took a chance and put it on Harry in reverse. Lily knew that if Voldemort couldn't find Harry he would never stop looking so she hoped the story was true and the cloak would protect him from death. The cloak protected Harry from the killing curse. Lily's death/sacrifice directed Voldemort's death magic back at him. It was the combination of these two factors that allowed Voldemort to be vanquished.

Loki wraps up by telling Harry that since he passed the challenges the power of the hallows have quickened his body and put him on par with Asgaurdians so he could marry Hel.

If anyone decides to run with this please link me your story. Thanks.

***** Well, the bot comment includes a Usage link. It's actually really easy to do, except that if you're using a device with autocomplete, it will want to insert extra spaces that will break things.

If you have the actual link, probably the simplest approach is to just include ffnbot!directlinks anywhere in your comment (but it only works for new comments, not after editing them).

  What if the origins of the Deathly Hallows started even before the Peverell brothers and instead began with Loki trying to protect his daughter, Hel. Unfortunately, there is another prophecy involving a Chosen One. Perhaps collecting all three Deathly Hallows and becoming the Master of Death doesn't mean what everyone thought it did.

** I'd suggest having Harry swooning as the Bifrost appears from the surge of power. Also Hermione stops Harry from instantly screaming "NO!" by pointing out that these are literal Gods and it might be a good idea to at least agree to meet her, even if he wants to emphasize that he hasn't already agreed to marry her.

Then of course you gotta make a choice: play the old mythology of her less beautiful appearance straight where Harry's desire for a partner who can look past his fame mirrors in a sense as she longs for a partner who can look past her repulsiveness, or say the gods somehow tricked all mortal academia (at least via the Gylfaginning, which I just found cited on wikipedia while googling for info on her cause I'm no expert) into thinking she was ugly while in reality she's absolutely gorgeous, maybe even somehow related to the origin of the Veela race, and as a result of the unwanted attention she constantly gets from anyone she meets, she understands Harry's feelings towards his own fame far better then anyone...

** Asgardians don't exists they are the aesir and no human could compete with them. Also half of hels body is a rotted corpse and the other half is a living person. So really no one would marry her and loki would never try to do this. There is also a distinct lack of Norse mythology in this like why the fuck is thor even showing up.

I don't see anything wrong with calling the residents of Asgard 'Asgardian'. It's like calling people from the US 'American'. And there's nothing in the prompt about beating the gods. Why would Harry need to compete with them to pass the 'test'?

#+end_quote

Have you seen how zombies are portrayed in modern media? You could make it work if you wanted to. Plus, ever heard of fanfiction? People have paired characters with /apples/ and, being a goddess, Hel would probably be more attractive than your average rotting corpse.

That was my weak attempt at humour. Ignore that.

#+end_quote

Is there any reason Thor shouldn't be showing up? I don't remember a particularly adversarial relationship between the two in Norse mythology. And sure, Marvel got a lot wrong, probably because they're being depicted as not being gods, just superior extraterrestrials.

*** Dude, STFU. It's a prompt for a story, and considering that the stories of the Aesir have been written, rewritten, and translated many times. There's a high chance that even if such mythological beings exist, we got a lot of that story wrong. Second point, if it is just a story, who the hell cares. You're in the HPfanfiction sub dumbass. If you came here looking purely for canon, read the books.
