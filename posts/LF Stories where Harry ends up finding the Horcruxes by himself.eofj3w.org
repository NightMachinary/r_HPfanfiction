Maybe it's an accident and Hermione leaves with Ron, maybe because of the stress of the situation and the Horcrux that they're carrying all 3 of them say things that they don't mean.

I DON'T want OP Harry, Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful then in canon is fine, but I don't want him suddenly becoming an Animagus, learning Wordless or Wandless magic easily, et cetra.

I don't want bashing for Ron and Hermione, Harry can be angry at them/feel betrayed or whatever, but I'd rather the 3 of them make up by the end of the story.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be on any site.

Would rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine.
