Is just because he is good at chess? Or are there scenes in the books I fail to remember? If it is the former, I am pretty good at chess yet I can fairly say I would suck at battle strategy. Or any other strategy really.


** Because JKR didn't give Ron "a thing". That is, he doesn't have a narrative role that he can uniquely occupy as a protagonist. Harry is the "doer", Hermione is the "knower". It's obvious Ron was initially to be the "knows the wizarding culture" guy, but that was almost entirely taken over by Hermione by Prisoner of Azkaban, as you only see whispers of that later. And so, people grasp at the closest thing to an important role, which was his chess skill. But it's not even really disputable that said skill was never rolled into anything he did (and besides which being good at chess is not an indicator of strategic skill).

Annoyingly, Ron ended up being mainly relegated to starting drama in most of the books (please don't patronize me by disputing this, it's JKR's fault not yours). And that's really quite disappointing, as he could have made a great moral anchor for the trio. But alas, he was mostly left to the witty retorts which were still nice on occasion.

**** That's pretty true. JKR more or less points this out at least as being Ron's fear. He feared that he had nothing to offer Hermione in comparison to Harry. And since Hermione was willing to give up her feelings for Ron to continue helping Harry, he took that as confirmation that he was destined to be in Harry's shadow.

If read Philosopher's Stone and you see repeatedly that Ron has the understanding of his culture you'd expect of a child that grew up in it. "Don't say Voldemort's name", "Oh yeah, Slytherin's bad cause You-Know-Who was in it", "Hagrid's half-giant, no wonder he's never talks about it", "House-elves like what they do", "/invested in his favorite sports team/". These sorts of things and others. But they quickly were made unneeded since Hermione ended up knowing most of what they needed, so Ron's main "thing" was made irrelevant save for a couple of times he let's slip things native wizards know ("Oh yeah, Elder wands are supposed to be unlucky like in the children's story").

I mean, we know how it ended now, and he didn't exactly shower himself in glory throughout the series, but back at the three year summer when we thought he might redeem himself, it seemed as good an indication as any as to what he might bring to the table. These days, most people just write him out because he brings so little.

It's always boggled my mind that people thing Chess has any bearing on military strategy. And that being good at a game with a set rule structure and limited moves and almost unlimited time to make decisions translates into real world anything. In chess, twenty rooks can't show up on your left flank and fuck your shit up.

Everything we see of Ron indicates that he'd probably be a terrible strategist. He almost never makes strategic decisions and, if quidditch is any judge, he's awful under pressure.

He might be able to come up with a plan, sure. But nothing we see from him indicates he'd be able to make correct decisions in limited time while in a high stress environment.

I'm all for making characters good at something but Chess = Strategy is a bit of a logical stretch.

***** Absolutely. But what is chess ability often used to signify in fictional characters? The series goes hard on him being a chess player. Why? It turned out that it wasn't anything, but in the three year summer it seemed like it might be important.

Does chess = strategy? No.

Was it reasonable in the middle of the series, when trying to predict the roles that all the characters would play, to think that the guy who is praised for his chess ability in the first book might potentially have a role which involves instructing his friends in what moves to make against their enemy? It's as good as theory as any and better than many.

***** Even strategy games with a way more detailed military system ( eg Wargame Red Dragon) which model the ammunition of each squad/tank/plane in battles with thousands of soldiers aren't close to commanding an actual engagement.

Yes, there might be a nearly infinite amount of possible moves in a game of chess, but even the first RTS games surpassed that amount by several scales of magnitude. And no one would argue that warcraft 3 qualifies you to lead armies.

**** Okay but I think it was more of Ron wasn't just good at chess. Ron never lost. Even against McGonagall, who was 45 years his senior. Does that make him a war general? Not even close. But I can definitely see him, after some growth and maturity, being a sort of strategist. Again, he's definitely not some master of strategy, but he's definitely not some witless moron in that field.
