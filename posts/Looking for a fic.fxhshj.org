I remember that the twiwiz tournament had Ilvermorney in it as well and Peter Parker was the champion for it. I also remeber that Peter was at the graveyard after the final task and had his web shooters. I'm pretty sure thaere was also a quidditch tournament between the school, but im not 100% sure about that part. Finally I remember that each task was at a different school


** I think somewhere in act 2 of this [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13124008/1/]] Ilvermorny comes in
