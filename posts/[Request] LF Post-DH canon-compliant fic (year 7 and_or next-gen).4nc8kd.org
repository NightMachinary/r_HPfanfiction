Hi, I'm quite new at the whole fanfic thing, been reading a few of them on and off for a few years, and I'd love to finally find some novel-length, canon-compliant high quality post-Deathly Hallows fics, which focus on the trio in the aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts, their next year and so on. Also I'd love to find the same thing for a next-gen fic, canon-compliant, novel-length and all ! Thank you all for your suggestions !

** Yes, Cursed Child does seem to fit the requirement, but given that I'm kinda far away from London, I'll stick with fanfictions until I can get my hands on the script ;) And, of course I'm not looking for a Cursed Child compliant fic, even though the plot is all over the Internet, I doubt that fics can be compliant already ;) Thanks for the suggestion, I'll take a look at Not From Others !

  She may not have been able to join Harry, Ron and Hermione, but Ginny refuses to go down without a fight. As war approaches, Ginny returns to Hogwarts to resurrect Dumbledore's Army and face the darkest year the wizarding world has ever seen. DH from Ginny's POV. Canon.

** I don't know how to link. But I suggest going to HPFF and searching by author for Mrs_Granger she has a series of two stories that are exactly what you want.
