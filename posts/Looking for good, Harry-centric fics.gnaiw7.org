I think I've probably seen all the popular ones, but I might've missed some newer ones, so those are preferable.

Anything from light, gray to dark!Harry is fine, but it has to be believable and in character.

All pairings are fine except for Snape/Harry. I prefer Harry/Ginny, Harry/Hermione, Draco/Harry or Tom Riddle/Harry, but anything else is alright too. It can also be gen, or asexual Harry or whatever else.

I'd rather not read manipulative!Dumbledore, but if the fic is good and everything else is believable, I can deal. Good and good but misguided!Dumbledore is preferable though.

The things I absolutely can't read is a/b/o dynamics, mpreg and any type of bashing. And no Weasleys using Harry for the money, or Hermione not believing Harry during the triwizard tournament and things like that (it's fine if Harry is at odds with them for some good reason, if the story needs it, but I don't like when the story makes them do things that are out of character to create that conflict). I'd also rather not read OP Harry (strong!Harry is fine but it has to have progress and training to get to that point. Magically strong Harry is also fine, but he can't be unbeatable)

Thanks everyone! I'd be willing to offer some counter recs if anyone is interested and has the same tastes.


** Maybe you'll like my trilogy fic. It's about 30 year old Harry and Ginny's relationship as Harry is forced to take possession of the Elder Wand again. Drama/mystery genre, non-epilogue compliant, plenty of twists, plenty of OCs. I'm publishing the last part now, it will be complete at the end of June.

  It should have been a simple task. Escort Ginny Weasley to her Quidditch match. But it all changes when Harry Potter rents the wrong car. What started out as a simple road trip between two friends and past lovers quickly turns into a hellish game of cat and mouse, and Harry and Ginny find themselves running away from a mysterious and deadly group of mercenaries, through a Scotland plagued by a mysterious infestation of Dark creatures. Part one of the Elder Tales series.

  Part 3 of 3 in the Elder Tales series. After killing Hermione and her unborn child, Harry Potter wanders, guilt-stricken, over moors, through mysterious forests, and in the underworld of Belfast. With a cursed wand strapped to his arm, and a Death Eater and corrupt Minister on his heels, he is left wondering if he will ever be able to find forgiveness and come back home.

** Linkffn( A New Better Life by Ulltima101)

This is my own fic, it has a stronger Harry and in my opinion a different take on how the school year is made up and a much more interesting take on Harry is the heir to his house. There is a tag for draco-bashing but it hasn't happened yet and I've thought about taking it out completely and have him as more of a Rival!Draco

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again.
