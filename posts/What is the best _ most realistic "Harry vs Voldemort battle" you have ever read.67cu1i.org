Hey guys, I wanted to see what is the best or more realistic battle you have read between the two, in the context of the fic itself (With this I mean that if the story has set up everything so that Harry actually stands a chance in a magical duel against Voldemort, then that's realistic by my standars /as long as the fic has actually developed him in a believable way/. ). One shots and Novel-like are both welcome. Pairings are optional but I'm partial to H/Hr, but I'll read even a Harry / Ginny if its well written (To clarify, I have nothing against that last pairing, jsut not to my personal liking)

Thanks in advance for your time!


** linkffn(The One He Feared) Has a pretty great duel.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
