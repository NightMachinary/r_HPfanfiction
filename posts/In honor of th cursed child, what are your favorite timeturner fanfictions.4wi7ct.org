#+begin_quote
  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** Aorist Subjunctive by Minisinoo It is Harry/Cedric and is unfortunately unfinished. You have to download the ebook, I think it was taken off all of the fanfiction websites. I'm still holding out hope that she will finish it.

** Terry Boot/Snape This one was written before the last two books came out so some of the information about Snape's backstory isn't canon.

** My favorite is Overclocking--it's got some really cool backstory on what it's like to work in the Department of Mysteries; Percy as a real, 3-dimensional character; and the characters actually grapple with the seriousness of messing about with time. Also, it's just an engaging read, and I'm a sucker for well-written Hermione time travel fics. I will second the rec for One Hundred and Sixty Nine as well, though.

  Hermione Granger is an Unspeakable specializing in time. After collaborating with co-worker Percy Weasley to decrease the number of casualties from the war, she is in a constant battle against the Keeper of Time, who wishes to restore the original timeline. Her final test involves traveling back to 1979, where her mission is horrifying yet hilariously simple.

** I really like linkffn(Time on my Side by Mark Geoffrey Norrish), which is a book-canon-consistent time-turner (i.e., stable time loops only) fic where Harry and Hermione have to take a slightly more... convoluted path through time at the end of PoA.

** I've never really cared for time turner fics because of the whole "you can't change the past" bs. The whole point of going back in time is to fix the problems. If you can't fix the problems then the whole plot is moot.
