I recently got back into fanfiction hard and am really feeling Harry/Ginny and was looking for completed stories about them after the war, any recommendations are welcome. R/Hr in there would be a bonus. Any rating.


** Start with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]'s 84 story series, most of them are postwar.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum][FloreatCastellum]] writes great canon-compliant fics too. Check out "The Aurors", linkffn(11815544). This author is also active on this subreddit.

"In Case of Emergency", linkffn(4625848), is an almost epilogue-compliant smut fic with a decent plot.

"Out of the Fire and into the Cupboard" and "The Wendell That Wasn't", linkffn(4396574;9526039), are two hilarious postwar one-shots.

"Polyjuice, Memory Charms, and More", linkffn(4291790), is mostly a postwar smut fic. Chapter 1 begins with Harry and Ginny taking each other's form and having sex. Hermione found out and was mightily impressed.

  There's a reason that adults don't usually play hide and seek - especially when they are nothing more than overgrown children.

  When Harry and Ginny broke up, they thought they were each doing what was right for the other But is it possible for them to be "just friends", especially when it seems like someone keeps trying to kill them? Mature sexual themes.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

  Harry has defeated Voldemort but is going back to his life going to be easy? What will he go back to, the life he once had is meaningless now. It's time to build a new one and to create a new post-Voldemort world.
