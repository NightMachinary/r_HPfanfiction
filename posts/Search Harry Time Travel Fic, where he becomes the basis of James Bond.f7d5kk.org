:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So awhile back I read a fic where Harry was tossed back in time (very common plot), but he was sent back farther than his lifetime (still not uncommon). While there, he foils a Grindewald raid and winds up shagging Mad-Eye Moody's mom. He also happens to inspire a young Snape to learn how to make his cloak billow with an unseen wind (which he ironically wanted to learn from seeing older Snape). He eventually meets the writer of the James Bond books and becomes the man who the books are based on. There is more where he foils Magic Nazi shenanigans and so on, but those are the points that I can recall. I'd like to go back and revisit this fic, if it still exists online.
