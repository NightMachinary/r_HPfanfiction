At the beginning , Remus is obviously not conscious of your existence.


** "I thought werewolves weren't supposed to attack animagi."

"They're aren't. And he didn't seem interested in attacking either of us."

"We can't let Remus know about this. He'd never forgive himself."

"We can't let /anyone/ know about this. Even if Dumbledore kept him out of Azkaban, there's no way he wouldn't be expelled."

"If anyone asks, Peter has had a strange fascination with spiders lately, and probably went looking for an acromantula last night, right?"

*** You know it is covenient his form was a rat. This time he disappeared without leaving anything behind ^{^}

But any collaboration with Remus would be awkward in the future :

"So wanna be friends now that we can communicate ?"

"You ate Peter."

"Well i kinda regret it, he didn't taste good"

*** No, you just take over Remus's body when he transforms during the full moon.

You can evolve the situation from there by making Remus conscious of your existence outside of a full moon (other days of the month).

** I can see this going somewhere

​

"Arf?" went the werewolf, sitting awkwardly at the battered desk with typewriter.

Harry blinked. How the Hell does a werewolf get a typewriter, let along put paper in it.

And why oh why is it wearing a fez?

*** Harry walked slowly over, the werewolf huffing but wathching him with amber eyes.

The werewolf had been writing words using a typewriter.

'Harry crossed the room and took the hand of the blonde girl "I'm sorry" he said.

Daphne Greengrass blushed prettily "You didn't know" she said. "It's so difficult as a Slytherin who wants to ask a Gryffindor out"

'

Harry looked up form the page to eye the werewolf "What the hell are you writing?" asked Harry. "Daphne Greengrass? " Harry asked "From Slytherin".

The werewolf bobbed it's muzzle and sniffed thrice.

""Oh." said Harry "You can smell .... of bloody hell no." said Harry.

The werewolf, crouched on the chair in front of the typewriter growled.
