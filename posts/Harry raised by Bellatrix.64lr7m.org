I'm looking for a story where Bellatrix is Lily's best friend and ends up raising Harry and being named Lady Potter. Does anyone have a link to this or am I imagining that I read it?

  I believe in the black household the children, if they misbehaved were cruciod

I doubt it. There are painful spells that are not Unforgivable and are not permanently damaging.

*** It was. Other details I remember about it is she and Sirius were both Aurors, Harry was incredibly smart and quite powerful, his fighting style was like RDJ's Sherlock Holmes, and he saved Fleur from DE at the World Cup. I believe he also had an adopted younger sister.

  Harry Potter A/U. What if Harry was raised by Bellatrix Black? What if, while attending the Quidditch World Cup, Harry saved a young woman from a fate worse than death, incurring a life debt?

**** Yes! Thank you! For some reason I thought it was a Harry/Multi, I just knew Fleur was involved.

** I've read a few fics along that line...though I'd probably be witchunted by some members of this sub if I posted them.

Anyways, I'll try to dig some of them up tonight. I never really made a list of the stories I read, nor did I follow any. Huge mistake on my part.

  [HIATUS!]Deliciously Dark. Evil too. Bellatrix finds baby Harry left with the muggles & discovers his unusual accidental magical trait, one that she finds... Very Appealing. She decides to keep and groom him to be their next Dark Lord, and enlists the aid of Narcissa. Harry/Bellatrix, quasi-harem for a reason but H/B/N overall. M for a reason. THESE CHARACTERS ARE EVIL

***** Amen, my friend. It's definitely a car wreck, but one where you run over and kill the local (insert criminal who has been let out here). I liked it. It's both a blessing and a curse this was never finished.
