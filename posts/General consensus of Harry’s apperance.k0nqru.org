** I mean, fortunately he's never described in extreme detail so there's a lot of artistic licence here.

I think what we do know is that he's got knobbly knees, his nose is slightly shorter than James's and his eyes green, but other than that his face looks exactly like James's. I think their faces are described as 'thin', whatever that means. James is described as the generic 'tall' and we know Harry is within an inch of him when they're 15/16. We know Harry is short and skinny for his age before that.

We know from PS that Tom Riddle, famously handsome, think that the two of them look somewhat alike, whether he's referring to black hair or their faces we don't know.

As for how tall James (and therefore Harry) is, I feel like the consesnus I've heard of is slightly above medium height for British men? We know Sirius is more than a head taller than Pettigrew and taller than Snape and we never get Remus's height described, which possibly means he's medium height, Pettigrew shorter. James is described as tall, but not anything else, so likely he's between Remus and Sirius.

** He's described as being the same height as James, who is in turn described as "tall", so I would put Harry at about 6 feet, which is probably the shortest a man can be and still be considered "tall".

In terms of looks: skinny in frame (see references to being small, having knobbly knees, having the right build for a seeker, etc) but not emaciated. By his older teenage years, not as skinny as age 11, but still on the skinny side of athletic.

Attractive face - Hermione calls him "fanciable" in HBP, and he's said to resemble James who attracted admiring looks from girls in his OWL year.

** I just think he looks like he does in the movies but with green eyes

** In my fic, which is postwar, he's definitely a heartthrob, but it has more to do with his charisma than his actual looks. He has striking coloring and beautiful eyes, but his face is thin, angular, and not classically handsome like Cedric or Sirius. He's also short (5'7”) and more wiry than buff (he's a professional Seeker).

And yet he somehow makes it work. Consider an actor like Tom Hiddleston. He's not classically handsome either, but he's somehow so magnetic that he may as well be.

My Harry also has hopelessly untidy hair, but he starts dressing really well, which offsets it. If he were perfectly coiffed he'd look a bit douchey, but the contrast just looks cool.

Anyway, that's my Harry, but obviously other versions are valid.

** Very average looking, very skinny and not very tall either. That's the way I perceive him anyways, since he wasn't described as "Handsome" and the Dursley's didn't feed him enough he was skinny and in my head cannon, not very tall either.

** I imagine Harry as a normal looking boy. Harry looks almost exactly like James, who is never described as being handsome in any way. When they appear in the mirror, only Lily is described as attractive. I don't think it's because of Harry's an unreliable narrator, because Sirius is described as extremely handsome even when Harry thought he betrayed his parents. Also, JK Rowling said that all of the trio looked geeky, and that the actors were all too good looking.

** The idea that Harry is "severely malnourished" is certainly fanon, based only on the few days after the Dobby incident. Harry in general seems to have had enough food, but not more than that - which is of course a huge contrast from Dudley and Vernon. So he's skinny but still healthy.

His skin colour is up for grabs, there's nothing in canon preventing him from being part-Indian.

*** I mean, James family are known to be british purebloods and Petunia is described as a blonde haired woman.

idk, i can't actually find his background to be that of a darker colored person, mostly due to how Britain is described and for James or Fleamont to be anyway married to a family with indian heritage.

It isn't clear in canon if magical Britain colonized like their muggle counterparts did, they had been seperated for a while before Britain entered India.

**** Kingsley and Blaise are also British purebloods and members of the sacred 28 and they're both black. We know the Evanses are white, but not necessarily the Potters.

Look up some older threads if this is a new idea for you. It's been discussed in detail plenty and I don't want to write out everything rn

***** isn't Blaise supposed to be from Italian roots or is that fanon?

Statue of secrecy was introduced in the end of 17th century, India was colonized by the British in the 19th century.

Kingsley i have no idea about, he definetly has african roots somewhere, but again, at the point in time where Britain enforced the SOS, they hadn't colonized much yet

** I've always considered him to be small, bony, below average height, with signs of malnutrition and abuse still affecting his looks. I don't consider him a pretty boy, not one to plaster on Witch Weekly cover for most charming smile award. Not ugly, just ... meh looking.

In my mind, he could look lot better, if he actually took care of himself. Comb his hair, have a proper haircut, clip his fingernails instead of biting them, decent clothes that aren't threadbare, often dirty and several sizes too large and maybe have an extra shower or two ...

Dunno, I always get a feeling he has a bit of a "street urchin" look to him.

** I get my share of disgruntled PMs and reviews because I make Harry short. And unlike what those people complaining about it think, it is entirely unrelated to the actor since I honestly don't give a single fuck about any actor. I write Harry as short because he did not get sufficient food at the Dursleys and Hogwarts, although it provides plentiful food, does not provide a balanced diet either. Nor is Harry ever treated for said malnutrition. Canon has growth spurts for Harry, but even if he grew the same amount as Ron during those he'd end up shorter because he started with less height (the first book is explicit about that).

*** My rule is that if Hermione gets to look anything like Emma Watson, Harry has to be short.

** I always thought of him as average looking because I don't remember James being described as handsome. So yeah, average.
