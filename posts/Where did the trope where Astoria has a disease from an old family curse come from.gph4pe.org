And my whole point is that that idea is ludicrous. Actual real-life psychopaths cannot love, but they still have sex drives. Though as I mentioned in another post, any sexual desire of Voldemorts would be very domineering and sadistic in nature.

In canon, Bellatrix shows signs of sexual desire to Voldmort, though I do understand the disgust you have the thought lol.

J.K. Rowling: It was a symbolic way of showing that he came from a loveless union -- but of course, everything would have changed if Merope had survived and raised him herself and loved him."

I really didn't want to bother addressing this, but the love potion thing was symbolic in showing that everything in and about his life was loveless, even his conception. Seriously, one of the stories main premises is that we are who we choose to be, it is our choices that matter. And yet everyone immediately accepts that being conceived under a love potion automatically makes one incapable of love, and apparently asexual as well, rather than the outcome of a long series of bad choices made by himself and his parents before him.

Honestly, if the love potion aspect was literal truth rather than symbolic, it would be a known thing, because despite how despicable we may find love potions, they are a part of wizarding culture. They are literally for sale in joke shops for crying out loud. Tom Riddle cannot be the only person to have ever been conceived because of a love potion.

Despite the inability to love, its perfectly reasonable for Voldemort to have a sex drive, that being said any sexual relationship would be extremely domineering and sadistic on his part.

Also, as a teenager maybe, but as an adult, Voldemort could in no way be considered high functioning. The man is the leader of a evil organization, hellbent on taking over their country and committing genocide, doing so my means of murder, overiding freewill, and many other heinous acts.
