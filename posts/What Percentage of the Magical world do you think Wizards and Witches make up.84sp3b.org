Compared to the rest of the Magical world combined (Giants,Goblins,Pukwudgie ,Vampires,House elves, Veelas, Merpeople ,Centaurs and dwarves, ect) how big a percentage do you think Wizards and witch make of the magical world ?

and How big a percent of the Population in the magical world do you think is made up people who are part-giant,Veela,Goblin,ect make of of the wizarding world?


** Honestly, I would say for magical sensitive creatures, a tiny percentage.

Think about IRL. I think rodents outweigh us by several times. And that's not considering the wand trees and more familiar animals.

I'd peg the guess at an easy 10,000:1 outweighing humans

** Of the significant magical beings, I say about 1000:1. I'm not counting owls or rodents or anything. With the Secret being in place they would have to keep magical livestock like firecrabs, Hippogryphs would have to be kept at low numbers. We don't see hundreds of Veela running around the magical world and we know the magical governments keep the Giants Numbers low and in confined areas.

*** Apart from the Giants we aren't really told much in canon we only really see five public places in the Magical world Hogwarts, Hogsmeade Village, Diagon alley, The Ministry of Magic and The Quidditch world cup campsite really Harry is kept very Isolated from the magical world.

Which is what makes the Harry Potter world such a fun play ground for Fanfiction and theory crafting.

Because if I wanted to I could make the argument that Non-human Magical beings are kept away from all but The Quidditch world cup campsite.

Hogwarts-Is a School for Witchcraft and Wizardry so it in unsurprising that harry Doesn't run into many Non-Human magical beings.(and 25% of non Defence teachers during harry time at school were Non-human/part human magical beings)

Hogsmeade Village- Seem to take Pride in being the only all-wizarding village in Britain so Non-Human Magical being are probably kept away from there.(its the only all-Wizarding Village in Britain not the only all-magical Village in britain)

Diagon alley- Is a Gateway between the Muggle and magical worlds so the non-human Magical being are probably kept away from there Its also the place were Muggleborns and there parent are introduced to the magical world so there might be a Place that Non-human are Discouraged from going there.

The Ministry of Magic- Seems pretty Wizard only from what we seem

leaving only The Quidditch world cup campsite were harry might have run into some non-Human magical beings and even then he probably wouldn't because of Non-human magical being were probably kept on Different campsite to the Wizards and harry was in the Ministry box for the game.

**** I think it mostly comes down to culture and communication barriers and being physically unable to live in the same place.

For instance; centaurs make it pretty clear that they consider themselves very much separate from humans and aren't willing to live among them. A formal aqquaintance is possible, but not living in the same place.

Then we have giants and merpeople, who physically can't live in the same place as wizards. Giants because of their size, aggression and inablity to blend in with other people, therefore not being able to mingle among muggles like wizards can. And merpeople are excluded from much of the wizarding world simply because they have to live underwater.

Goblins, like centaurs, seem to have such a fundamentally different mindset to humans that they also can't peacefully live toghether. There is constant friction between the two races. As their cultures and outlooks on life and magic differ so greatly.

With different species having completely different mindsets, it's not surprising to me that things like Quidditch are wizard only. They have different interests than other magical beings.

The same thing goes with government. We know for instance that centaurs want to be considered beasts instead of beings because they want to stay out of human politics. And while goblins do want a say, there is a constant battle for dominance between humans and goblins. It's possible that goblins have their own governing system amongst themselves, but the wizards are determined to be the dominant magical species in the world and govern most others.

Lastly there are other things to consider. For instance, you need a wand in order to enter Diagon Alley. You need to be human in order to be a witch or wizard and able to attend Hogwarts. As Griphook said, wizards don't share their knowledge of wandlore with other species, so only humans can attend Hogwarts. And many magical beings wouldn't be able to take part in quidditch because they can't physically sit on a broomstick.

***** I agree The wizards and Witches seem to be the Middleman between the Muggle and Magical worlds.

I think the other magical races probably have there own magic that they Keep to themselves like The Goblins and there blacksmithing techniques that are used to make Weapons like Gryffindors Sword.

and needing a wand to get into Diagon Alley sort of fits with the idea that the Wizards and Witches are the Gatekeepers between the Muggle and magical world.

I would not be surprised to find out that the Wizards and Witches are just as separate from the Wider magical world as they are from the Muggle one. after all from what we see the wizards and witches are Hated by the Majority of magical races we see in the canon(if you don't could house elf's I don't think that we meet a Single race that is on good terms with WIzards)

** I'm not great with numbers, so I'm not going to go into that. But it depends on whether you're talking about sentient magical beings or magical animals as well.

First of all, I think that one of the biggest factors is acromantula. Since they're like spiders and as we see with Aragog, as single acromantula pair can have thousands of children. Whether or not you count acromantula will make a big difference. They're more like animals that other magical beings, but they do have sentience.

Second, we know that there are very few giants left. And since vampires used to be humans, but not all humans become vampires, there are likely far fewer vampires than wizards. Unless due to their semi-immortality their numbers have steadily increased without old vampires dying off.

Then if we look at merpeople; one small lake already has an entire merpeople village. So worldwide, assuming they can live in multiple bodies of water, there must be huge numbers.

We know that there are reserves for dragons, which suggests to me that they are rare and therefore need to be protected. Though with them being dragons it's also possible that they are kept in reserves not due to a threat of extinction, but due to the dangers for muggles of them living in the wild.

Those are the main ones where I think we can get an idea of how many there are.
