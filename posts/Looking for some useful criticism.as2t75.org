** Piece of advice number one: post it on fanfiction.net or Ao3, e.g. websites that have a wider audience and where you don't have to register to read it.

  The sound came from the dining room at the other end of the hall. Lucius Malfoy was awake at once, his hand grasping for the wand he kept, always, at his side. The room was dark save for the faint lines of moonlight that streaked across the mahogany floor, casting distorted shadows of the window frame and trees beyond. He wondered how long he had been sleeping. The dull ache in his lower back seemed to indicate it had been a while however the odd aches and pains were not uncommon at his age. Wincing slightly, Lucius moved forward in his chair. The house was silent now and every groan that escaped his lips seemed tumultuous in volume.
#+end_quote

[This first part with the sound is passive and not very descriptive. You have no one experiencing or making the sound and you give the reader no idea what the sound is like. It's not very interesting. What kind of sound is it? A bang? A rattle? A creak? The sound of the wind? Thunder? You have an opportunity here to set the scene. Lucius is your POV person---make the reader experience the story through him. Make Lucius hear the sound and identify it and react to it.]

[The bit about the moonlight and the window frame and trees is overdone and seems out of place. Moonlight and streak aren't usually words that go together. A simpler way to get across the same idea would be “the moonlight shone on the mahogany floor, casting distorted shadows”. It doesn't really matter what the shadows are of, just that there are shadows.]

[On my first read-through, I didn't understand that Lucius was in a chair. What kind of chair is it? You have an opportunity to set a scene of an old man that falls asleep in his chair rather than seeking his bed and it's just kind of wasted here.]

#+begin_quote
  When did I get so old?

  It seemed to take an age before he made it to the doorframe despite the sitting room being a mere box compared to the luxury of his previous home. With a wave of his wand the lanterns that lined the walls of the hallway ignited with a soft woosh. Lucius paused a moment to listen for any responding sounds before making his way, slowly, down the hall. He would not pretend he was not afraid. It was difficult for him to recall a time when he wasn't afraid. Narcissa slept upstairs, the combination of Firewhisky and sleeping draughts always ensured she had a restful night and he would not wake her now for something so silly.
#+end_quote

[What is the sitting room like? Is it old and shabby? Small but well-appointed? It seems like the Malfoys have fallen, but you're not doing a very good job of setting things up. Mentioning previous luxury is good, but what's it like now? Peeling wallpaper? Worn, second-hand furniture? Good quality but old? Poor, cheap IKEA stuff? Give the reader something to look at.]

#+begin_quote
  It was a noise. It could have been anything. Nothing.

  Lucius kept his wand raised as he approached the dining room. Everything was still. In the darkness he could distinguish the shapes of their pitiful table and chairs. The cabinet in the far side of the room was a monstrous shape in the gloom. And the windows at the far end...
#+end_quote

[Pitiful table and chairs is a good description, but have Lucius think of something to contrast with. How is this a comedown?]

#+begin_quote
  The window is open!

  Heart hammering in his chest, Lucius moved forward cautiously. The thin, pale fingers which grasped his wand shook. Just as he came around the side of the table it happened. The shape flew up at him from the darkness, knocking him off balance and causing him to cry out in fear. His wand flew from his hand and rolled away across the floor and before he could pull himself to his feet his attacker hoooed at him.
#+end_quote

[The first part is good, but I'd get rid of the “it happened” part. Just have the action happen. ‘The thin, pale fingers which grasped his wand shook. Just as he came around the side of the table a shape flew up at him ...” Just have it happen in the moment. The rest of this part is good.]

#+begin_quote
  “Damn you!” Lucius spat at the grey owl perched on the back of one of the dining chairs. It stared down at him with wide, innocent eyes and watched, unblinking, as he struggled to stand. Glaring, he detached the scroll of parchment and followed the bird to the window, slamming it closed as the owl took off into the night.
#+end_quote

[This is good!]

#+begin_quote
  “I must have left it open earlier,” he muttered, unsure. His memory was not as it once was and he often found open doors and windows around the home that he could not recall opening.
#+end_quote

[Also good.]

#+begin_quote
  By the light of the moon, Lucius unravelled his letter and frowned at the words scrawled across it.

  DEATH EATER SCUM

  He could [would] have laughed if he had not felt so tired. It didn't seem to matter where they went, the owls always followed. He imagined a group of sniggering teens compiling [composing] this letter and sending it off to torment the Old [old] Malfoys some more. Angrily, he began tearing [tore] it apart, letting the scraps float to the floor in a pile. In a moment of madness, he grasped [reached] for his wand meaning to ignite each peace [piece] until they crisped and burned before he realised that he had dropped his wand earlier when the damned bird had flew at him. Cursing the creature, he turned to search the floor and found himself face to face with death.
#+end_quote

[Good action here. I can see Lucius ripping apart the paper and reaching for his wand. Now, question---do you maybe want to do “D” death here?]

#+begin_quote
  It was the first thing that came to his mind. The hooded figure with grey mask could be no one else, surely. How else could he sneak up on him so silently? Lucius could only stare in horror as the intruder raised a gloved hand and twirled Lucius's wand between the [its] fingers.

  “Lost something?” the [unfamiliar] voice teased, unfamiliar and muffled by the mask which allowed [had] only a thin slit for a mouth hole.

  Before Lucius could reply, the mystery man slid the wand down the sleeve of his cloak and brandished his own wand in the [its] other hand.

  “Who are you?” Lucius demanded, his voice shaking, betraying his fear. “How dare you presume to enter my home?”

  “Should I have knocked first?” The tone was mocking.

  “What do you want here? We have no money, no valuables. We've got-“

  “Nothing? And yet you have far more than you deserve, it seems to me. A cell in Azkaban would be too good for your likes [for the likes of you is a more common way to phrase this]. Forgive me if I don't weep for your troubles. I didn't come here to talk.”

  “No.” Lucius could feel the terror climb up into his throat, filling his mouth with the sour taste of it. His stomach heaved and he had to grip the chair on his right to stop from trembling. “Why did you come here?”
#+end_quote

[Nice. I personally would take out the “feel”---that's a bit on the passive voice side and more telling rather than showing. Have Lucius experience the terror. Example: The terror climbed up his throat, filling his mouth with the sour taste of it.]

#+begin_quote
  “To kill.”

  The last thought that went through Lucius Malfoy's head was of his wife, asleep upstairs.

  Sleep Narcissa. You must stay asleep!
#+end_quote

[All in all, not too bad. I can sympathize with the desire to dive right into the story, but you miss out on a lot of scene setting here. Obviously, the Malfoy's circumstances are very different from how they are in canon, but you don't put a lot of effort in indicating how different. Lucius is older, but how much older? Also, watch for instances of telling rather than showing. Make your characters hear the things, feel the things, do the things. There is so much more you can do with this and you're barely scratching the surface. I see you have several chapters and they're all very short, so I'm going to guess that they're in a similar vein. Remember, you're making a movie for your reader to see in their head---try to think of ways you can get them to see what you see.]

**** Yeah, no worries! I know you want to get on to the exciting stuff (swords, magic, true love!), but taking your time and really helping the reader visualize what you are trying to tell them will really pay off. It doesn't have to be crazy long-winded, either. Have Lucius notice things about the room--shabby wallpaper, a musty smell, a moth-eaten rug. But, make Lucius /experience/ these things because he's your reader's avatar.

#+begin_quote
  Lucius started awake at the loud sound echoing through the house, nearly sending the old wingback chair over backwards. What was that, he thought, rising slowly on creaking knees. He wrinkled his nose at the musty smell of the old chair as he gripped the back of it, making sure of his balance after sitting so long.
#+end_quote

So there you go. That gives the reader a bit more of a mental image--smelly old chair, older, less physically firm Lucius--and it didn't take a ton of words to get there. Now he can roll into the dining room, get startled by the owl and meet Death! And then swords, magic and true love!
