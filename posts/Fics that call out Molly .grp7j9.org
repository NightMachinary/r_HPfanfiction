Very specifically for that argument she and Sirius have in book 5.

Like to be fair I think Sirius is not the most responsible and he got locked up at 21 and his life kinda stopped then. I very much think that he needs more time to look after himself and taking care of a kid is not the best choice he could make if other people were stepping up to be the parent instead. Molly would likely be a better parent than Sirius at that moment.

But telling him that he wasn't there for Harry because he spent all those years in Azkaban was such a low blow and so mean. And then Sirius dies and its never really brought up again.

I don't hate Molly for the record I actually like her. But I just wanna see her called out for somethings like this.

preferably non bashing

Not really? Molly would be a terrible parent for Harry. At any time. She smothers and dictates everything. And has the subtlety and social grace of Hagrid. Howlers... in the main Hall? Really? Yes, let's air our dirty laundry for everybody to enjoy. Like the above argument. In front of everybody?

Okay, tangent over.

-

The right way to bite back over something out of her control would be to conjure/summon a world map, insert it into a howler and release it to ask "Like you know better, what country is your next kid going to escape to after you push them too far?" Yes, do it all in front of her too.

There, you hit below the belt for something she /probably/ had nothing to do with or control over, and made a dig at her penchant for airing the family's dirty laundry to the public.

*** I mean Molly has her flaws yes. And I don't mean to say Sirius would be a bad parent. Just that Sirius is dealing with a lot at the moment and he kinda needs some time to focus on himself and a lot of support.

I mean he just got out of Azkaban and now is trapped in the family home he never wanted to go back to. So not that he couldn't be a parent at the moment but not being a parent would mean a bit more time focusing on himself giving himself a break which he gets less of a chance to do if he had the responsibility of a parent.

Being a parent isn't the only way to be there for Harry either which Sirius demonstrates for the years Harry has with him despite not actually being Harry's parent.

when Ron was away at school? not really, apart from maybe sending genuinely dangerous things in the mail like with Hermione's mail in GoF, and that doesn't seem Molly's style.

#+end_quote

no one talked about a LOT of things that happened in the books, though. Harry's the quintessential unreliable narrator; for the most part, if it doesn't directly relate to Harry's journey, Rowling doesn't add it in.

a Howler isn't just getting scolded by a parent in the moment; it's thought out in advance and sent over. Molly, having attended Hogwarts, would know that students receive mail at breakfast and that therefore everyone in the hall at the time would hear it. that's planning out her son's humiliation in advance, which is emotional abuse.

Don't get me wrong, I Molly isn't my favorite (though I do think she means well most of the time) but I don't think the howler was too bad

Maybe that's because of the way I was raised though. I would probably forget it even happened after a week.

Now that I think about it, Sirius /could/ have walked out any time. I think the nominal explanation is that it wouldn't matter since he couldn't find Pettigrew and prove his innocence until 1993, but that doesn't work very well either. For one thing, I think that he was more interested in revenge than in justice. For another, even if he managed to steal a wand, living as a wizard outlaw would have been far more comfortable than as an Azkaban prisoner.

In any case, Harry didn't play a big part in his motivation; so perhaps Molly was justified.

*** Well I think it's really hard to find the motivation when stuck in Azkaban. And Sirius for a while was probably stuck in self loathing. I believe he blamed himself for what happened to James and Lily. And he didn't know where Pettigrew was, once he did he finally got motivation to take revenge.

Molly does have a point that for a while Harry wasn't Sirius' number one priority.

*** Very good point. Sirius always had the capacity to turn into Padfoot and escape. Though if I remember correctly part of how he escaped was by being so skinny he could slip through the bars as a dog. Even then though with how prisoners were treated that probably didn't take more than a year to reach that point.

​

I think the biggest point in Sirus's favor is the madness of Azkaban. He was already half mad with grief and rage when he was thrown in there and rapidly had his happy memories of James, Lily and Harry stripped away. All that he was left with for years was the bitter knowledge that he was innocent, but that he had as good as killed the Potter's himself. With any positive or happy thoughts about yourself and others taken away what reason is there to escape? He knew Dumbledore was taking care of Harry, but any happiness at the idea of escaping to take care of Harry himself would have been stolen away too. It took a severe shock in seeing Wormtails photo and knowing he was in a position to kill Harry, plus the fact that he had held on to some shred of his identity through the unhappy thought of his innocence, and the fact that he had protected his mind to an extent as Padfoot, to give him enough of an obsession, a "fire in his head that the dementors couldn't destroy", that he could focus on escaping.

Thinking about that, I don't blame him for not escaping earlier. I'm sure he thought about it, about doing his duty as a godfather, about raising a smiling happy Harry, but lost those thoughts and memories under the influence of the dementors. It's why no one else ever escaped from Azkaban on their own. The number of factors needed to give someone both the mental state and the physical/magical ability to escape are just too rare.

I also don't blame him for not immediately focusing on Harry and focusing on his revenge first. He's literally a broken man, with a broken mind, and broken memories. I think seeing Harry at Privet Drive, being in Hogwarts on occasion, watching Harry fly, etc, were all things that he needed to even be in the partially sane mindset he was in by the end of the book.

*** In theory, yes. But I think he considered Azkaban his personal punishment for suggesting Pettigrew as the secret keeper. He said that he had killed the Potters (with his actions, not directly). Only when he saw Pettigrew he knew that he still had a purpose to fulfill. And only when he saw Number 4 in 1993 he realised that perhaps there is another duty for him (he did suggest Harry moving in with him after all).

He seemed to believe that Harry was happy with his family, what was he to do, escape and make Harry accomplice to an outlaw ? And that's assuming Harry even believes him if he explain how he didn't betray his parents.

*** I mean its Azkaban I do think if he thought he could break out he would. But I think its hard to focus or think in there. My theory is that news paper managed gave him this concrete thing to focus on a concrete thing to do. That sorta clear direction could really give him something tangible to hold on to that could be beneficial to him. It was also not necessarily good therefore the Dementors couldn't feed on it.

Its true that Harry didn't really play a part in motivating his escape. But it really doesn't make it justified for Molly to say he wasn't there for Harry just because his reason for breaking out after being unjustly imprisoned, wasn't Harry, and instead was the actual culprit.

Besides until he found a place to settle he couldnt take care of Harry in the sense of adopting him. And in book 3 he's very unhinged. But he does help out alot in book four while hanging out in caves and eating rats so I'd say Harry was still a big priority for him.
