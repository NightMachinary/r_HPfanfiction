No slash. Complete or in progress fics. Which unfortunately means linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi) doesn't qualify. Any rating, though nothing smut driven.

On a completely unrelated note, I have no idea why people hate fics that use Magical Cores, even though I myself believe in something else.

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

**** I'm sorry, I misread your request, there are slash elements but the overall fic is incredibly good and honestly, the slash is written the same as any heterosexual relationship. But, if it's still not your thing, anyone else who wants your request and is okay with slash can read it?

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

*** It's quite similar to magical cores actually. I believe in Magicals having the ability to draw magic from around them into their reservoirs, with there being multiple types. Like some being more potent at drawing large amounts of magic for a single spell, others being more efficient, allowing them to cast more spells off one 'filling' of the reservoir, etc...
