The bones of his father he took with his blessing, ironically unknowingly. His shade had been called forth using Death's stone, and he gave permission gladly.

A moment of hesitation was overcome through a twang from the Cruciatus enchantment on Wormtail's Dark Mark, making his willingness meaningless.

Harry shouted his defiance at his parents' betrayer, including "take my blood then, you imbecile!"

The careful balance of two unstoppable forces present in that blood was not preserved in the sample taken.

When the cauldron erupted with a blinding light, it was not the sleek form of Lord Voldemort standing there, but a monstrosity more terrible than anyone could have imagined.

TL:DR, Eldritch, Insane Voldemort who was reborn as an intelligent Shoggoth.


** I read a fic long ago that had the theory that 'father' meant closest magical ancestor because rituals were written by purebloods for purebloods and they didn't think it was necessary to specify it. /If the filthy mudbloods dare try out a ritual, let them suffer!/

The flesh of a servant had to be taken from one's house elf, the perfect embodiment of a /willing/ servant.

There are several fics where Pettigrew botches the potion or the previous diet of Nagini's milk causes Voldemort to have snake-like appearance. These often leads to Snape brewing an antidote and Voldemort 'regaining sanity' and becoming the cunning, suave politician who makes people swoon over his good looks.

**** Umm... no I don't, sorry. Most of the fics I read few years ago have become a congealed mass of ideas in my head. I distinctly remember only a few which are either quite unique or repeatedly recommended.

** I once wrote an outline for a short story about the resurrection scene. Where the book Riddle read about the resurrection ritual was actually only a copy of a copy of a copy of the ritual. The correct ritual required all of the bones of the father (properly cleansed, purified, soaked in a saline mineral solution. Flesh of the servant actually required only flesh (no bones in the hand, hair, nails AND as little blood as possible). Blood of an enemy required the enemy to be of age, thus introducing the possibility Dumbledore and the Ministry declaring Harry Potter of age the ones responsible for the ritual working. However only a symbolic amount of blood was taken. In the scenario all of this was just barely enough to initiate the ritual but not complete it. So Riddle drew on his own magic and the magic he was connected to (his soul anchors and Nagini) to successfully complete the ritual. The ritual when completed gave him a body but with all of his magic bound/committed to first conjuring the body then maintaining the body and with all of his soul anchors gone. He was alive, whole and muggle, with no means of regaining his magic. Irony.

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.
