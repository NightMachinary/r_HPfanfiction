I'm looking for a story I have read along time ago. Voldemort won, but there is still a resistance. Harry is captured and then de-aged, but still has his memories. Voldemort is trying to get Harry to love him like a father figure and gain his loyalty. I can't remember the title of this story, but remember it was on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. Please help.
