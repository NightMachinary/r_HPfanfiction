After the war Harry heads to Sunnydale or moves through dimensions to the Buffyverse. Has anyone read any fics like that?

None of these are great, but they're the only three HP/Buffy crossovers within the "readable, almost good" range.

** There's a crackish one where Harry ends up there when someone summons the master of death or something... The summoner's intent is to summon Lucifer IIRC, so when Harry shows up kinda cranky the scoobies do some assuming.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1098763/1/When-Harry-Met-Buffy][When Harry Met Buffy]] was pretty decently written, but pretty short.

** There's a multi-cross by Tenhawk called [[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=35][Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council]] that, though abandoned (apparently) is still worth a read (109 chapters and a partially done sequel, so a good bit of story despite being incomplete). It's not quite what you're after, but one of the better HP/Buffy crossovers.

In total, it's a HP/Buffy/Addams Family crossover.

** Sadly I haven't seen one good fic that matches your description. I've only read one good HP/Buffy story and that's [[http://liz-marcs.livejournal.com/144724.html][A Gift of Ordinary Magic]]. It's worth reading, especially since it's a Christmas story and it's that time of year.

** I once read one where Xander is sent into the HP-Universe to be a guide to Harry. Forgot what it's called, though.
