Do you have to be sorted in a House to becomeit's Head when you become a teacher later on? Or is it just an issue of 'Do you want to be or not?'


** I would personally think that Heads of Houses ought be an alumnus from that house: ideally, Heads of Houses should probably espouse the values of their house they care for very strongly, and feel very protective toward their charges.

Of course, it's possible that a foreigner or someone from a different house might have strong qualities of Gryffindor or whatever, and still feel protective toward their charges, but what one would have to take into account is how much they understood that particular house's experience.

For example, a Ravenclaw Head of House would probably be very used to dealing with riddles after going through seven years of them at Hogwarts, and might be expected to write (or recycle) them. A Gryffindor Head of House would have to understand how best to deal with Gryffindor brashness or recklessness while still being relatively positive; similarly, a Slytherin Head of House would need to exhibit cunning in dealing with their charges, as well as understanding what it's like to /be/ Slytherin.

I think that's the crucial thing here - tradition probably dictates that the pastoral elements of being a Head of House would include being able to directly empathize with their students because they'd been in that position themselves.
