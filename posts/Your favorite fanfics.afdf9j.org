With Harry Potter dead, and Hermione in emotional pain, can her growing up in the Marauder's era change the outcome of the war forever? Or will everyone just have more to lose?

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

*** I think that Grow Young With Me is a great story with a summary that doesn't do it justice. It sounds unbearably sweet and/or angsty, but both of those are actually in much better balance, and the result is quite touching.

It may be a bit spoilery, but I would have been more motivated to read it sooner if it had simply noted that this is a widowed Harry (previously married to Ginny and with their canon three children).

If you wanted to give it a go, that would totally make my day!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13125917/1/Trading-Places][Trading Places]]

When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard as he learns to separate the magical fantasy world he's always known from its dark reality. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, Dan's happy days at Hogwarts are certainly numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. But what can Dan do, in Harry's place? And how high will the cost be... to switch them back?

​

But since you asked, here are some that I really love!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/763509/Annerb][Annerb]] (I'm sure you've seen this one around, but I just read it recently, and it's freaking glorious.)

Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error][The Bureaucratic Error]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/49515/Iniga][Iniga]] (One of my fave authors, and I love this story. WIP)

As the Battle of Hogwarts draws to a close, Remus Lupin finds that dying isn't as quick and easy as they'd promised Harry. Even still, he probably shouldn't have gotten sarcastic with an all-powerful force beyond his comprehension unless he wanted to find himself five years in the past, having undone both Voldemort's defeat and his own son's birth. In progress.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12890642/1/The-Collectors][The Collectors]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1585368/James018][James018]] (Another one of my fave authors. One shot. It's hard to write a clever mystery, but James does it so well.)

Harry Potter wakes up in an unfamiliar place, missing parts of his memory. His only clue to what happened to him is a young woman who claims to be his Auror partner. They are supposedly hot on the trail of a major criminal organisation, but as Harry is about to find out, not all is as it seems.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12437451/1/Veritas-Omnia-Vincit][Veritas Omnia Vincit]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/555858/Heatherlly][Heatherlly]] (I just found this one and it's really good! WIP)

Lily and Severus reconcile after her marriage to James, beginning an affair that will have long-lasting consequences. Canon compliant until "The Half-Blood Prince". Eventual Severitus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5906606/1/A-Second-Chance-For-Happiness][A Second Chance For Happiness]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2237626/original-star-girl-78][original-star-girl-78]] (This one actually made me appreciate a Ginny/Snape story when the concept is completely not my thing at all. But it's brilliantly done.)

Ten years after Voldemort's demise, Severus Snape, thought by all to be dead, lives out his days in solitude. Ginny Potter, meanwhile, juggles a high-profile career, three children and a workaholic husband. What happens to change their lives forever?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13160266/1/Basilisk-Eyes][Basilisk Eyes]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/10025989/Hegemone][Hegemone]] (This one has a very interesting concept and it's very addictive! Another WIP)

As he slays the Basilisk, Harry is dowsed in blood and venom . . . some gets in his eyes. Blind!Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10772496/1/The-Debt-of-Time][The Debt of Time]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5869599/ShayaLonnie][ShayaLonnie]] (Do I even need to list this one? I wasn't going to, but hey just in case).

When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. *Art by Freya Ishtar*
