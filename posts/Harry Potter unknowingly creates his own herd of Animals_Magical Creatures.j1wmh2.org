So, if someone takes an interest of this, then please do feel free to have a go at it! :>

/[Anyway, Magical Creatures have always interested me when reading the books and watching the movies. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them only solidified that.]/

Alright, so the general idea is that this either starts in 1st year, or 2nd year. Or perhaps if you want more freedom, then you can decide on the year.

Harry is not treated that well from the Dursley's - Like Canon - with a bit more... emotional abuse and neglect. Which means that Harry can simply run away at most times towards the closest farm or pet shop to spend time with animals of all kinds [Pigs, Dogs, Cats, Horses, even Cows.]

Harry is less sociable towards people, but he loves animals, and he falls in love with Magical Creatures of all kind, and always wants to be around them and or nurture them.

/[You can also make it so he owns a farm, or a lot of land for the animals and himself]/

However, the people who befriend him /[Despite how few that may be]/ will always be supportive of him.

So somehow, Harry managed to befriend many different breeds of Magical Creatures/Animals from around Hogwarts and the Forbidden Forest [Possibly the Basilisk as well] and creates a very crazy and amazing herd of different animals and Magical Creatures, and he treats them like family, and in turn, they treat him like family. [Almost like they all have thier own little community, despite the species differences]

*The pairing for this, well, the really doesn't have to be a pairing for this, however, I would prefer it to be M/F.*

Anyways, please let me know on what you think about this, tell me is it good, bad or possibly even 'cute' in a sense. I would try to write this myself, however, I am not comfortable or confident with writing in the Fandom just yet.


** I love this!
