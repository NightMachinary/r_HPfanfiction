I'm a grammar pedant but, I like to think, not overly so: I don't care about minor points like the gerund, which vs that, and I can tolerate comma splicing. I'm looking for PJO crossovers that don't make my eyes bleed.

Criteria:

- Appropriate use of dialogue tags (I don't know what it is about the PJO fandom, but they seem to have a collective allergy to the word 'said', which is a major bugbear of mine).
- On that note, judicious use of adverbs.
- Involves Percy, because I love him.

  - A well-written Percy, too; not one that does nothing but rave about blue cookies and how much he loves Annabeth.

- Preferably no slash, but I'm flexible.
- No genderbending.
- Complete or frequent, recent updates.

Thanks all!


** "not one that does nothing but rave about blue cookies and how much he loves Annabeth"

This, my friend, is the relatable story of the ages.

***** There are several non-demigod au fics actually, which are pretty good. Mortal au fics are actually my favourite to read among pjo

Pertemis is ok, there are couple good ones but most are just the same banishment/betrayal things which suck

****** I like mortal AU PJO fics, and the fluff in Percabeth one-shots is unmatched, but it's still written by 12-year-olds with a 12 year-old's understanding of spelling, punctuation and grammar.

Smut in PJO is some of the worst out there. Probably because, again, 12-year-olds.

**** Can you really blame em tho. It's hard to build a good world in pjo because it's centered around New York. Unless it's a fic based in the past you have to make pretty wack changes like Percy being blessed by a shit ton of gods for it to be revelant

***** Yeah, there are not many different ways you can take this series. Partially because I think there are much less plot holes than other books/shows and also most readers are content with how the story went.

Like for harry potter, most deviations are due to the readers being unsatisfied with how a certain part was written.

Also there is not much to infer from the world building from pjo, it's good but like it is basic Greek gods stuff nothing too fancy.

****** Yep. This is why is think pjo crossovers are far superior then just pjo. You can practically turn the story in any direction and with that comes new magic systems and plots. But I guess it's a testament to how good the original series is. There's practically no way to make it better lol.

** The series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1546498][Bonum Chao]] is promising, but it doesn't have canon PJO characters in Hogwarts. Percy and Harry are twins, separated at birth. Percy is a squib (or Harry is muggleborn, I guess). The author doesn't appear to be allergic to the word 'said' but unfortunately they /are/ yet another author that has no idea how to punctuate dialogue. Linking part 3, as the earlier bits don't involve PJO and it isn't actually necessary to read part one and two. The last update was saturday (part 4).

Note that the boys are young yet: still pre-camp.

linkao3(23965276)

Also: subscribing to see what else gets linked, because there's a lot of garbage in this crossover :(

**** I've been trying to look for some because I'd love to read a good fic like that too, I've found a fanfic community called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/community/Demigods-at-Hogwarts/98642/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/][Demigods at Hogwarts]] but the majority have the cliche overpowered Mary Sue characters vibe. And there was another promising one on AO3 but I opened it and Percy immediately started talking about how much he loved Annabeth lol. Why is a good fic so hard to find! Argh.

** linkffn(Dies Irae by MufuMufuSan) is probably my favorite HP/PJO fic. I believe the only one of your points that it misses is that it's not complete and it hasn't updated in about six months, but maybe that's recent enough for you. I'm still holding out hope.

**** I started reading this fic because I liked the premise, but it's one of those where the author never uses "said". It's always "gritted out" "inquired" "stated" and it reads very melodramatic to me. Maybe one day I'll get over myself enough to read it :p

***** Hmmm. I hadn't realized how bad it was at that. I still think it's good enough to read, but I completely understand having a pet peeve that makes an otherwise decent story completely unbearable.

Unfortunately, I have found that it is a lot harder to find good PJO fics than it is to find good HP fics. Maybe that's just because PJO is a smaller fandom, maybe it's because it and its fans are younger, maybe it's due to some other thing that I'm not thinking of right now. But for whatever reason, there seem to be disproportionately few good PJO fics out there.

*** Having read it, I would say that it is a good popcorn fic, but not necessarily the greatest story ever. I have concerns about the writer's plans for Hogwarts years, as they have already solved most of the canon HP plot lines, and a few of the PJO ones as well. Plus he seems a little Sue ish. This doesn't make it bad, mind you, just not something I'd call the best. Like I said, good popcorn fic, just don't expect anything too dramatic or serious.
