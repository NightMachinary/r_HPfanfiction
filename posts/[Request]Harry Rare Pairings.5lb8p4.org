Looking for some good fanfiction where Harry is paired with a girl that is not Hermione or Ginny. Preferably M rated and over 50k words


** Harry/Astoria:

"Finding a Place to Call Home", linkffn(9885609)

"Heterochromic", linkffn(10938984)

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3084182?view_adult=true][The Minister's Affair]]

Harry/Bellatrix:

"Delenda Est", linkffn(5511855)

Harry/Gabrielle:

"The Hero and the Veela", linkffn(8358170)

"The Little Veela that Could", linkffn(5490079)

"Vitam Paramus", linkffn(9444529)

--------------

Harry/Katie Bell:

"Harry Potter and the Emerald Trance", linkffn(10298096)

"More than just Teammates", linkffn(7984462)

Harry/OC:

"Emperor", linkffn(5904185)

"Not the Only Redhead", linkffn(3882344)

"Triwizard Tales", linkffn(7594305)

My favorite non-canon pairing is however Harry/Hermione/Ron, and that pairing is surprisingly rare:

AO3 has [[http://archiveofourown.org/collections/triofic/works][an archive]] of 96 Harry/Hermione/Ron fics. Unfortunately, they are either incomplete, one-shots, or just terrible fics.

"The Sum of Their Parts", linkffn(11858167), is probably the best Trio fic out there, but it never dived explicitly into romantic aspects of their relationships, merely stating [[/spoiler][they slept together.]]

"Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water", linkffn(12076771), is still WIP. It's the first fic I found that specifically paired Harry/Hermione/Ron together, is of novel length, and has a decent plot. However, It's also a crossover with Kantai fleet girls and requires a certain level of interest in WW2 naval history from readers.

"What it Comes Down to", linkffn(6858689), is well written, but contains too much torture, angst, and is down right grim-dark. I only made it through a third before giving up.

"Ruthless", linkffn(10493620), is high quality and has a great plot. However, Theo Nott replaced Ron and the story is relatively short.

"Just The Three of Them", linkffn(6807742), is a cute canon rehash with a romantic Trio. One-shot only.

*** The sum of their parts is not a romantic trio fic. You've read into the idea that you hid behind the spoiler tag. It didn't dive explicitly into romantics aspects because their weren't any to even implicitly dive into.

***** [[/spoiler][The epilogue is the main reason why I disagree with that idea. When Mcgonagall is talking about the children who will be coming to Hogwarts in the future, she doesn't once mention any child of any of the three of them.]]

[[/spoiler][And as far as soul bonds go, this is different from the usual one where the two or more people with a soul bond fall in love. It didn't just bond their souls together, it merged them somewhat. Each of them is themselves but also is the other two.]]

If you want to read romance into that go ahead, but I truly don't see any there. I only see closeness between the three, intimacy even, but I see no sign of sexual or romantic intimacy.

*** Just an aside: it's often nice, when you're reccing a lot of fics at once, to explain why you think each fic is interesting. Otherwise it is hard for someone to know why they would want to look at any one of the fics you rec in particular.

#+end_quote

I feel kinda guilty mentioning a smut/BDSM author here, but there are two stories by SoftObsidian74 that always come to mind when this pairing is mentioned. "Always & Forever" has Harry in an affair with Ron&Hermione while still being married to Ginny. "Bound by Duty" also includes Draco and is very heavy BDSM, but takes itself and the challenges of their lifestyle quite seriously (I probably learned more about BDSM/fetish culture from that fic alone than anywhere else). There's also some kind of plot about their love being able to destroy Voldemort, it's quite long ago that I've read it.

Fair enough, probably the same reason I don't like post-epilogue Hhr fics when they cheat or their spouses die. Too pathetic for my tastes.

I kinda understood Harry in Always & Forever though... he wanted to protect his family from scandal and their involvement would have a much worse reaction than a 'normal' affair (which already would have been bad)... and yeah, Ginny was incredibly understanding in that story, but I thought it was kind of nice to write her that way for once.

****** Yeah the [[/spoiler][morning after scene with Tonks]] is one of the most realistic I've seen and the [[/spoiler][Daphne/Harry/Tracey love triangle]] could be right out of a real school. Also the moment [[/spoiler][Fudge realises that V is really back]] is one of my favourite fanfiction moments.

It's also cool that some thinga remain unexplained [[/spoiler][like what happened to Ginny]], we rarely see stuff left unexplained in fanfiction.

** You've been making a lot of requests, and I know you can't have read all the recs given to you already. Could you condense all of your searches down to one or two posts, maybe? Or use the search feature?

*** I dont have time to read them now but there is a point where im going to need a lot of reading material so that is why I am making a ton of posts. I post them as I decide what different pairings I want to read.

**** Try browsing the linked wiki. It sorts by pairings. It's on the right side of the page.

Barring that, there are literally dozens of pairing specific ff.net groups. You could also try the dlp recs list. Additionally, there are some good fics linked through tvtropes. Finally, if you use the search function, everything you have asked for has been requested previously, and you can find links in many of the old threads.
