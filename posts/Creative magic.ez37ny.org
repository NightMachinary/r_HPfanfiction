** In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts) and it in-progress sequel linkffn(Harry Potter and the Physical Adept), Harry uses D&D-influenced spells, with the implications of D&D magic. For example, /disintegrate/ is used to not only destroy architecture, but also for crime-scene clean up, and also for direct combat. /Alter self/ is used to gain the ability to fly without a broom, as well as disguise as other people.

** Magic really breaks all laws of physics, and not in the fun, quirky way that leads to creative workarounds, but in the "nothing we know about physics could even begin to explain how this is possible" way. Your prompt of it selectively working with physics when its convenient and ignoring it otherwise would need an explanation.

*** It isn't a matter of working with physics my 'prompt' is more of an example in which magic can be used creatively, reread it and you will most likely find it isn't made as a discussion of magic doesn't follow physics, it is quite literally I do not see enough creative uses of magic.

**** I guess I misunderstood why the stone that was being banished and summoned simultaneously heated up ; I thought you meant it was due to friction. If it was just a interaction between those two spells specifically, you would have to make an explanation why no one before Harry has ever tried, or figured it out.

****** I answered in both my comments why we aren't seeing creative uses of magic ; You have to explain why it's only being used now, and by these characters. Harry isn't a unique genius when it comes to magic. He doesn't figure these things out. If it's something that only a muggleborn like Hermione could figure out due to physics, you have to explain why physics and magic sometimes contradict and sometimes don't. It's not as simple as "think of a creative use of magic" because thats the easy part. The harder part would be fitting it into a story without these kinds of questions ruining the immersion. There have been countless generations of wizards before we reach our point in this story. You need a reason why in this time this wasn't figured out, or if it was why it isn't common knowledge and use.

******** You are ignoring my point completely.

#+begin_quote
  simple statement of the fact that I do not see many fics where magic, a nigh unstoppable, almost extradimentional force, is used creatively.
#+end_quote

Have you ever heard of Sandersons First Law of Magic? in brief summary, magic can be used to resolve a problem only to the extent that we know beforehand how that magic works. If Magic is this " a nigh unstoppable, almost extradimentional force" then you need to explain why it isn't used this way. In either canon, or by everyone in your fanfic if the AU in that fanfic is that magic is unstoppable BS. Again, the hard part isn't making up fun new spells that Harry can use to ROFLstomp his enemies, its explaining why and how he can do that to a satisfactory manner that doesnt ruin the immersion of the story.

Why isn't this trick with a rock the number 1 way of killing dragons? Why isn't it taught at hogwarts? if it is, sure thats an explanation, now explain why the rest of the magic contradicts this particular instance, or rework all of magic (or atleast insofar as it concerns the main point of the stort) to the point where it makes sense.

********** ...It's not in-universe law of magic, its a real world author's rule (Brandon Sanderson, author of many fiction novels) for how magic must work in a meta and narrative sense. Did you seriously not even try googling it? Ill spare you the effort of a simple google; "An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic". I even explained this in my last comment. Are you reading my comments at all?

Okay, let me try this again; In harry potter, people do not use magic as " a nigh unstoppable, almost extradimentional force". We must assume that everyone in HP universe isn't a goddamn idiot, or for some other reason choosing to ignore this utility of magic. Therefor, this utility of magic doesnt not exist. Magic is not nigh unstoppable because it is not used as such in series. This topic is over a month old, so quickly rereading, you were asking why people weren't using magic creatively. Well, either you must assume that everyone is pants-on-head retarded and didn't think of it, or you must assume for whatever reason it cannot be used this way.

************ Okay, theres no point to this. I'm aware of what the difference is, and that Harry Potter is a soft magic system. Why did you reply to a comment over a month old? Why do you keep deleting your comments? Why do you seemingly read the first sentence of my comment and ignore the rest every single time?

************** Okay. I'm going to attempt one last time.

I didnt say HP was a hard magic system nor treat it as such. I brought up Sandersons law because of its relevance to the original topic of this post, which was "why dont people use magic creatively, like something something banish and summon a pebble until it turns hot as shit then banish it at a dragon. That was the original topic, before you deleted your comment. I brought up Sandersons law because it applied to that, even to a soft magic system (despite your original prompts use of physics very arguably turning it into a hard magic system) as much as a hard one. Why dont people do that? Because they don't. Theres no canon explanation, and since we have smart people who dont do that, we must assume there is a reason, despite it not being present in canon.

This is my whole point. I added it to the first paragraph so you might hopefully read it for once. People dont do x, there are smart people who could think of doing x, therefore doing x must not be possible/practical.

I cannot believe you genuinely think you're the one bashing your head against the wall. If you didnt delete your comments, I'd find some subreddit equivalent of "am I the asshole here" that deals with idiots because either I am desperately failing to get my point across somehow, or you're just flat out not reading my comments. Or maybe you just have some sort of developmental issues, I genuinely cannot tell at this point.

**************** Two points

#+begin_quote
  read it and be amazed. Having said that if you ever see something I post take the time to realise you are no fun. Because that is ultimately what I was asking why do I not see more fun and creative uses of magic.
#+end_quote

in regards to "be more fun"; fanfiction that doesnt explain why shit happens is bad fanfiction. But this is a point of opinion. Your interpretation of what constitutes a good fanfic isnt somehow more valid than mine, so get your head out of your ass.

#+begin_quote
  As to people being smart in the Harry Potter universe we know damn well they aren't given how only a small minority of people are stated to be death eaters yet all of books 5 through 7 are people cowering when they have the numbers advantage.
#+end_quote

You ever seen a bank robbery? dozens and dozens of people cowering from 2-3 bank robbers? they're all goddamn idiots huh? oh no wait, they just dont want to fucking die and know that the bank robbers are willing to kill them, have training (dark arts would be the guns in this analogy) to kill them while they don't. Your complete oversimplification of everything is why you cant get a straight answer that fits your criteria.

Thank you though, for fucking finally, after god knows how many comments, responding to one of my comments in full. I think you genuinely read it this time. I'm not even being sarcastic.
