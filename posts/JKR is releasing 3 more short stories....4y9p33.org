** It's just some of the Pottermore stories collated and put into an ebook. The "new" stories are also just stories that JKR wrote for Pottermore, but haven't been published yet.

***** I wasn't being sarcastic. 'Meh' is probably the best response. After years of Pottermore, the Cursed Child nonsense, and now this I'm just ready for Jo to take a break and enjoy her success.

******* This is kinda similar to how Enders game was done - lots of tangentially related stories in that series - not everything was just about Ender. I'd love it if she did this but not holding out hope.

** What do you guys think about this? I don't follow Pottermore much (TBH I find the website too confusing) so are these just published versions of stuff she's already put on that site?

Also, if the CC wasn't proof enough, it really feels like she can't stop George Lucas-ing HP! Even when she promises CC is the end, she adds more.

Should we be grateful for any/all new canon because beggars can't be choosers or is it fair to be annoyed because her additions are just causing more inconsistencies than they resolve?

*** I'm feeling a little irritated, I suppose. I'm happy for the people wanting more HP, but I get the feeling these books will only make the itch worse rather than properly scratch it. I want something I can really sink my teeth into, like the original series.

** After CC i'm not sure that i'm interested. Unless all of the money is being sent to charities I feel like she should just leave HP to the fanfic writers.

** Jo, my love - don't you think you already rich enough?

Why are you doing this to us!?

Buy not only one, but THREE virtual books... and just after the CC fiasco. Honestly woman, we are not all made of gold... u_U

*** It's not because she wants to get rich off HP, it's because she simply can't let it go. And so the Potterverse just keeps on expanding and expanding. Think about it, JKR has been involved for almost thirty years with this "project". She is so passionate about it that it blinds her and she just doesn't know when to stop.

**** That's more than understandable, really. It's become such a big part of her life. But it's like she only just keeps her toes dipped in. I'd like to see her take the plunge and do something with more substance.

****** Well yes, but... I'll admit I want more novels. Films are great, but I miss her writing. :D There's just this spark of narrative magic that's lost in other media.

**** I can understand that, but at the same time... why can't she make it be free, like she did with the other stories from Pottermore? I mean... it is not even a printed version of the story. It is online stuff, and according to Pottermore some of the stories have already been published!

** Actually, those are stories that I really waited for! Don't get me wrong, I am really glad for Cursed Child too, but it's not all written by JK Rowling and the exclusivity of it bothered me. So I haven't yet bought the book. If I have the money, I'll be buying those new ones first. Really happy right now.

** On the bright side we can now at least tell how much of CC is written by JKR herself.

Although a cynical side of me is wondering if the short stories aren't simply Pottermore articles...
