I've just seen this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryHogwarts/comments/7h71fw/lord_voldemort_redesign_by_thibaud_dorlandi/][post]] and now I want to read a fic with a Voldemort who is seen as almost a god.


** Um, canon?

All jokes aside, he was god-like, if irrational and insane in canon. Only Dumbledore could really stand up to him in a straight fight. In the Battle of Hogwarts, he's fighting McGonagall, Shacklebolt, and Slughorn three on one with ease. All three of them are accomplished wizards and witches, and easily in the upper echelon in terms of duelling skill.

He really only died from Dumbledore and Harry taking advantage of his paranoia, irrationality, and power-trips.

**** Yeah. At least, I think so. It was pretty unclear the extent of Harry's protection. He did manage to trap Neville Longbottom under a flaming hat.

** The Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave features an insanely powerful (but believably so) Voldemort. It's a AU series with 7 instalments that covers all 7 years at Hogwarts, where Harry's brother Connor is hailed as the Boy Who Lived (but avoids the common pitfalls of the trope).

  “Yes, Harrie. Your little friend had nearly murdered you. Perhaps, unintentionally, perhaps not. But that hardly matters now, does it? My rebirth is imminent, and you---” Voldemort crooned, stepping so close to Harrie's shaking body that there was hardly a centimeter of space between them; Voldemort's breasts level with her own pallid face. “---will facilitate this, my little lion.”Harrie felt her vision swim when the locket tightened further, cutting off what little air could pass through her obstructed windpipe.“Eternity you have sought, and eternity you shall receive. Your life spared but another taken,” Voldemort whispered before digging the wooden stick against her quivering throat, teasing along the chain biting against her neck.

** In linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time]]) both Harry and Voldemort are godlike and very believable.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
