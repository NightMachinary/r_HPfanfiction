I was just wondering this. Are there any fanfictions set during the time Merlin went to Hogwarts?

*** Nope. According to pottermore he went to Hogwarts and was sorted into Slytherin.

**** This sort of thing is exactly why a bunch of people laugh at Pottermore, and don't consider most of it canon. JKR seriously likes to make up random stuff on a whim, just to appease or pander to fans.

**** He should be.

I'm not a big fan of JKR's appropriation of Geoffrey of Monmouth's legend, but I understand why she did it. My best guess is that she wanted to keep the origin of magic a mystery.

***** I like the thought there are two Merlins, but the second was so famous that the first got swallowed into his myths through time. No achievement he accomplishes distinguished himself enough.

Or vice versa I suppose.

** linkffn(6337450) managed to railroad itself when the pottermore Merlin article came out. Many of the later chapters try and sort the mess out, but the best thing the author could have done was just ignore it in its entirety.

  AU past OP-After Harry is thrust back in time, he has to survive his final years in Hogwarts and live his new life around people he knows will become Death Eaters. Can he beat his prejudices and give people a chance, or will he crumble under the pressure?

Took me forever to find this fic because of its +stupid+ unique name. For reasons Harry gets sent back in time and ends up becoming a student in hogwarts during its founding, falling in love with Salazar and eventually becoming a sort of teacher's assistant. It's at about that point that merlin comes into the picture, is sorted into Slytherin and ends up relying on Harry as a sort of father figure. The kids act in ways that make sense given the circumstances and Harry becomes a believable role model to them. The author sets themselves up for some really easy Godric bashing, then doesn't indulge in it. Godric's negative traits and beliefs are treated as things that you can't change and should not waste your time complaining about, which was refreshing.

My only complaint is that the story peaked then had a conclusion that lasted way too long (about 10 chapters). If you're looking for stories about merlin or early slytherin house give this one a read, it's wonderful.

And my girlfriend would like [[/r/HPfanfiction]] to know this is her favourite time travel fic.

*** Thank you.

.....but I just noticed it was a rated M and I don't really read M rated fanfics (Most of the time I read T rated ones)....

**** It's been a while but if I had to guess the M rating probably exists for 2 reasons.

1. Harry and Salazar have sex and while you never actually see them have sex they do mention what they've been doing at the time to each other. If this kind of language bugs you or makes you feel uncomfortable you can skip it and not miss out on anything the story has to offer.

2. Godric has issues with certain types of people and won't hesitate to use that language to hurt and dehumanize a person. Like I said earlier this could have been used as an excuse to bash and demonize him but instead it's used as a way to give his character depth. The idea being that even though this man is so good and advanced in some ways he does have his blind spots, just like we all do. If this kind of thing makes you uncomfortable then I'll have to recommend you pass on this fic. The language is only used maybe 3-4 times during the entire duration of the fic but it's usually quite important when it's being used and you'll miss out on important plot elements, motivations and events if you skip the passages where that happens.
