Hey guys,

we all - probably - know WBWL-Stories, right?

Now I've sadly never seen a WBL-Story where Harry (who either doesn't know or doesn't care or plays along) is the WBL (and the true one is either dead, kept ignorant, being trained or being groomed as a sacrifice, like canon Harry IMHO was!)...does something like that exist (that isn't slash)?

Thanks for your recommendations in advance guys, signing off - the stage is yours :)


** Well, there's 2 that comes to mind, but I don't feel that they exactly what you want. linkffn(The other boy who lived by Kwan Li; The Return of the Marauders)

Both have Neville as the actual BWL, but Harry is the one of the prophecy, sorta, kinda. I think this isn't what you want tho, if i'd guess, what you want is where Harry is the presumed douchebag WBWL while either his brother or Neville (or another OC) is the actual BWL but no-one knows it ? Basically a WBWL fanfic that Harry is the douche and not the hero of the story ?

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.

** Well, there's linkffn(4641394), where Harry is a decoy, but doesn't really fulfill the requirements for a WBWL story. He isn't the prophecy child, at least, so I guess it's Wrong Chosen One?

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.

*** This I've read (I think so at least!)...his past is a fabrication (James and Lilly are alive and so is the true Harry), right? Still, I'll probably give it another go! Thank you!
