** There are a few Severus/Lucius/Hermione that I read, they were okay, but not ground breaking. I think I read them mostly for the smut haha. You can find them on AO3. Most of the time it's Hermione/Snape with Lucius coming somewhere in the middle as the story progresses.

** I personally would love to see a story about polyamory where it's not always sunshine and roses -- where there's some actual drama between the people involved. I get that harems are wank/power fantasy material, but surely there are at least a few out there that are more... realistic?

** Quatermass has some pretty good Lunar Harmony (Harry/Hermione/Luna) fics. the only that is really pure Lunar Harmony that I've read is Just A Touch of Kleptomania. linkffn(12369862) Most wind up with some sort of harem, but Lunar Harmony is the core. (Mainly because they make a Freudian Trio: Luna is the impulsive Id, Hermione is the intellectual Superego, and Harry is the grounded Ego.)

  (Dumbledore Bashing! Lunar Harmony!) Based on, but not an answer to DZ2's "What's Yours is Mine" challenge. The Shadow-Walkers, magical thieves of extraordinary power, have long been thought extinct. But Harry, Hermione and Luna not only have those powers, but intend to use them to take everyone from Dumbledore to Voldemort to the cleaners...and make a little profit along the way.
