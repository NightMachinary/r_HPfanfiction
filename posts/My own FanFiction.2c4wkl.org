** Ideas are cheap. So very, very cheap. Intelligent, creative people have them naturally every day. Great ideas. World changing ideas.

*Execution* is what matters. It is /all/ that matters, as even most of the things that have changed the world weren't very good or well thought-out ideas. This includes otherwise really great things, like the internet. But they were actually done, through hard work and determination. This is what separates them from the musings of early 20-somethings shooting the shit at Starbucks in hushed tones, least someone overhear and "steal" their idea.

This attitude isn't uncommon. And every time I hear someone in programming, engineering, or (now for some reason) fanfic say "I'm afraid someone will steal my idea," I sigh and roll my eyes. No one wants to steal your idea. That you will eventually post online anyway. Even those theoretically in the market, so to speak, to take someone else's idea and spend literally days of work perfecting and publishing it likely won't think as highly of it as you, and certainly won't have as much drive to see it succeed.

So don't be silly. Do perhaps ask politely and /humbly/ if anyone wants to beta for your story, while giving examples of what they'd be reading and why they should care. And do work on your personal proofreading skills, which didn't do much for this post, as most people will judge you on the quality of your writing, and not the abstract quality of your ideas.

** As soon as you post it, if it is truly unique and fantastic, it will be copied and emulated. There is a reason why so many fics seem similar to others.

So...it truly doesn't matter. If it is good, it will be the most popular of the type. So in other words, focus on getting someone to help you, don't worry about people trying to copy you.

Edit: time looped put it much better, so as he says.

As soon as you publish, they will be able to do that anyway. And /until/ you publish, nobody will know it was /your/ idea in the first place.

As a reader, I care less about the plot than how well the story is written. If someone copied your idea and wrote a better story, I'd prefer to read the better story. If you have an /amazing/ plot, but write badly, I will not read your story.

1) Use a spell checker. There are no excuses for bad spelling. Beware the their/there/they're trap.

2) Please, please use a beta reader. Unless you're J.K. Rowling. And, dare I say it? Perhaps the canon books would have had fewer plot holes in them if she had.

** Words are wind.

Someone's written your story already. The question is: can you write it better?

** No one's going to take your idea, because whatever it is, however unique you think you're being, someone's done it.

That someone is probably a 13 year old girl who got 10k words into it before it devolved into a slash filled clusterfuck, but the idea was still there.

And the arrogance to think that of the literally million stories written in this fandom, that you're going to have the undisputed best of all time? Astonishing.

It's your first story. Try not to shit the bed on the first go and you'll do a lot better than most, but look at several of the now well-established published authors and their early works in the fandom - they were shit compared to their later stories, all of which pale in comparison to their published work.

Well, Cassandra Clare actually writes a lot of the same drivel. But I digress.

You're writing fanfiction because you don't know what you're doing. Being an arrogant toe-rag about it makes anyone who's been around a while and may be able to help turn away and just make fun of you.

Lose the attitude, develop a thick skin, post your story on DLP's Work by Author section for real feedback. There aren't enough people giving criticism on this subreddit to really justify it as a place to better yourself as an author.

** You seem rather reluctant to trust people with this, so perhaps you are going about this the wrong way. Start with the people you do trust (IRL, online), and out of them, ask them to read it and give you pointers. Also, you would do well to read critiques of other people's works, and glean perhaps something that you might have missed in your own writing.

There are also people who are established beta-readers, though I know none of those personally.
