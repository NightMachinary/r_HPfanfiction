Was just thinking today about characters who I haven't seen as main characters in fics. My first thought was of Hagrid, who is always in the background but never really featured.

Anything goes, including pairings. It'd be nice to find some stuff from around the time he was expelled or his experience during any of the three wars he lived through. Even just some slice of life stuff with him and his creatures.

Thanks!

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

  Even with the war over and Voldemort defeated, many wrongs remained to be set right. After nearly fifty years of paying for Tom Riddle's crimes, Hagrid is finally ready to clear his name. But there are still those who are not ready to hear the truth.

A Moody-centric oneshot. It's an awesome piece with a... well, you'll see once you read it. It's definitely one of my favorite oneshots of all time.

  Some things never change, no matter a past which no longer sleeps. This is a lesson Alastor Moody must learn first-hand.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.
