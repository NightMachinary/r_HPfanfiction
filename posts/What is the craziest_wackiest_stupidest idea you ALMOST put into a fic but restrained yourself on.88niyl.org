For me it was very nearly revealing that the main villain of my story was the "real" Chosen One after he killed Voldemort in a Dark Wizard power struggle. Or that he was an amnesiac Diary Riddle made flesh, slowly regaining memories of who he was the entire time as he worked alongside the modern Voldemort


** I mean I had one where Harry showed Dobby the film 'Ghostbusters' and then the house-elf started a HorcruxBusters gang and got a car and did Knight Bus enchantments and everything and they would go BANG appear and shoot lasers at the parts of Voldemort's soul and put it in a jar or something and then BANG gone.

** I had an idea that Harry watched Dr. Doolittle before 3rd year and from there learned he could also speak to Hedwig and other animals,.Consequently he used this and had enough time to tell Hedwig to get scabbers when he and Hermione went back in time, thus, really saving Sirius.

** In Victoria Potter, one of the ways I showed from the beginning that Victoria had good magical instincts was to make her really bad at maths, with Vernon stating that she can't even perform addition properly. The idea here is that she is more naturally inclined to think of numbers behaving according to the rules of numerology/arithmancy and so Muggle mathematics feels wrong to her.

In the original plan for this idea, I was going to take it further, with this instinct being the same for all wizards, not just Victoria. It would be common knowledge in the wizarding world that "Muggles can't count", because Muggle mathematics would simply seem obviously wrong to wizards.

However, I quickly realised that this is the kind of rabbit hole you do not want to send yourself down. It would mean that any time wizards referred to something numerically, they would have to be using a different counting system, and it would make everyday life in the wizarding world *a lot* more wacky than we see in canon.

So in the end I settled for the more moderate position that wizards do still count, add etc. in the normal (Muggle) way, and it is simply that Victoria, having strong magical instincts, struggles to separate out regular mathematics from arithmancy - at least, until she is formally trained in the subject.

*** I mean my headcanon for arithmancy is basically an unholy crossover between algebra and geometry. addition and subtraction work with perimeters, multiplication/division works with surface areas, exponents work with tessellation, ect.

guaranteed to give any math major a headache

** I was once challenged here to write a Harry/Draco oneshot. Being a little drunk, I decided to give it a try despite hating Malfoy and not being gay. In the end I had written a rather lackluster story about Harry getting pegged by Tonks due to a complicated scheme involving a Lust potion aimed at revealing a secret fantasy of the user. Never going to publish that one.

** Well this was way before FBAWTFT, but my story was gonna be about a semi self insert squib girl finding her place in the Wizarding World by searching out new beasts and plants, inspired by her favorite book since she wasn't allowed at Hogwarts. I never wrote it because I can't write very well and can't put ideas down on paper.

** I was going to have Bellatrix have a secret son by Rodolphus, born right before they were sent to Azkaban, and Narcissa put the boy in an orphanage. Then Bellatrix would find her son and try to train him as a weapon for Voldemort (explaining why Bellatrix wasn't at the battle in HBP).

Then CC came out and I decided Bellatrix shouldn't have any children at all.
