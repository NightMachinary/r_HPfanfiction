** I have a vague memory of a fic where a teacher measured the requested length of the essay and then ripped the parchment off there, and Hermione was naturally outraged. And tbh I kind of feel that's the way to go about it.. if you're told to do X amount and you do 3x that, the teacher has no obligation to read or grade the rest and you clearly failed the assignment.

*** That's a good way to go about it, but it's a bit of a dick move if the teacher doesn't make it clear to the 11 year old kids that that's what will happen.

** The trouble is that unless it is, in fact, a bashfic in which Hermione is incapable of learning from her mistakes, this sort of thing would happen exactly once, and then Hermione would write more concisely for the rest of her career at Hogwarts, which would make it an utterly inconsequential scene that doesn't add anything to the story.

*** Alternatively, if it's the fanon 'she can do anything' Hermione, she could:\\
* Submit her assignments in ultra-tiny writing that takes at minimum a magnifying glass.\\
* Submit a perfectly normal complete assignment...then barrage her target teacher with about a dozen owls containing the rest of the details.\\
* Put a confounding jinx on her parchment that makes it impossible to correctly measure the length.\\
* Compress the long assignment down to a 'normal' size, but with included hyperlinks to the bits that expand the parchment and reveal more information when tapped.\\
* Put a charm on her homework to make it impossible to tear off the excess amount.\\
* Put a confundus charm on the teacher to make them forget how many inches they wanted.\\
* Use really wide parchment so that each inch has more words in it.\\
* Just write on the front and the back of the parchment.

**** As someone who has worked as a TA, me telling someone to stick to assignment guidelines then having them pull s**t like that will result in fail marks for the current assignment and nitpicky marking for the rest of the semester. My (and Flitwick's) time is more valuable than the ramblings of some 11-year-old twit.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.

  Harry overhears a conversation between two of his teachers early into the first year at Hogwarts. What he hears makes him ponder about how he's going about his school work. He decides to take action and make his parents proud of his performance. Just how will that little change influence the events taking place at the school?
