Once Harry gets all three hallows spirts of his close ones start appearing on random For example Lily helping him change his kids first diaper James and/or Sirius keep trying to prank him everyday with godric/moody appearing to make him train up to his 'potential'. Dumbledore popping up to give advice to 'save the Wizarding world'. They can't stay permanently because of 'pain for the spirits to stay in the physical plane' but the spirits can come back after a while. So some spirts abuse this to return as frequently as possible. Other random spirits appear to annoy or help Harry. I don't know if it'll be more fun if only Harry can see the spirits of if everyone can see them.


** Sirius doesnt seem like a person to "prank" harry tho

**** Was Sirius really a prankster in canon, because from what i remember him as from a written standpoint is a mix between Harry and Malfoy actually. Jinxed random students and badically broke school curfews, becoming an animagus and whatnlt

** The 'pain' and discomfort' spirits feel is actually them 'degrading' in this plain, like their slowly losing cognitive functions, memories, beginning to look like they're decomposing, et cetera.

However, popping back to the other side for even just an hour undoes all these negative effects, like hitting a reset switch.

They abuse the shit out of this, with some spirits like his parents hanging around for twenty out of every twenty-four hours.

Unfortunately, the one side-effect of spirits being on this plane? They can become quite wrathful to those whom they feel wronged them.

For example, if Wormtail were still alive, Lily would do everything she could, bar demanding Harry himself kill him, to see him killed and booted ass-first into whatever grim afterlife awaits him.

** And then Voldemort shows up and always stays the longest possible, at first he is in denial over being dead and tries to keep the war going, then when the coin drops he decides to try by any means to get Harry to resurrect him, including but not limited to trying to trick him in doing it, bribing with money/information/knowledge/magic/power/anything, threatening him about it, bluffing that he had more Horcruxies, trying to convince him he changed and deserves a second (thousandth) chance and finally annoying him until he does it just to make him go away.
