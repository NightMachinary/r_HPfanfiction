*** I didn't really like this one because it's basically canon rehash with Bellatrix replacing Andromeda. All the major events in canon happen the same way.

There are these little snippets that show canon history and it shows the difference between this fic and canon Bellatrix, but in one of them it shows that Bellatrix is the reason Moody lost his leg and then Moody still shows up with a lost leg.

In either canon or fanon it is Bellatrix who kills Gideon and Fabian Prewett, so theoretically they should still be alive but they still die. Oh and Sirius also still dies the same way.

Another thing that bugged me is that Andromeda basically became a more serious version of canon Bellatrix. Andromeda should have a completely different mindset.

Anyway these snippets cited Bellatrix as being the reason for all of those things when she was evil.

Since the author was writing a good Bellatrix, those things should not have happened. There should have been a butterfly effect.
