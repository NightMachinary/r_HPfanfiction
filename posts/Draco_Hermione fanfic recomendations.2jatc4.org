Hey guys, I've read most of the good H/HR stories and wanted to try some dramione. I found a fic called Isolation, which was fantastic, but I can't seem to find any other great ones. I prefer it longer than 50k words, complete (although not nececary) and I don't mind lemons. Can I get some recommendations? Thanks.


** Thanks guys! I was a little afraid islolation was the best of the best but ooh well, with a fic that good what do you expect. By the way is there an equivalent of Portkey for dramione? Portkey has a really high density of good stories for harry/hermione so I mean in that respect.

** Do you want fics featuring romance between Draco and Hermione, or do you want fics featuring a romance between a handsome bad boy and a bookish ingénue just waiting to be swept off her feet? (Said ingénue may well have previously unknown magical ancestry too, so it's OK for Draco to love her now; isn't that sweet?) If you want the latter, you can hit it by swinging a dead cat on FanFiction.net or pretty much any HP fan fiction site save Portkey.

If you want the former, then here are some that were recommended to me by a Dramione fan whose opinion I respect. Note that I have not gotten around to reading most of them, so the following list (reproduced with permission) is verbatim except for formatting and grammar and spelling corrections, and I take neither credit nor responsibility for these:

- A Pound of Flesh - Pennilyn Novus (Dramione in muggle world, mysterious memory wipe, big twist, a strong heroine lead and a male lead that is different from stereotype, all rolled into one. It has two endings, and the second one could break a reader's heart. So only read the first one if she doesn't like tragedy.)

- A Series of Unfortunate Events - Geeky-DMHG-Fan (Funny and fluffy with a touch of angst here and there, but this fic is pretty much perfect for new readers. Hermione's a bit oblivious and naive at romance, but to be fair, Draco is too, even though one could never guess just seeing how he acts.)

- The Revenant - atalanta84 (A lot more angst, and a led-astray Draco who found his way home to his wife. It was an incredible read, a big mystery, and in the end, a choice for Draco where he could finally make the right choice after all this time since the night at the Astronomy Tower, even sacrificing everything he held dear. It ends well, but a true redemption!Draco fic if I see one, even though it might not seem like one.)

- Turncoat - elizaye (Probably one of the most famous war fics out there, and it was the fic introduces me to the DE!Spy!Draco and Handler!Hermione. I've outgrown this kind of story, mainly because I think Hermione would be a lot more cunning than Draco, but this fic deserve a read anyway. It was well-written, nevertheless).

- The Deadline - Lena Phoria (Lena is one of my favorite authors lately, and she deserves it. The Deadline is pure romance, of course, but you don't really see it seeing it explores rather carefully a lot of the next-gen and everything else that matters. It has become my headcanon for what really happens after the dreaded Epilogue.)

- Beautiful and Cruel World - Lena Phoria (Another War fic, featured a badass prison-break!Hermione and top-DE!Draco. One of the few War fics where I don't feel Hermione was there just so Draco has someone to go back to, and while it touches quite a few darker themes, it was a brilliant read. Lena has a love for OCs, she includes a lot of them, but they are never Mary-Sues or boring. For someone who's allergic to OC story, I have a lot of love for Lena's extra characters.)

- A Primer for Small Weird Love - unicornesque (A bit different, seeing as Draco here was born and raised in France, never tainted by Lucius's ideology. He visits Hogwarts during the Triwizard Tournament, and meets Hermione for the first time. He also has to face the sins of his father's past, letting him define or not define his future before Voldemort returns. It ends with a very questioning tone, with a lot of foreshadowing to an unpleasant future, but it also has a hopeful tone about the first love. Draco here is a true pureblood without the arrogance and ignorance that came with it, and while some might not like the OOC Draco - well, for his background, how could it be different? - I love it.)

- Faultless - NajwaBarlaam (I always have a weakness for post war!Dramione where Draco is lost after everything that happens and a Hermione who is dealing with the aftermath of it all. A redemption!Draco without needless angst where Draco explores the Muggle world and gains the insight he had never gotten the chance to, and a light and fluffy romance at the same time. Has Ron and to a lesser extend, Harry bashing, but somehow I have a feeling that with how Ron and Harry treated Hermione in book 6 and 7, it's not really that far-fetched.)

- Witchlit - irondoormat (A very, very long oneshot. Featuring a dashing Potion Master and a double-identity!author!Hermione. Pure romance, fluffy and cute. It was amusing to see the two of them dance around each other like bloody teenagers with their first crush, even though they are both in their late twenties-early thirties.)

- Her Shoes - Margaritama (This one comes a bit close to the whole Sexgod!Draco, with a lot of smut - if she is into it. It doesn't offer a virginal-princess!Hermione, but a girl with a back bone and a big twist at the end.)

- Remember Me - ElectricFlowerChildren (More on the angst side, with a romance with a deadline. It has one of the best endings I've seen in Dramione fanfictions, so it's saying something.)

- On The Other Side - murtagh779 (As close to a Veela!Draco fic without it actually being one.)

- Inverse - Elesrea (I love school-year!Dramione, ones without a Sex-God!Draco and Virginal!Hermione, of course. It's one of the few fanfics of its type which doesn't exaggerate Draco into the next version of young!Tom Riddle, and with a Hermione with an ulterior motive. And more time-turner goodness. The romance hasn't come yet, it's still regularly updating thoufh.)

- Lover of the Light - xXBeckyFoo (One of the few Pureblood!Hermione that I could digest. I love BeckyFoo's version of Hermione in her fics. She's not a perfect, saintly girl who is also a compassionate martyr. On another note, I recommend other Dramiones of Becky too.)

** Isolation is really the creme de la creme of Dramione fics. I agree that it is a fantastic read and personally, I don't think you'd find many fics better than that right now. However, there a few other fics that I enjoyed and they are:
