I think when I came to this Subreddit I assumed that every Fanfic would be listed and people would upvote the ones they loved and down vote the ones they hated.

So it would be easier to go straight to the best of the best.

Fanfiction.net doesn't seem to have a good sorting feature, nor does Harrypotterfanfiction.com

Perhaps I should go back and have a closer look at one? Perhaps there's a 3rd party tool I don't know about?


** I don't think such a system would work due to the huge variety in views as to what constitutes good fanfic. The best you'll get are community-specific libraries of rated fics like DLP, because in such communities there is greater unity over the type of fic people are looking for.

**** Dark Lord Potter, it's a forum focused on HP fanfics. They have ... specific tastes, and sometimes do seem to give some leeway to certain stories just because of the themes present, but if you go for the stuff they rated as decent you are guaranteed not to get complete crud which is something.

Though their attitude could use a cleaning charm on occasions, but oh well ...

** fanfiction.net you can sort by favorites or reviews (whichever you think better represents "best").

The sidebar here has [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/index][a link to the subreddit's wiki]] which has a compilation of stories previously recommended here.

** Archiveofourown.org has a kudos system where people can upvote stories they liked. You can sort AO3 fanfictions by kudos to see which stories are well-loved. On fanfiction.net you can sort by story favorites.

** I have little to no idea how the computers work. However, someone over at DLP, created Scryer, which is a "better" way to search fanfic.net. It searches all of ff.net not just DLP unless you restrict it to DLP. It lets you do a greater amount of refinement, which sometimes gets you better results sometimes just shoots back nothing.

** find a fic you like and browse the authors favorites. it's time consuming but the reward ratio is higher than a simple number of fav's sort. Browse fanfictionauthors.net. Higher quality stories at that site than average. try twisting the hellmouth fanfic site for stuff not in other archives.
