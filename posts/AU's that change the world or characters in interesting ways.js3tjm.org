Can be time travel where they change a lot of stuff happening, or a pure traveling to another universe story.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.

Would rather NOT have Weasley bashing

Am fine with male pregnancy as long as it's not detailed

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes

When romance is involved I'd like slower paced development, but that's not mandatory.


** Harry and the Mysterious Curse of the Girl Who Lived is a story where both Harry and muggles identify him as a male but the wizarding world identifies him as a female. He makes friends across multiple houses. The story has the funniest Padma in all of fanfiction. WIP.

HP and the Scrambled Sorting has the hat not caring where the students want to be sorted and thus sorts a bunch of people in Harry's year into different houses. Funniest Parvati in all of fanfiction. WIP. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13256350/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Scrambled-Sorting]])

  Harry always knew that there was something unique about him. In a way, the arrival of the Hogwarts acceptance letters was almost expected... except, why are they all addressed to 'Harriet Potter?

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

  After decades of an empty life and wars that claimed all he ever held dear, the greatest dark lord in living memory and his most loyal servant are finally ready to challenge fate and once again bring down their vengeance upon their enemies. AU, extended universe, Time-Travel, bashing and HAPHNE.

** If you are okay with me suggesting my own fic, I'm writing an AU that will include parallel universe travelling to the actual canon universe. It's new though, so It's not complete. There's no romance at this point. Give it a go, I would really appreciate any feedback, positive or negative :)
