Long story short, I've just finished the last of [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/bluepeony/pseuds/bluepeony][Bluepeony's]] fanfictions, and am now desperately craving anything even remotely similar, not really in terms of plot, but style of writing. (If you don't know any of her fics, I particularly recommend Out of Grace and Time is a fine invention! But most of them are a good read).

What I like best about them is

- the British cultural references
- that they are very slow-paced, which means that there is lots more detail in every scene than otherwise possible
- the indepthness of the characters involved
- that the writing is very perception-orientated - often in fics, large portions of the story are taken up by the POV character's inner monologue, worries, fears; which is fine, but not quite up my alley. Here, there is more outward-directed observation of the environment going on (yet the POV character's emotions aren't neglected, but instead conveyed through actions or well-chosen thoughts). --> aka show rather than tell
- they feel very sincere/authentic, like you could walk right in and experience that precise moment without having it feel unnatural
- the coming-of-age theme in some of them
- good, witty banter

I do prefer Marauders era fanfictions over any other, but honestly would be open for anything that you think checks some of the criteria. None of the above is something you can just go and feed to Ao3's tag system, so my searches have been largely unfruitful so far, and I would be super super grateful if anyone has something to share! <3


** Northumbrian writes a very authentic British setting, with a particular focus on typical middle-class domesticity.

FloreatCastellum's fics are more plot focused than slice of life/coming-of-age, but also have a thoroughly British setting.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

*** Well, as a Brit myself I find that there is sometimes a difference when another British person writes a story. They can add in mentions of casual things which are specific to this country. I'm happy to read good fic from writers from any country, but I do appreciate it when there's a joke or wry comment that seems particularly British.

*** Fics using candy, vacation, having random music and arts classes, etc. greatly reduce the Britishness, and this IS Fanfiction.

I suppose you could throw in the ruthless conquest and forced 'civilizing influence of the glorious Ministry of Magic' if you want to go Old School British? Perhaps go to war with the French after the Triwizard Tournament.

Edit: Forgot about breakfast pancakes. Not very British. A fry, now.

*** Have you ever read an American story set in Britain? It's not good. So many American terms and plot points that make 0 sense to a Brit.
