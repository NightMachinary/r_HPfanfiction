I've probably read most of the more famous fics, so don't bother with them.

EDIT: any rating, though K or K+ isn't my cup of tea. Also, any website, doesn't have to be ffn, as long as I can download into an epub.


** linkffn(a step to the right) this is a WIP that started fairly recently

  When Harry saves Hermione's life they end up in a different world and in the middle of another magical war - but at least they have each other.

*** Yeah, I tried reading this, but I couldn't get past the first 2 chapters. Its like the author never heard of using words to describe the scene that aren't "He". I also hate Hermione, so there's that.

Thanks though.

** This happens in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/374837][The Mirror of Erised]] linkao3(374837). However, it's a sequel to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/288347][The Rewards of Perseverance]] and I don't know how much sense it would make on its own. Also, I'm not sure what you mean by "no 'Dumbles'" but Dumbledore is in it.

*** By "Dumbles" I mean that trope where he's that old manipulative old goat that is incompetent and keeps saying "my boy" and just being dumb. I hate this trope, Dumbledore is such a good character that so many people butchers him for no good reason at all. Happens all the time in Dumbledore Bash.

I'd say its different from GG Dumbledore (greater Good) because in those type of fic, Dumbledore is actually smart and good at manipulation and fucking over Harry. But oh so rarely does this happen in fics. The best one I can remember is from Imprisioned Realm.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
