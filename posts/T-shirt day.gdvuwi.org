An obscure and forgotten department of the Ministry of Magic (perhaps called the Department of Wizarding Holidays), in a desperate attempt to rid the country of death eaters, creates 'T-shirt day', where everyone is somehow forced to wear a t-shirt.

P.S: This is my first post on Reddit, I hope I'm doing this right!


** Doubt you can convince robe-wearing stubborn wizards to wear tight, confining muggle shirts. Just ask the old gentleman in a nightgown at the Quidditch World Cup. Maybe Arthur and the Weasleys would, but outside of that, I'm not convinced many would.

*** Who said this was voluntary? Let's say no one expected this to become an issue or perhaps... magic was on their side? I admit this isn't much of a plot for a serious story but a comedy one could come out of this, I reckon

** "Minister! Explain!"

Lucius Malfoy had the uncanny ability to whine in such a way that it could cut through one of Celestina Warbeck's concerts. When Minister Fudge was broken out of trying to charm away the ridiculous garment, which had been forced onto his body by the floo entrance, by Lucius' voice, he looked up - only to see a very ticked-off Malfoy family striding towards him.

Lucius himself was of course dignified as ever, were it not for the fact that his "shirt" had a strange mural with 'iron maiden' printed underneath. Narcissa's shirt was only slightly better, at least it did not name a torture device, yet the two bore an uncanny similarity. Hers said 'Sabaton'. Their son, meanwhile, had his hands in his pockets and was attempting to stare a hole in his shoes - Cornelius could just barely make out a deeply familiar red/golden insignia on his garment, as he had thrown a cloak over it.

Before the Minister could open his mouth, one of the Unspeakables swept in, like all of them clad in a uniform grey shirt that stretched over their robes in odd angles and depicted an ever shrinking chain of unspeakables also wearing identical shirts with shirt-wearing unspeakables on them, and quickly took a look at their shirts, before whipping out a floating parchment and quill and dictating to it as he walked off.

"Two muggle metal bands, and another instance of a reference to magic! Interesting development..."

"Well?" Sneered Lucius, tapping his foor angrily, arms crossed.

Fudge opened his mouth, but was interrupted by Arthur Weasley, who had accidentally bumped into his back.

"I'm sorry Minister Fudge, but have you /seen/ my /shirt/? It's amazing!"

Weasley's shirt had a very cartoonish depiction of the man himself holding up one of those muggle glowbulbs and grinning at it.
