Can be close to canon or AU

I understand and respect the fact that Harry doesn't want to kill, I completely get that.

But, they're at a war, Death Eaters aren't going to go easy on them; even if it's not Harry who kills, I'd like to see other characters kill.

I mean we had freaking Molly Weasley take down Bellatrix, if she can take down freaking Bellatrix in an intense situation, than I'm sure that the other characters can as well.

If Remus has to die, have him dying protecting his newly made family, have him take down Fenrir Greyback, avenging his childhood.

Or have Tonks take down the Lestrange brothers, or her own aunt Bellatrix or someone.

Fred dies because of a freaking wall? Have Lucius or Narcissa or someone die, protecting their son.

Hell Hedwig and Dobby dies? (I'm still not over that); have some other Death Eaters be killed as well.

Bonus points if it is Harry who is forced to kill, and must learn to deal with it. (He isn't okay with killing, but learns to deal with it because the Death Eaters won't stop).

Note no Weasley bashing, I'd rather not have any Dumbledore bashing either, but if it's minor I don't mind. (Like if it's AU and he's alive)

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

No Harem Harry

No Seer Luna

No super smart or super powerful Harry. Harry when he's more powerful or smarter than canon is fine, but make it believable.

Can be close to canon or AU.

Would like for it to be completed or regularly updated


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] linkffn(4745329) features a Harry who resorts to violence rather faster than he does in canon. And it's an excellent fic to boot, even if it seems to have been abandoned.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. A new perspective on the 1970s time travel genre. Some slash much later.

** linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky)

I know you asked for no H/Hr, but its in a world where Ron dies, so it isn't that cliche of shit. Its really really fucking good and not at all focused on any sort of romance, its more of an emotional crutch for the both of them.

linkffn(For Lack of a Bezoar)

Otherwise, linkffn(The Legacy)

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.
