** Why would someone want to read this?

You didn't use a flair; you didn't edit your post, and there is no description of the story or an explanation to tell a potential reader why someone would want to read this.

Edit: Forgot to include the edits that I always provide (and of course, my offer to edit your posts for you remains standing). This time, I provided a short description of your story as well.

  This is a crossover between Supernatural and Harry Potter where Hermione is related to the Winchesters. Funny situations ensue. It's meant to be funny and I hope it makes you laugh. Check it out if you're interested!
