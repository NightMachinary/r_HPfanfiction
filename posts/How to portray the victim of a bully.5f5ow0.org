The fiction I want to write has my character's first three years at Hogwarts being bullied, with a steady increase until it's finally noticed.\\
I wanted this bullying part, because it will shape her character later on in the story, as someone who does not tolerate oppression and racism, as she is, herself, a half-breed, giving her great sympathy and compassion for others, but also a sort of ruthlessness and black-and-white thinking where bullies are concerned.

The thing is, I have no idea how to portray the evolving mentality of a bullied victim. I don't want to go over the top and make her suicidal (I'm not sure 11 / 13 years old can feel urge of suicide, and anyway, it's clearly not the root I want to take), but at the same time, I don't want to go as if it did not affect her, because it's not the case.

She does not have friends, and is isolated, as there is a lot of racism during those years (1950's) and half-breeds are usually shunned. She does not seek contact either, neither does she seek help from adults, thinking it's /her own problem/.

As for the bullying itself, there's nothing like beatings, mutilation or even rapism, but there's definitely emotional / verbal abuse, coaxing and taxing that will steadily increase in time with her things being misplaced, sometimes with lows or peaks, up until third year, where it will be more physical (shoving, ripping homeworks, etc.), until the bully cuts her hair. It may not seems much, but I know that if I was the one being done that, I'd be devastated. Like stripping down your identity, or something, and that's definitely something I want to portray.

The problem is that I don't know how to portray my character's mindset, should I go the depressed, or angry road? Should it become better or worst during summers, as she is away from school?\\
Accidental magic, maybe, because she repressed her emotions?\\
If some of you were bullied, and does not mind sharing it, how did you feel during those times? How did it progress? What kind of bullying, was it for something you may have done and that pursued you forever, or something you can't help, like your hair, skin, etc? Did it affect the rest of your school year, and if it stopped in the middle of the school, did it affect the rest of your scholarization?


** I don't think you're coming at this from quite the right angle. Remember that you're writing a story, not an academic report on bullying. Your focus should not be "What is the most accurate representation of bullying?" but rather "what representation of bullying will lead readers to root most for my character?".

For that reason I would be wary of depicting too much in the way of angst or having the character wallow in self-pity. No matter how justified such feelings can be, they are not appealing characteristics nor do they contribute to a "hero's path" character arc. Their likely effect is to put readers off and make them dislike the protagonist rather than get on their side. There exists an "angst tipping point" after which the main character feels so passive, so weak, so self-indulgently woe-is-me that you actually start wishing more pain on the character, not less.

To that end, I would highly recommend taking inspiration from two elements of canon. The first is the Umbridge plotline in OotP. The feeling of frustration in the face of injustice, the sense of powerlessness leading to anger... these are powerful emotions to harness in the reader. The second is Harry's response to the Dursleys. By making him a resilient character, by having him keep his sense of humour, his snark, and his essentially good nature, the reader immediately gets on his side.

*** Yes, that's exactly the point I want to avoid.\\
I don't want a miserable MC, and I don't want to bullying to get over the top either, it's not an Angst fic as much as a plot-device I want to give backbone too in order to explain how she will be shaped as a character later. I want her to be affected, with a sense of helplessness growing as she ages, not downright destroyed and empty.

And yes, good idea for canon! I had not thought of that.

** I think [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] did a pretty good job. Read the first arc for tips. The protagonist there just tries to get through the day, but has something else to focus on as an escape. She is depressed, and somewhat resigned in a way, but planning a way out. She is a few years older though, keep that in mind.

What do you mean by racism and half breeds exactly?

*** I was sure I had replied, but apparently not.

Half-breed in the sense of half-creatures, people who had either of their parents not human (veela, giant, goblin, elf, pixie, etc.).\\
A sort of Umbridge-like mindset, but on a larger scale and slightly less extreme. Half-breeds are less than human and objectified, with many thinking they should not have access to a wand and have blatant discrimination made against them. I want to emulate the racism and fight people of different ethnicities had to live through during that time, but in the wizarding world.

** Speaking to my own experience and that of my sister's, I would think that someone of that age would probably be prone to a lot of emotional stress. Maybe not leading to outright depression (yet) but a severe case of anxiety that controls her life. Maybe she could put on a strong facade during the school year and then completely break down outside of school. The anxiety would be the main catalyst for a lot of problems in life, but it's helped by the presence of true friends (as cheesy as that sounds, it's actually helpful). I suppose it all really depends on the character's personality.

** There were two extreme cases of how bullying victims responded in the US:

1. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre][Columbines High School Massacre]]

2. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Phoebe_Prince][Phoebe Prince Suicide]]

--------------

Since every student was carrying a deadly weapon at Hogwarts all the time, Columbine styled massacres would very likely happen. I mean there was really no procedure to prevent bullying victims from unleashing fiendfyres in the Great Hall, something a stupid and magically weak kid such as Crabbe was able to cast.

*** Not trying to get off track here, but the Columbine shooters were not bullied, they were the bullies. The bullying thing was just something the media ran wild with, this story was pretty detrimental for the real social outcasts at the time. A few newspapers put out this information after everything had been fully investigated but the public was already set on the dramatic image of the shooters being victims that snapped.

**** Really, I'd like to see some proofs.

Why should we believe 'a few newspapers' over the main media? Why are these 'few newspapers' more credit worthy?

****** Ok, there was no proof or conclusive evidence that they were bullied. But that didn't mean they were bullies themselves.

As for the first article, no, I would NOT accept David Brooks' opinion piece as facts.

**** You should never bully anyone armed with a deadly weapon at all time.

You never knew when they would snap and go on suicide attacks.

James and Co should feel lucky that Snape didn't go that far.

US schools have been cracking down hard on bullying ever since the above two bullying cases. In a country where kids can get their hands on assault rifles easily, bullying is a risky matter. Kids in Wizarding world would have easier access to even more firepower.
