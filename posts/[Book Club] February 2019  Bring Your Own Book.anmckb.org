   :END:

1. Spoilers are allowed! This is a book club, after all.

2. As per *Subreddit Rule 5*, fics containing sexual or suggestive content involving minors cannot be recommended. This is due to reddit's [[https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-post-sexual-or-suggestive][site-wide policy]].

3. Please submit fics to be considered using [[https://goo.gl/forms/y60X6vHRLwFTFfYq2][this form]].

4. All stories submitted must be *complete*

--------------

Liiiiitle bit of a meta update here. Since last month's post went up, I got hired as a full time teacher. Being a mid-year hire, it's kinda a pain in the rear to find anything resembling free time. (In addition, I'm hosting a puzzle scavenger hunt over on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] this month, and that kinda sucked up my time.)

All of those are excuses to say...I don't have a fic picked out for February.

*THAT BEING SAID!*

I'm opening this up for a free-for-all discussion. What fic are you reading/have read/can't stop thinking about (*that is complete*) that you want to have a discussion about?

Please keep the conversation in this thread centered around *a review or general thoughts* you had after finishing a /complete/ fanfic.

--------------

The standard book club will resume next month. Thanks for being patient with me!

** I was just re-reading The Eyes. This story could easily be published in one of those Lovecraftian yearly almanacs. It's a great horror with very little gore. It's scary because things so familiar to us as Harry Potter fanfiction readers reveal the terror that was inside them all along. The poetic use of homonyms is another reason to love this story.

I would love to find more stories like this one.

*** Oh, a Lovecraftian fan?

You've probably already read this one, but /It's Always The Quiet Ones/ is a great one, if you want something a bit more light-hearted.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

** "Nothing scares me anymore"

It is undoubtedly an odd story, an AU where Tonks is some kind of well-meaning "shadow monster" and Lavender Brown apparently a Muggle. It is not the usual fanfic but more akin to the kind of stories told in the Magical World (eg three brothers). At the same time, it still feels somewhat in character and for a short oneshot, I have seen way worse. It won't win any Nobel prices, but it is the good kind of different.

** "Faith and Understanding"

This is one of my absolute favorites. I remember reading it for the first time years ago, and I feel much the same way I did then as I do now. This story is focused on Ginny's friendship with Luna and Ginny's musings therein. It's sweet and tender-hearted and gentle; I consider it one of the best platonic love stories I've ever read.

Though I should note it is archived:

** I like "In Care Of". I read it a few years ago and I can't help but continuously go back to it. Nothing gets me going like a good Sevitus fanfic. Especially one that is about Snape getting his eyes opened about what Harry is really like and how he's really treated at home.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.
