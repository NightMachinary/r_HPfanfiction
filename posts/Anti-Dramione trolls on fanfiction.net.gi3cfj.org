If you are a Dramione author, you might have been getting hostile comments from anonymous users in the last week or so.

They (probably a single person) post the same comments verbatim to different fics. (for example at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/r/11894165/]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/r/8459441/]] ) I think you can safely delete them.


** Dramione as a combo does suck ass tho.

*** I agree that it usually does suck ass, but it can be done well and believably. The issue with it, like the issue with all the common tropes, is that a most fanfic writers aren't good writers. However, I'd say that after a certain point in canon, the idea of Draco and Hermione ending up together does stretch unbelievably thin.

The only pairing I absolutely stay away from is Harry/Voldemort because that is just wrong on so many levels

** Imagine caring this much what other people write. Baffling.
