I was told that this was a better place to post this, so here i go. This is kind of a rant, hope you guys don't mind.

​

Just like many of you, i have wondered what it would be like to be Harry Potter. Now i'm not talking about being in the magical world, i specifically mean being Harry Potter. While watching the movies and reading the books, there have always been some things i would have done differently. I wanne give a few examples, and see how you guys would be as Harry Potter.

1. We dont really see it in the movies, but in the books Harry is described as a pretty studious guy ( not like hermione), but he likes to read and learn. But i never understood why he didn't spent more time learning defensive spells and offensive spells and curses. I would have spent way more time learning how to defeat my oponnents. Dark magic included, since Harry has plenty negative memories.
2. I would have used the unforgivable curses way more. As stated in the books "you have to mean it", now if both my parents and my Godfather were brutally murdered, you better believe i mean those curses. I obviously would have spent a lot of time perfecting those curses, since i would plan on using them.
3. I would have avada kedavrad left, right and center. I feel like killing guys like wormtail, bellatrix, lucius Malfoy and other death eaters would be a wise decision. Bellatrix kills Sirius and after Harry refused to kill her, she kills Dobby and is a danger to other students and teachers during the battle of Hogwarts.
4. As stated by someone in my post on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] , it also makes no sense why Harry doesn't try to learn skills like: Magic detection, flying without a broom, becoming an animagus. Those are all skills incredibly usefull to escape your enemies, surprise your enemies or stay ahead of your enemies.

What do you guys think about my list, and are there things you guys would do differently from the books ?

** Canon Harry was already throwing around Unforgivables in Book 7. He even crucioed Amycus Carrow for spitting on McGonagall. Only because the series is written for children, did JKR not let her teen heroes kill. But she's mightily proud of Molly killing Bellatrix, so I don't think she's that much a pacifist herself.

Of course, JKR desperately wanted to write a wizard Jesus analogy in which innocence and passive sacrifice won the day. Maybe it's not such a bad message for our already very edgy kids, but I'm beyond the stage at which fairytales are still enjoyable for me.

As to how I would have done in his place, I have to admit I'm nowhere near as brave as him. The Hat would likely sort me into either Ravenclaw or Slytherin. However, knowing that children of my Enemies were mostly in Slytherin, I would have fought tooth and nail to avoid that house.

Growing up in abusive household like the Dursleys should affect my personality in significant ways:

- Able to perceive threat instinctively
- Defensive and excellent self preservation skill
- Hide my true feelings at a much earlier age, which probably leads to some kind of natural occlumency
- Ruthless and vindictive, and will resort to violence to protect my interests
- Strong hate against arrogant, entitled, privileged, and spoiled assholes (Dudley and Draco)
- Hunger for powers and abilities to determine my own fate

When the magical world opened up to this alternate me, I would pour over books purchased in Diagon Alley. I think even as an 11 years old, I should be able to come up with these basic questions:

- Who were my parents? Where are their friends? Did they leave me more than the gold in Gringotts?
- Why did I end up with my horrible Muggle relatives? Who put me there?
- Who was this Voldemort? How could I defeat him as a baby? What is that killing curse?
- Who were Voldemort's supporters? Are any still around?
- Who are the important people in magical world?
- Who could be friendly to me and help me? Who could be my enemies and dangerous to me?
- That Draco Malfoy seems to be an arrogant shithead just like Dudley. Some books speculate that his family was following that Voldemort. So, if Voldemort's people are all like that, then they are my Enemies.
- My parents were supposed to have been betrayed by their best friend Sirius Black according to “Rise and Fall of the Dark Art”. Who is this Sirius Black? Why did he betray my parents? Could I ask him directly?
- Finally, what powers could a wizard have? Can I learn them? How long do I need to learn them?

Compare to how I was received like a hero in Diagon Alley, I would definitely feel furious at how I was being treated at the Dursleys. Right there, I would swear to become so powerful one day that I would exact terrible revenge upon anyone who had led me to my current circumstances. I would swear to destroy this Voldemort if he was still alive and everyone who had followed him. I would swear to totally break that arrogant asshole Draco Malfoy. And I would swear to tear the Dursleys limb from limb one day.

But for now, I'm only a weak 11 year old boy with no power, apart from being able to talk to snakes, stealing food from grocery stores, and beating up would be bullies. For the time being, I have to stay low, find people who could help me, and learn as much magic as possible.

*** I really feel what you wrote. I agree largely with the things you say. I feel like you would grow up with a sense of anger, especially since you don't fully understand what happened to your parents. In year 1 you learn more about it, and this would anger me more and would make me want revenge in some way. At the end of year 1 you find out there are still threats to your live. This would be the point were the need for power would feel more urgent, as i now know that there are still people out there who want to hurt me.

So, Strong Hate against....James Potter, Sirius Black, Snape(technically not entitled or privileged), and pretty much everyone at Hogwarts. Everyone is entitled, spoiled, priviledged compared to Harry. And many were also Assholes during Book 2, 4, 5, 6.

Seeing your massive vault of gold, I doubt that question would arrise.

  That Draco Malfoy seems to be an arrogant shithead just like Dudley.
#+end_quote

""My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands," said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. "Then I'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow." Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. "

Although Harry was reminded of Dudley, all in all, in this conversation, Draco seems like a normal kid.

#+begin_quote
  Some books speculate that his family was following that Voldemort. So, if Voldemort's people are all like that, then they are my Enemies.
#+end_quote

Consider that false accusations are a big thing. It is entirely possible to assume that he was mind controlled as he claimed. Certainly Voldemort would have no issue doing that. Also, only Dumbledore's side(for the lack of better word) thought he was bad. Everyone else bought the Imperius excuse, IIRC. So, I'm not sure if the books would speculate about that.

#+begin_quote
  Could I ask him directly?
#+end_quote

Somehow I doubt that you would feel the need to ask a well documented massmurderer about your parents death. That seems to be heavily ignoring emotions.

How is it different than in any other school? Just because you switch schools doesn't mean that the new students will treat you like a god. You do stupid ship, so they treat you accordingly. Harry not only illegaly entered a tournament(in their eyes), but after it in hopes of more fame said that Voldemort returned, such thing being impossible as per common knowledge. For comparison, imagine I was a jew whose family barely survived Hitler. Now Imagine I came up and in front of a huge crowd announced that Hitler returned. I also could not provide any evidence to prove this impossobility. Would you believe me that Hitler has returned? Of course not.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Why so? Even if you run away from it, Voldemort will still chase you. Might as well stay in the best school protected by Dumbledore and abuse the libary for knowledge.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It was increadibly bad. Petunia displayed abuse(trying to hit him with a frying pan that he casually dodged implying that it was not a one time occurance), Dudley and his friends liked to beat him up (Harry Hunting), he was living in a cupboard and was locked in there as a punishment for long periods of time(Zoo incident), he was definatly starved during the second year and....the fourth,IIRC(could be fifth). He was verbally and emotionally abused. Dudley hit him with a new stick upon Vernon's command(shortly before Harry got his letter). Marge's dog tried to bite Harry and she didn't care and verbally and emotionally abused him. She went so far as to mock his dead parents.

One, how do you think Orphans like say....Tom Riddle paid for it? Or poor families like Weasleys? Another thing, no payment for Hogwarts is mentioned. Also, Orphans are given money for their school supplies.

" “That is easily remedied,” said Dumbledore, drawing a leather money-pouch from his pocket. “There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes. You might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand, but ---” "

Furthermore, Rowling has confirmed that it is free([[https://mobile.twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/622118373061709824]])

#+begin_quote
  But we both know it is not the best or even a good school.
#+end_quote

It is a good school. It has many highly qualified teachers "Snape was one of Slughorn's ex-pupils and while he attended Hogwarts he proved to be very talented in the art of potion-making. Professor Snape was a ruthless disciplinarian, with little patience for foolishness, yet effective in his job and well respected by other professors. His deep understanding of potion brewing, as shown by his expert concoction of Wolfsbane Potion.Severus was made a member of the Slug Clubpresumably because of his talent at potion-making". He was also good enough to modify and improve potion recipes. Minerva "During her seventh year, she was appointed Head Girl. After her education, Minerva worked for two years at the Ministry of Magic and later returned to Hogwarts, where she became Head of Gryffindor House, Transfiguration professor. Minerva greatly helped the Ministry of Magic's resistance through spying Death Eaters and bringing the Aurors crucial information on their activities. She also protected the students from Alecto and Amycus Carrowfrom 1997 until 1998.". Dumbledore needs no introduction. Filius "He also protected the students from the Carrows in the 1997-1998 school year.After completing his Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests in his seventh year, Flitwick graduated from Hogwarts and then proceeded to become a Master Duellist and earned the title of "Duelling Champion" at some point,and has a shelf full of trophies to prove it. It is also likely Flitwick studied further into magic, becoming an accomplished wizard, masterful in spells, charms, and defensive magic, and even possibly earning the title of "Doctor", and becoming a fully-fledged and educated sorcerer before beginning his teaching career back at Hogwarts sometime in or before the early 1970s."

I gave you the acomplishments of just a few of Hogwarts staff. What else makes the school great? Well it doesn't discriminate against Orphans or Muggleborns unlike say Durmstrang. In Hogwarts everyone was more or less equal, in Durmstrang, just because Krum was famous he had more power (""Back to the ship, then," he was saying. "Viktor, how are you feeling? Did you eat enough? Should I send for some mulled wine from the kitchens?" Harry saw Krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on. "Professor, Ivood like some vine," said one of the other Durmstrang boys hopefully."I wasn't offering it to you, Poliakoff," snapped Karkaroff, his warmly paternal air vanishing in an instant. "I notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again, disgusting boy "). Hogwarts also has huge libaries filled with some of the most rare and darkest of topics like Horcruxes.

#+begin_quote
  As for the knowledge, I would just use the library found in any other school.
#+end_quote

And would it be better than Hogwarts'? It is described as "The Hogwarts Library is located off of a corridor on the first-floor of Hogwarts Castleand contains tens of thousands of books on thousands of shelves. " also for the restricted section "These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advance DADA.Books in this section may be rare, valuable, and/or considered inappropriate for younger students, thus why it is restricted.The Restricted Section used to have books about Horcruxes, including Secrets of the Darkest Art."

To summarise, it has a huge library full of many rare and or dangerous books.

I couldn't pull an Ava. That isn't to say I wouldn't have put belatrix down, but there's easier ways to end a life. Causing pain though... That's an option.

I would have been more like Hermione. You've stumbled upon an entire world! Right underneath your nose! A world that with some mental alacrity you can make yourself into an animal and shape reality as you want it!

No amount of bullish behavior would have dulled my fascination with potions, (although i would have skipped class and just learn on my own with Shape as my teacher) and charms and transmorgification would have been a genuine pleasure!

I wouldn't have ever turned in any homework, but i never did that in school growing up either. Waste of time. Either i knew the subject or i didn't and learned my own way, not by writing inches or a word count of a subject.

** I'll try to keep it short :

Dark Magic : killing and using Dark Magic hurt your soul and corrupt the mind. There is no point to win the war if in the end you became just as bad as the Death Eater you replaced. It's even more true with the Unforgivables since you need to "mean it".\\
You can't use the Cruciatus just because you need to extract informations, you need to seek your victim suffering, to like it, to take pleasure in his screams. You also can't end the suffering of a friend with the Killing Curse, you need to hate your opponent and to really want him dead for the spell to work.\\
The only spell that can be somewhat excused is the Imperius, since you only need to overcome your victim mind to use it, and it doesn't ask you to be up to no good to be used.It is not to say you can't kill Death Eater (though the Imperius Curse create a moral dilema since except for the most well known one, you can't never know if you are killing a true Death Eater or a controlled puppet), but never with the Unforgivables, and if possible without any Dark Magic.

​

For the over skills : most of these skills take years, if not decades of work, and would be useless in 99% of the cases:

- It took years for the Marauder to become Animagus, and unless you plan to keep company to a Werewolf, turning into a stag is pretty much assured to be useless.
- Voldemort, someone who has decades of experience on Harry and supposed to be more talented, is the only character able to fly without a broom, and it's implied he invented the spell, or at least rediscovered it. So ok it's pretty impressive, but what's the point of it since in 99% of the cases, you can either break you fall with a spell like Arresto Momentum, or use a broom?
- We only see Dumbledore detect magic, once again it's implied that it's a skill who take years or experience to be learnt, and Dumbledore use it exactly one time.

It's not that these skill sucks, but Harry win the 2nd war before his 18 birthday, and had his life at risk at least once a year since he was 11. Harry could never focus on a long term project just for a skill "that may be usefull", he always has to focus on things that will definitevely be usefull in short time, like the Patronus Charm when there was dementors nearby.

*** But the canon has also made it clear that Avada Kedavra will not harm one's soul if used for euthanasia. Therefore, using it for self defense and protection of innocent civilians should be fine too.

On the other hand, confunding a house-elf to poison her master is considered cold blooded murder. Voldemort even used this act to split his soul to make a Horcrux.

**** yeah, just like people who use a gun to kill someone who breaks into their home in real life. nobody goes off on them for being "Just as bad as the home invader who ALSO used a gun against you!" i think it's ridiculous to condemn any wizard or witch for using whatever spell they have to in a self defense situation, as long as it isn't plain obviously immoral like torture curses. because obviously if someone invades your home that doesn't give you the right to tie them up and spend a few hours beating them with a hammer. someone even got arrested for that exact thing, after he kept torturing a guy he found sexually assaulting some kid.

using the killing curse is probably the MOST moral curse you could use, since it is equatable to a gunshot wound to the head, which will mostly kill you instantly! i'd use the killing curse over a blasting or cutting curse in a self defense scenario! the wizarding world has some real skewed perspectives on stuff, and that's also bleeding into the fandom - clearly, as evidenced above.

also canon harry is fine with torturing someone over spitting on someone's face, but OH NO I WON'T KILL THAT'S TOO TERRIBLE FOR ME TO CONTEMPLATE, I'M NOT LIKE VOLDEMORT! Fuck that, you're JUST like Voldemort for pettily torturing someone over something as nonharmful as SPITTING at somebody.

*** I figured those skills would be hard to learn, but the Marauders did it in their school years, so i figured Harry could learn too, and that might actually be usefull. The other skills i already figured would require years of training and/or talent, and you're probably right, they would not be that usefull.

As for the Unforgivable Curses they seem to be described kind of unclear. Since its said that Aurors could use the unforgivable curses during the war, and it didn't seem to corrupt them. I also think it will corrupt your mind if you keep repeatedly using them, i would only plan on using them a handfull of times, And i don't think i would've consider my mind corupting while i'm trying to survive and protect my friends. If someone killed my parents or assisted in it, i would definitely 'mean it' when i use the death curse. I feel like there are a few moments in the books where my thought and feelings would be so sinister, that i would be capable of using all the unforgivable curses. Harry obviously can't use them because of his character, i'm saying that i would've used them if i was in his shoes.

*** My headcanon on dark magic is it relies on negative emotions and after casting you feel numb to that emotion. So casting a dark spell with anger makes you feel less anger in you. A tolerance would be built making it require more dark spells to get the same effect over time. So the “corrupting” part would be people wanting to feel that and associating dark magic cast on others with people with feeling really good. I never really liked “dark magic hurts the soul/corrupts it” because wizards made these spells. Why would they want to make these to corrupt themselves? Dark magic is illegal/restricted whatever because many people would “lose themselves” to the feeling. The point of self flight I think is that you no longer need anything to fly. If you can't apparate but can fly such as snape in hogwarts that's a big advantage to have. Aresto momentum stops you from going down fast doesn't let you go up and around. Depending on your career field I could see magic detection more useful. WE SEE dumbledore use it one time. How often is dumbledore in canon doing anything that would require it. Half the time it's in hogwarts.

If your life is under threat every year wouldn't you want to start learning to defend yourself?

** That's the beauty of fanfiction :)) So that you can write/read what you would have like to happen instead.. or change whatever you want to be able to enjoy it to your liking. Everybody will have different opinions about this and about everything really. And the good news is, there is enough fanfiction to satisfy most opinions.

Personally, i really like the stories where they show Harry actively tranining and/or learning so he would better be able to defeat Voldemort.

There's this amazing writer who sadly has stopped and vanished since a long time.. but she has written two particular stories which i adore, for this exact reason. One story starts after the end of the fifth year, and the other after the start of the sixth year. And they both show Harry actively invovled.

** I'd study as much Dark Magic as possible, even if simply out of principle. I'd never take morality lessons about souls and afterlifes from whats an essentially Medieval society. The dreaded dark arts are probably just social taboos and Ministry banned spells and rituals. Powerful and maybe dangerous, but I would never believe that there is actually some kind of intrinsic evil in them that makes your soul go rotten and turns you insane. I imagine I would lean quite heavily on Transfiguration when it comes to combat.

I also subscribe to what [[/u/InquisitorCOC][u/InquisitorCOC]] said, it sounds like a good plan.

** If I were Harry, I would get an arsenal of potions for every occasion and focus on learning everyday spells, easy-to-perform curses and healing charms. Hogwarts students learn Accio in their 4th year, I very much doubt I would be able to learn any advanced magic easily. Becoming animagus takes years, and most forms are useless anyway. Magic detection would probably take decades. People gripe about stunners and disarming spells, but it's what I would do if I were in a fight with an adult Dark Wizard. Something reliable I wouldn't screw up that would take an opponent out of the fight in one blow.

Thinking a teenager can easily kill Lucius Malfoy, Bellatrix or even Wormtail is silly. Not even because killing is not as easy as it seems if you aren't a complete psychopath. But those are adult wizards who have so much more experience with magic and violence, and you haven't even learnt Aguamenti yet.

Definitely no duels, battles, flashy dark curses. Magic wand is not a sword, there's absolutely no reason to ever engage in face-to-face combat if you can avoid it. If I absolutely had to try to kill somebody, it would be poison, some magical explosive I would deliver under Polyjuice in advance, or, in the worst-case scenario, a surprise attack when the opponent least expects it.

But most probably, I would terrorise the Dursleys into submission with some potions / magical trinkets and attempt to transfer to another school as far from Britain as possible sooner rather than later.

No you wouldn't. It sounds really cool and easy to kill people but really it's fairly hard. That is due to our natural empathy and due to years and years of conditioning by society. Sure, maybe you could use it in a moment of blind rage, but other than that, I can't see you killing people left and right. Unless you are a trained Army personel or a sociopath. Also, in HP universe, Murder fractures your soul, so that is another thing to watch out for.

#+begin_quote

Maybe it would be. Maybe not. The books are from Harry's perspective. It is possible that they had good reasons for doing what they did. Anyway, could you actually murder someone? And later not kill yourself in guilt? Our brains work in interesting ways, and the societal conditioning would make you feel increadibly guilty. And, hey! After you do that, you get to go to Azkaban. The only times when you were legally allowed(Pre-Voldemort taking over the Ministry) to use Unforgivables was during 1981 (at the height of First Wizarding War) and only by Aurors. If I were you and I felt that Death Eaters needed to die, I wouldn't use the unforgivables.

I am! all around the room. “Aaaaaah . . . did you love him, little baby Potter?” Hatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before.

Both of these are increadibly rare and hard to Master skills. The first one only Dumbledore knows as for the second, only Voldemort(the creator of the spell), and Snape who was taught it by Voldemort. Also, Magic detection doesn't seem very uselful. After all, it was only useful in canon once.

  becoming an animagus.
#+end_quote

It takes a long time to learn and it's pretty much useless. You can't pick your form, so if you got a slug....deal with it. Furthermore, you can't even do magic in that form. Only a few forms would be of any use and it's not really worth wasting your time on what amounts to a lottery

Anyway, my list:

1. Learn a bunch of useful magic. Doesn't have to be rare. If I master Genimo Gurse, I never have to worry about food again. I have one sandwith? Now, I have a million sandwitches. Definatly Transfiguration. Useful for fighting, food, making homes, furniture, ect. Potions is God-Tier magic. I mean...potion that prevents lying? Potion that makes you change shapes? Potion that can make you know how to do anything you want regardless if you have the required skill? (The Luck Potion). Definatly Potions. Charms are useful too. Waterbreathing charm, for example, removes pressure.

2. Try and find a method of immortality.

3. Screw with Muggles.

** I don't think I'd be as normal as Harry is.

I'd probably be angrier (like mentioned here already) and more confused about my identity. I'd probably struggle with a lot of questions: Who am I? Why me? What is expected of me? What do I want? I'd probably struggle with feeling isolated from my classmates because I went through something not many could relate to. And I'm the center of attention every year (good or bad but mostly bad).

On that note, I'd probably talk to kids who'd been affected by the last war more too. If only to feel like “Damn, I wasn't the only one that ordeal screwed.” Neville comes to mind.

I know Harry had his moments but for a kid who was going through all that he was, I'd say he was extremely well.

I suppose it was just his personality. If you really want to twist and analyze you could argue that him obsessing over Quidditch and not trying so hard to confront the past is a defense mechanism. He just wants to feel normal, why would he run after the things that make him different?

I would not. I'd probably get swept away with it to the point of unhealthy obsession and chill out a little only after several dramatic incidents.

Also, more than anything, the thing that has bothered me the most is how much of his history Harry learns from other people. I would find out absolutely everything I could as soon I set my foot in Hogwarts. I would look through old news papers, all the school records, talk to teachers, trace back my ancestry, anything I could.

So basically what Tom Riddle did, now that I think about it. It's only natural for a child to want to know about his parents. I think most people would do this.

** Hm...question is: Do I show up there with what I know now or does the plot of HP get erased from my memory?

Let us say I get to keep all my knowledge:

- you bet I would learn more magic than canon Harry from healing spells, to illusions, dark-arts (I would mean them, too!), rituals, wandless casting (and silent casting) and everything else that seems remotely usefull...especially enchanting (I mean look the Marauder's Map, I doubt you can't make a ton of usefull things, like say an invisibility ring or something like that (carrying the cloak around isn't always practical!))

- I'd try to learn everything the ministry bans (because most is probably pretty powerful/usefull stuff...look at the AK, painless, breaks any defense (unless you place and object between it and yourself or you dodge!), so usefull - but forbidden, even if self-defense? Fuck that!)

- I'd learn magic from other cultures (if possible I'd go there during the summer! I mean forging a document saying that you are allowed to fly by yourself isn't hard and neither is forging a passport, if you have magic that is!)

- I'd become an animagus (and I would NOT register with the leaky sieve (the MoM)...otherwise the DEs and Tom would learn of my form...yeah, wasting an advantage like that? Sorry, nope!)

- I'd look into becoming an metamorphmagus (rituals, blood-transfusions etc. whatever it takes, that talent is too usefull to not have it!)

- I would look into leaving Britain (maybe even before the TWT!)...and I would think very hard about coming back (I might let Voldemort have Britain, they kind of deserve it for their pureblood crap!)

- I would try to befriend Fleur (I'd probably be interested in her romantically, but I don't know if that would work - but friendship would be pretty good, too!)

- I would not end up in Gryffindor (sorry Dumbledore, either Ravenclaw or Slytherin!)

- I would not befriend (Mo-)Ron, I simply do not like him and I wouldn't trust him (abandons Harry twice...yeah, how about: NO! Go to hell RW!)

- I would befriend Hermione (if possible from the start, but I'd confront that troll if I had to and I'd be prepared!)

- I'd find more friends (from all the houses if possible), especially the interesting ones like Susan Bones (having a connection to Amelia sounds usefull!)

- I'd get myself a gun (Trolls and other non-casters can be killed with one, so why waste magic on them?) or several and maybe some mercenaries?

- I'd buy myself a magical tent ASAP...why sleep in a dorm if you can put up your own magical tent (in the dorm, so that teachers can't forbid it!) and have basically a small house for yourself, especially since you can work and learn in there in peace and have a training room, a lounge, a potions-lab etc. :)

- I would like to get my hands on the following items: Pensieve, time-turner, foe-glass, probity probe, secrecy-sensor (detecting lies sounds usefull), sneakoscope, omni-occulars (spying tool...I'd love one with a mike attached), two-way mirrors (several pairs), magical trunk (like the one Moody has), flying carpet (for the lulz, but also as a kind of tactical combat plattform...the people not flying it can attack and they can't easily be hit as those things aren't slow), vanishing cabinet (leave Hogwarts whenever you want to? Yes, please!), sorcerer's stone (I would not destroy the one in the mirror, I'd get it earlier so Voldemort doesn't get it and return it to the Flamels with the request for a meeting...maybe I can get my own from them?)

- I would not let Snape abuse me (I'd write to the Prophet if I have to, in order to muzzle that asshole or get rid of him!)

- I would abuse the cloak of invisibility (restricted section, but also other things!)

- I would put Draco down early (not lethally, but he'd stop attacking me or else!)

- I wouldn't be Dumbledore's sacrificial pet, who is un-aware of what big D is doing!

- I'd try to get my hands on the Black Library!

- I would try to get the horcruxes out of the way early (I'd use the resurrection stone to learn from the greatest of Wizards!)

- I'd also use the Room of Requirement as much as possible

- I would stay in a second tent during the summer (nope, I am not going back to the Dursleys (they can rot in hell for all I care, but killing them isn't worth it!)...putting the tent and some muggle-reppeling wards in a public park would probably work well :) )

- I would sue the people using my name without paying royalties!

- I'd use my fame for free stuff ;)

- I'd sue the Prophet for the smear campaign (if I was still there, I would probably leave before that point in time...at the latest after the TWT!)

- I'd clear Sirius if possible (if not: I'd ask him to ask for asylum somewhere else and I'd join him there!)

- I'd tear Remus Lupin a new one...bloody self-righteous coward! Stayed away for over a decade and then thinks he can slink away as soon as the going gets tough? Gimme a break!

- I probably wouldn't write essays ("Sorry, this is a waste of time and the grade I get isn't usefull either! Only the OWLS and NEWTS count for anything and I will be prepared! Hell, grade my practical double if you need two grades!")

- etc. etc.

=> "Some of these skills take years to learn!"

I have years, especially if I don't slack off as much as canon Harry does and especially if I leave after the TWT (at the latest...with Sirius after second year) and live under a fake name (so that Voldemort doesn't easily track me down!)

Killing? I doubt that killing in a true "It is you or me"-Situation is actually hard...yes, I am speculating, but I doubt that if someone starts shooting me and I have a gun that I would freeze (I know that this can happen and that soldiers train for this and some still freeze, but somehow I doubt I am in that category, I value my own life too much!)

=> "Some of these skills aren't all that usefull"

Well because nobody uses them really...there were (sadly!) no animagi-spies etc. (despite that being a usefull function for an animagus that is not registered!)
