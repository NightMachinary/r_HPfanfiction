It's the standard for time travel fics to have the characters go back in time--start of Hogwarts, some time during Howgarts, Marauders era, that sort of thing. Are there any good fics where the characters travel /forward/ in time?


** Browncoat, Green Eyes is a Firefly crossover that has Harry travel forward in time for about 150 years (not sure on the exact amount) by basically entering stasis. The setting is mostly Firefly, and won't make much sense unless you've seen the series and movie, but the focus is mostly on Harry. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][link]] in case the bot is still down, or linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon) if not.

*** You don't need any knowledge of firefly to read that. In fact, I'd bet most people who read it had no knowledge of it at the time, and upon reading it, binge watched the series afterwards.

**** Ah, that might have just been me then. The way I remember it, though, I started reading it more for the Firefly part because to be honest, Harry in it is massively overpowered and after (I'm trying to phrase it so it's not a spoiler) they meet those old people, it was really boring and I stopped reading.

I wouldn't recommend it to someone if they didn't also want to read about Firefly because Harry's part is only really interesting in terms of relationships with the setting, for me at least.

***** I honestly enjoyed the story in general, but it definitely has flaws. Harry being godlike is probably one of the lesser ones. Several of the main Firefly cast people are underutilized and flat, and relationship between the stated main characters has no payoff at all. I'm not expecting smut, but it kind of fizzles out.

Still a good adventure story, and the setting is interesting, but it has some issues.

Hmm, if time-travel used as a plot device for explaining the crossover merger is fine, then I'll add [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10006313/1/Ascension][/Ascension/]] (141,467WL; Complete) to the list.

This one is a HP x Mass Effect story that follows stations of Mass Effect (IIRC) but the author is at least quite knowledgeable about Mass Effect-verse.

  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out. (Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone)
