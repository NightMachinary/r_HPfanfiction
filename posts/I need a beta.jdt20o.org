*Looking for a Beta*

My fanfic is a Drarry one. It currently doesn't have any chapters posted except for the prologue. I cannot give you the link to the Google doc as everyone would be able to access it. Once you agree, I'll send you a private message.

The genre will be the same as HP just with more romance. There will be triggers for PTSD and Abuse (not sexual). I am not going to have heavy smut, if at all, as I'm uncomfortable writing it and I've (somehow) convinced my mother to be a second beta. If there is to be any smut at some point, it would be when they're both sixteen. There will be some light swearing unless the situation calls for more.

My beta will need to help me with grammatical errors and the like. Also, any ideas would be appreciated (I won't claim that it's mine if you came up with it).

I don't have a specific word count but I'd like it be 50+ chapters, at least 1.5k words each.

If you want something in return, I can make fanart for you (though I'm not the best) and/or name an OC after you. If you want something different, tell me and I'll think on it. Me being a beta for you is completely off the table, sorry.

If you aren't one but you have a beta yourself and you trust them, please give me their user. I'm a very paranoid person and I'm worried that my beta will steal my ideas from me.

If you are against LGBTQ+, don't bother to comment.
