As you can read I am looking for one specific Fanfiction... only problem I‘ve forgotten the name of it.

Basically: Harry travels back in time Takes an identity as a cousin of James Potter, who was homeschooled He takes his NEWTs and gets into the Aurorforce He is one the most effective of the Aurors on the battlefield During a trip he meets another very good auror, who is american She moves in with him because the americans need someone to talk with the British In the end he kills Voldemort and ends the war, while his parents and his past self survive without greater damage He tells his father and his father's friends the truth about himself

The story is like 5 or 6 chapters long Like I said I don't know the title and I would be very grateful if someone knows this story


** That would be linkffn(8821847) if I'm not mistaken.

  Harry was massively disappointed in how things were going after the final battle. Nothing had changed, it only looked like it on the outside. So he decides to change the past to prevent certain things from happening. Being the Master of Death has its perks. Time-travel, Harry / OC
