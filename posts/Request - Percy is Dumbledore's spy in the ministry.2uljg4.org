It seemed obvious to me when reading Harry Potter the first time through that Percy was Dumbledore's spy in the ministry, just as Snape was Dumbledore's spy in the Death Eaters. Snape killed Dumbledore to cement his place with the DEs, and Percy rejected his family to cement his place in the ministry. It irked me that Rowling never got around to revealing this truth to her readers. :P

I've been meaning to write a story with this theme, but am realizing it's probably never going to happen. Are there any good fics out there that explore this idea? Anyone feel like writing one? Bonus points if Fred Weasley was Percy's only contact after Dumbledore's death.


** Not /quite/ on the mark, but:

** In Vera Rozhalsky's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/][Amends, or Truth and Reconcilliation]], it is revealed that Percy was not so much Dumbledore's spy as having subtly but effectively used his position in foreign affairs to sabotage the Voldemort-controlled Ministry's international efforts. For example, [[/s][SPOILER]].

** I think I've seen this (Percy as a spy) once or twice, but I can't remember the story names. (Although, I usually ignore non-Harry focused stories, so maybe there are more out there that I'm unaware of.)

Edit: site still seems down.
