Hey guys,

my last request for now (I've done this as 3 separate postings in order to be able to keep the request separatly - doing three request in one thread is just messy IMHO):

Give me your best stories about Hogwarts being fixed - from the teachers (someone like Snape isn't fit to teach - at least not the younger years, not to mention having a ghost bore people to death in history -.- etc.), to the reward system (sorry, but the housecup would not interest me at all, there's no advantage to having it, so why bother!), the classes (it always bothers me that there's no such thing as teaching economics or law (the students are finished with their schooling after Hogwarts and have to work, so they should know the basics at least IMHO), not to mention things like enchanting etc.), the school itself (trick stairs and traps in a school? - come on that's unnecessary and even dangerous) etc.

As always, please NO SLASH - Het and gen is fine :)

Thanks once again - and yes, that's my final request (for now) as I am going to bed now (it's way past bedtime in Germany)

  In his sixth year at Hogwarts, Harry is faced with an evil greater than any he has seen before, an evil so huge that all wizards, whatever their loyalties, must band together to survive it... COMPLETE!

** I think that linkffn(Calculations)might be just what you're looking for. Don't take it too seriously, but it's a nice long one-shot (18k words) about how a genius Harry gets appointed the Headmastership rather than a House.

  Young Harry liked numbers, he liked using numbers and working out the value of things. When he found out that he was a wizard and had a big pile of gold... well, he had something new to calculate. oneshot, complete, don't own.

** linkffn(Riddle And The Ancient Contract) is amaaazing! Contains kind of dark femHarry with a nicer Tom Riddle. Also has amazing detail on the rebuilding of hogwarts and its education later on!

*** This is... oddly interesting. I'm about ten chapters in, and it sorta seems like a sterotypical "lord slytherin-potter-black-hufflepuff etc" story... but I'm having fun with it anyways. I like how they changed harry/hari 's character and riddles, but i dislike all the other ooc characters. And i wish they had explained exactly how riddle regained his sanity - im assumjng destroying the horcruxi (?) returned his soul to himself rather than having them destroyed.

**** I think they explain how he regained his sanity very early on. It seems that when a horcrux is destroyed, the soul slice returns to its original (i think they call it an "immortal soul" since souls do not disappear unlike the body). This also means that when the soul slice is returned, the insanity disappears a little bit. Also, its said that the diary, as Tom's first horcrux, contains a full half of his soul, which means he would regain most of his sanity when it was destroyed.

  What if it wasn't anything the current Potters had done that saved little Harika Potter as an infant? What if the child prodigy Thomas Riddle had tweaked the horcrux spell before creating them? And what happens when they discover that nothing is exactly what it seems? FemHarry, DumbledoreBashing EXPLICIT SEX/ MENTION OF RAPE. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.
