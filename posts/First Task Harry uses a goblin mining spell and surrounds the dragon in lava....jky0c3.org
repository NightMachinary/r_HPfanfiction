:END:
Any ideas on which fanfic this is from? Thanks in advance

Awkward: I've just recommended Family Bonds to someone looking for an alchemy/flamel fic. This is also the one with the mining spell..... ðŸ˜‚ðŸ™ˆ


** No clue, but based on it being a goblin spell, maybe Harry Crow? I don't think I've ever read a fic besides that where he knows goblin magic

  When, after that fateful Halloween night, the wrong Potter twin is hailed the Boy Who Lived, how will Harry's life turn out? With a power he knows not, an ancient prophecy and one Severus Snape practically raising him, interesting at least is a given.
