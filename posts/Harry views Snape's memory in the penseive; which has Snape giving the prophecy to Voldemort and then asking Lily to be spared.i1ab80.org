Instead of the canon "worst" memory in the fifth book, Harry witnesses Snape telling Voldemort about the part of the prophecy he overheard. When Voldemort speculates about the Potters, both Order members who've escaped him thrice, Snape asks Lily to be spared in place of Harry and James.

I'm interested in Harry's reaction to the prophecy itself, its existence hidden from him till date and the reason why Voldemort targeted him, about Snape's interest in his mother (who Voldemort would've openly called a mudblood). Maybe Voldemort would even consider stealing the full text of the prophecy available in the Department of Mysteries.

What would happen if Snape catches Harry? Would he attempt to obliviate Harry? Maybe Harry escapes without a confrontation or wilfully engages in one?


** You know, it always surprised me why he chooses that memory. Surely there were other memories more important to keep away from Harry. And also maybe more embarrassing things to hide. Like, I don't know, maybe Harry could have found a memory of Snape wanking in the loo mouthing Lily's name. Harry's reaction there would have been interesting.

These men he wants to be like? They're no better than the Dursleys. Snape doesn't just get revenge against Harry. He gets it against James as well.

**** I doubt it. I'm quite sure that as a spy for the Order, Snape knew better than anyone how important it was for Harry to shut his mind to Voldemort. Yet when he catches Harry snooping into the Pensieve, he goes completely bonkers and not only refuses to further teach him Occlumency but throws vials at him as he kicks him out of his office. Also the fact that he refuses to even acknowledge Harry's existence afterwards shows that he is really pissed and rather than dealing with the boy anymore, he prefers to go the Dumbledore route.

It's not fanon. We actually see several of Snape's classes. Case in point his first lesson, Shrinking Potion in 3rd year, and his potion classes in fifth year.

He's a horrible teacher; he does /not/ teach (putting instructions on the board and telling them to get to it doesn't count) and he's insanely biased which makes it even worse. I've had bad teachers, though never as horrible as Snape or as biased, and I still got good marks because I studied for the exams, just like Harry did.

******** I really don't know what he was because besides a few snapshots of his classes when he's arguing with Harry there's nothing else in the books so everyone can fill in the gaps however they like when they write their fic. He's presented as horrible and a bully but there's no conclusive assessment of his teaching quality in canon. My conclusion is that since Harry got a decent grade probably his teaching style was at the very least somewhat functional.

What? Anyway, Snape is canonically a triple agent. Voldemort already knows he's a double agent, one that works for him! That's the whole point of the last two books, with the end showing him as a triple agent.

As a reader however I say that last twist plot doesn't really fit with the character. Who he's actually working for isn't clear at all.

As for his teaching, like it has been said, it isn't fanon. He never once taught anything in class. Admittedly we didn't see many lessons, but other teachers at least taught /something!/

I think the response is pretty justified. The Pensieve would show what you are most curious about. In Goblet of Fire, he sees Barty Crouch Junior in his dreams, and that is what is shown in the Pensieve when he goes to Dumbledore's office.

Similarly. I think the biggest question that exists with regards to Snape at the time is this: Why does Snape hate Harry Potter so much. and that is what was shown to him.

** From my pov, the entire 'memory' was manufactured.

Why? Because it makes James look bad, but far more importantly, is shows Remus speaking publicly about being a werewolf, BEFORE Sirius tricked Snape into meeting Remus during his 'time of the month.'

*/Harry looked around and glimpsed Snape a short way away, moving between the tables towards the doors to the Entrance Hall, still absorbed in his own exam paper. Round-shouldered yet angular, he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider, and his oily hair was jumping about his face./*\\
*/A gang of chattering girls separated Snape from James, Sirius and Lupin, and by planting/*\\
*/himself in their midst, Harry managed to keep Snape in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of James and his friends./*\\
*/“Did you like question ten, Moony?” asked Sirius as they emerged into the Entrance Hall./*\\
*/“Loved it,” said Lupin briskly. “Give five signs that identify the werewolf. Excellent question.”/*\\
*/“D'you think you managed to get all the signs?” said James in tones of mock concern./*\\
*/“Think I did,” said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors/*\\
*/eager to get out into the sunlit grounds. “One: he's sitting on my chair. Two: he's wearing my/*\\
*/clothes. Three: his name's Remus Lupin.”/*\\
*/Wormtail was the only one who didn't laugh./*\\
*/“I got the snout shape, the pupils of the eyes and the tufted tail,' he said anxiously, “but I/*\\
*/couldn't think what else -”/*\\
*/“How thick are you, Wormtail?” said James impatiently. “You run round with a werewolf once a month -”/*\\
*/“Keep your voice down,” implored Lupin./*\\
*/Harry looked anxiously behind him again. Snape remained close by, still buried in his exam/*\\
*/questions - but this was Snape's memory and Harry was sure that if Snape chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the grounds, he, Harry, would not be able to follow James any further. To his intense relief, however, when James and his three friends strode off down the lawn towards the lake, Snape followed, still poring over the exam paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where he was going. By keeping a little ahead of him, Harry managed to maintain a close watch on James and the others./*

In order for this to have been Snape's actual memory, he would have had to know Remus was a Were before he found out.

So, either this is a manufactured memory or yet another of Rowling's glaring plot holes.

*** I hate Snape as much as the next person, but you have the chronology of the order of events mixed up.

The incident where Snape snoops around the Willow after Sirius tells him about the knot at the base of its roots (and subsequently sees Remus transforming into a werewolf) happens before the time when James strings him after their defence OWL. We see this when Snape tries snivelling when he inadvertently admits to Lily that he found using dark magic on her schoolmate funny.

The memory after their OWL happens afterwards, since Lily is still talking to him.

*** The memory resurfaces again in the Prince's Tale, at which time Snape was dying so I doubt he would have been fit to manufacture memories. Also in Prince's Tale, the memory just before it is about Snape arguing with Lily about Snape's theory of Lupin's condition as well as the fact that James saved his life. So it means that Snape had already been in the Shrieking Shack to have seen the werewolf there even if he didn't know for sure whether it was Lupin or not.

The only way it could possibly make sense is if he was sure that it didn't matter if Voldemort found it out. That is to say, he was /certain/ that Snape was actually loyal to Voldemort, and that therefore none of his secrets needed to be respected, because he just needed to be executed.
