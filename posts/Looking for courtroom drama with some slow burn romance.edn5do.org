I would like something with a criminal trial, maybe somewhere between DH and the epilogue, with a romance between the prosecutor and the defense attorney. I would prefer it if Harry was one of the attorneys because I prefer fics where Harry is at least /a/ main character, but I'll take pretty much anything. Thanks.


** Probably not something you expected, but I liked linkao3(20795585).
