*** I love Messing With Time so so much, I wish there was more of it. i took the author's update in December as an "I haven't abandoned this" statement, but with nothing since, it makes me sad.

*** Oh God Not Again is such a bad example of "Time travel with Harry saying screw it and doing his own thing".

It is a canon rehash in the worst sense. The story bends over backwards to make sure it stops at every single station on the canon timeline. It has to spend half its time plugging the holes that are created whenever Harry even slightly varies from canon.

None of the characters are likeable, except for maybe Gilderoy who is genuinely entertaining. Harry is the worst of a bad bunch. For the most part they don't actually seem like friends at all.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
