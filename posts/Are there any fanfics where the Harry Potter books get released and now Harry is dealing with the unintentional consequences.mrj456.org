** The closest fics I'm aware of are linkffn(The Girl of Steel and the Silver Speedster by mysteryman10000) and linkffn(The Lightning-Struck Soldier by TheUnHolySmirk). They're both Supergirl crossovers where Harry ends up in the Supergirl universe, where the Harry Potter books exist because Rowling can subconsciously see into his universe (it's an idea that exists in Supergirl canon, as far as I can tell).

In both stories, Harry does have to deal with people who know a lot about his life, but the details aren't exactly always accurate. And the people who find out that their favorite fictional character is real tend to make a bigger deal out of it than he does.

They're also both pretty safe to read fandom-blind. I have a decent general knowledge of DC comics, but I knew nothing about the Supergirl series before reading them, and I was still able to enjoy them.

  Supergirl is a hero. A beacon of hope for the people of National City and the world. But when tragedy strikes, she learns that her heart isn't as unbreakable as the rest of her. In her darkest hour, when she questions her very humanity, who will be the hero that saves her? Will the darkest speedster in the multiverse be the light of hope for Kara Danvers? Can they save each other?

  He handed Alex the book so she could read the gold lettering stamped into the top of the front cover, The Lightning-Struck Soldier. Below a minimalistic cartoon of a cupboard door was the name "HJ Granger". / Alex felt weak in the knees. "Hermione Granger wrote this?" / Harry smiled. "Best woman I ever knew. Bit barmy at times, though."
