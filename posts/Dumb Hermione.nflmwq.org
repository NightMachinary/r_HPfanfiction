Harry reads the other two's papers. He can't reconcile how bad Hermione's are with her class rank, bossy-know-it-all persona, and convenient research gets. Which reveals manipulative Dumbledore early.

IIRC she barely passes OWLS and Ron has to repeat the year.

It was on FFN and I think fairly short.


** I kind of remember this? He finds the class ranks (in McGonagall's office maybe) and sees Hermione is not actually ranked first? And Remus wrote in his notes that Harry 'had potential'.

Aaa if I remember the name I'll post

Edit: Found it!
