  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

** Yet another chance to recommend one of my favorite fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817/1/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes][Something Wicked This Way Comes]] by the Mad Mad Reviewer has Voldemort as smart and classy. He still loses, but that's more due to the AU circumstances of the fic than getting handed the idiot ball.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8704528/1/Enveloped-in-the-Darkness]]} and its sequal might work and there's the classic linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land]])

I wouldn't say he's exceptionally smart in either, but he's extremely competent as opposed to all of the ones where his downfall is just taken care of while he sits around

  COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment. (Currently being re-edited.)
