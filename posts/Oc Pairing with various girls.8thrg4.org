I am looking for fics with an original male character as the main character getting paired up with Hermione or fleur or any other girl instead of another OC.

It can be an self insert or anything else. It can be mature too.

Thanks in advance


** I can't think of much but there is Mark Moon from Northumbrian's universe, who dates Lavender Brown. They're side characters in his Hunters and Prey fic and there's about 4 or 5 one shots about them as well, as well as appearances in other stories in the universe.
