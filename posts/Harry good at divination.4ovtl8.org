I had recently read a Naruto fanfic where Sakura practices the art of divination, so I came up with idea of Harry as a seer or good at divination. What ideas could I use, and are there other pics where Harry excels at divination.


** I love brainstorming! Feel free to use any:

*"Realistic" Idea* - You could always go the Observant Harry route. Where, since he was an outcast at the Dursleys, he learned the art of people watching. Which can evolve into being able to predict people and their actions. So not /really/ divination, but incredibly skillful all the same. Bonus: Harry accidentally starts a cult because people think he can truly see the future.

*Creature-fic Idea* - He gets abandoned by the Dursleys and raised by centaurs, who teach him the way of the stars.

*Crack Idea* - Harry is obsessed with tea. He starts practicing tasseography as an excuse to brew more tea and discovers he's actually talented at it.

*** Realistic is Psych!/Harry Fusion

Creature is probably done before.

Crack idea - Kinda like it. There's one where he's summoned to another world and says he's a divination expert and since he's been so injured on the trip over, no one recognizes harry until the map comes into place.

  Imagine Harry Potter raised under the guiding hand of Sibyll Trelawney. He arrives at Hogwarts versed in the higher arts of Divination, Arithmancy, Numerology, and Palmistry - you know 'real magic.' Prepare yourself for one humorous ride.

** i believe it was called 1 800 rent a hero but it was a fic where harry gets summoned to alternative universe by dumbles and crew and winds up being the divination professor and using it a lot was an interesting take on divination not sure if it was ever finshed

***** Pretty sure it's a fair use thing tbh, since it's asking for money off some else's copyrighted work and it's not exactly transformative.

****** Fair use is supposed to be a defense for using someone's copyrighted work and doing something that alters the value of it in a way that is transformative.

Fanfiction typically falls in the non-transformative area, and it does impact the value of the original work.

The reason why fanfiction is tolerated so much by various publishers is because the writers do not directly profit off of it. By asking for money, braintheif is not only going against this, but putting fanfiction as a whole at risk.

**** If handled correctly I don't mind it at all, Coeur Al'Aran does it well, where he will keep writing no matter what, but has his patron set up that if people donate enough he can devote more time to writing. Right now he has five stories, and every single one of them gets a decent update every two weeks. Professor Arc and Not this Time Fate on alternating Fridays, Stress Relief and One Turn for Another on alternating Mondays, and From Beyond every Sunday.

Hell, in general I actually only really care that they follow through, if not it feels like stealing. Like Brainthief's Patreon, which from what I can tell we hit the goal in over a month ago, which should have insured an update every two weeks, but low and behold, no update.

**** Both. He's traveled back a few years so he has some idea of immediate events but since he tries to change them things start going differently. But he also actually discovers the real divination that no one has taught in over a century, starts to learn it and teach it (one chapter ahead kind of teaching). linkffn(11160991)

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP
