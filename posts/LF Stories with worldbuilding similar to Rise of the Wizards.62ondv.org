I really enjoyed the worldbuilding and the ending on that story. While the beginning was a bit of a slog, it quickly got better. I'm looking for similar stories, that are at least 150k words or more, complete, and have great worldbuilding, preferably featuring a dark or semi dark Harry, but that isn't a requirement. No slash please. Thank you for your time.


** For worldbuilding, I really like linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) and linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19).

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  A Harry Potter cursed with immortality must not only survive the raping of Earth by monsters far more powerful than any humanity has encountered, but he must rise to save it, and in the process exact one wizard's revenge against the Galactic Empire.
