:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read it 2-3 years ago and can't find it! Story from Neville's POV as he leads the DA during their 7th year while the trio is off hunting Horcruxes. Multi chapter, long, some romance. I remember it was popular with lots of reviews. Probably on FF.net but not for sure. True to canon, nothing very unusual about the plot/story/characters, nothing AU. Rating was T or M. Fairly similar to JKR writing style. Please help!


** Dumbledore's army and the year of darkness by thanfiction. Hopefully someone has a downloaded file to share because I'd love to read it again

*** Oh no it definitely wasn't that infamous fic. This one was pretty “normal”, no extreme violence or anything like that. Thanks though

***** Something about the author being very mentally ill and running some kind of cult?
