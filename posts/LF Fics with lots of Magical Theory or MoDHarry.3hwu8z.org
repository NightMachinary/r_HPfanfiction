Not together, I'm looking for fics with either one.

By the first I mean things like HPMoR or Knowledge is Power where Harry or someone else explores the nature of magic or obscure branches of magic. !linkffn(5782108) !linkffn(5142565)

Thanks!

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

  As the Master of Death, Harry cannot be taken by time. His friends were allowed to live out their lives, while he remained unchanged until they finally passed on. With nothing left to live for in his world, he sought out a new world, where he will find new friends and more danger than he's ever been in before. Middle-Earth might never be the same again, after Harry's done with it.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  He's been stuck like this for a couple of beginnings, and so many ends. Millennium have passed by and his age never changes, his skin cannot stay pierced, his body cannot die; thus locking his soul, binding him forever to this existence. This stranger comes into their lives, and they're unprepared for the events that follow after him. Viper is an interesting enigma. Immortal!Harry

#+begin_quote
  Made to endure until the End, Harry Potter saw civilisations rise and fall, continents break and drown from his eagle's view high up in the sky. In the land of Middle-earth, he'd thought that he ought to help the poor sods trying to destroy the latest Dark Lord. So begins the tale of a Fellowship plus one, Rings, and a long journey to a volcano.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)
