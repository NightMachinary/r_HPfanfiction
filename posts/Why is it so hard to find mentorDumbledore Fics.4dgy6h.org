Despite the time when Harry destroys his office in OotP, Harry and Dumbledore always had a good relationship. Dumbledore is without a doubt the most powerful good character in the series and we all know that Fanfiction writers and readers love powerful Harry fics so why is it so hard to find stories where Harry and Dumbledore have a good relationship and he either mentors Harry or takes him on as his apprentice? I feel like this would be one of the most obvious points in fanfics that it would become cliche but in my opinion it hasn't. Its also an obvious way to counter people who get angry when Harry becomes powerful over night. Have him train with him for a time and voila, his new skills are now at least slightly more believable. But no this doesn't seem to be the case, there are thousands upon thousands of evil or senile Dumbledore fics. I don't know why this is but I know when I find a good mentor fic I make sure to enjoy it. That being said do you guys have any recommendations for mentor!Dumbledore fics (not just mentor in magic but life in general is fine)?


** linkffn(By The Divining Light) and it's sequel are two of the best fic s that meet that requirement.

Manipulative!AD is a common trope because it gives Harry another antagonist besides Voldemort and is necessary for Harry to branch off on in his own and become independent. The death of a mentor is as central to fiction as any plot device. Look at canon, lotr, star wars etc.. having AD turn against him accomplishes the same effect without having to kill AD off. Without it he'd have to die, so one might think of it as a way to save AD's life.

** Two main reasons:

1. Most fanfic is written by teenagers and they tend to love rebellion against authority themes.

2. The majority of the fandom has a poor understanding of canon, and in particular Dumbledore (see, for example, Dumbledore using the phrase "for the greater good" in so many fanfics, when this is exactly the philosophy he is against).

This isn't necessarily true. Dumbledore talks about the failure in his plan. He was sacrificing Harry from the very beginning, having him grow up with the Dursleys was a part of that. But he cared about Harry too much. In the end he cared more about Harry's happiness than the wizarding world. His plan was always for the greater good though. Even if he lacked fallow through.

**** He's rather more complex than that. Dumbledore runs a balancing act and does not consistently place Harry's interests above the world or vice versa. He tries to balance the two. He keeps Harry ignorant of uncomfortable truths, but allows Harry the freedom to discover them for himself. He doesn't push Harry to confront danger (as he would if he was training a soldier), but permits Harry to seek it out.

Going by the fandom's absurd definition of "manipulative" (which basically amounts to "influence or control"), all parents are manipulative. Dumbledore is essentially Harry's parent (due to in loco parentis) and those actions of his which are called manipulative are typical of good parenting (e.g. withholding uncomfortable truths until the child is old enough to deal with them). The problem with Dumbledore, from a traditional parenting perspective, is actually that he's not manipulative enough. From the parental perspective, he allows Harry too much freedom to seek out danger. That's where he's compromising his duty to Harry to satisfy his duty towards the wider world. But he does it selectively and within limits, not completely. He still mostly puts Harry's interests first.

With regards to Dumbledore's conversations with Snape, everyone seems to forget that Dumbledore is telling Snape what he needs to hear, not the truth. The truth is that Dumbledore was planning for Harry to survive the forest encounter with Voldemort, but he also needed Harry to enter the forest fully believing that he was about to make a genuine sacrifice. So Dumbledore lies to Snape about sacrificing Harry in order for Snape to believe it fully and then pass that belief on to Harry.

It's just one of those things you have to accept about Dumbledore that he had an inhuman level of foresight. Dude is like the Emperor from Star Wars.

The bigger problem really is that Dumbledore's general competence seems to vary from having an inhuman level of foresight one moment to being practically useless the next based on the vagaries of the plot. If Dumbledore really did have that level of foresight consistently, a majority of the key conflicts in the books simply wouldn't happen. I suppose some of this can be blamed on JKR painting herself into a corner in books 1-4, but Dumbledore's selective uselessness always annoyed me in canon.

To resolve this inconsistency, the easiest way out is to either make Dumbledore have his own agenda that does not always align with Harry's, make him senile or kill him off.

Is Albus the conscious manipulator of fanon? Of course not, but he wasn't a good parent either.

I think your reasoning falls apart when Albus is compared to another parental figure in the series. Sirius wanted to be open and honest about information that directly affected his godson's well-being, even though Harry was perhaps too young to react to this knowledge in a mature fashion. Even if it would have been a short-term mistake to share details with him, Sirius respected Harry's agency more than Albus.

I also don't buy into the part of your argument that hinges on the belief that Harry would live long enough to 'deal with uncomfortable truths.' There is no reason to believe that this should be a valid assumption after TMR's rebirth. Given the life-and-death nature of Voldemort's interest in all things Harry Potter, Sirius' stated goal of complete disclosure has a much better chance of providing Harry with the tools he needs to stay alive than Albus' decision to limit Harry's access to information.

Dumbledore's stated excuse of 'caring too much' falls a bit flat for me. Does this mean that Sirius /didn't/ care about Harry's well-being because of his interest in providing Harry with information? Wanting a child to stay pure and innocent for as long as possible is exceptionally bad parenting.

This needs a citation. I just reread the passages in 'The Prince's Tale' and 'King's Cross' and found no cause to assume this to be true. Pure (fanon) speculation, not the gospel truth as you've indicated.

** It is a difficult subject, but alot of people really did not like the revelations given in DH. Those revelations showed Dumbledore in a terrible light, as both a manipulator, and a human being who was led astray by his own dreams. (I speak of Grindlewald and the Deathly Hallows)

To be fair, Dumbledore was right. It is human nature to avoid death if possible. Dumbledore knew that to tell harry before he had destroyed the other horcruxes would break Harry's resolve. Dumbledore also knew that Harry would not be able to learn enough in the 9-12 months that Dumbledore had left to teach him, no matter what occured. (I am thinking of HBP now) He would not have considered training Harry to be a soldier because Dumbledore was a pacifist.

Its difficult to write a pacifist especially when a portion of the story is always going to be preparation for war, and another portion will involve war. Dumbledore had to make an impossible choice. Dumbledore had to either turn a child into a soldier, knowing that he would die in the attempt. He tried his best to skirt the fence on both fronts. In a way Dumbledore trained Harry in canon.

its for those reasons you dont see many Dumbledore as a mentor fics. To be fair, Shezza at least makes Harry and Dumbledore allies. that is the only one I dont see mentioned so far. so linkffn(the Denarian Renegade)

*** I see what your saying here but my confusion has always been around the point that's its Fanfiction! If people don't like what came out about Dumbledore, in your AU make it not happen. Change how things happened in later books! Its as if all these readers and writers want Dumbledore to be evil. I understand Dumbledore bashing has allowed some to give an excuse for Harry to come into his own / become more independent but I've seen some of the best fics written where they had a good relationship and Harry still was his own person. Where Harry goes to him for advice but that doesn't mean he has to follow it. Anyway, I've read my fair share of evil Dumbledore fics that I've liked but I just wish they were balanced out with an equal amount of well written Dumbledores.

I think it would be more realistic if Harry held AD at arms length. Hagrid tells Harry that AD gave him to the Dursleys. Coming out of the hut on the rock, Harry knows AD didn't care or didn't check, in either case why is the guy important in his life? Doesn't make sense to me.

AD earning his trust could be interesting. Harry finding another mentor (Sirius? Dan Granger? Arthur? Remus? Andromeda? Augusta? Amelia? Mad Eye?) could work.

Dumbledore is a very busy man. He is already running a school with hundreds of students, as well as serving as the Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump; and given the overall state of magical governance, we should be glad he is.

Would mentoring a student like Harry --- who doesn't learn magic and other things any faster than his classmates and is rather reluctant to study in the first place any more than the minimum he has to to satisfy his immediate magical needs --- really be a good use of his time? If you want an adult to mentor Harry, someone like Remus or Sirius seem like a better idea, and it'd be years and years before they'd run out of things to teach him so that Harry would need to "graduate" to Dumbledore --- assuming Harry were even capable of mastering the sorts of things Dumbledore and only Dumbledore could teach.

** I don't like Dumbledore bashing, because his actions were bad enough in canon. Oh, I'm not talking about him dumping Harry at Dursleys or using him as a sacrificial lamb, I'm more pissed about his inactions after knowing Voldemort's true nature as far back as 1957, and the general ineffectiveness of the Order.

Either JKR significantly downgrades Dumbledore's overall importance and influence in the British Wizarding World, or we have to assume he was incompetent in dealing with Voldemort. If JKR writes that although Dumbledore was superbly intelligent and wise, he was feared and shunned by those in power, and his warnings about Voldemort went largely ignored for decades, then his ineffectiveness (or rather difficulties) against Voldemort would be largely explained away. That would imho make the entire plot far more believable and credible. It would also explain why so little was done against Death Eaters after Voldemort's first fall, and why Lucius Malfoy could corrupt the government with impunity.

That being said, there is one story in which Dumbledore played a very positive role, and that came from an author who generally bashed him mercilessly before: *Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5]] generally writes competent Dumbledores: *Patron* and *The Dark Lord Never Died*, linkffn(11773877;11080542)

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** People love to bash Dumbledore on top of what was tossed onto the inferno in DH. Dumbledore bashing fics also serve for interesting, if occasionally worked up plots.

*** I understand that. I myself have read tons of Dumbledore bashing fics and enjoyed them its just I always thought the concept of a mentor Dumbledore was obvious enough or appealing enough that there would be at least an equal amount of those kind. Or at the very least more of them then there currently out there. I must have just underestimated the anger fellow fans had against the character after DH. He's always been my favorite character because he is so complex.

**** The problem is that canon Dumbledore fails just far too often. Most of his failures are plot devices so Harry can be the hero, but we rarely see Dumbledore accomplishing something. He usually appears (too) late, and does some clean-up, at the end of the year.
