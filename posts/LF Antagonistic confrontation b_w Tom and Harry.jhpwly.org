1. Horcrux or time-travel or whatsoever Tom and Harry are antagonistic towards each other(hopefully which ends in a semblance of friendship or truce, but I'm not picky)

2. No Heartbreaking Endings... e.g. Diablerie, Friend or Foe, The Unwinding Golden Thread... When I was halfway through them I was like "eheh this is just what I was lookin for" and at the last chapter I was like "oh no!!! Why do you always kill Tom or irreversibly traumatize him?" Not that they were bad fics. I'd say they were good, if anything. I just don't enjoy such endings that's that.

3. No Dead fics. Hopefully Complete of WIP. No FemHarry or FemRiddle.

I'm okay with Voldemort instead of Tom and both slash and nonslash. Just, if it's slash, I'd rather they were all not just fluffy, thx in advance!


** My bad! Diablerie ended abruptly because I held myself to a ridiculous chapter amount and realized I couldn't finish a gigantic plot in that time. So, open ended it is
