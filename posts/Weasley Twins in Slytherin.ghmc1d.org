Has anybody done this? I'm a sucker for all things Twin-centric, ideally with the Twins characterized much as they are in canon - if they're dark and evil, the characters are no longer /The Twins/ so I'm not so interested. But that aside, I'm convinced the canon characters have enough inner-Slytherin to have been sorted that way, had the Hat been so inclined.


** They are evil they murdered Ron's Pet for fun

***** Okay, I had to go look this up because it is *not* in the books. For anyone else who's as lost as I was, Rowling published a kid's book called /Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them/ (not the movie), supposedly a copy of Harry's textbook. In the textbook, there's writing in the margin "from Ron" saying he had a Puffskein until Fred used it for Bludger practice.

There's a long distance between that and "beat to death with beater bats"! The marginalia doesn't specify that the pet died. It doesn't say that it was hit with a bat at all - Fred might have chucked it at George for practice dodging. And it's pretty clear to me at least that the puffskein died (or was taken away) as an accident from childish thoughtlessness in normal play, *not* because the twins set out to hurt something.

****** If some children played baseball using a cat they would be considered serial killers in the making this is no different
