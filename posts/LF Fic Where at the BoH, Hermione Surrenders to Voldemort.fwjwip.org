Okay, the title is a bit confusing, but I promise I'll explain what I'm looking for.

So you know how Harry dies in the Forbidden Forest but then it turns out he's not really dead? And Voldemort starts gloating and says that anyone who comes out and surrenders can join Him/The Death Eaters and will be, â€˜pardoned' essentially, for fighting on Harry's side?

So I was wondering if there were any stories where Harry really /is/ dead, and Hermione (or Luna) surrenders to join them?

I'd love a multi chapter fic with this idea. Just something I was thinking about!

Thank you! :)
