Hi, I'm looking for Harry Potter fics that feature an ambitious, motivated Harry like To Young To Die where his goal is revive his sister. I just like seeing the suspense of if he's going to succeed or not. I don't care if he's evil or not, but don't want him to be the self-sacrificing type who's only goal is to save his friends or something. Thanks!

When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.
