linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle by Inverarity) is the first part of the /Alexandra Quick/ series. While it is an American wizarding world with original characters, the writing is honestly amazing, as is the characterization and worldbuilding. Note: It's also on [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1211079][AO3]].

The long-awaited fifth part, linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the World Away), was posted today just minutes ago. It's going to be released at the rate of two chapters a week, but it is completed, so there's no risk of abandonment or hiatus.

PS: The subredddit [[/r/AlexandraQuick][r/AlexandraQuick]] is quite active despite being small, and the community reread threads feature some interesting analysis. Spoilers for books 3, 4, and 5 are hidden, except in the community reread threads where nothing is hidden.


** Good news is the Author said that they finish the whole thing before starting to post, so no huge waits thankfully.

******* That's actually the third book. The personification of Death gives Alex a coin that it says will kill anyone she gives it to and resurrect her brother. She keeps the coin but can't bring herself to use it. At the end she's faced with a portal to the Underworld that won't close without a person entering it, and Alex's choices are to send herself, her enemy, or an adorable innocent bystander, she takes a third option by throwing the Death Coin in which works to close the portal. I don't think this is illogical it just reflects that Alex isn't willing to commit cold-blooded murder.

If it's all written already, why post it piece by piece? I know that from my perspective, I'd rather have it like a book where I can read the lot in an evening than have to wait potentially months.

*** Posting a chapter at a time is better for audience engagement and visibility purposes. If you post a story all at once someone might blitz through and only comment at the end once for the whole story, if that. It will also fall off the ‘newest' sections for its relevant tags quickly and wont ever return to them again afterwords since everything is already posted, meaning after that first post all its traffic will be generated soley by word of mouth or being found incidentally through searches. So generally speaking fewer people will see the work, leave fewer reviews, and it wont reach as large of a readerbase when posted in one chunk.

It IS a good option to post all at once if you just want to be done with, but that also reduces the time you have to write a backlog to post once the story is up.

***** My guess is it's just a better way to keep the fic visible. With the way AO3 and fanfic.net work, if it were all dropped at once, it would be on the front page of for like a day and then it would be gone. By posting it chapter by chapter, it ensures that it will be seen by as many potential readers as possible. Otherwise the only people who read it would be the die-hard fans who stuck with the series after its 7-year haitus.

Personally, I'd rather it be posted chapter-by-chapter because I think it's fun to analyse and speculate with other fans. That, and it gives Inverarity some time to work on Book 6, so that hopefully the next haitus isn't quite as long.

*** The author actually explained this method earlier. He tried to post a multi-chjapter fic all in one go, but this resulted in the entire fic vanishing from the FFN front page after a short time, getting buried in all the other fics, and ending up not getting a lot of readers.

When he switched to the "posting one chapter per week" tactic for the AQ series, that meant it kept returning to the front page, and that again meant that a lot more people discovered and read it.

*** There's certainly merits to piece-by-piece and all at once. I do think piece-by-piece greatly outweighs all at once though. Getting feedback on individual chapters is a huge boon. What if they made a plothole? What if they didn't catch it, and their editors didn't catch it? That might be my biggest fear. It also allows authors to farm more reviews, I guess, but that has never been my goal.

On the other hand, too long in between chapters risks burnout. If I'm reading a lot of fics, it's quite possible that I might forget what happened in the last chapter, and having to reread chapters of a fic that has only just started could be a chore. This was a problem I had with the Dementor's Stigma. Author finished it ahead of time, but put it on a 2 week chapter release schedule. Way overkill, and it was hard for me to keep interest during it. Surely the greatest amount of feedback would be in the first few days after posting, so why prolong it an extra week or 10 days?

While it's possible the final two books might be quicker since the earlier books took much less time to write, this book took 8 years, so you might be waiting a long time.

*** I don't know if I can pitch it, I've never been good at doing that for books, but let me tell you that Lands Below, the second book, is where it starts getting really interesting. I highly recommend reading through that, and if you still don't enjoy it then you probably won't like the rest.
