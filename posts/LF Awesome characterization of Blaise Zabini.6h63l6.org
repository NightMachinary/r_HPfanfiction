So, I have been reading lots of stuff lately and found myself developing an interest in Blaise's character. What I am looking for are completed or WIP (no abandoned ones please) fics that have an awesome Blaise in them. No Fem!Harry, or evil dark Harry please. I prefer slash (but please, for the love of everything good and sexy and delicious in the multiverse no Harry/Tom Riddle or Voldemort!)but can do with het and gen as well. Hit me up with your best Blasies!


** I rather like Blaise in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** These are all Harry/Draco with Blaise on the side, fair warning.

** My favorite Harry/Blaise is "All that is Pure" by Sasha Dimierez. It's a shorter fic so it doesn't go too deeply into his character. It's a finished creature story, but not one of those stories that is full of ridiculous trope after ridiculous trope. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6565419/1/All-That-is-Pure]]

"Rise of the Drackens" by StarLight_Massacre isn't particularly well written and uses some colloquialisms native to a specific part of Britain that took me awhile to understand weren't just straight up grammar errors, but I really like how Blaise is portrayed. It gives him a fairly rich history with a balanced personality that made me appreciate the character more. If you're not already familiar with the story though, prepare yourself for quite a few creature and harem tropes. It's a WIP that's gets updated semi-regularly and is over a million words. However, because of the aforementioned not so brilliant writing, it doesn't take forever and a day to read. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/384548/chapters/629550]]

Unfortunately, some of the best Blaise characterizations I've seen are in abandoned stories.

** I know you said no fem Harry but Blaise is utterly fantastic in linkao3(the girl who lived (again)) he and Harry bond over both being transgender and Blaise joins the DA with a few of his Slytherin friends and fights Voldemort. He has a very Slytherin way of thinking, it's great.

He's also very charismatic in linkao3(turn by saras_girl) and winds up with Ginny.

  Peeves, though he was nasty about everything else--ickle firsties and orphan girls--got it immediately. For all six years of Harry's Hogwarts tenure, he dropped water balloons on the heads of anyone who misgendered her. Professor Binns never quite figured it out, but he didn't know any student's name. Nearly Headless Nick gallantly and somewhat awkwardly called her lady and tried to hold open doors for her, despite the fact that he couldn't open them. Snape called Harry "Mr. Potter" for all seven years that he was in Harry's life. Around year three, Ron stopped counting the detentions he got for his increasingly sarcastic responses to this.
