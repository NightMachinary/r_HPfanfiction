I was just imagining Voldemort with a cat familiar and meowing adorably at it instead of the fearful hissing of parseltongue XD

And it got me wondering if there are any fanfics out there where someone has the gift to talk to an animal that isn't a snake. Preferably Harry or Voldemort and ideally played for laughs, but I'll take whatever, even a small, unimportant mention in a larger fic.


** linkffn(The Fight for Rights) has the fem!Harry speak to both snakes, dragons, and /spiders/ (the latter gift being caled Araknatongue).

  After ten years of silence in a cupboard with her only friends, the spiders, one of them talks to Annabelle Potter! As an arachnatongue - a witch who can understand spider language - Annabelle befriends and allies with spiders around the world as she goes out into it, and together they start an unstoppable change: The fight for the sentient rights of all sapient nonhuman species!
