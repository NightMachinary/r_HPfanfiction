...by other means!

Sorry, but I think Dumbledore's plan is ludicrously stupid (it depends on too many ifs and reeks of desperation...not to mention that him wrecking Harry's life doesn't justify what he does...sorry, but why not lock Voldemort up like Grindelwald if they can't kill him? Hell, containing the spirit (no magical power!) might even be possible!) and I think that Harry is rather dumb for going along with it!

So, stage is yours :)

Note: No slash (at least not main-character-slash!), everything else is fine!

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

**** I've read that (well: Not finished it because it wasn't finished the last time I got it recommended to me!), it wasn't bad (I occasionally like powerful Harry, as long as he has to work for it and does have occasional setbacks!), still:

Thank you!

**** Lot of potential that it just didn't live up to. Once summer hit in the story, it just started getting mired and lost its cohesiveness and direction.

***** I think it went down the drain when just after Christmas. Maybe it's just that I don't like how things went just after the Yule Ball.

****** One of the author's notes talked about one plan for the story where Fleur would break up with Harry at the end of the summer and he would eventually start dating Katie. I think that probably would have been a better route.

  Summer before third year Harry has a life changing experience, and a close encounter with a dementor ends with him absorbing the horcrux within him. Features Harry with a backbone.
