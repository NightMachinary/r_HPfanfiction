Preferably without Hermione, Draco and Snape as secondary characters, i'm ok with incest if it has some, also don't mind lemon/smut, but not required by any means. A requirement that has to exist is that they must love each other, not the kind of fic that either sibling hates or is a prick to the other. Thank you for any suggestions


** linkffn(Too Young to Die) fits perfectly. It is complete and Harry loves his sister (not incest) and Hermione, Draco and Snape are not at all important.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

***** ron/Her Nev/luna, but the story stops mid 4th year, so the romance aspect doesn't quite devolep yet, there's girl talk in some of the chapters, and there's talk about who likes whom, but the closest to actual dating there is, is Percy and Penelope (i think year 3) cuz Percy is really friendly with Emma. I'm sure Draco shows up a bit, but i honestly don't remember him much. Also, not everything goes like the canon, but it does follow it. Harry's first year is quite interesting, because its mostly from the POV of letters to Emma (she's like 10 months younger)

  Sophie Hatter, professional hat maker and part time wallflower, was perfectly content with her life until Great Magician Howl and his troublesome castle dragged her into the world of magic and wonder. 'A crazy life', she thought, but at least she found a most unexpected ally in her time of need. "Sophie, come greet your new neighbor," Lettie said. "I have one?" She asked.
