** Yeah they do.

Halloween predates the founding of America.

It's said to be from an old celtic holiday, Samhain. It's probably Scottish in origin. (Which is probably why JK Rowling used it as she's obsessed with Scotland irl. By used it I mean have a lot of events conspire around the 31st of October.)

Robert Burns actually has a poem named Halloween which he made in 1785, if you don't know who he is, he wrote, Auld Lang Syne.

*** This answer isn't wrong, but it's important to realise that the existence of Halloween is not the same thing as the form of celebration being the same. Halloween is much, much bigger in America. I don't think I had even heard of Halloween until I was 8-years-old.

**** Oh damn then, maybe it's because I'm from Scotland, I just assumed England was the same. Every single year we have Halloween here and it's very big. In fact my local town celebrates it on the last Friday before the 31st. (Instead of the 31st) lots of kids used to double dip for sweets on the friday, and then on the 31st they'd go to another town or a city to get extra sweets lol.

Of course adult parties are big also, booze and an excuse to dress up in fancy dress.

** We do celebrate it, but not nearly as much. I gather Halloween is a BIG thing in the US; my friend in Orlando gets excited every year for a bunch of themed haunted houses and sends me vids of tons of people walking about in costume and stuff. Seems to go on all October.

It's a lot smaller in England. Kids trick-or-treat, and there might be parties, but it's a much smaller holiday.

*** Orlando might be a bit special because we have universal studios so they have a major haunted house thing at the theme park with all the props from all of their movies.

And it was even smaller in the 90s.

**** Smaller, but not unknown. I can remember efforts to make it a thing as far back as the late 70s, when I was bang in the target market.

** Just for another perspective, which may or may not be similar to the UK, I'm from Australia.

I didn't hear about Halloween existing until year 7 and none of my friends ever did anything. When my younger sister was in year 7 six years later her friends went trick or treating that year and the next two but that was pretty much it.

At university, colleges will throw a party as will each faculty's student group.

As an adult living in the suburbs there's about 1 in 10 houses with some cheap decorations up, the supermarkets sell lollies 1/2 price and have a half of one side of an aisle dedicated to halloween. The people that give out lollies rarely dress up themselves, where I lived someone posts out flyers each year letting everyone know that trick or treating is from 6-7pm and to put up a small decoration on your mailbox if you're participating. Most of the trick or treaters were 10 or under accompanied by their parents and maybe 25% of the people were young teens in small groups who looked like dressing up and going to the houses was a chore that paid in lollies.

It definitely seemed like american movies and television was the only reason Halloween made any ground here but now the young kids are growing up with more and more american shows so they really want to go around. It's not seen as a particularly fun activity by teens and it's just a costume party, at a bar or someone's sharehouse, but with a horror theme for uni students and then it's just remembering to buy a couple cheap decorations and some lollies as an adult.

Not every suburb would have trick or treaters though, only the more family oriented ones. People living in most suburbs could easily never know it was halloween.

Back in the 1990s I'd never heard of halloween at all though (born in 1991).

** Here in the UK mostly it's just a couple of kids trick or treating (very few). Most people stay inside hoping that nobody knocks on their door.

** It depends on the era and the location.

My father grew up in the late sixties, early seventies and Guy Fawkes was a much bigger deal (Penny for the Guy, Bonfires, Fireworks, Parties). Halloween had some rumblings but really took off in the late 80's and early 90's, with our parties being some of the early ones in our area. In Northern Ireland (where my mother is from), street parties were more common than going trick or treating.

It's all going to depend on area too. While we do a massive Halloween thing at our house, our house is known for it as the Halloween house because no one else really does it to our degree. around 50/50 on trick or treaters, 60/40 around here because there's many elderly people and many people who just won't answer the door in general. Eggs and flour are restricted substances in many shops in the lead up, and become 18+ only. There are a lot more trick or treaters now, though. We used to do 40 'goodie bags' and have some leftover. Last year, we hit 140.

** We were in the U.K. around Halloween in 2016. Halloween seemed to be a very kids-oriented holiday. We saw a few kids costumes and the bags of candy were laughably small. The only place we saw window displays were Scotland. No giant Spirit stores, no 5-lb bags of candy, no risqu√© adult costumes. I have a friend whose favorite holiday is Halloween and she throws a huge party every year and you better come correct with your costume. One year I was a [[https://imgur.com/gallery/Dq3cK][Dia de los Muertos Boxtroll.]]
