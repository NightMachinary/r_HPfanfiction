I unfortunately can't remember the name of the story, but I remember reading a story where one of the background pairings was Seamus Finnigan/Daphne Greengrass; it was such an odd pairing, but was written rather well.

I also remember reading a pairing of Padma Patil/Anthony Goldstein. (I can't remember the name of that either; unfortunately). But I enjoyed it so much that I now have it as a pairing I use.

Are there any stories, where the pairing is random or rare, but was surprisingly good for you?

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** I tend to think any pairing (with some logistical or creepy exceptions unless that's your jam) can be done convincingly with the right author wanting to put the time into it and flesh it out so it feels convincing. I remember quite a good Remus/Davey one from back in the day that surprised me, but I knew the author was good from their other stuff.

** Linkffn(Stars Fall by Lady Altair) Stars Fall is an absolutely wonderful fic by Lady Altair which has Remus/Lavender as the pairing. The writing style is absolutely gorgeous and it's just perfect (in my opinion). I adore the characterization and how Lavender's character is treated. If you liked this one I would reccomend like all of Lady Altair's other fics. Some of my favorites with lavender are Linkffn(show me dragons by lady altair) and Linkffn(her first and her last by WhiskeyTangoFoxTrot).

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

  When Stiles was a little kid he always wondered about his father's tattoo. The way his father was, tattoos had never made sense for him. On the right side of his father's arm were the letters SPQR with a Caduceus symbol above it, and six bar lines under it. When Stiles gets hurt and the pack wasn't there to help, the Sheriff decides it's time Stiles learned about his tattoo...and about his own legacy as the grandson of Mercury.
