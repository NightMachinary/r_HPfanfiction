** He might also be sad that Lily Evan's son was abused. Those stories aren't /that/ unreasonable. But I digress. Maybe I'm biased because I enjoy the fluff those fics have.

As far as your request goes, there are several fics where Harry's abuse comes out and yet Snape doesn't turn sympathetic, but I've never read one that has that relationship in the limelight. Most stories just completely ignore Snape, or just straight up get him fired.

Its definitely writeable though. Snape has suffered through abuse himself, and is a cynical enough character that he'd see Harry getting rescued and being helped as some sort of mollycoddling. If done right by someone who can portray canon characterisation well, I think it'd be a fantastic read.

Anyways, your request is interesting, and I hope you find what you're looking for. Cheerio.

** i never understood why people like Snape. He was a spy? so what? he was still an asshole even when not needed. He was just a small minded little man that took pleasure in fucking with Potter over a dead man's sins.

  Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]

** In canon it was discovered that Dudley's gang bullied Harry and that he was chased by the dog of his aunt, Snape laughed or didn't care; he's still angry at James, so it was not because he didn't mind bullying in general. Judging by this it would be illogical if he cared about the abuse. Perhaps Snape's anger at James and Sirius was only because they tried to kill him and because of Lily, then it wouldn't be.
