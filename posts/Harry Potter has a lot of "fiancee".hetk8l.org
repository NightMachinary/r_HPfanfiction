I was thinking of along the lines of Ranma1/2 and less Harem. The type of interfering and meddling horde of fiancee his dead father gave him and is technically true so Harry tries to work through loopholes to get rid of them example: verbal promise doesn't count, imma bankrupt her family so she can't pay the bride price, I'll trick her to "marrying" malfoy
