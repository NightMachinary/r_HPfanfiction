Hi people!

Yesterday the app logged me out while I was reading. I am trying to log in back again (with google account) and it says that the app may not be secure. Anyone has any idea why? and/or how to fix this?


** I think you have to set it to allow third party apps in your google account. Had the same issue with another app as it claimed it might not be secure.

***** Thank you very much! The problem is still the same though. I enabled it but still nothing.

****** Only other thing you can try is to make sure the app is updated to the latest version.

*** There /is/ an app. But not one for fictionpress, which is weird.
