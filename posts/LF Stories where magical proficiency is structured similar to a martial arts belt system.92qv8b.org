Can you suggest any stories where magical skill is tiered similar to White > Blue > Purple > Brown > Black > Red belt (like in BJJ)? Where the difference between the Master and Student is so wide that inherited abilities of the student count for naught against the experience of a pro.

Usually what happens in stories I read is that Harry (or someone else) uses their Legilimency etc. to get the edge on his adversary. The combat is stale and predictable. And beyond that, Harry's "power" simply lets him stomp through other people who should wipe the floor with him.

At age 14, HP vs. Rowle should be like HP vs. a brick wall. HP should get /smoked/ 100% every time.

I want to read a story with competent enemies, tutors who display such mastery of magic that it brings to mind the phrase "Technology so advanced it is indistinguishable from magic." Except... in this case it's /magic/ so advanced it appears to be ... something other-worldly and insurmountable. I want the hero to fail a thousand times before they can overcome enemies, where the reader can /see/ the improvements in the character's skill with how they approach problems, identify patterns, and produce solutions. Often this is shown as "Harry's creativity" and that bores me. I want Harry's creativity, mixed with tons of study and practice.

Got any recommendations?

I'll be writing my own small fics toying with this idea.


** It's not tiered this way formally, with belts and levels and such, but the /Grey Maiden/ series by Chris Widger has chasms of ability separating wizards of different skill levels.

** Linkffn(The many Deaths of Harry Potter by ShayneT)

There is no system of magical proficiency as you wanted but Harry cannot stand up against trained Wizard's by power alone. He has to rely on his own creativity 'a lot'. Emphasise on a lot.
