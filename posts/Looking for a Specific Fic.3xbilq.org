I read a fic a while back where Harry was adopted by Sirius and Harry had the ability to control and call forth family magics, I would appreciate any help in finding this fic again


** Sounds like linkffn(8045114), a Marauder's Plan. Sirius stays to help out Harry towards the end of book three, and Harry can call upon Family magics.
