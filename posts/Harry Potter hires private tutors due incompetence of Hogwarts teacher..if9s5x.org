Is there any FanFiction where Harry Potter hires private tutors (which can be done due to some Hogwarts rules or education rules) due incompetence of Hogwarts teacher. Like private tutor for Potions or History of Magic or DADA. Love to read those. Oh and I found one fanfiction like that. Here is the link [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9963013/1/]] (He is not Dead yet by Redbayly)


** linkffn(Man of Iron, Child Of Magic) should have what you need. It's an Avengers crossover in which Stark adopts Harry after the aliens invade (the HP universe is shifted so this is the end of Harry's second year). Stark has just organised the tutors in the latest chapter, and is trying to generally make Harry's life suck less. Updates often.
