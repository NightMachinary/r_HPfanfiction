The Universe Is An Optimisation Problem by Eigenstation / imasentientantcolony (aka me)

Summary: Featuring a Cold War where both sides were helped by wizards, Hermione Granger as a sweet girl who just blows up buildings every now and then, Bill Weasley as a dimensional ritualist, Harry Potter as a mind-clone of Tom Riddle, a massively expanded magical universe, and three transnational megamonopolies figuring out how magic can be their competitive edge. (HPMOR-inspired, AU)

(not just au for the sake of it)

hope a few people enjoy reading!

still working out a regular posting schedule, sorry


** It's pretty good, but my god does it waffle on and on and on sometimes. I understand they're trying to give us a sense of the enormous scale, but it's endless at times and i'm only on chapter 2

*** you're right about that - i've taken out the first two bits in chapter 2 and i'll post them in a separate chapter later on. if you have the time, could you have a very quick skim and tell me if it flows any better?

there was a drop in waffling in ch.3 and i'm hoping to cut it down as much as possible over the next few chapters. i'm a fan of stories which just drop you right into the middle of the plot as it's taking place, but i have a feeling that if i did that with this fic, it would make absolutely no sense at all. later on, i'll do some reorganising of the first few chapters :)

** I really enjoyed this! Are we going to be following Ozland again in the next few chapters, or are we going to return to Hermione and Harry? Actually, since Ozland seems so important right now, why isn't he featured anywhere in the summary?

**** You haven't read the story at all have you? Ozland is not Harry, unless some weird parallel universe dimension shifting mind-fuckery just occured.

***** To be fair, I am kind of stoned. Character read sorta like harry in most AU's.
