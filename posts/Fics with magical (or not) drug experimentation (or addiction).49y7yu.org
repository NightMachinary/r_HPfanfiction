Things along the lines of:

- Wizards/witches try out Muggle drugs.
- Wizards/witches have their own drugs.
- Tragically, comically, clinically, whatever.

I've read a few where some characters were regular alcoholics and a couple where it was part of the whole Death-Eaters-have-semi-regular-orgies-and-raves kind of thing. I also read one where Dobby was a huge pothead, and in canon I guess Winky was somewhat of an alcoholic.

It just occurred to me that it would be amusing to have Hagrid snorting pixie dust off Maxime's asscrack or something. Though, to be fair, I think Hagrid would be into much, much harder stuff.

I'm basically looking for magical substance abuse.

It isn't really a huge plot point, but in the Firebird's trilogy, it is considered normal for anyone using divination at least semi-regularly to be an alcoholic.

** Coping Methods. linkffn(coping methods by chelseyb). Drug addiction and abuse are the focus of the story. I'm starting to feel like I rec this fic everytime I post...but it fits here perfectly.

Duality. linkffn(7145549). Cigarettes, I think, but not really relevant to the plot iirc. Been a while since I've checked in on that fic. The FFnet version is probably an edited/sanitized version, but potential NSFW content.

I can think of a few more where drugs are mentioned in passing but I think those are the only two where it's the focus or frequently referred to.

Oh, almost forgot. Stages of Hope. linkffn(6892925). Has substance abuse but not of a kind you expect--a magical substance too.

** Blood Magic by GatewayGirl (complete only on Schnoogle, only part is up on ffn) has a bit actually. It's a severitus fic, with a Snape that I quite like the characterization of (it's more book than movie Snape, in that he lashes out rather than being calmly nasty. He's got a beautifully morbid sense of humor too. It was written too early to get Snape's background quite right, but it's closer than most takes, and it's a rather fascinating one). Anyway, there are a few mind altering substances brewed, some by Snape, some by Harry, and a character is mentioned as being addicted to a particularly nasty potion. Some of the drug use is played for humor (and the dialogue is actually brilliant - better than I've seen in many published works), but it's also addressed more seriously. It is novel length, and the drugs are a bit of a running side theme/plot, not the main one. It's one of my favorite old fics.

**** Sorry about the wait. I forgot it is primarily a Marriage Law fic but deals with Hermione's addiction in it, so sorry if it's not your thing.
