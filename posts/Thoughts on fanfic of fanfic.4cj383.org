I've run across this a couple of times, though I don't have any example links.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9331540/11/The-Secret-Compartment][Here is one.]]

A lot of stories on SB/SV have omakes by other writers as well.

I think they're nice. If I'm unfamiliar with the original, it makes me interested in checking it out. As long as credit to the source material is given, it's flattering to the original writer as well.

  This is a what-if spin-off from the fanfic 'The Hidden Hero' by Evebb, answering the question: What would have happened if Dumbledore had believed and supported Mark (aka Harry) at the end of chapter 19? Mentor!Sensible!Dumbledore Enabled!Light!Harry. Giants, Dark Arts, Ministry takeover, Horcruxes, Undesirables, Harry masquerading as a muggleborn. No Deathly Hallows, MoD, or H/G

  Hermione is offered a war-stake by Dumbledore. She ignorantly accepts the beautiful scroll, only to find she has thereby agreed to become Wife to the House of Malfoy. An on-the-go education by Minerva, Molly, and Astoria ensues as Hermione enters formal courtship by Draco and Lucius. Utterly absurd and a tad naughty. AU, OOC

** Why not. I'm gonna be honest with you, I often thought about writing something about this amazing stories THESE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE DECENCY TO HAVE FINISHED

I think certain stories are popular and have a great element of worldbuilding. HPMOR (for all the flack it gets) it's a great example of this, at it did spawn quite a few "spin offs"

** Here's several that is fanfics/spin-offs of the first mentioned fanfic, I've taken the following from a comment to a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4678q9/lf_dimensional_travel/][request a few months ago.]]

#+begin_quote
  linkffn(Harry Potter & The Girl Who Lived by SilverAegis) isn't really that impressive or long, also abandoned. But it sparked a following of fanfictions to his fanfiction, severeal that will be on this list.

  linkffn(Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived by Agnostics Puppet) Is the complete spinoff of the previously mentioned original fanfiction. I think it's the only finished on this entire list...

  linkffn(Harry Potter & The New Life by smaster28) is another SilverAegis spinoff. Though the original it was based off was erased from SilverAegis's account. (I think he erased it willingly)

  linkffn(Harry Potter and the New Lives by Steve2) Is a worse ripoff of SilverAegis's erased story, though the first several chapers is 90% copy paste of the orginal, so if you want the original that Silver abandoned, just read this for a few chapters.

  linkffn(New Life and New Battles by krytos) is yet another SilverAegis spinoff, I can't really remember so much about it, they all tend to mix with each other at this point.

  linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wand of Uru by alienyouthct) was listed as a SilverAegis spinoff by [[/u/inimically]] but i haven't personally read it. But I'm assuming that it fits your criteria.

Crossover between Harry Potter and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with homebrew X-Men and Inhuman elements because studio politics suck.

** There are several. Some of the more popular stories that have a fanbase (e.g. Kurinoone's Dark Prince Trilogy, HPMoR) have stories that are inspired. The problem is, most of the popular stories on fanfiction are utter shit, and since the original is shit, the stories that are inspired by the shit are shitty as well.
