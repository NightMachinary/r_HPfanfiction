I am looking for good sorting au's, fics like On the Way to Greatness and Applied Cumtural Anthropology. I am open to all characters and pairing as long as it's well done.

Any reccomendations?


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/704082][The Switch Verse]] is probably right up your alley.

Fred and George get their hands on some Confunding Potion and decide to use it on the Sorting Hat.

Harry and Draco wind up as Hufflepuffs. Lucius is not happy.

Ron's in Ravenclaw.

Crabbe and Goyle are Gryffindors and decide to be Hannah Abbott's bodyguards, since they don't have Draco anymore.

Hermione is in Slytherin.

Enjoy!

  Chessmaster Volume I. AU. Harry discovers that cleverness is the best way to outwit Dudley and his gang, which leads to a very different Sorting. While Harry and his friends try to unravel Hogwarts' various mysteries, the political tension in the Wizengamot reaches new heights as each faction conspires to control the fate of Wizarding Britain. Sequel complete.

  Chessmaster Volume II. AU. Tensions continue to rise both inside and outside Hogwarts with the announcement of the International Scholastic Quidditch Tournament. As international influences begin to creep into British politics, Dumbledore isn't the only one worried for the future. Thomas Gaunt is concerned as well, but for very different reasons. Sequel now posted!
