Can we see some slash that isn't emo Harry my life sucks bullshit paired with the misunderstood Slytherins with cutting obsession.

because honestly all the slash I see for miles is all grimdark my life suck redeem the death eater bullshit and I want to see something that makes me gay rather than depressed (this is the part where i laugh like peter griffin at my double entendre and make myself look like a fool) because today is HAPPY.

remember folks: smile or DIE!


** I've found a couple.

Harry /young sirius: linkao3(cartographer's craft) and linkffn(turn by Sara's girl) were both pretty good.

  One good turn always deserves another. Apparently. Epilogue compliant/AU. HPDM slash but some canon het along the way. Please trust me - I promise the epilogue will not bite you.

**** Sara's Girl writes amazing stuff. I am especially fond of This Summer linka03(969751). It's delightfully lighthearted featuring costume parties and a pub quiz night. Also the people in the story have largely gotten over school rivalries and even being on different sides of the "war".

** I've found most fics set after the war (tagged as hp:ewe on ao3 usually) are the best for this. usually lighthearted, they also deal with ptsd issues from the war, stuff like that. time travel further back than canon rehash is also good or complete au's. I'm often weary of slytherine!harry fics but i try to keep an open mind and judge purely on writing and story quality. If you have more specific pairings you like or particular tropes you like/don't like could make it easier.

There are plenty of good slash if you know how to look. If you treat fics with gay pairings the way you would treat any other fic; ie. if the fic is well written, good characterisation, etc. and dont just think about what the pairing /is/ to determine its worth, then that makes it a whole lot easier. There are just as many awful het and gen hp fanfics as there are slash. I saw a thread on this topic a while ago. the majority of fanfictiion is bad and the >5% that's good is good, regardless of whether it has het, homo or no pairings. and from there it's all down to personal preference.

** linkffn(To the Waters and the Wild) Though it is pretty light on the gay. It should make /you/ plenty gay though. Also read other stuff by this author.

linkffn(Fill Circle by tetsurashian) Crack

linkffn(The Elements of Being a Lord by Rendered Reversed) More crack. Also read her other stuff. She's got a lot of very different AUs, a lot of which are pretty cracky. If you've ever wanted Harry Potter and Tom Riddle as magical girls, for example, she's got you.

linkffn(And Now For Something Completely Different by Silvia Kundera) Still crack.

linkao3(811963) If you're ever in the mood to read an essay on Harry/Draco. There is discussion of penis size in this. It's utterly amazing and anyone who reads Harry/Draco on a regular basis will feel the truth of this survey in their soul.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/811963][*/Ever so slightly longer but not quite as thick: Toward a quantitative literary sexology of Harry Potter fanfiction/*]] by [[http://www.archiveofourown.org/users/blythely/pseuds/blythely/users/Circe_Tigana/pseuds/Circe_Tigana][/blythelyCirce_Tigana/]]

#+begin_quote
  Discussion regarding fanfiction tropes produced the observation that in one subset of Harry Potter fanfiction, "Harry/Draco slash" [HDS], Harry has a short, thick dick, while Draco's penis is long and thin. We tested the hypothesis that there was a consistent difference in how these two characters' genitalia were described. Additionally, we tested the hypothesis that slash fiction authors in this subset of fandom did not place equal emphasis on the description of testicles as compared with penii. We surveyed 100 HDS stories in online fanfiction archives and collected data on sexual description and content. Here we present the first quantitative test of fanon stereotypes and show that these explicitly sexual stories contain low levels of visual/sensory genital descriptions. Qualitative comparisons demonstrate trends in support of both hypotheses, although sample sizes prevent statistical significance. We use these findings to discuss how fanon may develop despite the incorrect assumption of perceived ubiquity.
