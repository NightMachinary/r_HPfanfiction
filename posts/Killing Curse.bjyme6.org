Why do people think the killing curse obliterates souls or some such nonsense. If it did, then Voldemort would not have survived the rebound, because the horcruxes couldn't keep him alive if the main portion of his soul was obliterated. Also, why was his body destroyed by the reflected ak? Who knows, but the killing curse doesn't make sense to obliterate souls, only kill, hence not being named the 'soul obliterating curse'.


** I've never seen the Killing Curse depicted as "obliterating the soul"; there is a long-standing, functionally unresolvable fandom argument on whether it makes the body dead and the soul is ripped out as a result, or if it rips the soul out of the body and the body dies as a result.

As for why the reflected Curse blew up the Potter Cottage and Lord Voldemort's body with it... that's an entirely different question, with a lot of potential answer. It could just be magical backlash from the unblockable curse being blocked; it could also be what happens when you hit an immortal person with a Killing Curse, considering that we know the Curse causes explosions when it hits already inanimate matter.

Personally, I've always seen it as part and parcel with Quirrell's defeat in /PoS/ --- when the Killing Curse rebounded off Harry's Love Protection, it didn't /just/ rebound, but become infused with said Love Protection, and /that/ hit Voldemort at full blast, frying him to a crisp (and blowing up the roof as collateral).

If that were the case the killing curse would be functionally the same as the Dementor's Kiss, except we know that people subjected to the kiss remain alive afterwards. A soul isn't necessary for a body to remain alive.

**** A common point for the "it makes the body dead" side, of course. The counterargument to that is that mark that I said "rip" --- the difference between the Kiss and the Curse would be akin to surgically removing someone's left kidney versus violently ripping it out of them with your bare hands. One is fatal, the other is not.

***** Also, if it simply made the body dead then, depending on how exacly it did that, then somone could conceivably recover. If, for example, it stopped the blood flow, the heart and knocked someone out at the same time then can't a timed defibrillator like spell save him?

Unless the AK does something extreme (like severing all brain connections) then it could be recoverable. After all, we see no signs of obvious external or internal damage to the body.

****** Well, the idea behind the "it makes you dead" is part of the Taure-style, symbolic theory of magic. The idea being that it /doesn't/ do anything medically recognizable; it just abstractly removes the "alive" quality from a person without any other changes.

******* Its canon that the Killing Curse doesn't do anything that is medically recognizable. Its explicitly mentioned that the Riddles who were killed by the killing curse had no apparent cause of death.

#+begin_quote
  Then, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on the Riddles' bodies came back and changed everything.

  The police had never read an odder report. A team of doctors had examined the bodies, and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, stran- gled, suffocated or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all. In fact, the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilder- ment, t*he Riddles all appeared to be in perfect health -- apart from the fact that they were all dead*. The doctors did note (as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face -- but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being frightened to death?

  As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go.

******** Indeed, though to play Devil's advocate, something that fried neurons wouldn't really be recognizable to 1940's country British police; if there were no external signs of injury or of a heart attack, that would very probably get written down as "/the Riddles all appeared to be in perfect health -- apart from the fact that they were all dead/".

Besides which, even if the bodies really were wholly unharmed, that can just as easily be explained by the "soul ripped out" approach as by the "symbolic magic" approach.

Usually yes, but their bodies were examined by a team of doctors, I doubt that they wouldnt have noticed at least anything if it medical.

/1940's/ Doctors. What if, for example, the Curse severed connections between all individual neurons, on a microscopic scale? Would 1940's coroners /really/ be able to detect that?

See an earlier reply I made to precisely this point about the difference between having, say, your left kidney /violently ripped out of you/ and having it surgically removed. The idea would be that the magical shock kills you.

**** This is true. It's a bit of an unusual position, though; it's usually felt that however it works, the Killing Curse should be more inherently magical than that. (/HPMoR/ also has something similar, of course, but /it/ has an even more completely different magic-system from canon than the /Arithmancerverse/ does.)

**** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12562072/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Daft-Morons][Harry Potter and the Daft Morons]], the Killing Curse is comparable to an overpowered Memory Charm, making the victim forget everything, including body memory like how to breath or how to make your hear beat, killing the victim in the process.

​

I don't really like the fic for several reasons, including what they did of this explication but I still found it pretty interesting.

*** I'd argue that it rips the soul out by making the body dead, not the other way around- victims of the dementor's kiss can canonically live without their soul as an empty husk, and brain dead isn't the same as bodily dead.

** I just like to think it stops the heart, and the magical world just equates no heartbeat with dead. If only you could restart it within a few minutes, but that's necromancy, and super illegal.

As for Voldie getting his body snuffed, that's his rejection of his magical oath. He recognized that Snape had really helped him but providing him with the prophecy, then agreed that in exchange he'd spare Lily. That mutual agreement created a magical binding, that was then altered when Lily said “Not Harry, Take me instead”, and Voldie said “Very Well”. Then he went back on his word when he tried to kill Harry, and magic ‘killed' him instead...

Or it would have, if he didn't have Crux's.

** I agree with you but putting myself in their shoes...The act of reflecting the spell could in some way alter it- whose to say but the author and honestly I don't care what's not written in the books- that and that alone is gospel to me.

Also they may have read AU fics that depict the killing curse killing souls and just assumed it was right.

Yep, that's a mystery, never says in the books as far as I know. I'm surprised no one's done a fanfic where Severus or Albus destroy the body as completely as they can because dark lord's that use magic zombies might be able to do more along those lines.

*** It probably wasn't just a reflected killing curse. That was the official explanation Dumbledore gave so that Lily's protection would stay secret and people wouldn't know to search for her relatives to find Harry. What really happened was that Lily's protection kicked in and burned Voldemort to a crisp, just like Quirrel over ten years later.
