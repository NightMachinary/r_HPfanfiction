  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality

It's almost (almost!) more of an advertisement for critical thinking than it is a HP fanfic. I read it many years ago, before it was finished, and never did finish reading it - in my opinion the quality tapers off. In it, Harry is raised as a scientist and applies the scientific method to magic. It even has its own subreddit.

** What do you mean by smart Harry. Just how smart are we talking? Do you mean so bright he never struggles and blasts through school and out thinks his enemy before the battle begins

Or

Smart in that he does his work and doesn't slac around all the time getting decent grades but still occasional struggling with one subject or in war with his opponents even if he can think through the tactical bits well?
