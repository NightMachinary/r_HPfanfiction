I have "A Marauder's Plan" and "Angry Harry and the Seven" bookmarked right now, but due to their incredible length, I've been rather hesitant to start reading. Did you guys like these two fics?


** Angry Harry and the Seven - is a shit story unless you want to read tons of cliches.

** A Marauder's Plan is objectively cliche but enjoyable overall. If I rated aspects of the story... Here's my overall review that I put too much effort in.

Writing 8/10 Dialogue 7/10 Plot 5.5/10 Action scenes 9/10 Magical theory concepts 8/10 Pacing 6/10 (900k words to detail the entire 4th year and then some)

Yes, it's packed with tropes.

Super!Harry: Funny thing is he never really gets to use his power. It's said he's near the level of Dumbledore's power but the majority of action in this story doesn't involve him.

Lordships: I let this slide because the political drama/events subplot is pretty good.

Multiple Animagus forms for Harry: Stupid, and ultimately irrelevant to the story. His forms are a Raven and a Lion. The Raven is featured maybe every other chapter but the Lion gets forgotten.

Romance: Surprisingly, there is no issue here. Harry and Hermione act like they should: 14 year olds without a clue. Remus and Tonks is a nice subplot,

Final verdict: It's a fun story, honestly not meant to be taken super seriously.

** I haven't read A Marauder's Plan, but Angry Harry is a good one, if a bit cliche.

And if you want incredible length, then Prince of the Dark Kingdom is for you in its entire 1,257,000 word glory.

** I read the first few chapters of Angry Harry and the Seven and it was too painful to continue. I had seen it promoted a few times on this subreddit and so I tried reading it. Just do yourself a favor and never read it.

Marauders plan is great, I love the Sirius and Harry father/son relationship. The romance is done well. Politics is also done well. There is this family magic that is waaay too OP. Honestly this would be one of the best stories there is if the pacing was better and they got rid of the OP family magic bullshit. Even then though it is great.

** A Marauders Plan would is be a decent fic if it were about 1/4 its current length.

** For me, very few fics are well-developed if they aren't long. I typically give a story several chapters to gauge its quality before abandoning or finishing it.
