*** Honestly, I can see Vernon as a "Godfather" type and the next time Malfoy (or whoever caused the offence) leave the Leaky Cauldron, they will have an unfortunate car accident.

** These kinds of questions are impossible to answer.

What you're doing is changing a fundamental core part of characterization. There's nothing to predict after that. The story can go as you want it to be.

"What if?" plots are fun when they're based on chance, change in mytholology, difference in power system.

** Wouldn't have been quite so against malfoy for one. I also think he would've been a lot more like his father than he was in cannon, and perhaps not as angry as he was in order of the phoenix when he saw snapes memory. But I do think that yes, he would have gotten better over time.
