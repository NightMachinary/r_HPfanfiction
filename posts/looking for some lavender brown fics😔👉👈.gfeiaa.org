** Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19949440/chapters/47238583]]) is a great fiction focusing on divination and strange murders in 1947 and also showing that minor actions can totally change the future (butterfly effect).

Smut is not so present but heh if you ever wanted to read a fiction where a female character describes Tom Riddle as "passable" it's the one xD.

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

  The Ink Drop was the best-kept secret in the nightclubs of Wizarding London. Werewolves, or those close enough, could work out their sexual appetites on willing submissives looking for a rough ride, and nobody had to get hurt. The system generally worked best when the werewolves stayed clear of each other, but someone forgot to tell the new girl about that.36,000 words. NC-17 and then some -- for sex, violence and the foul language of werewolf subcultures. Bill/Lavender. Past Remus/Bill. Quite a bit of Fleur. Several werewolf OCs. July 2008.
