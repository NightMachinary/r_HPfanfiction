searching for a fic

hey, i'm currently in love with sirius x hermione after reading debt of time, does anybody have any more of this type, preferable not including time travel but that's fine if it's done well!


** I don't think I have any without time travel, so here is one Linkffn(the last peverell)

  Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right? (FemHarry)
