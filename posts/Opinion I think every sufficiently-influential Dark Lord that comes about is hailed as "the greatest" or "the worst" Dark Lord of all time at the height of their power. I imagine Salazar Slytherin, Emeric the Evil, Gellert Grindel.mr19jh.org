I think the idea has credence, because we can sort of see it implied that Grindelwald was greater than Voldemort when he was in power.

He resists him when Voldemort - the supposed greatest Legilimens of all time - tries to take info from his mind. And that after half a century in prison too.

He also went toe-to-toe with Dumbledore when both were at the height of their power for three whole hours.

And yet Voldemort is then hailed as "The Greatest Dark Lord of All Time." I think that fact is true simply because people have forgotten the horrors of Grindelwald and the power he wielded. I imagine they called Grindelwald the greatest once too.

That's why I think when in another half century another Dark Lord comes along, he too will be hailed as the worst and the greatest. The cycle will continue.

What are your thoughts on this?


** IIRC, "Dark Lords" are actually fanon.

Voldemort being called "the Dark Lord" was actually from his followers or sympathizers showing respect/fear, going by canon writing (IIRC): others just called him a dark wizard.

Same deal with Grindelwald, unless I missed something from the Fantastic Beast movies: guy was literally Hitler's wizard counterpart, but he was just a "dark wizard".

But yeah.

I daresay if Harry ever went batshit insane and dark after graduating Hogwarts and going into adulthood, and if he had a reign of terror like his predecessors, they'd likely call him the worse dark wizard in recent history in the future.

It's the same sort of deal with the World Wars: the First was called the "War to End All Wars" because, at that time, the scope of death, destruction, and technological advancement were unprecedented.

And then, a few decades later, we had WW2, which was actually far more destructive, killed countless millions through either combat, genocide, starvation/disease, and, of course, the two nuclear bombs which /could have set the entire fucking atmosphere on fire/ (this was a genuine fear from those working on the Manhattan Project).

**** Why would Lord Voldemort, someone who fucking hates muggles, hates the idea of muggles, hates thinking about muggles, and hates looking at muggles take something that fucking symbolic from his father? Why would he willingly inherit a filthy muggle title from his filthy muggle father? He hated him and them so much he distanced himself from his own fucking name. It's just completely goddamn asinine.

******** Oh no, I'm not forgetting the the moves by the Nazis to exterminate Slavs, Eastern Europeans, and anyone else they found 'undesirable'. Looking at the numbers, LGB people and the mentally ill were actually under a million in total across WW2. They killed far more Jews and the Slavs in Ukraine -- I'm actually surprised that the numbers are higher in Ukraine -- 11.7 million, excluding Jews. Maybe the Germans did kill more people, statistic-wise, than Stalin did, unless I'm missing something.

Edit: eh, I don't give a shit what Tankies think, to be honest. If they want to defend Stalin, a monster that was like Hitler, then that's on them.

****** Part of the reason it's hard to know exactly what Stalin did is because he won his war. And therefore was in a position to rewrite history to make his worst crimes gone from public knowledge. His crimes happened before the advent of Spies and information gathering came around. The CIA was born because of the cold war. which was a while after WW2. and for all intents this was when it was rather for a government to easy to cover crimes up. And due to Nazi Germany no one was really paying attention to what Stalin was up to.

  Bellatrix Lestrange uses dark, sacrificial magic to bring the Dark Lord back to life after Harry Potter has given his life to defeat him. However, asking for a "Dark Lord" turns out to be a tad bit too ambiguous. Baba Yaga is having fun, Godelot is a sadistic bastard, Herpo the Foul brags about his horcrux, Tom Riddle is unimpressed.
