  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** There don't seem to be very many of these, and from what little I've looked at it seems like it's common for the DnD character or characters to be fully aware that they're DnD characters. As in they refer to DnD mechanics as if they're actual things, like "Oh, I just got 1000xp, that's enough to level up!" Which is fine for a parody or crack fic but not easy to take seriously. Anyway, the best I can do is link this community: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Dungeons-and-Dragons-Crossovers/224/1116/]]

** This is the obvious one, isn't it? It's the only one I know.
