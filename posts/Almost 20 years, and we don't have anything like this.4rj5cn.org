** [[/r/narutofanfiction]] has a list on the side bar that you can add to or access. It's got who recommended it, the summary, whether or not it's completed and when it was last updated, how many words, and finally, a link to the story or its author. It would be cool if we could incorporate that into this subreddit. I'd love a nice long list in one place instead of multiple different rec lists on multiple different websites. We could probably sort them based off of the genre (time travel, non-BWL, magical creature!Harry, etc).

*** It's a good list, but not that many people contribute, and I don't think it would scale well. I've contributed some stories to it, and seconded recommendations of others, but it would take a lot of maintenance. At the moment, it's more of a 'start here' list. It's also useful for pointing people to when they ask for a list of good recs.

It's definitely useful to have, and a similar thing on this subreddit would be good, but I think there's some problems that haven't become apparent on [[/r/narutofanfiction]]'s list that would immediately crop up here.

For example, would HPMOR be on the list? A lot of people like it, including some people on this subreddit, but in general people don't. And what about robst/Perfect Lionheart? Stuff considered generally bad but still popular? The naruto subreddit is small enough that I could list the ten or so main contributors, and we all get along fairly well, whereas this sub is too big.

Don't take this as an argument against it, consider it as some starting points for improving on it. A list like that is a good idea, but could be expanded or changed to fit this sub better.

**** These are some really good points. If we were to make a list, we would have to be sure we keep adding to it and that we do a good job explaining what kind of story it is. Maybe there could be some form of a "recommended by people who love HPMOR" tag alongside the everything else, but that might be a little too clunky. I'm thinking we would almost need a tumblr blog or something where you can make a huge rec list and explain who would like each story and stuff. Would be a lot of work, but I think that's along the lines of what OP is looking to make.

** It'd be useful to have a resource that one could sort according to a wide variety of preferences, unlike FFN's godawful search function that is pitifully limited in its search terms. AO3 tries, but has only a fraction of the fics that are on FFN, and unfortunately tends to fall prey to tagging issues with enormous drabble collections spewing character tags across the page like drunken lechers. Your rec archive seems to avoid this issue largely by being focused on a single pairing, but if one were to size up to the entire Potter fandom, the tag list will become utterly monstrous and bizantine in its meaning. This needs to be accounted for, if possible, by either culling exotic tags or using some very 'plain meaning' tags for common concepts, otherwise it's going to be a giant list of euphemisms that probably meant something to someone once.

** I would love a source like that. I really love Dean fics, but I honestly don't think I've ever been able to find one that fits all my criteria (aka, not that interested in romances, slash or otherwise, but when I remove "romance" from the criteria, it's still only Dean/Seamus fics - but I'd said no romance!! It seems romance is such a standard in fanfics that they don't need to be specified or something?

*** Well some stories are just more adventure, mystery, or what ever it is than romance. You also have to remember that there is something like 711k harry potter fics just on fanfiction.net, so its unlikely that a large majority of them have marked their fic correctly.

*** A lot of authors follow Hollywood's example and add a romance sideplot because they think it makes their story look more legitimate. It's a real shame, because stories without pairings are much better than stories with a poorly-done pairing shoehorned in.

** You are totally right that it is lame that we don't have something like that for HP. My guess is that the divisiveness of the different ships since the very beginning made everything really decentralized. I think Ao3 has really good searchability, but it is up to authors to properly tag their work and some barely tag at all. Also there is no one "curating" it for good writing (at a minimum spelling and readable grammar/formatting). And I know a lot of people are FFN loyalists, but imo it is almost unusable to find fics I want to read. Anything I read that is hosted on FFN is because it was recommended somewhere else and linked.

I would definitely help with making a site similar to the twilight one, but I think it is a huge undertaking! But still, I would be happy to help out however needed.

** I think the benefit of something like this is that it would be fandom-specific (tags, themes, etc). But the key is to offer something that the other sites simply can't give, which may just be the ability to really drill down into the tags to get (or at least request) what a person really wants. I think you could also include a small and well-regulated request/commission function - one that can help potential writers gauge what people are interested in seeing. For example, I have a huge project I want to undertake but I keep putting it off because I don't sense much enthusiasm for the topic.\\
My question is how do you determine what is guaranteed "well-written" and who makes those determinations?

** Well, there's sites for specific kinds of HP-FanFiction, still a better organized and searchable ressource would be great!

ps: What's the appeal of "all-human" Twilight stuff? I don't get it! I would have NEVER read Twilight if it wasn't about Vampires (and I only finished it because I needed to - for school (I did a report/presentation comparing Bram Stocker's Dracula with contemporary vampire-literature (and used Twilight as one example...did a comparison of the Count and Edward for example)) - otherwise I probably would have done what I did with the last HP-Book: Put the books in a dark corner and sticking to fanfiction (love the Twilight universe, but I HATE certain characters...Edward comes to mind and original Bella))

So again: What makes this a thing? It takes away everything that makes the setting good IMHO! (Turns it from a mystery/fantasy story into a damned sitcom -.-)

** Just seems like a curated list of fics that people like. We literally have multiple threads of those, and in the comments, the remaining thousands of fics that people on this sub have recommended.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3f97u2/the_most_popular_fanfics_of_all_time_in/]]

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3hsfw0/general_recommendations_thread/]]

As for well-written stories with either specific pairings or themes such as "All-Human," there are still specialty sites out there that people can traverse to their heart's content, or, just find a community on FFN.net.

**** There are quite literally communities on FFNet dedicated to curating a list of fics that are post-DH, time travel, and any other generalization I can think of. If there isn't a community for it, I would just assume there's a minuscule amount of fics available in that niche.
