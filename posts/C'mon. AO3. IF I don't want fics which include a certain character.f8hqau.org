What makes you think I want to read fics with them in a relationship?

I don't want to read about Draco Malfoy, so I have to exclude him, Harry Potter/DM, Hermione Granger/DM, Ginny Weasley/DM etc etc etc etc. even Draco Malfoy/Lucius Malfoy for pity's sake.

I can't find a suggestion box for AO3 either.


** The real problem is the people who think tagging relationships is good enough, and that they don't also have to tag characters. That's not the way it works.

And this "over-tagging" paranoia people like to spread around. Personally, I would much rather people over-tag than under-tag.

**** The one case where it can be an issue is where someone plans to write some huge, sweeping epic and tags all the characters/relationships right away, and the fic is abandoned after 4 chapters with 90% of those characters/relationships never appear in the story. If you're looking for a specific character or rare pairing, it can be frustrating to go through all 15 chapters of a story only to find the author got ahead of themselves when tagging.

**** There is a downside with 'too many' tags - and that's in not exactly making it clear which is important. That is to say, if I'm looking at the descriptions and the tags, it'd be nice to know which are major ones in the story - and which might have basically no presence there.

Eg, tagging something with a relationship that pops up a single time in chapter 4 and never gets mentioned again - while technically true - is also mostly irrelevant.

*** No, that's solving the problem at the wrong place.

If a character is part of a pairing of the story, they obviously are also a part of the story.

Consequently a search for a character should include/exclude it properly. Everything else makes it needlessly complicated for the user (both author and reader).

**** Not necessarily. I can write a fic where character A is in a relationship with B, but B never actually appears in person. I don't think that's even particularly uncommon in shorter fics.

Regardless, that kind of a setup would probably take some serious restructuring of the way relationship tags work on AO3, and I don't see them being able to implement it anytime soon, even if they wanted to. And tagging your fic based on how you /wish/ tags work, rather than how they /actually/ work is a losing proposition.

***** I mean, yeah. It's not the only or even worst place in terms of AO3 usability.

Just a random example: if you click on Search -> Works, at least on mobile it's easier to search /for/ rape or underage than to exclude it. Which is not how content warnings work.

[[https://imgur.com/rqHccVt.jpg][Clicking "Rape" in the Warnings section searches for fics containing it, uit doesn't avoid it]]

I'm not saying that this shouldn't be a feature, because there are probably users of that features. But making it easier to search for it than to exclude it a yikes from me -- makes the place more hostile to people affected by this.

I have so many more examples of why AO3s most important upgrade to the site should be an usability rework.

Just for fun, here is a more minor nitpick. Search for "Excluding Crossovers" but two fandoms in the search. I have no clue how how the results are generated, [[https://imgur.com/qpA7UhB.jpg][but it's rather confusing]]

Instead AO3 just should limit the input to one fandom in that case, or search for "either fandom A or fandom B" if "exclude crossovers" is on.

Anyway, I could go on all day with major and minor nitpicks. It's still a great site, don't get me wrong - but there's loads of room from improvement.

*** I'd much rather have overtag, because it's more likely it'll show up when I search random tags for fics. But I have to say, I do hate when it's so much I've got to scroll and scroll to get past them all. For series fics, or fics that they have several fandoms in one, and each chapter is different, I can understand it. But one fic, one fandom, shouldn't be so annoyingly overwhelming of tags. It makes me want to skip the fic if it's SOOOOO much.

** That's why i use the filters to remove all the unwanted relationships. I go as far as removing 30 relationship tags so as to not have a problem later. Honestly just remove the pairings and not the characters. Even if you really really don't like a character you might just stumble upon a story you might dig (which you might have missed because it happened to have that character listed).

You can also use additional tags or the category to remove M/M if you want. Some fic might still get through, but you have to deal with it.

Honestly it doesn't take more than two minutes to do all of that.

***** For some reason it works if you type his name in the exclusion box in lowercase, i.e. "draco malfoy". That will remove any fic that mentions his name in tags, pairings, fic summary, etc. However, using lowercase words in your exclusion filter is often unreliable. That method tends to mistakenly remove quite a few fics that would have been ok for your preferences.

Is this really something that bothers you all overmuch? Just seeing a fic summary of a fic with one of those relationships you don't like? Like, isn't just scrolling past them simpler and less time consuming? You don't have to read a fic just because you see a summary of it, no?

*** Personally speaking, it's not a matter of individual fics so much as it is a matter of volume.

If you exclude Draco Malfoy because you want to read absolutely nothing with Draco Malfoy in and then a third of the fics on your first page still contain Draco Malfoy/Someone ship tags it's more /frustrating/ than anything else.

Sure you can just ignore them but if you're ignoring a huge chunk of the fics then it's not exactly a mystery as to why you might want to filter the lot of them out with as few tags as possible.

For example, I would /love/ the ability to filter out entire categories when looking through a tag because I am never going to want to read RPF so if I could get rid of that entire category rather than the specific fandoms therein then I would be a very happy bunny. Sure I /can/ get rid of them with the fandom tags, but it's annoying to have to do so.

**** Ah, okay. That makes sense. Thank you for your answer. It sounds like it's not so much about Malfoy specifically as it is about the site not really doing what you're asking it to do. Like the fact that two of the highest pairings when looking for F/M fics are M/M pairings (Sirius/Remus and Draco/Harry). Malfoy is just a particularly annoying/prevalent example. Right?

I think it seems like we search differently too. I tend to go looking for a specific thing, so I tend to end up with far fewer unrelated things - eg. "I want to read a Harry-Hermione fic today" so I filter to get only that, which means my not-that-pairing fics number tends to be quite low. Like, if I click F/M, then Hermione/Harry, I only get 130-ish of the 2800-ish fics having that pairing.

*** No but since I don't want to read Draco or indeed Snape relationship stories, I sometimes have to scroll past pages of stuff to find anything to read at all.

And if I find something, finish it and go back to look for more, I have to set all my preferences again. It's a waste of time and makes using AO3 a lot less enjoyable.

Maybe if it was a less prevalent tag, it wouldn't matter but the little shit is unaccountably popular and stories that feature him make up a ridiculous proportion of everything on the site, and are correspondingly difficult to avoid.

**** Ah, okay. So it really is a sheer volume of inaccuracy issue (ie. You're getting lots of stuff that isn't what you want). That is a big thing on Ao3. I was noting to someone else in this thread that two of the highest pairings when looking for F/M fics are M/M pairings (Sirius/Remus and Draco/Harry).

Oh, and before I forget, the 'suggestion box' for Ao3 is [[https://archiveofourown.org/support]] and their twitter handles. There's also more advanced search options with a tutorial here ([[https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/10851]]) that may help.

EDIT: I found the 'support' link in the contacting the staff FAQ here ([[https://archiveofourown.org/faq/contacting-the-staff?language_id=en#sendfeedback]]) and it said feedback was acceptable there, even if the page itself doesn't seem to.

I don't know if the suggestion box will be useful though. It seems like it's the nature of the system they use - it seems to be meant for searching really specific things with wide exclusions and not just searching widely with specific exclusions. Like it's supposed to get you as many options as possible, directly related or indirect. Worth a try though, maybe they'll know a way around that we don't (and if they do, please post it!).
