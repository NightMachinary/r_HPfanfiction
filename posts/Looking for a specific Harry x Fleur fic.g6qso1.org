*** It wasn't either of these but thank you. Gabby didn't really play any part in it other than that she existed really and it's a one maybe 2 shot fic so it's not anything super lengthy.

** I think I've read that story, is it where the Delacours took Harry in? It's somewhere in my fave list. A bit of harem as well if I can remember.

**** Oh wow, this is aa entirely different fic from what I was talking about, but I'll read it though. The one I was referring to is where the Delacours took Harry away from the Dursleys and the harem where girls his age; Daphne, Hermione and a few others.
