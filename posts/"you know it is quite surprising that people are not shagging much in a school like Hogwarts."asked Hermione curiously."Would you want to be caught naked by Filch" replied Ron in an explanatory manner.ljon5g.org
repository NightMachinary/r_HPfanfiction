People tend to forget that Hogwarts is a coed boarding school which are usually strict about such things, and usually those schools tend to expel students caught in the act


** The threat of expulsion is massively overstated in Hogwarts IMO. It is as far as we know the only magical school in Britain - schools in the UK are already very reluctant to expel students because of the hugely negative impact on their lives - how much worse would it be if you couldn't go elsewhere?

Add that to the fact that no one was expelled during Harry's time at Hogwarts (even the Weasleys) and the fact that all threats of expulsion levelled at Harry were clearly toothless.

***** Kids are the same regardless of socio economic background. But public schools also have a lack of suitable adult supervision I don't see in statw schools. Some hp fanfics criticize the realisticness of such a small number of teachers but it was pretty representative of my experience. The only thing we had that Hogwarts didn't was a person (not a teacher) who slept in a private room in the dorms in case of emergency. Her main role in my experience was handing out sanitary products to teen girls on their first period and fire safety. I didn't live in the dorms long it was also a day school and my family moved closer and I stopped baording but even day pupils could be on site until about 8 or 9 at night sometimes.

** I went to a UK boarding school. This is rubbish, there was a LOT of shagging going on among the older years. And more than a few incidents involving younger years too. The sports hall was the most popular venue, there were changing rooms and toilets you could lock and it was rarely supervised as it was at the other end of the school to the staff room (it was a big track of land with multiple fields). Or we would go to the woods, there was a 2 mile walk from the school to the town and it took us through woods and down by a river. We also used to go skinny dipping in summer. Boarding schools are no where near as well supervised as you would expect. I got caught skinny dipping with about 6 others, we were given detention, that's it. They did threaten to tell our parents but if they did my parents didn't tell me off so I think they didn't bother.

Another girl in my year got caught giving a guy the year below a blow job, they both got detention but that was it. This was a good school too, did well in league tables but outside of school hours there was almost no supervision. You had to be pretty stupid to get caught given how predictable where the teachers would be was (and yes I know I said I got caught but I stand by that we got arrogant).

Edit: I asked my mum if the school ever reported me for the skinny dipping incident. She said no. I'm now wondering if I can get in trouble for something I did nearly ten years ago.

** I'm always a little surprised that more writers who write shagging or other sex-related stuff don't get more creative with sex magic. I mean, a school full of adolescent wizards - wouldn't the first thing on most of their minds be searching for illicit spells somehow relating to sex? And given the nature of people, wouldn't the wizarding world have a enormous catalog of sex spells, which adolescents would try to find and experiment with if they could, even if just on themselves if possible, or just in the normal teenage exploration of what seems exciting and illicit? Even adult sex is always so boringly...muggle...in most HP fanfic, when you'd think that magic would have allowed for all sorts of creativity when it comes to sex, beyond silencing and locking spells.

There's a story by Queenie_Mab - I don't really remember it, and don't think I really liked it much, but two things I do remember are that the Weasley twins had an underground side business in wizarding sex toys, and they used eighth year students as their beta testers (if I remember right). And that Harry used some everyday charm, I can't remember what, to automate an everyday item into some kind of masturbatory tool, which I thought was the kind of enterprising magical creativity one would expect of a teenaged wizard!

**** It's a long time since I've read the books so I'm not sure if it's canon or just really prominent in fanfic, but a few of the students who were in 7th year with Harry etc went back and did an 8th year since their last one was so full of disaster and whatnot.

***** Yes. There's a whole category of Eighth Year fics - the concept is that the 7th year students whose schooling was interrupted by the war, who didn't get to take NEWTS, who basically didn't learn anything because of the terror regime of the DEs running the school or who had to leave or flee (or weren't there at all eg Harry, Ron, Hermione), are invited back to repeat their 7th year, and this is referred to as "Eighth Year." You can search for the tag in AO3. It's not canon! But having the students of different houses and sometimes different sides all in one place again allows for some very interesting stories, with exploration of issues of healing, recovery, how to move on (or not), forgiveness, how to avoid perpetuating the issues that led to the war, PTSD, etc.

** Multiple things have lead me to my understanding that it is afar different than muggle culture in England. The following fic may help you understand.

°•○○•°

Harry had gotten back to the burrow and finally had to ask a question that had been bothering him something fierce.

In fact it had been weighing on him since he first noticed it. So much so that when he got the first chance he could he asked Arthur the question.

"Mr. Weasley sir, when I landed in Knockturn Alley I noticed something that was bothering me."

Arthur pulled himself up a bit and settled his hand on Harry's shoulder in a reassuring way.

"Harry, there are a great many things dark and disturbing in Knockturn alley. Best to not think about it much."

"Yes sir, it's just I saw an old woman selling hair and fingernails. Why would she sell those?"

Arthur had known intellectually that Harry was muggle raised but it wasn't until know he really processed that.

He looked across the room where Molly was bustling the family about and cleared his throat.

"Molly dear, me and Harry need to have a talk out in the shed."

Molly looked up and had a question on her tongue. However seeing her husband making a not now gesture and glancing at Harry she realized it was important, or embarrassing enough, for her question to wait for in private.

"Alright dear, dinner will be in an hour."

Arthur chuckled and turned to the door out.

"Come along Harry, this is important. We have a bit of a talk to have."

Harry gulped and wasn't sure why his question had brought this about but figured it was important for some reason.

"Yes sir."

Arthur chuckled and led them out to his shed.

"You're not in trouble Harry, it's just that your question made me realize how there are probably many things about our world you don't know."

Harry scrunched his eyebrows as he tried to figure out what this was about.

"Like what sir exactly."

They sat down in the shed before Arthur started his lecture. All the boys had been given it and after 6 times he was fairly good at it.

"Harry, there are charms and potions for everything. Including making sure you and your sexual partner never have an unwanted pregnancy."

Oh boy, this is not what he had expected.

"There are also potions and charms to ensure fertility as well as determining who the parent of a child is."

Harry still wasn't making the connection yet or what this had to do with hair.

"This means worrying about your spouse getting pregnant or getting someone else pregnant, is not something people of our world worry about unlike muggles."

Harry was still confused and growing more so by the sentence.

"Harry, muggles have rather strict views on sex and marriage. We wizards tend to be far more relaxed about the whole deal. Here in Britain it is most common to marry for politics, breeding, and then love."

Harry was taken back by that. Marry for politics? Why would marriage have anything to do with politics?

Arthur chuckled as he realized Harry had no idea what he was talking about.

"Take my marriage to Molly for instance. It was mostly for politics and having a big strong family. The Prewitt family and the Weasley family were both in need of something. The Weasley family needed more political backing, while the Prewitt family was waning in magical power. Us Weasley family members have always been in the top percentage on power."

Harry was really interested now, he knew Ron had power, he just really had problems getting the spells to work right to begin with. Once he had them they were good nearly as strong as his own.

"So by sisters married the Prewitt twins and Molly married me. Both sides were quite happy with the arrangement. Though just between us Molly was rather badgering at first. Put me right off let me tell you."

Harry was even more confused again, they seemed like a happy family though Molly was still a badger of a mother.

Arthur had to laugh again as he loved seeing the obvious confusion of Harry as he went along.

"Harry here is where we get into the second part of the conversation. Well Molly and I needed to make our relationship work. So she made up a dose of love potion you see and brought it to me. We each added a drop of blood to the vial and drank half."

Love potion? Like the song love potion number 9? Huh, that sounded interesting.

"Love potions when taken correctly allow you to see the better parts of the other while making their more unattractive aspects settle."

He let Harry work through this, some wizards and witches just didn't like love potions, though they were the minority for sure. Most of them though were muggleborn however so he wanted to be careful about this with Harry.

"So they just let you see the good parts without having to worry about the parts you don't like? That seems okay but kind of not as well. I mean the bad parts are still there right?"

"Yes they are Harry, but when taken twinned together like Molly and I did it also helps you change the things that cause problems. Afterall if you love someone why wouldn't you want to make yourself a better person for them? And if that is working both ways then both people become better for it."

Harry nodded, that made sense and seemed like a good idea.

"So love can and will grow in a marriage rather easily Harry. So marrying for love is not that important though it is nice."

Arthur prepared himself for the longest and final stretch of this conversation.

"Now, if you are marrying for a practical reason, and don't have to worry about the issues of having unwanted pregnancy that means sex outside of the marriage is not a taboo like it is for muggles."

Whoa, that was crazy! The shows on the telly always made it seem like a big deal.

"This means many people in marriages have lovers other than their spouse. It also means that some people enjoy using special charms and potions for sexual purposes as well."

Harry just nodded as he felt a bit embarrassed over it. Not overly so but it was somewhat uncomfortable to talk about. Arthur picked up on that but after dealing with Percy on the talk this was nothing he couldn't handle. Oh, he should also go over that as well, homosexuals, bisexuals, magisexuals and more.

"There exists a special potion for people who like to role play as others. It is called the Polyjuice Potion. With just a hair, nail clipping, or something similar for one hour you will look like someone else."

He could see the sickle slide into place as Harry finally made the connection. The next part was important as it was what made polyjuice both popular and legal.

"However the important part is that you still sound like yourself. This means people will know who you actually are, so things are consensual, and who you are not as well. So you cannot polyjuice into someone else and then commit a crime. Silence during a crime is usually taken as evidence of a polyjuiced person."

Harry had not even thought about it but he made the connection instantly afterwards. Of course criminals would use it for crimes.

"That's brilliant! What a great idea, that's an amazing potion!"

Arthur let out a sigh of relief that Harry was taking this so well.

"This means that there are those who sell, or get taken from them unknowingly, hair and nails for other to enjoy. You noticed Gilderoy Lockhart today yes? He is rather famous for selling his hair commonly."

Frankly, yes. An unmarked door to a staircase that leads to the shop on the upper floor. The only outward sign of it is the brass plate beside the door and the ringer you have to push to be let in.

This might just be a cultural thing, but I do expect these kinds of places to be there, discreet and catering to a discerning clientel. Meanwhile down Knockturn Alley are the blatant ones announcing their trade with neon signs and barkers in front of their doors.

Asmittedly, by my headcanon the primary customer base for the classier establishments are the parents of muggleborn who want to try to inject a bit of "magic" in their love life.

** I always figured that since the year groups around Harry's age we're so small (mid war baby dip/population cull) there was a fucktonne of empty classrooms (how many times do we see the trio duck into a clearly unused classroom to talk plot shit) that other teens were hooking up in & Harry n Co were just too busy trying not to die to notice (I mean cmon it took 2/3 of them 5 books to get a serious kiss in)

** Bro, you could fly a fucking car into a fucking tree and shit and you still wouldn't fucking be fucking expelled, are you really fucking expecting them to fucking start fucking expelling people now?

I always think of the fanart where Scorpius gets up to give his graduation speech and starts off by mentioning how glad he is to be graduating so he can have a proper shag without fearing detention(draco's face). He then talks about how brave Draco was. Then calls Draco an idiot and a coward for not asking Harry out already. They(Draco and Harry) have already been dating for several months now.

Thinking 'Man with the Golden gun' by accident, if Newt had three nipples would that make him a witch AND a wizard?
