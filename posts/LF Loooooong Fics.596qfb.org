I'm in the mood for some crazy long fics that aren't complete trash. Series also work I guess. 300k+ words, complete, and no slash please :)

Edit: Thanks Everyone!


** The first part of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With a Purpose]] is more or less standalone, is complete, and is just shy of 300k words. linkffn(4101650) IMHO it's the best Peggy Sue fic ever done, though others may disagree.

** I know it's probably too late, but I just /have/ to recommend Hogwarts Exposed Timeline - no official word count, but at 500 chapters, many of which are multi-part, it's probably one of the longest HP fics around... well over 300k words anyway.

Official fic page [[http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=159046][here]], but you need an account on AH.com to read it. TV Tropes page [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HogwartsExposedTimeline][here]] (but it has an awful lot of spoilers, and, well, TV Tropes, good luck not getting lost).

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*
