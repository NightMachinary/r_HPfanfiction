Most of the times in dimension travel fics where Harry meets his parents his counterpart died as a baby or is evil, so I was wondering if there are any fics where he is actually still alive and not a bad guy but has a different personality while being still a good guy

Dimension!Harry isn't exactly good but he's not evil, he just grew up as a bully. A bit of a jerk but not evil.

It's a really good fic. Incomplete though but it's so worth it.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** Too Far From Home by story2tell is unfinished, last updated around a year ago so I still hold out hope it will be continued. A 14 year old Harry ends up in a dimension with living parents, a sister, and an older version of himself. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5757945/1/]] This one stayed with me. Well written and very angsty.

** The incredibly long trilogy by Green Gecko, starting with Resonance, has this a plotline. Harry travels to several dimensions and encounters his parents and a version of himself in a world without Voldemort. Dimension travel doesn't happen until book 2 or 3 (Revolution and Resolution). Technically, the work is incomplete, but the author posted the last few chapters on LiveJournal. There's only one minor plot that's not finished, the whole thing is worth it for how the characterisations are so close to canon (if you can accept Snape not being pure evil).
