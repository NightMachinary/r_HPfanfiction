I really like the potential of this post-war pairing as a dual-redemption story. The idea of the muggle-hating Pansy, and the wizard-fearing Dudley, both abandoning the prejudices of their youth, and finding each other in the process just seems so poetic to me.

I've been brainstorming ideas for a fic I'd like to write about them, but I'd like to see other people's interpretations and maybe get some inspiration. Have you read any decent stories with this pairing?


** Not with the pairing, but I think you'd need to find a reason for Dudley to interact with the magical world at all (or Pansy to interact with the muggle one enough to meet Dudley).

I vaguely remember a fic where Dudley got bit by a werewolf during the year in the safehouse his family was in. But like, something like that to drag him into the world he fears so much.

*** Maybe similar to that Draco Exile story Pansy could be forced to live in the Muggle world as an atonement and meets Dudley at his job or college or something

  SOUND THE ALARM! CHRISTMAS FIC 2018! It's nearly Christmas, but crime doesn't sleep. Instead, it leaves a swathe of destruction and dead bodies in its wake across Wizarding and Muggle London. Festive! The Aurors are stumped, the Met are mystified, and consulting detective Harry Potter is on the case.

** There's a fic called the Witchhunter - I cant remember ffnet or ao3 - which has all other canon pairings, and the main pairing is Dudley/Pansy.

** If the (widely shared, not certain if canonical) idea that Dudley started his conversion to be truly normal after the meeting with dementors leads to anywhere, then I always believed that morally upright Dudley would be a policeman. That would a) utilize his figure and boxing abilities, b) make an interesting link between him and Harry (both being law officers; perhaps Dudley could work as some kind of muggle police liaison?), c) lead fast to Vernon's cardiac arrest (his son working for government!). Pairing with Pansy would be interesting in such case, but I have always rooted for Dudley/Cho ship, sorry (I liked linkao3(651870)).
