Browsing the internet, I ran across these two blog posts, detailing some more "unusual" theories (backed up with a bunch of evidences though):

- Professor McGonagall is a DE spy:

[[http://unplottables.livejournal.com/46684.html?thread=694364]]

- Dumbledore is Ron time traveled to the past

[[http://unplottables.wordpress.com/weasley-is-our-king/]]

The Livejournal community died a while ago, but digging through it, I found a couple of plausible ideas for a fanfic.

Any one want to give it a shot?

Also feel free to post any ideas niggling around your head, someone might be willing to pick it up :)


** I always thought to myself, if Voldemort actually had no Horcrux, and had died... who would have been the next Dark Lord?

Lucius Malfoy seems the type to hoard power, but historically, the house of Malfoy preferred to ingratiate itself on all levels of power instead of being overt leaders, as leaders are prone to be replaced eventually.

Snape would seem a candidate - he was a genius, ambitious, skilled in the dark arts, and with reason to hate Dumbledore (who said Snape trusted the wrong person... ignoring the fact that Snape could have said "you're right, I trusted you /and she's dead/."), and plenty of others. But he'd be without purpose; he was broken when Lily died, and only his mission kept him going.

The other Death Eaters are either imprisoned or not nearly as competent... so they're out.

So, without Voldemort, then the #1 candidate for the position of next Dark Lord becomes... Hermione Granger.

Like Snape, she has the skills, she has the brains, she has the need to prove herself, and a fascination with the dark arts (the contract for the DA was a dark spell; it left horrible and incurable scars, a sign of a dark curse. The DA coins were based off research about the Dark Mark... etc), a really vicious side (Rita Skeeter comes to mind), and quite frankly, without the troll incident, she would be friendless in Gryffindor.

Without backup, in a world that dislikes her for being a nerdy muggle-born witch, she'd work to change the world... and would be a nudge away from doing so in shady ways.

*** On one hand, I think Hermione is too rule bound and obedient to authority to ever stray that far. While she does want to prove herself, she lets others, especially if they are more competent, take charge (like the DA club). She also did spend all of her Muggle education presumably friendless and manage to come out OK.

With SPEW she did ignore the wants and desires of house elves to instead focus on her ideal, which I can see supporting your theory. I can see her being turned and it would be a really neat story if done well. It'd be cool to see the other side of the coin. With her stable family background I don't see it being likely, but I would love to read about the series of events that twisted her morals.

**** Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle would bully her, and without Harry and Ron (since there was no Voldemort, and therefore no Troll incident) at her side, they manage to sabotage her more often than not. Lucius Malfoy applies pressure on the teachers via the Board of Governors, and Dumbledore then usually goes with Draco's explanation of events. In her own house, Lavender and Parvati make her life hell, and the twins decide that because she's so serious, she needs to be pranked all the time.

One day, she goes to cry in a bathroom, only this time, it's Myrtle's. Myrtle empathizes, and starts telling her about the chamber of secrets... Hermione applies herself and finds a way in, searches it carefully, and finds tomes of dark, hidden knowledge. Fascinated by this foreign type of thought, she delves into it, not understanding just how dark the nature of it is.

When she goes home each summer, she has less and less in common with her parents - not only because she's all about magic, but because the study of the dark arts changes her. Eventually they really don't have anything to talk about, and the worried parents try to pull her out of Hogwarts, and put her into a normal school. She obliviates them, just like in canon. Dumbledore prods around, with "do you have anything you want to tell me?", and she decides that she can't trust him.

... it really writes itself.

***** I'll continue the plot bunny a bit more. Snape, without any reason to be at Hogwarts, left and had become a reclusive potions researcher, and so no one other than Dumbledore has the tools to notice Hermione's descent into darkness... other than a few Slytherins. "Brilliant but scary" becomes more extreme, as Hermione's obsessive and hard working nature takes hold and she studies material outside the curriculum... and with every year, darker in nature.

Like many bullied teenagers, she sees plenty of faults with the world. But different than most of them, Hermione knows it is within her power to fix everything. It's not conquering the world and bending it to her will... it's repairing a damaged world. But she can't do it alone. She needs people with her agenda, or at the very least, completely loyal (whether out of fear or any other reason).

Lavender goes missing during her the summer. Parvati returns to Hogwarts silent and twitchy. Goyle had an accident and lost an arm. WWW was burned to the ground before the twins could pay off their loan. Draco is the only one to connect the dots, and suspects Hermione of being responsible. No one else thinks she's more than a bookworm with a temper, but he knows darkness when he sees it. On the way back from Transfiguration, he's pulled into a side corridor and feels a wand at his throat.

"Malfoy. Shut up and listen." Hermione spits out, eyes narrowed.

"Granger!" He manages to choke out before the jab of the wand becomes too strong.

"I said shut up and listen, or this will get messy. The way I see it, you owe me a very bloody death... or your life." She says, her voice cold.

Draco looks around, and there's no one near. The shortcut he took would mean no one would hear him scream. He looks into her eyes and sees a hardness he only saw when his father was about to destroy someone's life.

"Roll up your sleeve, and give me your arm." Hermione whispers as she removes Draco's wand with her other hand. She puts her wand against his arm and whispers "Morsmordre". Her first servant has been recruited.

******* No coin (upvote) was inserted!

Draco returns home, and Lucius sees the dark mark and pales significantly. Draco refuses to tell who did it, but says it is not Voldemort. Lucius quickly calculates that he needs to stop this new dark lord - the disaster of supporting the last one cost him years to fix. But he can't do it directly for fear of ruining Draco's life.

In his desperation, he seeks out Severus Snape... who finds it hilarious, throwing how Lucius recruited him to the Death Eaters in his face. Lucius tries to hide behind his aristocratic demeanor, but Snape is too clever by half for that to work and understands how desperate Lucius is. He bullies Lucius into promising anything to keep Draco safe, and petitions Dumbledore for the DADA position.

Stories about the more extreme pro-Pureblood politicians either having bizarre accidents or changing their political views start reaching the news. Nott, Avery, the Carrows, and all other free Death Eaters start talking among themselves. And then the disappearances stop... just prior to the media figuring out it was more than just random accidents.

When her seventh year starts, she sees Snape as the new DADA teacher, and is unsure if he was looked at her or not during the sorting ceremony. She looks towards Draco, who is acting like everything is normal, and when she looks back to the head table, Snape is staring right at her. She immediately starts practicing occlumency, but feels nothing in her mind.

Hermione asks Draco to tell her everything he knows about the rise and fall of Voldemort that isn't in the books. Snape features prominently (Voldemort was winning handily before Snape's work as a spy caused a bloody equilibrium), as does Dumbledore. She decides that Dumbledore is too dangerous to her agenda, as he has decades of enforcing his... and that Snape is the one who could tell her best about what faults Voldemort had that caused him to lose, as well as a unique insight to Dumbledore.

From Snape's introductory speech to the class, she understands that he has a very deep insight into the magics she studies on her own... and to her surprise, he asks her to stay after class while she was acting completely inconspicuous. She pieces together that he suspects her of darker motives due to his connection to the Malfoy family instantly. She reminds herself to punish Draco later.

She tries to not give up anything, but Snape just starts from the point of flat out calling her out on the practice of dark arts and murder. Surprisingly though, he says he has no intention of stopping her, telling her he did the same at her age. He lets her ask questions about Voldemort and Dumbledore freely, and while she is careful, just from her questions, he figures out that she want to become the next dark lady. They reach a deal of sorts - he will advise her and keep Dumbledore out of it, if, and only if, Draco is safe. Otherwise, he'll kill her himself.

Draco naturally does not know of this agreement, and Lucius remains terrified. Hermione, taking advice from Snape, manages to expand her recruitment pool without Dumbledore noticing. She's starts a debating club, and through it positions herself as a champion of equal rights and political activism, and decides it's time to communicate with Lucius via Snape in order to apply political pressure on Dumbledore... and with a few carefully placed rumors by Draco, it reaches Fudge that Dumbledore is after his seat.

The political influence is subtle at first, but Rita Skeeter's Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore becomes a massive best seller. Lucius works via the Board of Directors, Fudge and Umbridge via the Wizengamot, and Snape points out to Hermione which students are most likely to work under her at Hogwarts... using the political distractions to great effect.

Once she leaves Hogwarts, the real work is ready to begin. After all, every revolution gets bloody before it succeeds.

Why would there need to be a dark lord?

It was considered extremely unlikely and unheard off that both Grindelwald and Voldemort appeared in the same century. I would say "dark lords" are few and far between and not something that every generation has to deal with.

Also, Hermione? give me a break. Even if shen went insane she would be a crazy psychopath at best, not even close to a genuine threat like Voldemort was. She has some book smarts but she isn't a strong witch. She simply lacks the magical power to ever pose a true threat. Do you see her fighting off ten aurors at the same time? I think not.

According to JKR, Hermione was quite possibly a genius, and one of the most powerful of her age. I doubt the heads of large crime syndicates are insane, or even completely amoral... and Hermione would be molded after them, rather than a super powered genocidal madman. Seven years of education at the school who brought you Voldemort and the Death Eaters could be a different place than described via Harry's eyes.

And anyways, the whole point with fan fiction is that you can be flexible with the source material. You know, for /fun/. Plot bunnies: I enjoy the idea, therefore I write it somewhere and will probably do nothing with it. But it was fun to think it.

tl;dr: I am not JKR, this plot bunny isn't even a story, let alone canon.

That's not good enough! She is "one of" the most powerful, but not "the absolute best by seventeen miles".

Hermione does not have what it takes to be a dark lady. She has no money, no influence, no charisma and not enough magical power to be a threat. When voldemort show up in the field he fights and wins against multiple very powerful opponents at the same time. While a very dedicated and highly trained Hermione wouldn't be a pushover she doesn't have the raw power to do things like that.
