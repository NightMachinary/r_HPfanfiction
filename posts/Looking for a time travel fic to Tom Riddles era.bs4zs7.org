I am looking for a fanfiction in which Harry goes back in time(accidental or on purpose doesn't matter) to the school days of Tom. After that i am pretty much open to anything that happens, so it doesn't matter if they are in the same house, become friends or enemies, as long as they don't become lovers in the end. I would prefer if Harry goes back in time after his fourth year or later, because I think that after their duel/s and so on, any meeting between the two makes it much more interesting. Any fics you can recommend?


** Linkffn(Realignment)

It's told from Tom's point of view, who suddenly has a powerful wizard who wants to kill him and has a mental connection to him.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald
