** In a crossover fic called 'Itachi, is that a baby?' There's a running joke where everytime a husband of Miss Zabini dies both Harry and Blaise just shrug and blame it on unfortunate accidents. Even if, quote: he tripped up and down the stairs seven times, rolled into the kitchen on the other side of the house and slammed into the kitchen counter which caused the same knife to fall into his body twenty-five times.

The deaths keep getting more and more ridiculous while their reaction remains the same.

** Completely random thought: Blaise is a (Voldemort's) Horcrux and the negativity that surrounds him forces the husbands to become depressed/crazy/paranoid and thus die somehow.

Mrs. Zabini is completely oblivious to the situation and isn't affected because she's proficient at Occlumency.

** Funny, but firstly two flaws I instantly see. It's Mrs. Zabini, with a b, not the letter n. Also, how do you propose her son managed to kill the first at such a young age, considering before Hogwarts it was seven husbands I presume. Therefore, it would be quite strange for a child to have that intelligence, skill, and psychotic resolve that early in life.

*** The story of the seven ill-fated husbands is referenced in HBP:

#+begin_quote
  Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold).
#+end_quote

So if he was a child serial murderer (maybe accidental magic at first, gone really wrong), he's definitely got time to kill off 7 guys before 16.

**** Seven guys, that's assuming it's in the last seven years one each, is believable in a shorter time period. Not really at eleven.

*** Alternatively: she's a seductress but as soon as they're married (in a good old-fashioned, magically binding fanon marriage contract, of course) she becomes so horrible to live with that they off themselves.
