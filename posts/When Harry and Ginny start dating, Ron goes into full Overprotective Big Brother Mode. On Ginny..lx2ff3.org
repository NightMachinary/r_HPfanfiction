***** And everyone in the Great Hall heard Ron. Students and professors alike were stunned into silence by what they heard (Hermione face palms).

Snape drops his fork in shock onto his plate, catching everyone's attention, and whispers audibly, "She does have the same shade as Lily's hair".

By the end of the day, rumors were abound about Ginny (presumably) Potter from her being Harry's long-lost twin (Harry and Ginny, their names rhyme. It makes sense!) to the Weasleys kidnapping Ginny during the aftermath of Voldemort's defeat (some say this was done with the help of Albus Dumbledore).

** "Alright, Ginny," Ron said. "We need to have a little chat."

"Ron, can't it wait?"

"No," Ron said. "It can't. Sit down or I'll jinx you to the chair."

Ginny scowled but said nothing as Ron went on and on for the next hour and a half about Harry and how Ron was not going to tolerate any mistreatment whatsoever.

"I know you're more or less over the hero worship," Ron said. "But Harry doesn't like attention."

"I know."

"And I know that money's always been tight, but if I see that you're using Harry to buy you things, then you'll be in for it. It's not proper to use a bloke for his money pouch."

"I would never!"

"That goes double for his Firebolt! You have a perfectly good Cleansweep!"

"Why would you even think that?"

"Harry's my brother," Ron said. "You hurt him? I hurt you. I'll make it hurt in ways that would make a Death Eater blanche. I'll break off every one of your fingers so you can never catch a Quaffle. I'll bind you up by your ankles and use your feet to hold candlesticks--I remember, you're still afraid of fire after that incident with Charlie's birthday cake. But we do understand each other right? You won't hurt Harry?"

"Ron!" Ginny snapped, but she looked almost ready to cry. She held her hands tightly together. "I'm your sister! You're my brother...why don't you trust me?"

Oh...bloody hell. Ginny was his little sister...little Gin-gin. She held his hand when they crossed the street until...actually, hadn't it been until his fourth year? Maybe even after that?

He was the one she went to when she had nightmares after that thing in the Chamber.

She let him sleep with her bunny after Fred turned his teddy into a spider...even after Mum had turned it back.

"Ooof!" Ginny groaned. "Ron! Gerroff me!"

"Baby sister! If Harry hurts you, I'll eviscerate him!"

"Let me loose!"

"Sweet Ginny...kind Ginny...wonderful..."

"Harry," Ron said. "We need to have a little chat."

"Er, alright," Harry answered. "Oy, what happened to your finger?"

"Ginny."

"Er..."

"Harry," Ron said. "You need to listen to this. Ginny is my baby sister, but next to you and Hermione, she's my best friend."

/"Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!"/

"Oy, nobody asked you!" Ron barked at a half dozen girls. "Didn't your mothers ever tell you not to eavesdrop? Now, where was I?"

"Ginny bit you?" Harry asked.

"Blech! I had to brush my teeth for twenty minutes!" Ginny groaned. "Blech!"

"Serves you right," Ron said, putting his hands on his hips. "Both of you, sit. This way I only have to give one lecture."

"Ronald, this is not necessary!"

"Ginny, for calling me /Ronald,/" Ron glowered. "I'll tell Harry how many stuffed animals you sleep with. Now, both of you mean a lot to me. I don't want anything bad to happen to either of you."

"We get it," Ginny said. "You're an over-protective brother."

"Er," Harry said. "I don't really get it. I've never had an over-protective brother before."

/"Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!"/ The same group of girls called.

"Oy," Ron said. "We'll skip to the rules then."

"Rules?"

"Ginny, you are not allowed to try on Harry's glasses. Harry, you are not allowed to use Ginny as a dummy for the Beaters. Ginny, you are not allowed to snog him for more than ten seconds without coming up for air. Harry, you're not allowed to give Ginny any gold jewelry--she's allergic..."

** Oh man, this reminds me of wanting to see a shovel talk like this one:

"I can see which way the wind is blowing," said Robert Granger as he motioned Harry to have a seat in front of him. Hermione joined him a few moments later.

"At the risk of sounding cliche, I feel I need to get this talk out of the way," he finished wiping his glasses and put them on, looking directly at Harry. "You have been blessed with a rare gift. Not everyone is as lucky as to fall for their best friend. You hold, in your hands, the love of a wonderful person, one who is most dear to me, and at the same time, you have the power to hurt them, terribly, more than anyone else in this world.

"Which brings me to the next point. Should I find out that you took this gift for granted, that you treated such a gentle soul without the kindness and love that it deserves, they will never find your body, Hermione. Am I clear?"

"Daddy, you're being....wait WHAT!?" Hermione stared at her father with wide eyes and a thoroughly shocked expression. Harry was similarly gobsmacked, surely he had heard Robert wrong, right?

"I'll repeat myself," grinned Robert with a twinkle in his eyes that would put Dumbledore to shame. "You will never find another person like Harry, even if you go to the ends of the earth. Frankly, you lucked out big time, kitten. So please don't let anger or ego or jealousy or a slew of negative things ever put a rift between you two that cannot be crossed. You will regret it for the rest of your short-lived life as I hunt you down with a rusty spoon. And believe me, it's *super* rusty."

Harry's laughter broke out of him and his attempts to mask it with a coughing fit fared rather poorly.

"Hmph. Very funny." scowled Hermione with her arms crossed. She was clearly not amused by the antics of Harry and her father who were either trying to control their guffaws or not bothering to do so at all. "What's wrong */Potter/*? Do you need some water?" she glared at her fiance.

"Just....just a spoonful..." gasped Harry before he and Robert doubled over, cackling like madmen.

**   Ron drew Ginny aside in the common room, as she threw a longing look at Harry, which he seemed to be returning with equal gusto. "Listen, Gin. We need to talk."\\
  Ginny stared at her youngest brother for a long moment. "This had better be good," in a tone that promised Bat Bogey hexes should she be displeased by the conversation.\\
  "C'mon," he said, walking towards the portrait hole, with Ginny reluctantly following. They made their way through the corridors to one of the many abandoned classrooms. Ron drew his wand, and pointed it at the door. "/Colloportus!/" The door clicked shut and locked. He stowed his wand away and took a deep breath, gathering his thoughts.\\
  A long moment of awkward silence passed. "Well?" Ginny said, sounding slightly annoyed.\\
  "Are you serious?" Ron asked.\\
  "What?"\\
  "Are you serious about Harry?"\\
  "I don't know. What do you mean?" Asked Ginny, baffled.\\
  "I mean, do you actually like /Harry/? I remember you had mum read you /The Boy Who Lived/ books every night from the time you learned to talk to the time you learned to read, and Harry isn't /him/," Ron said.\\
  "I know that!" Ginny exclaimed.\\
  "Do you? What do you think he is?"\\
  "He's my knight in shining armour. He saved me from Riddle, from the Chamber. He saved us all from V-V-Voldemort.." Ginny replied stuttering a bit with the name.\\
  Ron flinched a little when she said that name. He grimaced, "That's not all he is."\\
  "No. He's kind, he's um... Well he's cute." Ginny said, fishing for how to describe Harry.\\
  "He's also scarred," Ron interjected.\\
  "Well duh, everyone knows that." Ginny said with a snort.\\
  Ron shook his head in response. "Not talking about that. Think back to before you started Hogwarts. That summer. Remember when me and Fred and George-"\\
  "Fred, George, and I," corrected Ginny.\\
  Ron glowered at his sister. "Shut it, I get that enough from Hermione, and I'm trying to make a point. Anyway. Remember the day Harry showed up?"\\
  "I remember Mum blowing up the rafters shouting at you three."\\
  "Remember the part where we said they had bars on the window? That they were starving him?"\\
  "You were just saying that to get out of trouble," Ginny said, dubiously, "Weren't you?"\\
  Ron shook his head. "No. I wasn't. That's why I wanted to talk to you. He's been hurt. A lot. I don't want you adding to that. If you can't see past the /Boy Who Lived/..." he trailed off. "You're my sister, and as annoying as you are, I love you, but Harry means as much to me as any of my brothers."\\
  "So you brought me all the way out here to tell me not to hurt Harry?" Ginny asked.\\
  Ron rubbed the back of his head. "Well. Yeah. I don't think you'd do it deliberately, but it took forever to get it through my head that he hated all that /Boy Who Lived/ stuff. To all of us, it's a reminder that he's a hero. To him, it's a reminder that he lost his mum and dad, and is forced to live with people who /hate/ him."\\
  "So you're doing the whole protective older brother thing for him? Why aren't you pulling Harry aside and telling him you'll take him apart if he hurts me?" Ginny asked.\\
  "Promise not to hex me?"\\
  "For the next ten minutes, at least."\\
  "Well, for one, I trust him not to hurt you deliberately. For two, I'm pretty sure if I did do that, you'd have hexed me on his behalf."\\
  Ginny took a moment considering this. "Fair enough. When did you get so mature?"\\
  "Well, it started with me doing the phenomenally stupid thing of standing on a broken leg between my best friend and a wanted serial killer. Then there was the whole thing with the tournament. I really deserve to be treated far worse for what I did to Harry," Ron admitted. "Hard not to grow up a little when you get smacked in the head with how stupid you've been."
