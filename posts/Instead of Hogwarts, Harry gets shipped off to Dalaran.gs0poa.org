The lack of quality Warcraft crossovers, and the fact that Faykan just updated his fic, I thought, why not send Harry to Dalaran? It has to be significantly better than Hogwarts considering the abundance of Magic in Azeroth.

Maybe go the route of Medivh getting the infant from the Dursleys. By this time, he's free from the corruption of Sargeras and he becomes the great prophet. We can even solve the Horcrux!Harry problem via Medivh too considering he's that OP by then.

We can have a golden trio via Kael'thas, Jaina, and Potter studying under Antonidas with interactions with Arthas on the side.

It can start with Reign of Chaos then Harry getting pulled back to Earth by some means after the whole Archimonde debacle to deal with Voldemort. A plot binder can be that Voldemort is contacted by the Burning legion via their Dreadlords too.

Also just to link what inspired this post: Linkffn(the stormreaver by faykan)

Go read it if you haven't yet. One of the best Warcraft crossovers IMO.

  A tale of demonic manipulation and a warring Alliance trying to defend their world from a rampaging Horde. Thrown into the mix of this world before he could even walk or talk, Infant Harry Potter is placed into the hands of the most powerful Warlock of his people, Darkness Incarnate himself: Gul'dan, chieftain of the Stormreaver Clan.

** Can Kael really be a part of anything morally good without making him into a named OC? The guy's an extreme version of Draco at his best and worse then IndieFic!Ron on his worst.

*** Actually, Kael was good before the Fel. He fell because of the xenophobia of the humans before outland and then the absorption of actual Fel magics in outland.

Funfact: Kael was actually one of Jaina's suitors along with Arthas during their younger years. Iirc it was mentioned in a book.
