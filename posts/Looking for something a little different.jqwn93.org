I read a fiction a while ago where Harry could pull things/people out of book, magazines, etc. and use them. I think the power is called libromancy. All I remember is he pulled a witch from one book and got training in another. I will stop rambling now and get to the point. I want to find that fic again and any like it. Give me some recommendations on you best libromancy fics. Thanks ahead of time.

P.S. I guess I should add that I was looking for a HP fanfiction with this premise. Didn't mean to be confusing about that. Also thank you all for the other suggestions from other fandoms.


** Sadly no. The idea of Harry with the ability sounds like a fun read though.

** I only know that ability from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_the_Red_King][Children of the Red King]] series. It's just with pictures, not books though.

FYI its probably a good idea to put what you're looking for in the title. Makes helping you easier

** Have you read the book series by Jim C Hines that ability was likely borrowed from?
