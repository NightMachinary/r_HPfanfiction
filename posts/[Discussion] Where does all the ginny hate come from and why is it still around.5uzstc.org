I mean honestly, the amount of ginny bashing I see in fics is horrendous. Ok so I'll just list some of her good quallties here: She is kind, has a slightly evil sense of humour like harry, smart, pretty powerful, passionate, fiery and also plays quidditch, Here are some negative aspects: I guess she is a bit of a Mary-Sue character because JKR didnt develop her much. Also she had a crush on harry when she was younger, but he did save her from tom riddle so thats pretty understandable. I also see alot of people writing her as a petty, jealous bitch, I don't think that makes sense at all. She did not date Dean to make harry jealous, she moved on from harry and had like 3 boyfriends before dean so if that did not make harry jealous I don't think she would have kept trying. Anyway that is my opinion


** she was potrayed pretty badly in the movies. I personaly have no problems with Ginny and thinks its quite realistic for Harry to start liking her. I personally just dont think their relationship is interesting compared to other possible ones.

****** I think that's why a lot of us don't like movie snape. Don't get me wrong, I completely agree he's incredible, but my whole childhood was based off the books. Something that big in your life you don't really want to see it changed. Spend a long time thinking Snape is a immature dickhead that I don't think even remotely deserves Lily, or Harry's gratitude. Really, in the books he saved Harry's life in first year, gave him the sword, then told him he had to die. It's kind of hard to see Rickmans snape that doesn't seem so bad, and you can empathise with him.

*** Agree with this. I thought there were interesting dynamics of their relationship that just were never explored, though some things were hinted at in Cursed Child.

The Harry/Ginny coupling is essentially Ginny pining after Harry and dating other guys to try to move on, but never being able to do so. It would have been much more interesting if the story was told from her perspective, as it follows a similar trajectory as Jim from the Office. Except we got to see his storyline and hers was implied and offscreen.

Once together, Rowling really did nothing with the relationship so naturally it wasn't too interesting. This is a shame since there were interesting areas to explore with them being together. For one, how does Ginny change the dynamic with the trio? Does Hermione get jealous that Harry goes to Ginny more for advice/support? What was the nature of Ginny's relationship with Michael and Dean? Were they really a means to an end, or did Ginny actually date them with the hope of finding happiness with them and away from Harry?

After the war, things could get even more interesting. Do they get back together right away? Is Ginny upset with Harry for leaving her? Does he minimize what she went through at Hogwarts? How does she accept him trying to lock her away during the battle, as her desire to fight is a fundamental part of her that in that moment, Harry tried to squash?

TL;DR I find they relationship between Harry and Ginny to be incredibly interesting, but it's a shame Rowling chose not to show that.

**** Yeah the thing that got me was the fact that Harry left Ginny in DH and she just accepted it. Where was her Weasley temper then? Rowling just kind of excused all Harry's shit away because it was unimportant to her, and so I feel like as a result I didn't click with their dynamic past a few funny pre-hookup scenes.\\
Ginny is a fun-ass character, don't get me wrong, but I prefer to read her in fanfic than in canon. As for where the hate comes from, I have no idea.

***** Yeah I always thought the break up was a way to show how self-sacrificing and noble Harry was, but it didn't effectively show the best traits of Ginny. I get what Rowling was probably trying to do, showing Ginny as the stoic, battle-hardened "good girlfriend." Cho cries and ginny doesn't, so she is better (I actually don't think crying is a bad thing). But to me, the Ginny I prefer is the one that refuses to accept what Harry is doing (in part because it makes no sense) and refuses to be sidelined. Rowling should have had her basically understand that Harry had a role to play, but she would keep up the fight. And regardless of what he says or what he wants the world to think, they would not be broken up because she wouldn't let Tom control her life anymore. They will both fight and be there for each other when it's over.

Rowling went into such depth on so many characters and so many tiny details about her world. But when it came to Ginny, sometimes it feels like she didn't put much thought into her actions. I think she had an idea about what Ginny was like, but then wouldn't ask herself "would Ginny do this" during certain pivotal scenes.

As far as where the hate comes from, I guess it's from people who don't ship Harry/Ginny because they just don't like that Harry wound up with the popular pretty girl instead of the bookish girl more people identify with. And I can understand that, but it's not Ginny's fault.

** [[/u/taure]] ran a survey here a few months ago. It turned out Ginny's biggest haters are teenage girls, while her biggest fans are teenage boys, and to a lesser degree older women.

Ginny's intention behind dating other boys didn't sit well with many. She never really liked those guys, and her goal was mostly building up her self confidence. That was a pretty utilitarian thing. However, many haters tend to overlook that this was Hermione's idea to begin with.

Another group of haters are of the opinion that Harry/Ginny relationship developed out of nowhere. I'm also of the opinion that JKR could have handled this better. One has to do multiple rereads of OoTP to notice all the details and hints of their relationship. Not many in the fandom have paid that much attention to Book 5.

#+end_quote

I agree with this to a heavy extent, but I think the under development of this (and other key plot points that sometimes appeared out of NOWHERE) is a symptom of something bigger: she had massive writers block while writing book five, party because she had written herself into a corner. The first four books all came out one year after the other, then there was a three year wait. While she has never said she had writers block by name, she has admitted to it being a struggle to write and at times contemplating extreme measures to "explain" why she wasn't writing quickly.

Book five represents a massive tonal shift for the series, and there are many, many things happening in it. She also had a very specific ending she was aiming for with the series and needed to figure out how to get there. The problem was that a kids/pre-teen series wouldn't be the agreeable vehicle. So she needed to do the literary equivalent of bashing some code together simply to make it work. A lot of details are shoved rather hamfistedly in, and, most importantly, left out. While one of her strengths is casually foreshadowing something, book 5 was rather short on this. It was a means to an end to get her to a conclusion. Book 6 then picks up the story again as if book 5 had been more elegantly told. The problem is that it wasn't.

** I think for the most part the hate on Ginny derives from 3 things.

- Harry's sudden roaring chest monster.

Many would have liked to see a romance developing over a few books. Ginny came in Book 5 and then was just /there/. The signs and hints were too little, too late to make this relationship into something that felt like it developed organically. As it is, the feeling is often like Ginny went from fangirl to love-interest over the course of a few weeks. One symptom of this underdeveloped romance is definitely the "Love Potion" thing so many fics entertain.

- The Character itself.

Ginny is not well developed. Yes, relative to other HP characters she had enough screentime to get known, but once you look at her character from a more objective viewpoint, you see how underdeveloped it is. Rowling focuses /a lot/ on the trio. In terms of story and character development, they are far beyond every other character in the universe, Ginny included.

- Her "target group" doesn't relate to her.

As InquisitorCOC already pointed out, Ginny is not liked among the group of people she represents - young, average girls.

Given that a wooping majority of ~3/4 of writers on FFN are female, I can definitely see a correlation here.

I personally have been a fan of Harry/Hermione during my first read. Both were characters I related with. Nowadays however, I'm of the opinion that the canon books would have been better off without the relationship between Harry and Ginny, and without any serious romance for Harry. Killing the epilogue would've been good as well.

** For me I'm pretty neutral on Ginny but why is she bashed? Well she makes an easy and obvious target. So much of fanfiction is decided by pairing. This means for any non-canon pairing you have to have a way to remove Ginny from the equation. This can be done tactfully, killing her off, never having her in the equation to begin with or having them separate amicably. Alternatively you could bash her to make it clear why she isn't in the picture anymore. To give a reason why Harry isn't dating her but this often goes way too far.

Ginny can be seen as a bit mean. I disliked her view of Fleur. Take that and the idea that she was basically using the other boys and she seems a bit cruel.

Fan girly, I didn't like the way she was almost out of nowhere the object of Harry's attention but okay, can deal with it. At the funeral however, she says some stuff that can be interpreted as 'I'm still a fan-girl', the whole it was always you Harry. Now soul mates or fan girl? Lets just say JKR doesn't do a great job.

- can be mean and spiteful

- is not always forgiving especially toward her family members

** I agree with a lot of people that the relationship was not handled well.

J. K. Rowling wanted to get Harry and Ginny together, but she also, I believe, wanted the story to be about the Trio and didn't want to disrupt the Trio through the end. Thus, Ginny gets sidelined, especially in Books 5 and 6 where JKR herself tries to make her shine, and fails.

I agree with [[/u/UndeadBBQ][u/UndeadBBQ]] that "Harry's sudden roaring chest monster" is a problem. I actually think Book 6 was /worse/ than Book 5, and the way the romance felt shoehorned in is a big part of why. (And that goes double for the movie.)

Ditto for Ginny being underdeveloped. I contend the way to do it right would be to double Ginny's screen time in Books 5 and 6, dump the entire Dean subplot, and have her and Harry make the slow transition from acquaintances to friends to dating over that period. (Unfortunately, as written, Harry is angsting too much in Book 5 for this to work.)

He's known her as Ron's little sister and just never thought about her in any other way until she shows him her personality and she is actually a person, an engaging, funny, pretty one at that.

***** Remember though that for much of 5th year he is pining/dating Cho, plus he's a moody kid who has a lot on his plate that year (Umbridge, Voldemort). So I'd excuse him for not noticing Ginny.

Also, rules of attraction (girl pretty= I like girl) don't quite apply for Harry and Ginny since he grew up knowing her as Ron's sister and thus blocked his mind from seeing her as an attractive girl. But when she actually spent time around him, that changes and thus his eyes open to who she truly is. Plus, he starts fancying her when she is 15. Perhaps this was a time development-wise where it became impossible to not notice Ginny was very attractive.

Finally, and maybe most important, there is a difference between noticing a girl is attractive and having a crush on them. It is entirely plausible Harry did find her attractive but never had feelings for her for reasons mentioned above, but once he actually got to know her, he did develop feelings. It speaks to Harry's character and the difference with him liking Cho that it would be Ginny's personality that made him want to pursue her. With Cho, it was simply Harry finding her attractive. With Ginny the crush developed over much deeper feelings.

****** Yeah, those are good points I'll admit. It's been a long time since I've read the books :/ only thing I disagree with is the crush thing. I'm not saying he needed to ha e a crush on her, even a little, just that there should have been some indication that he found her attractive prior to the monster part. He could have found her attractive but since it's never mentioned we can't really say that he did.

******* Fair point. It could be assumed. There are numerous examples of Harry noticing her hair and eyes in a positive way throughout the series. It was likely attraction yet at the time he probably didn't see it that way. I'd chalk it up to Rowling only writing about relevant things as they occur. Harry finding Ginny attractive only becomes a relevant point in book 6.

*** Absolutely. I didn't think I fancied my current partner until he announced to a group of our friends that he was moving abroad. I quietly got up, went into another room and burst into tears as I realised I was hopelessly in love with him. Came out of the fucking blue. We've been together nearly 5 years now.

** Why is she bashed? I would say because the writers that do it don't have the skill to pair Harry with someone else without doing it. H&G are my favourite pairing, but, as others have already pointed out, she is underdeveloped in the books and the films twist the knife even further. Thats why I like fanfic, I can write her like I wanted her to be in the books.

Lolwhat? Writing Ginny out without bashing is the easiest thing ever. Just don't have Harry feel anything in OOtP and remove the monster in the chest. Ta-dah!

*** I think her problem is her development is there, just hinted at indirectly, and thus not delved into deeper. We know from what she says and what others say about it that she is physically pretty, very strong, a relatively powerful witch, brave, petulent, childish, prone to jealousy, and a bit conniving, among other traits. That's not nothing as far as development.

The problem is we don't really get the "why" about her. There is a backstory there but it's never explored. For example, when she scolds Harry for forgetting she was possessed, it hints of a darkness in her but the issue is brought up and forgotten about quickly. Fanfiction generally gets it right on this issue by making their shared connection to Voldemort a great source of character exploration. Rowling, however, was too focused on the trio to give Ginny much more time to show herself, which is a bit odd since she winds up married to Harry and is perhaps the greatest love and closest person in his life.

** Ginny Hate reason #1: Hermione is better... if you want to put Harry with another girl you have to get Ginny out of the way somehow (depending on when in cannon your fic Picks up)

Reason 1a: Other girl is better than Ginny, but isn't Hermione. Same reasons, different girl. It boils down to lazy writing when the only way to make another girl better is to tear down the cannon girlfriend instead of just choosing between two good options.

Reason #2: Love out of nowhere... this is what gives rise to the !potions!Ginny tropes. The potions subplot fits in so well to cannon that many think JKR actually intended for Ginny to dose him with love potion to get his attention, just like Molly did with Arthur. At the last moment, those people believe, someone told her how Rapey that sounds. (I'm one of those who believe this)

Reason #3: Weazy bashing, some people get on the train and end up having to hate everyone (except usually, Bill/Charlie, the Twins, and Arthur)

Reason #4: Some people point at Ginny and go "They look just like reincarnation of Lily and James, how cute!" Other people look at Ginny being compared favorably to Lily, and see Oedipus complex (creepy not cute).

The most normal reason to me, is that JKR sucked at writing Ginny and Harry's relationship. It came out of nowhere and we were just supposed to accept that she is his soul mate. It was authors wish fulfillment along with R/Hr and didn't develop naturally enough.

It doesn't help that the Movie cut even more of their relationship development, including the one scene that helped crystalize everything for me. When Ginny beat Cho to the snitch, she was metaphorically proving she was as good as Cho and therefore worthy of Harry. Thus why she jumps him in the common room and kisses him.

Personally though, I much prefer Harry letting Ginny down nicely for any reason but bashing. Ginny hatred is un-needed and overboard in almost every instance. Find better reasons to put him with someone else, it isn't the poor girls fault Harry just isn't attracted to her.

Note my flair, initially I was a Harry/Ginny fanboy and I still tend to put them together in a harem setting or threesome with either Luna or Hermione. I like her enough if is hard for me to say no to her even when I have decided that Hermione was always a much better choice for his life mate.

Much hatred of Ron comes from the place of Ron not deserving Hermione... I try not to hate on him too hard...and fail. But I usually make Harry the better boyfriend along with playing up Rons flaws... I don't hate Ron most of the time though...however it helps me understand why people hate on Ginny.

** It's the gold digger angle.

Didn't Molly Weasley have Harry's Gringotts key at some point? Knowing that family is poor, someone thought "let's make Molly groom her daughter into being an evil gold digger after Harry's money", and it's become such a fanfiction cliche.

** Personally I am not fan of bashing and usually avoid such stories. Having said that I have never been fan of Ginny. And I generally avoid reading stories about Harry/Ginny. Just not my cup of tea so to speak.

I /really/ wish JKR had left ending open and up to the interpretation (or fantasies) of the readers. Instead she has locked canon down and continues to do so to this day through Cursed Child and Pottermore. It's like she just can't let go.
