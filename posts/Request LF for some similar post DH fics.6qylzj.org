I've been looking for some fics which are similar to linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10025439/1/Big-Brother-is-Listening-to-You]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/]]) in that there's not a massive amount of character bashing going on and that they're fairly comfy reads with something of a believable friendship developing between Harry & Draco. Don't have any particular pairing preferences (though Ginny's not a character I really enjoy reading ).

Any recommendations would be appreciated

  A new show on the Wizarding Wireless Network launches 5 years after the final battle. It will place 10 'celebrities' in a house together for 2 months. Friendships and romances will blossom, but rivalries threaten to rip them apart. Who will win 'Listen-In' and the prize of a thousand galleons that comes with it? AU post-DH, Rated M for language, sexual and sensitive themes.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.
