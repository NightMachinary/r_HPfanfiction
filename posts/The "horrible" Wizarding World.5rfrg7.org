In the past hour I've seen multiple comments mentioning how horrible the Wizarding World really is.

From Azkaban, to house elves, to goblins, discrimination, Dumbledore, Muggles and so on.

And I roll my eyes every time I read them. And since I don't feel like repeating myself again for a while I'm going to take all those points and beat them into the ground.

- Azkaban

Let's start off with this one.

#+begin_quote
  But Aegorm, the dementors are horrible beings. How dare you support the torture of inmates!
#+end_quote

Oh please, Azkaban is a prison for Wizards. Wandless magic exists, we see it when Quirrel curses Harry's broom and again in Fantastic Beasts. Even if you disregard the movies Harry still blows up Marge without his wand. Why wouldn't inmates be able to do such things? Some wizards can turn into animals, other can change appearance, Veela can throw fireballs and Hagrid can pop your head like a grape. And all of them can apparate.

Can you imagine trying to jail them without dementors? The only other wizarding prison mentioned is Nurmengard. And that one was created by Grindewald, a Dark Lord, to hold his enemies. I can't imagine that being much better than Azkaban.

- Sirius' trial (and the absence of it)

#+begin_quote
  Okay, you can't possibly defend this. This is a horrible example of the corrupt and unjust Wizarding world! They are so barbaric!
#+end_quote

Sirius was detained in 1981. During a 'War on Terror'. Did you guys just ignore the news the past few years? Does Guantanamo Bay ring any bells? Either way, allow me to give you all a quote from Wikipedia, I don't feel like actually looking up the relevant act.

#+begin_quote
  In 2004, the House of Lords ruled that indefinite detention of foreign terrorism suspects under section 23 of the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 violated the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights.[1] Under Schedule 8 of the Terrorism Act 2000, the detention of terrorism suspect may be increased upon application of a Warrant for further detention by a Crown Prosecutor (England & Wales), The Director of Public Prosecutions (NI), the Lord Advocate or procurator fiscal (Scotland), or a Police Superintendent (any part of the United Kingdom).[6]
#+end_quote

Let me quickly explain what that means. Before 2004 the UK allowed the imprisonment of foreign terrorists without a trial. Sirius was arrested in 1981.

Is it wrong? Sure, but then you look at the case of British resident Shaker Aamer, who was detained for 13 years and had been cleared for 8 years before he was finally released in 2015.

- House Elves

#+begin_quote
  Slavery! Horrible! Disgusting!
#+end_quote

Oh, Hermione... Okay, we know nothing about house elves and I can't take you seriously if you actually think this is a real issue. But here I go either way. House elves are based on Brownies. Not slavery, but Brownies. They are a race that enjoys what they do, but when they are mistreated they rebel. And that fits for both House elves and Brownies.

#+begin_quote
  Brownies are said to inhabit houses and aid in tasks around the house. However, they do not like to be seen and will only work at night, traditionally in exchange for small gifts of food. Among food, they especially enjoy porridge and honey. They usually abandon the house if their gifts are called payments, or if the owners of the house misuse them. Brownies make their homes in an unused part of the house, often in attics and holes in walls.
#+end_quote

Dobby is a name for Brownies in Yorkshire. They are not based on the enslavement of black people.

- Representation of other races in the Wizengammot

#+begin_quote
  It's unfair that centaurs and merpeople and goblins aren't in the government! They are sentient beings!
#+end_quote

Do you know what a liaison is? There is an Liaison office for Goblins mentioned in the books. The Centaur liaison office is mentioned in Fantastic Beasts. A liaison implies that they are not part of the government. That they are seperate. That they are in essence different countries. Centaurs, Goblins, Merpeople and Giants all have their own command structures and are seperate from the MoM. You don't see an American politician in the House of Lords do you? Why would they ever be in the Wizengammot.

#+begin_quote
  The Wizengammot is outdated! Hereditary government positions are outdated!
#+end_quote

Let me link you to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords]] The House of Lords consists of appointed and hereditary seats and it is a part of the Parliament of the UK. Before 1999 every hereditary peer had a seat. After 1999 it was restricted to only 92.

So yeah. The Wizengammot is fine as it is. It's the wizarding Parliament and in the 90's it was completely normal for every Lord to have a seat on it.

- Goblins

#+begin_quote
  They are forced to live under Gringotts and they aren't allowed to carry wands! They deserve better!
#+end_quote

Alright, first things first. They are vicious little buggers. Okay now that I said that let's start off by mentioning that Goblins can live where ever they want. I reread the books not too long ago and there was an interresting mention from a goblin visiting his family abroad or something like that and there isn't a single mention of them living under the bank.

Now, there is this little thing called Goblin Steel.

See how it isn't called 'Magic Steel' but Goblin Steel (Or silver if you want). Goblins keep their secret weapons for themselves so why would the wizards give a historically hostile nation their greatest weapon?

Anyway. I'm done for now. If you have any gripes with the Wizarding world then comment here and I'll put it in perspective because really, the Wizarding World isn't as backwards as your bashing fics make it out to be.

#+begin_quote
  Can you imagine trying to jail them without dementors?
#+end_quote

Well... yes. I mean, there are so many ways to imagine a wizarding prison without torture, I don't even know where to begin. Just to start I can imagine a place charmed to the brink and put under Fidelius. I don't know if a nation should be excused their torture-horror-prison because another option would be slightly more inconvenient.

The +Goblin+ Houselve slavery thing... Yeah, its cute that they're based of Brownies, but no matter what, the parallels to actual slavery is pretty scarring. Plus there doesn't seem to be a law against the mistreatment of them, so houseelves are even less protected than animals. They're obviously not animals. In the story they're thinking, feeling creatures with a sense of self.

The wizarding world is pretty horrible in many of its aspects. Arguing against that is just ignoring the lore. However, and that is something a lot of muggle-wank fics completely ignore, its not like the actual, real world is much better. The difference is that our torture prisons are called Guantanamo, our "houselves" live in de-facto slavery in Africa, our governments are corrupted, our wars on terror enable the same, inhuman "justice" and so on and so on and so forth.

I totally agree. The issue for me is that wizards have the tools to fix many tons of societal issues that we have, and yet their society does too. That's the issue I have with the wizarding world (it seems like wizards don't sensibly use magic), and it' s mostly a result of JK introducing magic in one book that accidentally solves problems addressed in another book.

Examples include courts [book 3] when truth-telling potion exists [book 4]. Or jails [book 3] when unbreakable vows exist [book 6].

*** The Fidelius wouldn't do much to keep someone in would it? But if you want to look at an easy escape just look at Harry and how he escaped in DH.

He was the highest priority target. And he basically walked out without any issues...

But if you can type out a decent idea to keep wizards locked up without dementors or fanon concepts then sure. Tell me, I'm actually interested.

House Elves. There is actually an Office for House-Elf relocation. So there is some sort of rules for them. And really, your argument about house elves is rather ridiculous. We don't know why they are bonded like that but it seems to be something about their species. It isn't indoctrination, Dobby could only truly fight back once he was officially freed. They are bound by magic. If Wizards actually did this then why didn't they do the same for the Goblins?

No, all the evidence points towards House elfs having some quirk that bonds them to other beings. It's rather pointless to keep arguing about this, because slavery is horrible, but can we put those views on house elves? I don't know.

There are however a few issues with that.

First. The secret keeper. There has been no mention of transfering the secret to another keeper so if the keeper were to die then there'd be some issues. Suddenly the guards can speak the secret, the visitors can and so on.

Second: Hermione brought someone into Grimmauld place by accident and immediately gave away the secret. Without even mentioning it or anything.

Third: I imagine that the door would be the only entrance/exit. So that begs the question, can someone be put into the prison without knowing the secret? Or would that, like Hermione did, give away the secret no matter what?

Not to mention the description we hear in POA is that Voldemort could have pushed his nose against the Potter's window and never find them. We don't know how literal this is but it could be evidence that they didn't hide their home but themselves. The fidelius is meant to hide a secret within the soul of someone.

The implication here is that the spell can be cast on things other than properties. The secret could have been "The Potter family lives at 17 This is Silly Lane, Godric's Hollow" which would have protected the family but not the property itself. Where we know the secret on Number 12 Grimmauld Place was for the property as well as the purpose it served.

Ah, I see. Well, it wasn't in the original books, so that is why I missed it. I haven't read "Fantastic Beasts", so I didn't catch that. Well, yeah, that makes much of my argument invalid. I mean, they're obviously still doing a shit job, but at least the idea is there. But goddamn, mate, watch your condescension. The fact remains that the way they were portrayed reminds of slavery. That argument isn't ridiculous by any stretch of the imagination. Did you know that much of the arguments Hermione received were also used during the enslavement of Africans? "They like serving us", "Thats their purpose",... For houseelves that may actually apply, but *no work of art is ever detached from reality*, making those arguments an the portrayal of houseelves a scarring parallel to slavery and especially slavery in the US. We can talk up and down about the theories and fanons of why houseelves are enslaved, but the comparison to real life issues remains valid.

And after that I'm really not in the mood for any creative worldbuilding, so no prison designs here.

2. The 'good guys', headed by Dumbledore, were so ineffective that they resorted to sacrificing children to save their world.

3. The government would use mental torture on anyone convicted of crime, regardless of degree. Your argument 'wizards could not be locked up without dementors' was pathetic and repugnant. There were wards and protections after all, and only few wizards could do wandless magic anyway. Imagine your relative went to that prison for a year because of property theft and came out a total gibbering wreck.

2. Prophecy. Dumbledore and Voldemort, the greatest wizards of their age put a lot of stock into it. This means that it is EXTREMELY likely that they are truly binding.

He felt bad for it but if he didn't do it then his world would be doomed. Because it was prophesied. He did the right thing.

3. Wards are actually never mentioned in the books. They are entirely a fanon creation. Only charms and enchantments. There is also no mention that theft or minor crimes result in an Azkaban sentence. To see how easy it is to break out without dementors just look at Harry and his friends in DH. The highest priority targets could escape without any issues... Sure, Wormtail is an idiot but if those 'wards' exist then how did they even have a chance to escape?

4. The first war lasted over a decade. Fudge fucked the second one up. Not even going to argue about that but Voldemort played the second war brilliantly. The killing of Dumbledore, the assassination of the minister and the systematic replacement of high ranking officials is just a great coup really.

Since the eventual means by which Voldemort took over was to put a handful of high-level officials under the Imperius Curse and kill off the (non-Imperiused) Minister, it's a ridiculous embarrassment that he didn't with the first war within a year. It's shocking that any nation of mages is ever /not/ in the control of a Dark Lord.

Yaxley said it was difficult, but really. Draco Malfoy was able to put an adult under the curse when he was sixteen. Surely a 50-year-old Voldemort could hold half a dozen people under, especially with the Death Eaters he had at the start of the first war.

I completely disagree with you about the prophecy being 'binding'. In HBP, Dumbledore himself said that prophecies were at best self-fulfilling.

Speaking of Dumbledore, this man was a great failure who ABSOLUTELY failed to live up to his reputation. I have complained many times before about his failures, so I won't bore you with more repetitions. But here some links:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/42lgoq/what_did_the_order_of_the_pheonix_actually_do/czb9jv4/][Why Dumbledore's failure was worse than Neville Chamberlain]]

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5kyfr0/did_you_change_your_preferences_or_pet_peeves/dbs7ne8/][Hogwarts' Abyssimal Safety Record]]: not always Dumbledore's fault, but he shared great responsibilities.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/5pfii6/stopping_lord_voldemort/dcqtijj/][Why Dumbledore's final plan was crap and his actions in HBP CRIMINALLY NEGLIGENT]]

Because of his ineffectiveness, he resorted to sacrificing children in desperation. I can only shake my head in how messed up magical Britain was.

--------------

Being a 'good person' didn't excuse a leader's failure. Both Neville Chamberlain and Herbert Hoover were considered 'good people', but they were abject failures in history, and Dumbledore should be remembered the same way.

Why?

If you mean that witches are not responsible for much besides child rearing, this forces women to be idle once they no longer have children.

If you mean that most of the responsibility for child rearing falls on witches, this only makes sense up until the kids are on solid food, and even then wizards can step in for a lot of the tasks. The number of years this occupies depends on how many kids a witch tends to have and how close together -- and we see a /lot/ of single-child families.

Add to that idea that all the long term people in prison have no chance at rejoining society, or at least so it seems based on the mental state of all escaped prisoners we are exposed to) and it paints a clear picture of vindictive punitive punishment, and at that point it is safer for your society to just execute them.

The Wizarding world is a problematic society, which is understandable since it cannot be competent, since it's run by adults in a chukdren's novel. And adults in children's novels are, by neccessity, evil, incompetent or both. Because otherwise the children that are the main characters wouldn't have to solve the world ending problems.

Sirius was unhinged for a while but rapidly recovered. And Bellatrix was probably crazy before she was arrested.

And the Wizarding world is surprisingly like the normal world. (Guantanamo bay/Azkaban, racism/blood purity)

The point of this post was that the wizarding world isn't this horrible place compared to the normal world. Wizards aren't backwards idiots compared to 'mundanes' like so many people seem to believe. They are extremely similar.

**** I mean...I would argue the acceptance of Azkaban by the normal population implies a less moral society than our own. Yes guantanamo exists, the populace of the US by and large dislikes this fact, and would be up in arms if every prison were like it.

We don't know how long Barry was actually in prison for I don't think, and he is definately slightly unhinged. Sirius is specifically noted as having been able to mitigate the effects of dimentors with his animagus form, and he was still heavily impacted. I would argue he wasn't all that recovered, but I will accept that is personal opinion. Hagrid spent weeks, maybe a month or two in Azkaban, hardly evidence one way or another We have no evidence that Bellatrix was or was not that insane prior to azkaban. She definately was off her rocker though.

Regardless, I stand by the second half of my post. In order for kids to be protagonists, adults have to fall short on almost all occasions, and the Wizarding world in the novels is a symptom of that.

** Just adding fuel to the fire; in Chapter 33 of Order of the Phoenix, Umbridge's dialogue indicates that centaurs are considered creatures under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Magic, and that they're 'allocated' parts of land rather than having their own territory.

Also, there's clause 3 of the Code of Wand Use, in Chapter 9 of Goblet of Fire; Amos Diggory mentions that non-human creatures aren't permitted to carry or use wands. The only way that would be enforceable is if the Ministry of Magic granted itself rulership over the other magical creatures rather than letting them live independently.

  Azkaban is the only way to hold prisoners who can use wandless magic
#+end_quote

Nurmengard?

Life imprisonment in Azkaban doesn't seem better than a death sentence. Instead of a quick death, you get a drawn-out death with insanity in the meantime.

How prevalent wandless magic is is debatable.

Fandom tends to view wandless magic as straightforward to learn, just rarely attempted. Under that framework, it makes sense that it's hard to hold a prisoner.

If wandless magic is extremely difficult or impossible, it's far less urgent to guard against it.

In canon, the Carrows viewed Dumbledore as helpless without a wand. Remus Lupin /may/ have conjured flames without a wand, or perhaps the book simply didn't bother to mention that he used his wand. Similarly, in Philosopher's Stone, the narrative doesn't specify that Snape uses his wand while counter-cursing Potter's broom. Tom, the bartender at the Leaky Cauldron, may have been able to ignite fire with a snap of his fingers, or he may have enchanted his fireplace to light when he snapped his fingers.

*** Good points all around.

Nurmengard: I actually disregard this because it was made by a Dark Lord to hold his prisoners of war. I can't imagine this being any better than Azkaban.

I view wizards without their wands as an old black powder pistol compared to an AR if they have their wands. Those inmates are still armed in a sense and they can still cause great damage. Can you imagine trying to jail Bellatrix Lestrange when she isn't under influence of the dementors?

This post has also been slightly misunderstood. While Azkaban and Sirius his trial are both horrible issues, they aren't actually just Magical issues. The wizarding world isn't this horrible place compared to the muggle world. It's the same as the muggle world.

House elf slavery: There actually is an Office of House Elf Relocation.

Liaisons: House elfves are subservient. I can't imagine them on a government because they have no self interests.

Canon never specifies borders actually and that is a rather weak argument. Centaurs live in a forest, don't seem to use their currency, they have their own command structure and have no regard for the MoM's authority. If you don't call that a seperate, if primitive, government then I don't know what it is.

There have been treaties between Goblins and Wizards. If this doesn't imply that they are in fact seperate states then I don't know what is.

Wands: Would the USA give their advanced weaponry to North Korea? There is a difference between not giving away your superior technology to a hostile nation and forbidding another countries' citizens from buying their own weapons.

Your example would be more like not allowing Goblins to carry their swords.

That's a "it's not /that/ bad" thesis. The misunderstandings are entirely your fault.

As for it not being much worse than the Muggle UK, consider it from a perspective of injustices per capita. Also consider that it's easier to ignore distant injustices than nearby injusticies.

I grew up in a town of 8,000 people. If we operated a prison of despair, if we had a mayor who ordered two different people to be executed on sight, if we had dozens or hundreds of slaves, if we had another race of people who were not allowed tools that everyone else used to make everything in their life easier (perhaps they need to use gasoline generators rather than the electric grid?) -- that would be a much more present set of problems.

We /do/ see that the nation containing Hogwarts polices the Forest of Dean and Little Hangleton. We see that it has citizens residing in Cornwall, Scotland, London, Wiltshire, and the Highlands.

Every human has a wand. Every human can purchase a wand. Wands have been around on the British Isles for two thousand years. Wands are in use throughout Europe and the Americas. Wands are tools with many purposes and not specifically weapons. Goblins control what Hagrid refers to as /the/ wizard bank and have for 125 years, peacefully, at the start of the series. The amount of damage you can do with one wand is much closer to the damage you can do with one pistol than with cruise missiles or other modern military munitions. The USA gives advanced weapons to Saudi Arabia.

So your analogy kind of sucks.

But that requires collusion across many nations and many wandmakers. It only takes one wandmaker succumbing to the siren song of a giant pile of money (or a sword pointed at their throat) for the secret to get out. And that /also/ doesn't lead to it being illegal for goblins to /carry/ a wand -- Neville Longbottom could purchase and carry a wand, but he couldn't build one.

You know nothing about how hard it is to imprison wizards and you have no idea whether Dementors are required to ensure it. There are many ways that our worldy prisons could be made safer for the guards and better prevent escapes (like starving the inmates or nailing them to the walls), but we still don't do it because it's inhumane.

Exposure to Dementors seems very much like torture - even if it were required to imprison them it might still be wrong to use Dementors. The Veil might be more humane in such a case.

** In Order of the Phoenix, it is more or less explicitly stated that Fudge (or the Ministry) has control over the Daily Prophet, and he is able to use it for his own personal ends. The Prophet is one of only three publications mentioned in the series (the others being the Quibbler and Witch Weekly, neither of which are exactly on par with the New York Times in terms of journalism). If there were a major competitor to the Daily Prophet, it would most likely have come up during this plot line, as Hermione resorts to reading it for information despite knowing it is full of lies. This suggests that the de-facto state run newspaper has a total media monopoly over the country, which should be extremely troubling. Look at how easily Fudge managed to turn the entire country against Harry and Dumbledore, two of the most respected wizards in the country.

There is also a massive amount of casual corruption at the Ministry. In Goblet of Fire, Winky is caught with a wand after the Quidditch World Cup. What's more is that this wand was shown to have cast the Dark Mark. This should be cause for an investigation, and the elf should be subjected to questioning. However, because Crouch is a high ranking Ministry official, he is allowed to block any investigation because he doesn't want to look bad. In Chamber of Secrets, Dumbledore states that members of the Board of Governors were under the impression that their families would be in danger if they did not vote to remove him. Lucius Malfoy threatens and intimidates people to get his way, and other than being removed from the board, he doesn't really suffer at all. In OoTP, Umbridge apparently has the authority to order dementors to attack minors, and there is never an investigation that discovers this. Later in OoTP, Fudge agrees to allow a muggle-baiter to walk in return for ratting out a defence group run by 15-year-olds. Both Dexter Fortesque and McGonagall comment on the morality of this, but it never seems to have any consequences. Malfoy (and many other death eaters) managed to not only escape punishment for their crimes, but also keep positions of power withing wizarding society. Malfoy is on the Board of Governors, i.e. he has control over the daily lives of children, and MacNair has a job at the ministry. They may have claimed to be under the imperius curse, but convicting them should just be a simple matter of administering Veritaserum.

On the topic of crime and punishment, there's a lot that you're missing. For one thing, Sirius was detained after the fall of Voldemort, so the War on Terror was over. Secondly, we see other people get trials, so it's not like the Ministry was incapable of doing this. In the pensieve chapter, Karkaroff gets a trial, and even the Lestranges are tried before the Wizengamot. Sirius states that Crouch was the one who put him in Azkaban without trial, which implies that the head of the DMLE has the authority to unilaterally deny inmates habeaus corpus. Secondly, the US government cannot imprison American citizens in Guantanamo, and in the quote you give it states that the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 was ruled a violation of human rights. Guantanamo is unjust in real life, and Azkaban manages to be even worse. Also, why is Azkaban the only prison? Hagrid is sent there when he is believed to be attacking students, without much of an investigation taking place. Podmore is sent there for trying to break into the Department of Mysteries. His sentence lasts six months, which raises even more questions. Azkaban drives people insane, a fact that is acknowledged within the story. If you are going to give someone a sentence less than life, the recidivism rate must be through the roof. Knowing how Azkaban affects people, why would you ever send someone there if you had any intention of letting them out? Why is there no punishment ever shown other than Azkaban? Surely breaking into the DoM isn't a crime comparable to torture and murder.

On the topic of Azkaban, I find it hard to believe that the only way to make sure prisoners are held is by having and army of literal demons keep them in a constant state of mental torture. Nurmengard has no dementors, and it manages to hold one of the most powerful wizards of all time.

At the end of Goblet of Fire, Fudge has Crouch kissed by a dementor. Summary execution is generally frowned upon, especially in civilian contexts. Remember, Fudge at this point is denying that Voldemort has returned, so, for all intents and purposes, this is peacetime. The Minister apparently is allowed to act as judge, jury, and executioner when he wishes to.

Umbridge, while lecturing the Centaurs, states that they live where they are because they are allowed to live there, which implies that the Ministry has, or at least claims, authority over the Centaurs. It is also mentioned that Umbridge tried to create a merpeople registry, which means they have a similar attitude towards them. When Hagrid describes meeting with the Giants, he says that Karkus respects Dumbledore because he argued against killing the last of the British giants. Not only were the giants, a sentient species, eradicated, but dissent against this policy was rare enough that Dumbledore was notable for opposing it. As for house-elves, regardless of what they are based on Wizarding Society has a complete disregard for their health, safety, and well-being. Malfoy feels comfortable enough mistreating Dobby to hit him in public, meaning that this kind of treatment towards elves is not cause for concern among most people. At the very least, beating house elves should be illegal, regardless of whether or not the institution itself is just.

Then there are the implications of the possible uses of magic. Fred and George sell love potions in their store, and nobody seems to think this is a big deal. In HBP, there is a chapter where Romilda Vane tries to date-rape Harry, but accidentally roofies Ron instead. She is never punished for this, and the ease with which she managed it means that these should be highly restricted potions, not something sold in stores and taught in sixth-year potions class.

Some positions within it (or rather, reporting to it) are appointed to the young'uns, but the actual membership is full of wizards and witches with a long history of being wise enough or at least popular enough to merit being nominated to that August body.

** Just want to address one specific aspect of this. You're wrong about the Lords' (now the supreme court's) decision from 2004. The decision was to declare as incompatible with the human rights act of 1997 the clause from the 2000 anti terrorism act re: indefinite detention, itself strictly construed; the principle behind that, the right to fair trial, is based on Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights, to which the UK agreed to follow in 1950. The clause in question was quickly amended on the basis of this decision in the Lords following the Belmarsh 9 case. At most you can say that a law found to be unlawful allowed for limited powers of unlimited detention for 4 years before those powers were ordered to be revoked. Not to mention that habeas corpus has been around for literally almost a thousand years and is still a pretty big deal in making sure that people don't just disappear into the justice system :P

Similarly, imprisonment in Azkaban would be a direct violation of the Article 3 right not to be tortured; again violations of this have been able to be successfully challenged at Strasbourg since the passage of the ECHR.

It's also bobbins to say that the Lords have had any overriding authority since 1911 where its power to defeat a bill was removed. This vs the wizengamot which in any case seems to combine judiciary and legislature, again a huge no no! Plenty of ground, in other words, to call the wizarding world back-asswards .

They have no sense of time by which they will suffer from the isolation and be forced to ponder the depths of their mistake. Instead it's like being cryogenically preserved.

What is the goal of prison to you then? Make them suffer, removing them from society, or rehabilitating them? Azkaban does the first, turning them into animals does the second. And wizards have the means to do the third.

I definitely think it exasperates certain mental instabilities that are pre-existing in these characters due to genetics or cultish belief, but I can't see that reliving your worst memories over and over and over - not just visually, but emotionally as well - doesn't break someone, even the tiniest amount.

As for the dumbing down - the interactions between Fudge, Scrimegeour and Thickenese [spelling is probably totally off, I'm too lazy to google it properly atm] towards their Muggle PM counterparts - comments on how wizards treat non-magicals (think of Ron's "we have a cousin who is an accountant, but we don't talk about him much") or even Arthur's position as Head of Misuse of Muggle Artifacts and yet he can't pronounce things he's supposed to be an 'expert' in. There's also the incredible lack of positive non-magicals in the series, with only the Dursleys being representative of non-magical characters.

It is my opinion - and it can certainly be wrong - that in order for wizards to look righteous, or good, or competent, then their non-magical counterparts need to look less efficient, less kind, less competent, in order to establish the wizarding world as somewhere desirable for Harry, and by extension, the readers. I mean, Hagrid's idea of [paraphrased] "if muggles knew we'd exist and could do things, they'd want easy quick solutions to everything" seems a bit generalized, does it not? Magic itself seems, for the most part, very much like short cuts especially in regard to chores (I'd argue against my own point regarding spells like Fidelius and the like).

**** The prisoner may only gain have intelligence of the animals they transform into, but nothing suggest that they wouldn't be aware of their surrounding and wouldn't remember their time as an animal. I suspect it would be more like a non pleasent imperius curse where they act like an animal. It wouldnt allow them to regret their deeds during their imprisonment, but honestly few prisons actually do that and it would definitely protect the population from dangerous criminals. there is also a high deterrence capability for very proud people( can you imagine voldemort reacting after spending 50 years as some jellyfish) I am not sure if transfiguration can be naturally spelled of but i doubt so otherwise their would have been no point in creating the Quintapeds at all. their enemies wouldn't have cursed them if they didn't think it wouldn't be permanent

Being transformed into a turtle for 30 years... Isn't that just as bad as dementors? Like, can you imagine being a turtle for a few years?

Second point. Transforming someone into an animal is possible, we see that in GoF. But the Animagus transformation can be done without a wand. Wouldn't turning back into a human be easier then turning into your animagus form? I don't know, and I like your idea but I don't think it would work.

Thirty years of utter despair, reliving your worst memories, compared to thirty years of dysphoria and lack of communication. I think either would be devastating and both are inhumane.

On the other hand, if I were choosing which to experience, I would definitely go for turtle. And for a shorter sentence, being a turtle is obviously more humane.

** I'm taking the other species at face value rather than a metaphor for racism in the real world (we already have the blood discrimination to represent that). They are quite literally not human. Some of them are also hostile, like the goblins with whom the wizards went to war in the past. In a war between humans and another species, I'd support our side, no questions asked. Think of them as alien invaders from outer space if that helps.

** I made a post about this on [[/r/harrypotter]] a while back. The number of fanfics that go on and on about how awful the wizarding world is and how Muggles could easily completely destroy them gets on my nerves. Wizards definitely have issues, but I don't think everything is so black and white. I imagine Muggles could pose a serious threat if they found out about wizards, but I also think Wizards could hold their own against Muggles. There's only so much that can be explained about the Wizarding world in the actual books before it would mess with the flow of the story, so I understand why some stuff isn't fully explained, but even with what is given to us, it's not that hard to use your imagination if you want to really get into that topic.

Anyway, that's not what you're talking about. I think that Wizards definitely seem to oppress magical creatures, and this is not ok no matter what justifications are made for it. They might have "good" reasons, but oppressing entire races is pretty not good. It makes it seem like Wizards are superior to other magical creatures, which doesn't seem to be the case. Who cares if Goblins are dangerous? Let them live their lives like normal magical beings without restricting them. Like you said, they seem to have their own government and everything. Unless they start hurting Muggles or Wizards, I say let them do their thing- even if that means giving them a wand. Wands are only there to help control magic, so it's probably pretty inconvenient for Goblins and other magical creatures to not have access to wands.

While I'll agree on Sirius being arrested was a bad but plausible thing when they were at war, Azkaban itself seems unnecessarily harsh. I imagine it wouldn't be too difficult to commission the best wizards to set up some of the strongest wards possible. Remember the curses on the Black family home? I bet they could cast some curses on the prison to keep anyone from trying to escape, or something. Really, anything other than the soul-sucking demon ghosts, which seem to be a bit of a cop out. Maybe the Ministry was too cheap to use actual magic to keep the magic prisoners in their magic prison?

I'll half agree on the house elves. What do you do with a race that want to work without pay? I think it's cruel to enslave them like the Malfoys did, but it's also cruel to suddenly release them into the world like Hermione tried. House elves want to work for people, and it seems to be a big part of their culture. Hermione bascically ran in telling them their culture and traditions were wrong. But I think she's got a point. I think maybe house elves want to work without pay, but after years of mistreatment became used to being subservient creatures that wear nothing but rags and obey their master's every word or they hurt themselves. So I think in a perfect world, House elves would be paid and wear whatever they want, and would have rights (can't "own" them or hurt them), but they also get to work and clean like they love.

*** Oh, don't get me wrong. Azkaban is horrible. But Guantanamo Bay is just as bad and unlike wizard inmates the inmates from GB aren't that dangerous. So while it is still wrong, it is 't as if the muggles are any better. And in bashin fics it's always mentioned how backwards wizards and witches are. And how 'mundanes would never do such things, they grew past it'.

The Black family home is cursed horribly and putting those curses on a prison is probably not a great idea either. It would be dangerous for the guards and having your skin melt when you try to escape is pretty inhumane as well.

It's just that if you think about it, wizard inmates are still armed. Sure, they don't have their wand but they can still be dangerous. They might not have a machine gun but they still got a pistol.

As long as there have to be wizard guards then the prison isn't safe imo. Imagine trying to hold Bellatrix Lestrange when she is completely sane and not under the influence of a dementor.

Should petty criminals end up in Azkaban? No, but we don't know if they actually do. But Death Eaters are just fucking dangerous even without their wands.

** My headcanon actually has the Wizarding World as more egalitarian than we give them credit for. In a world where the only sort of superiority is based on actual(if bad), logic, we see female Ministers, black students, and a gay leader of society. Despicable though it is, the idea of blood purity being a deciding factor in social relations isn't that out there. In terms of magic, wizards are superior to muggles, and there is no denying that. Therefore, the idea of muggleborns being lesser than pure bloods is not that out there, and makes more sense than some of the other prejudices in our world. Also keep in mind the political situation. For decades, the Wizarding World has been terrified in a tense truce with the Muggle governments, and it isn't as though their relations with the creature governments are that good. The obvious equivalent being how we viewed Russians during the Cold War. Of course Muggleborns are treated with fear and suspicion that they may be a spy or turn against them. And because of the Statute of Secrecy, the Wizarding World is constantly taking in immigrants from a nation that it is at odds with, and those immigrants have no understanding of the culture, with a large amount of loyalty to their home nation. Yes, that situation is detestable, but given the actions during the Cold War, we cannot hope to hold the moral high ground, not with our own history of rampant McCarthyism and nasty habit of messing with other governments we don't like(I am American if you haven't noticed yet). Frankly, the majority of the fanfiction community are a bunch of Muggles, and it shows.

We see a leader of society who never married, where the author claims after the fact -- once it's too late to impact book sales and tie-ins, in a venue that most people will ignore -- that he was gay.

It's as canon as Hermione being black. The text doesn't say otherwise, and I'm free to make it my headcanon, but that's about it.
