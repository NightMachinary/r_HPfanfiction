Is there anything out there about the students back in Hogwarts during the year that Harry and co are out Horcrux hunting? Preferably Neville- or Luna-centric and if possible, completed.

I'm on mobile, so I can't flair.

**** It's been a long time since I read it - I remember the sexism, what was the racism?

... Not doubting it was there, in retrospect that was a trashfire
