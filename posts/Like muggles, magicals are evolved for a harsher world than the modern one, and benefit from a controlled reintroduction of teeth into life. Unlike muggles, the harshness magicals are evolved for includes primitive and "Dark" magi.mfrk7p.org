There's an idea floating around, in various formats, that a lot of our body systems expect bad things to happen to us and won't function optimally if they don't, and that in modernizing the world, we've prevented some useful bad events. The suggestion is that the following things, among others, function to reintroduce these bad events in a controlled way, for people who need or want them:

- Digestive bitters, heirloom vegetables, and wild food sources: The idea is that we need some bitter alkaloids in food for hormetic effect, but we've bred these all out of our modern crops for taste reasons (e.g., modern corn)
- Exercise: modern technology would let you live life with minimal exercise, but then your muscles would break down and stop working, and you'd get sick and die
- Violent sports and video games: we evolved in a world where people hurt each other a lot, and it's interesting that as soon as we could get away from that, we started seeking out ways to safely act out violence on consenting or fictional people.
- Fiction: we seek out stories about things we'd never want to happen to us in real life, because they let us safely explore extremes of emotion
- [NSFW example] BDSM: lets people safely explore violence and power imbalance in a sexual context, because those definitely happened a lot in pre-modern times, and if they were universal turn-offs, we wouldn't be here to have this discussion today.

Anyway, I think a hormetic effect of primitive and/or Dark magic in this vein would be an interesting thing to put in a story. Maybe a character starts experimenting with small sacrificial rituals and feels healthier or more in tune with their magic. Maybe someone looking at actuarial data finds that people who experienced more accidental magic in childhood live longer. Maybe Voldemort regains some sanity after cursing the Defense Professor position, having used up his irrational anger to fuel the curse. Or something else.

** Hmm. I might look at it another way: Other than dark magic in general, what threats were the early wizards facing? Dragons? Harpies? Horrors from other worlds/dimensions? Demons? Maybe just magic itself used to be a lot more chaotic and now that it's settled modern wizards are lacking that needed conflict that once resonated within them.
