I read a fic on ff.net a while ago and apparently didn't favorite it. Now I can't seem to find it again. It takes place at Grimmauld Place. Hermione is fighting with PTSD after her encounter with Bellatrix at Malfoy Manor . Draco shows up missing his hand with his mother. He's held prisoner for a while, falls in love with Hermione, and fights for the Order. Anyone know this fic?


** I think it is this.

Also, is it any good, I'm only a few chapters in?

*** Yes! This is it! Thank you, thank you! I did like it. There are parts when it gets frustratingly angsty, but overall a great story.
