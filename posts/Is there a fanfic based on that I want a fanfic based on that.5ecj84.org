** Two things.

Voldemort's head looks hilarious and totally looks like a pistachio nut.

And Hulk in the third last panel somehow looks EXACTLY like Danny Radcliffe.

  Harry Potter, Hogwarts student, the Boy-Who-Lived, fighting to save Hermione Granger's life. Then an accidental exposure to troll blood alters his body chemistry... (It's not a complete crossover, but I think it's close enough to be of interest to Hulk fans.)
