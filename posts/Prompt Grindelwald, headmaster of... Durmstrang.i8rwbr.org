Lets say for the sake of simplicity that Grindelwald never grew to the power he did in canon. Maybe he's on his way there, Dumbledore still duels him, but the death toll is lessened or his methods differ enough that he's able to avoid life imprisonment in Nurmengard. So by the time the books take place he's still a bit of a household name, a bogeyman story, but he is also... currently the headmaster of Durmstrang?

We know from the books that Durmstrang is considered pretty shady, and Karkaroff, a death eater, is the headmaster in canon. Lets extend our imaginations and pretend a Grindelwald who was stopped a few years earlier could take that position --- he's skilled, he's leadership material, and it's a good way to tie him down. Karkaroff can be dead or something I don't know.

Getting to the actual prompt: during Harry's fourth year, the triwizard tournament is held at Hogwarts. Beauxbatons and Durmstrang are both in attendance, and with the latter is their notorious headmaster, who several parents complained about being let in in the first place.

When you're suddenly stuck at your ex boyfriends school for a year, it's bound to get heated. What follows is either a ridiculously serious fic about forgiveness and finding love at age 115 and all that, OR a romcom with a side of Voldemort. Students take bets. Harry is oblivious. Voldemort + Crouch Jr are intentionally or unintentionally foiled by these goings on. McGonagall refuses to attend the wedding.

Anyway, LF a fic like this if it exists, and if not feel free to go wild!


** You'd have to retcon the whole expelled from Durmstrang thing as well.

*** It makes sense for the change to start there in the first place, to be entirely fair. I see this as not really being a problem.

Gellert keeps his experiments on the down-low, never getting caught doing anything expulsion-worthy. He learns more subtle, less forceful ways of getting what he wants, because he's around the more politically-inclined students for longer.

Eventually, he graduates from Durmstrang. Because he doesn't brute-force certain things and learned copious ways of abusing legal loopholes, they can't pin enough atrocities from his campaign for world-domination on him personally to give him a life sentence or bar him from positions of authority.

In turn, upon his release he goes for a teaching position, and eventually gets promoted to Headmaster.
