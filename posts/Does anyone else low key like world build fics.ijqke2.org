Basically the protagonist, usually Harry, tearing down or even just building a completely independent society? E.g. abolishing and rebuilding ministry, or a magical moon colony, or sky cities, or sci-fi crossovers w galactic civilizations. They are usually highly political and only the best ones have some semblance of plot, but essentially they are just a narrator saying “look what magic can do when you aren't idiots” and then also of course lots of original content (or not so original content for some cross overs).


** Low key? Try High Key. Though I haven't found many that I enjoyed in the Hpfanfiction sphere. If you have any recommendations I'd love to have them.

*** I have read a few, maybe I can count them on one hand, that were worth it. Most don't get completed, by way of not having an actual plot, but there are a few goodies to be found. The secret is in the crossovers.

** I'm writing one at the moment with Harry and Neville building a community/small village! I love finding good fics with that aspect of magic being explored.

** I think a better descriptor is probably empire building, rather than world building. There's a couple like this that I've enjoyed -

non crossover-

- linkao3(24850216) pretty good, updates weekly. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24850216/chapters/60115636]]

- a certain Noodlehammer fic that I don't believe I'm allowed to link here. Say what you will about this guys admittedly horrible opinions, but his empire building and magic systems stuff is top notch. Just search for the user Noodlehammer on fanfiction.net, it's his only HP only story.

crossover-

- linkao3(4629198) pretty good, though I think most of the crossover elements here are unnecessary. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4629198/chapters/10555032]]

- linkffn(13569941) I don't think there was really a big focus on the empire building, but they touched upon it a bit. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13569941/1/What-s-a-Gungan]]

If you're interested in Game of Thrones fanfiction of a similar type, I've found the following to be good-

- linkffn(13496554) star wars x GoT, good empire building [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13496554/1/Song-of-A-Northern-Sorcerer]]

- the sequel to the above stated Noodlehammer fic that I'm not allowed to link to. Same issues, if not worse than his previous fic, but again great world building.

Edit to add -

- Xerosis by Batsutousai. Personally, I think this fic is garbage, could barely make it through. Plus HP/LV slash is just... dumb. Regardless, it does still have some degree of empire building a magical moon base, towards the end, so I guess it counts. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/209494/chapters/313282]]

** Try Invincible. 2012 crossover where the radiation is especially deadly to magicals. Good portion of the fic is Harry leading a team to invent magical interstellar travel to survive. Then they run into Cylons. linkffn(13161929)

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.

*** Right now I'm reading linkffn(Blindness) and it's great, contains a lot of political influence and weird magic; there's definitely a light plot but it's somewhat slow to unfold, but even so I'd recommend it
