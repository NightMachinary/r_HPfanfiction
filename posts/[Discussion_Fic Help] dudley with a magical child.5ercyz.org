I just thought of this and when I searched the sub, I didn't find much of a result so here goes: I had the thought of writing a short fic wherein Dudley's child is magical. This could be written 2 different ways though. Either from the Dursleys' side (Dudley dealing with his parents' reactions, awkwardly seeking out Harry, and being the out-of-place muggle parent) or from the Potters' side (Harry being contacted that his niece/nephew is "like him", Harry trying to balance between helping Dudley and guiding his niece/nephew to tread the 2 world they now live in, and perhaps Dudley/his wife's constant worry that their child will leave them forever). What I'm wondering though is should I write these concepts as separate fics, or do you think all these issues could be juggled in one story without it feeling all over the place? Also, I can't decide whether the emphasis of the plot should fall with the adults or with the kids. Would a series be necessary?

Just as well, I'm open to any ideas that a reader might like to see. The plot bunny only hit me a few moments ago, so I haven't fleshed out many details yet.

*Edit: It's driving me nuts that my post title was capitalized when writing it and now it isn't. I know how to capitalize, dang it!

  Either from the Dursleys' side [...] or from the Potters' side

Why not both? A bit of incestuous mpreg never hurt anyone.

I'll show myself the door.

  It's twenty one years later and for the sake of his daughter, Dudley is going to have to learn about the Wizarding World after all.

** I'd rather see them both together as a reader, if you can do it without repeating too much information. Like if there's a phone conversation between Dudley and Harry not showing the whole thing from both POV's or re-quoting large swaths of every single chapter just to get the other person's emotions about each line. If you feel you need to do that, by all means make two stories.

But people do write changing POV stories all the time so it should totally be possible.
