Just an idea for a bit of fun. So while Ron was just a young player in PS, he's gotten much, /much/ better. Harry is only a bit worse than Ron, but has no context, and just thinks he's a slightly better than average player. They play at something like the international master level, and occasionally they play challenges, like playing as fast as possible or playing minus pieces. and when they play, the entire common room watches and occasionally bets.

When they play, the entire common room watches and bets on the winner, at least for their big games. There's a running board in the common room with their wins and losses, and no one from any other house will play them anymore. Hermione finds it infuriating that it's the only thing they're willing to put effort into outside of quidditch and faking divination.


** I like this idea!! I might borrow it.

Especially if they're playing chess in their 6th year. If Harry has learned all his chess skills from Ron for the last 6 years then I should hope Harry gets good at chess...

It'd be fun to write snippits of each year. Ron casually correcting Harry's moves, not teaching him on purpose just pointing things out out of habit and Harry learning by accident.

Then by the time they get to 6th year, Harry is on an almost equal par to Ron and doesn't even realise it because he's never played anyone else... Then he plays Seamus or something and wins in like 6 moves and is surprised at himself... And Hermione is both smug and annoyed they can get good at this but not homework.

And Ron is in disbelief going "Oh shit I've created a monster..."

*Edit :: When I do write this I'm calling it "The Wizards Gambit".* It's the best name I've ever come up with for a fic, I'm shit at names and I may just write this just to use the title.

Students meeting up at 2am in an abandoned dungeon classroom charmed to keep people from hearing them to run a chess tournament, McGonagall showing up as a cat and even though everyone knows it's her nobody says anything. Students placing bets on the chess players, dueling over the outcomes etc.

***** And other board games! Ravenclaws would /love/ Dungeons and dragons for its deep lore, as would Slytherins (likely for different reasons, though) if you could but get them to try it! (I suggest saying it's a super secret ritual from the Sacred Four that even the Sacred 28 never heard about XD) The more casual players from all Houses would love to play Catan and Carcassone and all that, and in all likelihood would invent magical varieties (like putting the cards for the bank in a certain place on the table and they get magicked to the bank, and over a certain point cards would beg to be played), which Hermione would help by. They'd ask Luna too, as her spellwork is good (remember the lion hat?) but she'd add nonsensical things like cards to get a CrumpleHorned whatever it is, making the card flash the players colors' and have the builders card talk like a market stall guy (â€˜wood and stone for a street everyone! Wood and stone for a street! C'on, it's a good deal! Expand! Try to have the biggest one for one whole shiny extra point! Makes the difference between winning and losing!') so that's not considered a big success. They consider Fred and George, but they shudder at what Fred and George would do to the boards and pieces.

**** I think they could stretch it to around 1500-1600, but more likely on the 1400 level. Wizards wouldn't have access to modern chess computers and theory, especially in a game that's a little different from the modern game.

There are 12 year old grandmasters, but that's with a lot of modern training. When I played in middle school in a big metro area, the top local players were around 1500-1600 rated. These were kids who were doing a lot of chess training with a coach, but still going to school like Harry or Ron would.

Even if Harry or Ron had GM-level talent, I think this is probably the limit for them at that point considering they'd be learning from books and playing each other. If their talent was more on the level of those local kids, we'd probably be talking 1200-1300 ish with the resources they have. Maybe in fifth or sixth year they could get up to 1600-1800.

edit: I guess Paul Morphy was probably around 1900-2000 at age 12, but again, he was basically at a chess club 24/7, had a lot of skilled players to learn from, etc.

***** Chess is canonically one of the only hobbies that Wizards have. They canonically have the ability to make chess pieces sentient, /they can make their own chess coaches/. Why not? Assuming massive weaknesses in the process, a grandmaster level player could probably make a GM level "computer". On the topic of Wizards not knowing modern theories, if Wizards aren't keeping up with the game then they aren't guaranteed to be playing the same game as some of the biggest rules in chess weren't finalized until long after the Statute of Secrecy.

So here's a question. How good could two kids with "GM-Level talent" assuming modern book learning, chess computers, and extremely high determination get?

My vote is for 2000-2200 which is a CM in the USCF. I am being generous in assuming that they could get to master level at all, but plenty of people got to master before the internet or any of the bits and bobs that make learning so much easier today.

Another idea: McG's chess set plays just above your level to annoy you (that feels like the sort of thing it might have been meant to do to Voldemort.) So Harry and Ron use it as one of their practice methods.

******* I guess they don't need to be 'sentient', but I imagine the producer ensured they understood the rules of chess. Quite possibly there is a loyalty mechanism involved because Seamus' set didn't work well Harry. It could just as be an intended perk ("chaos causing chessmen: perfect to prank your friends").

Wands aren't sentient but they do feedback to their owner.

Most likely the chess sets are somewhat analogous to a computer with different "software" (charms) being capable of difficulty range adjustments based off plays, complexity of plays supported, child-friendly/sweary/formal, etc.

Harry could easily buy a top of the range set to learn the wizarding rules. Then Ron could be tempted into trying the other colour pieces.

A sentient being is capable of experiencing the world through its senses. Sapient beings are capable of wisdom of thought. Neither of these terms precludes something which fakes intelligence. You can both be right. And I think you are.

A chess-playing computer is sentient. It's capable of taking in information. The computer doesn't do wisdom though so it wouldn't be considered sapient. It just runs an algorithm to determine the best move. Of course, this is a heavily debated topic, this is just the most recent 'conclusions'

*** Speaking just on the mind magic that wouldn't make much sense. If I had full access to a person's thoughts I would remember the thoughts even if I didn't know where they came from. So if Harry played consistently against Ron and unintentionally read his mind, he would play like Ron. If he played against someone worse he would just play like Ron. Even if saw what someone else thought was the best move, he'd still be able to compare it to his strategies from his higher play level experience. Say if someone taught me not to sacrifice pawns unless I got something in return as a pawn can be quite useful in the endgame, and another person taught me that pawns are worthless and just clutter the board, so I might as well get them out of the way. I would know both thought processes but would use the former as I know it is the better mindset.

***** Well, I operated under the idea of the Harry in question being unaware but his mind on some level translating the new thoughts and feelings. For example, if there was no processing Harry rather than playing well against opponents, would instinctually do the worst things possible, because without processing if Ron thought a move was bad, Harry would read the move as good, as Ron's gut feeling of "Yes!" would transfer to Harry.

And if it translated on an emotional level Bad for Harry = Good for Harry, he'd have the equivalent of a shock collar against mistakes. The problem is that different people have different thought processes. If Dean is a middling player, then Dean is far more likely to make mistakes. Dean would miss the right moves for Harry to take, possible responses against those moves, and possible strategies he could have used. So against Dean, those instincts would prove useless and Harry would probably stop trusting them and would have to play while ignoring his gut as it would have steered him wrong again and again. Thus putting him back at square one.

However, if Harry assimilated the thoughts in a manner like "This move would cause 1, 2, and 3" with the /ideas/ behind the moves rather than Ron's emotional response. To Harry, it would read more as an understanding of causality, than an unknown emotional response. He would be unaware of the origin of this information, but would now have access to it.
