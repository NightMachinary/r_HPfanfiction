The Man Who Lived

Mr. and Mrs. Harry Potter lived on Potter Lane, in the small, windswept village of Godric's Hollow. Their house was average-sized but comfortable and on the outskirts of the village, overlooking Lake Ariana.\\
At first glance, there is nothing interesting about this home in the quiet corner of Britain. Mr. and Mrs. Potter have three children, a dog and a cat. When taking a closer look, a passer-by might notice the five shiny broomsticks leaning on the back porch and the three occupied owl perches just outside the front door. If that same person looked into the garden, they might see a variety of moving and unique plants they had never seen before and would also glimpse squat-looking, bald creatures moving amongst them. Once that person opened the garage door to find tools doing their own work without the aid of a person and a car floating just above the ground, the observer would finally realize that this is not a normal, uninteresting household. You see, the Potters are wizards. And not just any wizards. Harry Potter is so famous that the street he lives on was named after him. Well, after him and his parents. Thirty five years ago Harry's parents were murdered on Potter lane by Lord Voldemort, the most evil dark wizard of all time. Harry, the primary target of Lord Voldemort, miraculously survived the attack because of a charm his mother had bestowed upon him by sacrificing herself.

This sent Lord Voldemort into hiding, existing as only a wisp of hateful thought for many years until he was finally able to return to power. By the time Voldemort had returned, Harry had grown into a teenager and was being trained as a wizard under the tutelage of the greatest headmaster Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry had ever known, Albus Dumbledore. With the help of Dumbledore, the members of Dumbledore's Army, the Order of the Phoenix, and most importantly, his two best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry was able to defeat Lord Voldemort once and for all and put an end to his reign of evil.\\
After the war was over, Harry married his longtime sweetheart, Ginny Weasley, and the two began a happy life together. Harry began work in the Auror Department of the Ministry of Magic and eventually got named head of the department at age 27, the youngest head Auror in history. Ginny went on to play Quidditch professionally for several years. Quidditch is a wizarding game played on broomsticks. Eventually, when she and Harry decided to have children, Ginny became the chief Quidditch correspondent for the Daily Prophet, the largest wizarding newspaper in Britain. The couple had their first child, James Sirius Potter, named after Harry's father and godfather, soon after. Albus Severus would follow two years later and Lily Luna two years after that. The Potters wished to live as quiet a life as possible for people as famous as they were. They spent the majority of their free time with their many friends and family members (while Harry is an only child, Ginny had six older brothers, four of whom are married with children).

On an otherwise quiet afternoon, the three Potter children, along with three of their cousins, Hugo, Rose, and Fred, were playing three-a-side Quidditch in a large field outside of Godric's Hollow proper. Harry, his best friend Ron, and their sister-in-law Angelina Johnson-Weasley, were sitting along the edge of the pitch watching their children enjoy the afternoon. Fred and James, the eldest two, were already attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and were members of the Gryffindor House Quidditch Team. James, entering his third year, had played as a chaser during his second year. Fred, entering his fifth year at Hogwarts, played as a chaser the past two years. Albus and Rose were heading to Hogwarts to begin their first year of school when summer was over. Hugo and Lily were still a few years away, but couldn't wait to join their siblings at the famous wizarding school. As the adults watched, James made a dazzling move around Fred and Albus, took a pass of the quaffle from his cousin Rose, and easily put the red ball through the hoop little Hugo was guarding.

“Man, you're getting even faster,” shouted Fred, over the sudden gust of wind that had entered the grove. “There's no way McLaggen won't make you seeker this year.” Fred was a stocky boy who inherited his father's build and complexion. His dark eyes were the only recognition of his mother on the boy's face.

“Anyone could look fast when Al is guarding them,” James teased as he spun a quick loop around his younger brother before zooming to his side of the pitch. “Plus, that blockhead will probably keep himself at seeker to give the other houses a chance.” James Sirius, with his disheveled hair and good looks, was every bit as cocky as his two namesakes. His skills on a broomstick were evident from a very young age. He seemed to inherit both of his parents' prodigious skill on the Quidditch pitch as well and was one of the best players on the Gryffindor house team as a second year student the year before, scoring more goals than any other chaser in the school.

“Go suck an egg,” Albus responded. He never liked these family games. Unlike his siblings, Albus didn't inherit his parents' world class skills on a broomstick. He wasn't entirely lost in the air, but his fear of flying too high and fast was very un-Potter like. He hated how his brother could exploit his weakness so casually, especially in front of the whole family. Albus was a much quieter and humble boy than his brother or sister. In looks, he was far more similar to his father than his mother and had inherited his father's green eyes. He required glasses similar to those his father wore and was of a smaller and lankier build. Albus was smart though. That was evident from a young age. His parents were not unintelligent by any means, but neither was an especially good student. Both were very powerful wizards; however, studying was not exactly their area of expertise. Albus, similar to his cousin Rose and his aunt Hermione, loved to read books. By the age of seven he had already read Hogwarts: A History so many times that he could recite the opening chapter from memory. Rose was his best friend and the only one in the family he felt he could really relate to. They spent a lot of time learning about the great wizarding history and their family's place in it.

“Enough James,” yelled Harry from the ground. “Al, don't let him get to your outside so easily. If you cut off his path, he won't have such an easy time scoring on you.” Just then, Audrey Weasley, Albus' aunt and the wife of his uncle Percy came into the clearing. “Hello everyone, Grandma and Grandpa Weasley just got here. It's time to come down and get ready for supper.” Aunt Audrey had the tendency to give commands to her nieces and nephews. The children tended not to listen.

“Oy! Get down here and get yourself smart looking. Your cousin is coming home today,” exclaimed Ron. “Last one at the table has to polish the brooms.” Albus gave Rose an exasperated look as the six broomsticks plummeted from the sky. After landing, Albus got into step next to Rose and his father.

“Don't let him get to you Al,” said Rose quietly. “He only picks on you because you're his little brother. I do the same thing with Hugo. It's just...normal.” Harry, hearing the exchange, said, loud enough for James to hear, “Pay him no mind, Al. He's got a bit of a big head your brother. He wasn't so cocky after Carroway from Ravenclaw belted him in the head with a bludger last year. “ Harry leaned into Albus and Rose and whispered, “He was crying in Madam Pomfrey's hospital wing for hours until your mother showed up to comfort him.”\\
Rose and Albus giggled with delight as Harry leaned away.

“Dad! What did you tell them?” said James, suddenly jogging to catch up with the trio. “Dad! That's not fair. It was a foul! Even Hagrid said so.”

“I see,” said Harry. “I must've forgotten, in all our years of friendship, that Hagrid is an expert on Quidditch.”

Ron, walking a few paces ahead with Hugo and Lily, chortled loudly.

Audrey was the first to come out of the thicket of trees and into the clearing behind the Potter's household. She waved to the rest of the family waiting on the back porch as Harry, Ron, Angelina, and the children emerged from the trees behind them.

Seated on the porch, some on chairs, some on whatever inanimate objects they could find, were Molly and Arthur Weasley, surrounded by their eldest two sons Bill and Charlie, and their granddaughters Charlotte and Emily, Percy and Audrey's two daughters, along with their grandson Louis, Bill's only son and youngest child.

“Come on, you lot,” Arthur yelled across the field, “I've got presents!” The six grandchildren coming from the Quidditch match ran to their grandparents' loving embraces.

“Ok, we've got two here for James and Albus,” said Arthur, giving his two grandsons each a large wrapped box.

“And this is for you Rosie,” said Molly, handing her granddaughter a rectangular object that even an untrained eye would determine was a book of some sort.

“Fred,” called Arthur, “I've got this one for you. Your father says you've got an unlimited amount of fun things..”

“Too much,” laughed Angelina, tussling her son's hair, “This boy's room is like a mini version of the shop...”

“Well, rightfully so, he's his father and his uncle rolled into one,” beamed Arthur, “but your grandmother thought, umm,” he looked to his wife, “your grandmother AND I thought you could use a little order in your studies,” finished Arthur, looking over to his wife to make sure she was appeased.

“Lily,” called Molly, “Come here doll. I know how much you love helping me cook, so I got you a little something special.” Lily, while adept on a broom like her mother, was much more of a homemaker at heart...like her grandmother. While Ginny wasn't particularly fond of cooking and cleaning, leading to a rather messy home, Lily took to the culinary arts from a young age. The first magic she displayed, at the age of three, was the ability to perfectly season any meal her mother had attempted to flavor.

“And Hugo,” called Arthur, “Here you go little chap.” Arthur handed his youngest grandson a huge bag of Honeydukes best summer sweets. James was already ripping open his present before Hugo even received his.

“Wow! Thanks Grandpa. Dad! Look! A high speed broom-balancing attachment! It'll fit perfect on my new Nimbus!” James greedily showed his father his gift.

“Spent a lot of time testing that, Angelina and me,” said Charlie, sitting behind his father. “Even took a go at a dragon in the air.”

“Yes, George has been working on that for quite some time,” Angelina mentioned, “I've got the bruises to prove it. James, no matter how fast you fly, or how sharp you dive, when that's attached to the front of your broomstick, you'll feel completely level and under control.”

“Quite a piece of gravity-cheating magic that must be,” said Audrey, sounding somewhat angered and standing apart from the others. “Don't get too used to that piece of magic James, your Uncle Percy has spent a lot of time regulating broom attachments to level the playing field.” James, still awe-struck by his present, paid no mind to his aunt.

“Can you believe that, when we were students, some players were allowed to ride state of the art, international-standard brooms, while others were forced to ride school brooms, IN THE SAME MATCH?” Audrey, looking around, continued, “No, I daresay, out of respect for fairness, that Percy will probably ban such attachments.”

Percy, the Weasley's third eldest son, was the Head of the Department of Magical Transportation, and was rather serious about his work. He had recently convinced Ludo Bagman, the long-serving head of the Department of Games and Sports, to impose certain restrictions on which brooms were legal in Hogwarts Quidditch Matches, in order to keep the games more fun and competitive at the scholastic level. It was only with reluctance that Percy allowed Bagman to continue to allow the Nimbus models in competition, just so long as he banned the international standard class of brooms, such as the Firebolt, made famous by Harry twenty years earlier, and the newer models, the IceGust, WindBlade, and LightningBall, the newest and most coveted broom on the planet.

“He never really did understand Quidditch, Perce,” mumbled Ron, mostly to himself.

“Never really understood childhood either,” Bill put in, “But that's just Percy I reckon. Where is my darling brother anyway?”

“He'll be along,” answered Audrey. “He's working extra hard at work, what with all the problems arising from the new use of flying carpets. Told me just last night that he understands now why they were banned in the first place. Much easier for Muggles to spot, dangerous when toddlers wander off the back. The safety standards and shield charms have to be top notch, but unfortunately most of the models are created out of the country and the standard for fashioning them are not up to snuff. Some of them...”

“Presents!” exclaimed Molly, cutting off Audrey's monotone musings. “I want to see my grandchildren's faces when they open their presents. You lot can go inside to talk about carpet regulations while I spend this beautiful summer day with my grandkids.”

Arthur Weasley cleared his throat. “Rightly said dear,” he began, “Now all of you apologize to your mother.” He looked over at Rose and gave her a little wink.

“Sorry, mum,” said Ron.

“Yes mum, sorry,” said Bill, with a little smirk.

Audrey's face went red with a combination of embarrassment and submissiveness. “Yes, sorry Mrs. Weasley,” she muttered.

“Oh, we've been over this Audrey,” said Molly, “Call me mum. You're my daughter by marriage and a perfect substitute for Percy when he's off being busy at work. Percy was always needed to keep the rest of this lot in line and you're needed for the same reason. All right dears,” Molly continued, “lets open the rest of our presents and then Lily and I will go inside to help poor Ginny with supper, Merlin knows she needs it.”\\
The rest of the group laughed, the Potters uncomfortably so.

“Alright then,” said Arthur, “Who's next?”

“Me!” exclaimed Rose and she began tearing open the wrapping on her gift.

“Yes! Look Dad,” she said turning to Ron, “A full workbook organizer...for my first year at Hogwarts! With a big Lion on the front! Thanks Nana!”\\
Ron muttered something about “your mother in you” but said aloud, “That's great dear.”

“Ooh, Rosie, it's the same ones we got,” said Charlotte, holding up she and her sister's organizers for the rest of the family to see. “When we are working in the common room, we can pass notes to each other by writing on the small tablet on the bottom. The organizers all have the geminio charm on them so that what you write on one will appear on the tablet of the other ones.”

“Wow,” said Rosie, “so we can all help each other with our studies!” Harry and Ron looked at each other with knowing smirks. If they had received objects that were capable of communication in that manner, they would've put them to good use, but studying was probably the last thing they would be used for.

James, seemingly thinking along the same lines, said “Wow, if me and Wendell had those things in class, we could talk about Tythe's beady eyes and foul stench and no one would know.”

“And that,” said Molly, “Is why you didn't get one of those James. Too much of your father and uncles in you.

“I couldn't even imagine the things Fred and George would've managed with those books,” said Ron, “me and Harry were tame compared to that.” The family caught themselves in an awkward silence for a moment. Fred, the twin brother of George and the namesake of George's son, was killed in the Battle of Hogwarts in which Lord Voldemort was finally defeated for good. It was still painful to bring up his name and the family tried not to as often as possible.

“Well,” said Molly, “you and Harry managed to get into quite a bit of trouble yourselves. What with driving that flying car, and stealing polyjuice potion, and smuggling a dragon out of the castle, and...”

“Saving the world,” Ron finished.

They all laughed.

“Well yes,” finished Molly, “And that.”

“So,” chimed in Arthur, “Who's next?”

Albus looked down at his gift. It clearly was not one of the workbook organizers the girls had received. He didn't want to seem disappointed when he opened it, but he really wished it had been a book of some sort. The rest of his family didn't seem to notice that he wasn't into the same things as his brother and was more into learning, history, and being different in every way possible from his brother. Ok, so maybe his father noticed, but it didn't stop his father from pushing him to do the same types of things as the other men in the family. He was barely average at Quidditch, and while he liked playing sometimes, he didn't care all that much about it. He was not as carefree as his brother and cousins. He didn't like all the attention that came along with being a Potter or a Weasley. Sometimes he even wished he could be part of some unknown wizarding family with no recent history to live up to. His biggest fear was that he wouldn't even be good enough to join the rest of his family in the Gryffindor house. He thought he wasn't brave enough or self-assured enough. He figured he would end up in Hufflepuff, where “the rest of the wizards” went. Even worse, he thought he might end up in Slytherin and be excommunicated from his family entirely. He was just about to open his mouth to say he would open his present next, when his sister excitedly called out.

“The new guide to cooking by Hannah Longbottom and my own magical knife and mixing bowl set!” You could tell immediately that Lily had gotten exactly what she had wanted. Her grandmother beamed in her direction, happy to have another budding chef in the family.

Albus was uncomfortable that his grandparents seemed to know exactly what each of their grandchildren needed or desired the most. He knew that to be true of every one of his cousins and his two siblings. Except for himself. He didn't know what it was that he really wanted or desired, he just knew it wasn't what was in this package. It was a recurring theme throughout the holidays and birthdays. He always was thought of and remembered as fondly as any of the other children, but he never had that great reaction or happy surprise when opening a present or being given a greeting.

“Huh?” said Albus after hearing his name and looking to his father.

Harry, smiling, said, “I said, do you want to open your gift up next, Al?”

“Er, sure,” said Albus, slowly tearing into the wrapping around his gift. They had gotten him the same broom balancing attachment they had gotten James. He looked down on it with quick disgust, but then recovered. He didn't think anyone noticed.

“That's great Al,” said Harry, “now you won't have to worry about flying too high or too fast on your broom and just focus on the quaffle and defense.”

Albus said, “Yeah. Yeah, that's really cool.”

Harry, still looking at him, said “Well, what do you say?”

“Oh, yeah,” said Albus, mustering as much excitement as he could, “Thanks Grandma and Grandpa, this will really help me get better with my flying.”

“Hah,” said Arthur, apparently unaware of Albus' momentary hesitation, “You're a Potter and a Weasley. Your mother played professional and your father could have if he didn't have, err, other pursuits. You don't need help. But this will make sure you're on the house team in your first year, just like your father.”

Albus quickly embraced his grandparents and returned to his spot on the porch.

Fred was the last to open his gift. There were a lot of ‘oohs' and ‘ahhs,' but not from Fred himself.

“An owl O.W.L. assistant?,” he asked puzzingly looking up at his mother and examining the mock owl bird sitting on his lap. He began reading the side of the packaging, “This wise owl is packed full of answers for any of the O.W.L. subjects you could possibly need. The best and easiest to use O.W.L. study guide on the market. Just ask a question and the wise owl will answer.”

“Yes Freddie,” responded Angelina, “Your grandmother and I thought it would be quite a nice change of pace to see you study for your O.W.L.s this year instead of me having to attend Hogwarts at the end of term to explain your poor performance to your instructors again.”

Fred winced slightly as the rest of the family chuckled. “We know your very capable of doing well,” continued Angelina, “you're smarter than me or your father, but you're also just as unfocused as he was. Fifth year is too important. Even your dad wants to see you get more than the three O.W.L.s he managed.”

With that, the gift giving was done.

“All right, everybody,” yelled Ron, “Back to the pitch.”

“No, no, no,” said Molly, “These lot need to get ready for dinner. Lily come with me to help your mother. Angelina, would you like to help? Boys, get washed and dressed. Charlie, you too. Harry, Ron, and Bill, stay here and keep Arthur company. Audrey, you too...if, if you'd like.”

The family dispersed as quickly as they had gathered. James and Fred quickly ran to James' room, Hugo and Louis to Lily's, Charlotte and Emily, who were already impeccably dressed, stayed on the porch with their mother, and Rose went with Albus.

“I know you didn't really want it,” said Rose, once they were alone. “I could tell. I mean, I know you wouldn't want a Quidditch accessory as a midsummer gift.”

“It's ok Rosie,” said Albus as he looked at his broomstick attachment, “maybe this really will make me as good a Quidditch player as James.” The two of them walked into Albus' room where Rose plopped on the bed and Albus sat in front of a mirror over his dresser. “That book you got is pretty cool. You're going to have to let me use it if when we're in the common room, or, you know, from different common rooms.”

“You're still bent up about not being in Gryffindor?” asked Rose. “You will be, Al. You're just as brave and Potter/Weasley-ish as the rest of us. The school would close before a Weasley or Potter was assigned to a different house. The sorting hat will know you, it knows us, we'll be fine.”

“So you're not worried about, ya know,” asked Albus.

“Not being in Gryffindor?” finished Rose. “Not at all. We're definitely smart enough, both of us, we've got the blood, and all of our cousins, well, except Dominique, has been in Gryffindor. So have our parents, our grandparents, and nearly all of our family's friends. We're shoo-ins.”

“I guess,” said Albus, “but what if?”

“Well, then ‘what if',” answered Rose, “Don't even bother with the what-if. It's not even worth thinking of because it's definitely not going to happen.” Despite all her apparent confidence, Albus knew his cousin well. He knew she was just as nervous as he was about beginning Hogwarts. Everyone said it's normal to be scared of entering Hogwarts your first year. There are normal nerves and a normal adjustment period. But not everyone was Harry Potter's son.

Up to this point, they had been homeschooled. First year at Hogwarts was the first real instruction many students from the wizarding world ever received. Albus, at least, knew he had fairly powerful magical abilities, like his parents. He wasn't as confident or cocky as his older brother, but he knew he could be every bit the wizard he was, maybe better. He had never been better than James at anything, but he wanted to be better than him at this. He wanted to be a better student and a better wizard. Albus had been waiting a long time for school to start. And Rose was right, he would be in Gryffindor with the rest of his family and everything would be all right.
