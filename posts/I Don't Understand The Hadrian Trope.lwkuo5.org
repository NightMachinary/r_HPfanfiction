Over the years of perusing HP fanfics, I've noticed this fanon trope about Harry's first name actually being Hadrian. I've been thinking more about it than usual lately and have decided to post here with the hope that someone can explain it to me. I just don't get it.

What do you all think?


** Harry isn't a historically common given name anywhere. It's generally a nickname for Henry or Harold.

My guess is that Henry or Harold are "too muggle" for a lot of writers who want Harry's name to match some of the others we're given in canon/fanon.

** A lot of the wizarding society names are Roman emperor names: Severus (Snape), Marcus (Flint), Tiberius (Ogden), Lucius (Malfoy)

or just Roman/Greek names from Mythology: Cassandra and Sybil (Trelawny), Argus (Filch), Minerva (McGonagall), Pomona (Sprout), Remus (Lupin), Aurora (Sinastra), Alastor (Moody), Merope (Gaunt), Andromeda, Nymphadora, Quirinus (Quirrell), Alecto and Amycus (Carrow), Dedalus (Diggle), Luna (Lovegood), Hermione, Mulciber, etc.

​

It just makes sense that Harry's name might be Hadrian to fit into the Roman emperor names. Harry is his name when he thinks he's ordinary. Harry finds out that he's a wizard, it makes sense he would have an extraordinary name. But he longs to be normal and still goes by Harry--in a firm juxtaposition to Tom Riddle, who hated having an ordinary name and goes to great lengths to be extraordinary.

** Ermithecow's response to JennaSayquah here nails it right on the head. It's people not quite understanding the name Harry. Possibly cultural differences - maybe it is a common name in the US? - but yeah. Here, Harry is a relatively posh name, people don't understand that and think it needs a bit more Societal Ooomph, so they riff on it awhile before coming up with Hadrian. Dude was an Emperor, he had a wall, it's Roman, that's perfect for the Wizarding World!

But yeah, more Royals have had names like George, Harry, and James than Fitzgerald or Montague. I think the poshest UK Royal Name I remember from the last century is Victoria. Prior to that, probably Isabella for Queens and Charles for Kings.

***** Fitz- is a patronymic that exists in Norman French, from Latin ‘Filius' meaning son. As Anglo-Norman French was the prestige language of the nobility for several centuries, it evolved. Hence why Royal Bastards were termed ‘Fitzroy', son of the king. IIRC that trend continued into the noble bastards, hence why we see sometimes FitzJames, FitzAlan, FitzGerald, FitzWilliam.

The Regency iirc correctly was a time of change for the nobility, that's when they start to become somewhat irrelevant, the beginnings of the industrial revolution changed everything and their sort of last hurrah as it will came with the advent of the Great War.

*** I think it goes a bit further than that culturally. There seems to be a trend these days, particularly coming from the States, where traditional surnames and Patronymics are used as first names notably in a unisex way. The argument about Harrison, for instance is a bit dead because Harrison is now a ‘royal' name because of Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor but is at least used in its proper context.

I find your point about the ‘poshest' royal name to be a bit hilarious. Surely by virtue of it being a regnal name it is posh, having entered the upper stratosphere of the upper class.

Ironically regnal names become common, because they are used by the royals. It used to be that when the name of a royal birth was announced, there would be a spike in popularity among the rest of us.

I think historically, this is very simple: The lower class is behind the curve. In Victorian times, maids might be Mary and footmen might be James and John. It takes time to filter through society -- or it did, anyway. It's obviously a lot more fluid since the 20th century.

What was Orwell's phrase? We're all equals, but some are more equal than others. Regnal names are posh, sure, but some are posher-sounding than others. :)

But no. I don't actually know if that cultural facet extends outside the UK, so I was attempting to be comparative. A lot of people seem to think that 'posh' names have to sound like Byzantine Emperors, all 'Dominus Noster Flavius Theodosius Augustus' and similar. So, by that metric 'Harry' is generic, but 'Victoria' or 'Isabella' or 'Charles' might be regarded as more posh. I was attempting (perhaps poorly) to connect it back to the Fitzgerald and Montague thing - the very 'Downton Abbey' perception of posh that seems most visible outside the UK.

I do agree that they're all posh sounding to us, though. Harry always evoked an image of a vaguely roguish lad from Oxford, and Charles is a real 'old boys club' sort of name.

However, in canon Petunia complained that Harry was "a nasty, common name." This indicates that his actual given name was Harry. (I once knew a man whose given name was Bob --- not Robert: his birth certificate said Bob.)

I have a full set of notes from research I did for if I was ever going to write a fic in which Harry goes on the run and changes his name. *Hardwin* was already mentioned, as being the name of an ancestor, and means "courageous friend". I also liked *Harfang*, which is another name for a snowy owl. /(Of course, if you were really on the run and disguising your name, it should be something that is not at all connected or similar to your real name.)/

*** The "nasty, common name" thing is a deliberate joke on JKRs part designed to show up the Dursleys as social climbers who don't actually have a clue.

Harry is, in the UK at least, a relatively posh name. It's technically a nickname for Henry- which is the name of eight of our previous kings, a good number of whom are actually referred to as "Harry" in historical documents such as letters from friends/family. Prince Harry is undeniably posh and the best known owner of the name. Of course, he's a Henry too on his birth certificate. It's much more common now as traditional names have had a bit of a resurgence, but at the time PS was being written (early 90s) if you met a bloke called Harry, there's a high chance he was privately educated. It was, and still is, a posh name, either on its own or short for Henry.

Dudley, on the other hand, is very much /not/ a posh given name. It's /unusual,/ but unusual is not the same as posh. It screams of parents who are trying too hard. It's actually /Petunia/ who gave her son a "nasty, common name," and even young readers in the UK got the joke when the book came out, because how can Harry be a common name when it's the princes name?!

That tiny throwaway line established Petunia's character. She's desperate to be something she's not, which is exactly where all her canon issues spring from.

******* Yeah, there were three Elizabeth's in mine, but like, it's still the queen's name so it's a posh name, even if lots of "regular" people are also called it. Traditional names have definitely come round again in the past 20 years though. Loads of kids getting called Harry and George these days, whereas when I was a child (and I'm about Harry's age) they were definitely the posh names.

My point is, "Harry" is a traditional name as used by royalty. (As is James actually). "Dudley" is the more "common", as in "lower class" of the two names, even if Harry is more /usual/ and /widespread./

Petunia's comment of it being a "nasty common" name doesn't mean "loads of people are called Harry." It means "I think this name is synonymous with being lower class," when it's actually a version of the most popular boys name in the monarchy so by definition cannot be inherently lower class, no matter how many "common" people use it.
