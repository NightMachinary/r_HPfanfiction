** Title: Stone Dragons

Author/Artist: gravidy

Rating: R

Warnings: DH compliant. Violence, language, ambiguous consent, just a smidge of BDSM and sadist!Draco, a bit of Ron/Hermione fluff

Summary: Sometimes there are no right decisions. There are only actions and consequences. Hermione's only choice now is who to betray.

A fic set in an alternate universe which offers interesting theories of the reason behind the struggle of the Purebloods
