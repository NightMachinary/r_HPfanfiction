I dont mind if it's from Harry's view or an OC, I'd prefer if it was either complete or a high enough word count that it doesn't take ten minutes to read.


** Not Snape-centric but he's much better represented in linkffn(A Champion's New Hope) than in canon

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.

  21 years after the FInal Battle, regrouping after Ginny is severely injured, Harry goes on a mission for Minerva and discovers that Snape is alive, is living as a Muggle with no memory of his magical life, and has a daughter Lily's age who has just received her Hogwarts letter. A sentimental journey to bring Severus home.Thanks to my wonderful badgerlady, who re-beta'd this entire story in the space of a day or two, formatted it with HTML tags, and got it ready for archiving here.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play

  When Harry appears at the Welcoming Feast wearing a glamor only Snape notices, Snape decides to find out what the glamor is hiding. You, the guiltless, will pay for your father's sins,Roman, until you repair the decayingtemples and shrines of the gods, and theirimages, filthy with blackening smoke.When you act as servant of the gods, you rule:from them all beginning, leave them the ending.Horace, Odes, III-6
