Today my wife and i were grocery shopping and for sandwich meat and I misheard her say “Tavern Master's Ham” instead of “Tavern Ham” and I ran with it. I imagined Snape being the “Tavern Master/Brew Master” of Hogwarts.

“Class....Who can tell me what is the difference between an ale and a lager? Anyone....anyone besides Ms. Granger? Very well....”

“Please sir for the average beer drinker, the difference between an ale and a lager comes down to how the beer looks, smells, and tastes. Ales tend to be fruity-estery, while lagers are clean-tasting and frequently described as "crisp." But to a brewer, the difference is more fundamental than that. It's not color, or flavor, or aroma, or hop/grain/malt varietals or even water hardness that separates a lager from an ale. Simply put, lagers use an entirely different type of yeast during fermentation.”

“An answer delivered straight from the “Brewmaster's Bible.... Are you incapable of thinking for yourself or do you simply enjoy regurgitating information as if you had just inhaled one of the Weasley twins abhorrent puking pastry's? 100 points from Gryffindor for you lackadaisical indolent attitude.”

Or conversely: Say Percy, who's that teacher drinking beer with Professor Quirrel?

“That's Professor Snape, Brewmaster of Hogwarts. Right now he's drinking a Pilsner but everyone knows it's the Dark Beers he fancies”


** “Hops” McGonagall said to the portrait of what looked like a wheat field at the end of an abandoned corridor.

The portrait swung open to reveal what was unquestionably a speakeasy. At the back of the room was a long bar with several stools. Flitwick and Sinistra sat together at one of several small tables scattered around the room.

Standing on a small stage to her left was Trelawney, singing yet another horrible rendition of Celestina Warbeck's ‘A Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love'

McGonagall cringed and headed for her usual stool at the bar. She hated karaoke night.

“The usual” she said to the bartender.

Thirty seconds later a glass appeared in front of her.

“Double firewhiskey on the rocks” sneered none other than Severus Snape, Brewmaster of Hogwarts.

** I can teach you how to bottle ales, brew stouts, even put a stopper in ... porters.

Potter, what would I get if I added wheat and hops to an infusion of water? WELL? Why aren't you copying this all down?

** It's like Hairy Pothead and the Marijuana Stone except with alcohol instead of weed.
