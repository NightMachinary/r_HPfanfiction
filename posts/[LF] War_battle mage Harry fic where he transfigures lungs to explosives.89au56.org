Looking for a war mage fic i read awhile back, it was basically Harry killing dozens upon dozens of wizards at a time. I specifically remember a scene where someone asks him how he approaches a battle and he says something to the effect of always trying to transfigure or swap the enemies lungs with explosives but a skilled duelist can counter that. If anyone has any ideas of which fic that was in please let me know! 95% chance i read it on fanfiction.net if that helps any

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.
