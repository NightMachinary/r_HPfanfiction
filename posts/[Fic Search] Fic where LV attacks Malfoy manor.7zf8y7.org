Hey everyone,

I'm looking for a fic I read some time ago but I can't find it back. I'm not sure but I think it was a time travel story but I'm not sure. Here's the infos I remember : Harry is negociating in Malfoy manor (possibly with in company of a Black too) but Voldemort attacks. The elder Malfoy and Black (surely Abraxas but not sure) understand that Lucius betrayed elder Malfoy to get him killed by LV and inherit the title, propriety and gold and tells the others to flee. They say they will stay but give Harry something (related to money of title? possibly a way for him to empty the Malfoy Vault before Lucius can get to it). LV gets in and the elder Malfoy activate a trap in the room where he waits for him that destroy the manor and injure LV.

I'm not sure about everything but that's what I seem to remember. I hope this was understandable, being not native english speaker. Thanks
