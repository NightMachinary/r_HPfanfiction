Canon/Epilogue complaint, so Hermione is suprised (if not to say shocked) that her Body gets attracted to Malfoys and even has certain thoughts about him, despite their bullying past and despite her being married (IF she is married) she gets aroused when Malfoy gets physical or mental appearance. Maybe leading to a lot of pent up tension and she tries to blow of some steam with Ron. Hermione and Malfoy might have a Session in the end. Malfoy would possibly be as suprised as her, when she confronts him, but wouldnt have any objections of them "having fun"
