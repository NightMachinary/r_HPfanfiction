Hi. I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions for fanfics that involves Harry and the military or harry learning muggle self defense or something like that leading to the demise of Voldemort or killing of death eaters. For example, something like Agent Potter By White Angel of Auralon.


** Stories with a military Harry:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3918135/1/The-Sniper][The Sniper]] by DobbyElfLord.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2784825/1/Old-Soldiers-Never-Die][Old Soldiers Never Die]] by Rorschach's Blot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]] by Kwan Li (the second half of the story).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] by Marquis Black. Also the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3561444/1/The-Dark-Wars-Empire-s-Plight][Dark Wars]] series by the same author. (Together, the two are about a million words.)

There are a couple of Secret Agent Hedwig stories out there (who would have thought that was a thing?):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6422638/1/Agent-O][Agent O]] by Rorschach's Blot

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4176058/1/India][India]] by Perspicacity.

With the exception of Emperor (which is 500k+ words), all are complete.

*** There is another, if you can find it, idk what it's called, maybe something like learning to breathe, I'm not sure. It's a story set in sixth yeah I believe and it has Harry as a soldier, after his defeat of voldemort, but he has no social abilities whatsoever.

This is my favourite, it involves the military and harry becoming a leader of both witches/wizards/muggles.

it IS uncomplete, however the last chapter leaves it in a nice enough place.

*** Nice, it's a great story, but the end is somewhat weird... It feels rushed and like the author just piled the Last Battle chapter into a couple of pages.
