Just read a 5 month old post about it and thought that it should be brought back up to the spotlight considering how the books and movies contradict each other on multiple occasions and could be quite confusing for someone who didn't took the pain to read all the books

Would like you guys to offer your input and opinion on this matter so that it wont confuse those who only watched the movies only.

** The books are considered 'more' canon by most people, and tend to have more details. However, you are free to use either one - and, of course, both of them are not necessarily consistent either.

If you're worried that it'll be too confusing to movie-watchers only, you can make a little author's note on the subject I would say.

** It's your story; pick what works best. My personal rule is "be consistent," that is, if you go with the movie for one scene then don't go with the book for the next. It just makes it easier for the reader to stay tuned, rather than whiplashing your story all over the place.

** If they're going to read fanfiction they can read the real thing.

** Generally, use the books as a basis. Although the movies obviously had a lot more visual information (eg the looks of the name only characters) and can therefore be a valuable addition, they are at best that, an addition.

*** Considering that the books say that the Dursleys are inherently blond whereas the movies portray them with only Vernon being blond and Petunia and Dudley having black haired.

So, I think that you are right, my good man/woman in saying that the movies are only, at best should be used as an addition, a kind of reference point as I do normally portray Vernom as the only blond in the Dursleys household .

Thank you, fellow Potterhead, for helping me during my dilemma of sorts on this topic.

*P.S.* Do you think that me researching so much for fanfics would be worth in the end? Do advice me, kind sir/ma'am.

**** Don't forget about Neville!!!

Honestly the movies messed up the physical appearances of many characters. Hell, I remember the illustrations in the old books editions before the movies, Harry's scar was in the middle of his forehead between the eyebrows. It had even different shape!

** I prefer the books to refer to since there are more details and less plotholes.
