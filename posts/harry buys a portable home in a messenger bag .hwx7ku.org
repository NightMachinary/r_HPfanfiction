:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
im looking for a fic that I vaguely read a while ago and want to check up on again. it's another one of those cliche 'harry is smart and he figures out he has a lot of money (I think)'. harry buys some kind of portable home / house storage at some point before attending hogwarts. it's like a luggage bag / messenger bag with a house on the inside, if I remember correctly. I also can't remember if it was where harry simply found out he actually had money or if he ran away from the dursley's during the summer to do part time jobs on the magical side for spare money


** basically every super harry fic ever

#+begin_quote
  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.
