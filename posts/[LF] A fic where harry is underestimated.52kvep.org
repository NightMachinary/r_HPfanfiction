So I know that fics like this will generally be wish-fulfillment, but I'm currently in a mood to read something like that. I don't have any real parameters for what I'm looking for as long as it is Harry-centric and not slash.

Thanks!

** Bungle in the Jungle linkffn(2889350). Writing style can be jarring at first. But it's quite fun.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

** Every fic. I can't think of a single one where Harry isn't underestimated, which makes sense since hes a kid.
