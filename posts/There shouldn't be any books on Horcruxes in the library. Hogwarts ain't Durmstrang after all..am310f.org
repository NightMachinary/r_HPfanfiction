** Horcrux how to books is canon, Dumbledore didn't remove those books until some time after he became headmaster. Hermione ends up with them in deathly hallows and the instructions are there.

** It's not fanon. It's canonical. There /was/ just /one/ book in the Restricted Section (presumably from Salazar Slytherin's time), until Dumbledore purged the library of it and other Dark books.

** As for "Hogwarts not being Durmstrang", there /is/ Slytherin... a whole House whose ideal is to be awesome Dark Wizards. (Some just buy into the aesthetic without actually being evil, of course. But it's the same in Durmstrang. Unless you are proposing that Viktor Krum is evil.)

*** And for all the "Hogwarts is not Durmstrang" talk, Durmstrang actually managed to expel their own dark lord for dark magic, unlike Hogwarts.

***** Define Dark arts. It's such a nebulous concept in the HP Universe as to be useless. Even in the British wizarding community, you have people that think any offensive spell is a Dark Spell.

****** I mean I dont know if they call it exactly that, but if they do that means they dont consider dark to be something bad. In addition that would mean that dark magic is somehow more creative and asthetically pleasing?
