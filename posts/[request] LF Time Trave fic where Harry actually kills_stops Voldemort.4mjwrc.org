I come across time travel fics mostly where either Harry falls in love with Voldemort or like Snape, but there's gotta be some out there were he actually goes back in time and just offs him, right? I'm thinking adventure , teen or mature rating, maybe no romance or just not focused on that much? (optional)

Maybe something that goes into the consequences of that action, as in time paradox or Harry's guilt etc.

Ideas?

  Go back to the beginning, that was the plan. Stop Voldemort on the cusp of becoming a dark lord, stop him before he created his first horcrux and change history before it could be written. That was the plan, only Harry made a mistake.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

** linkffn(9398368)- I wouldn't consider it a true romance, considering the ending, but it'll read like a decently typical one right up until the end.

**** You didn't. You asked for a fic where Harry time travels back and kills Tim Riddle and that's what I linked. You did say that romance was optional. Because I agree that fics where Harry kills Tom are very rare. This fic was the only one I've ever seen before I found this sub. I guess I should have been more clear that it happens, but I thought that was implied as a reply to your request. I've linked this story before for this very reason not too long ago- Harry kills Tom.

  Harry goes back in time to 1944 to deal with Voldemort before he decides to make seven horcruxes. Unfortunately for Harry, though, dealing with a 17 year old Tom Riddle isn't as easy as he thought it would be. TM/HP HP/TM Contains slash.
