** I'm going to go against the trend and say that things would soon return to normal once the colonies got established. Wizards travelled along with all the other waves of colonisation on earth, even the ones after the SoS was established. They wouldn't even need to go on the spaceships - portkeys could be made from just looking at maps and video footage.

While I agree that many wizards wouldn't care about space travel per se, they would still want to maintain the SoS. In fact, purebloods would be leading the charge, since they're the ones who are still the most frightened of witch-hunts, or of just losing their precious isolation from Mugglekind.

Meanwhile, muggleborns are born in space with no local wizard authority to handle it. Without obliviation squads covering up accidents, space muggles begin to notice kids with certain abilities. The thought is space itself is the catalyst for for these Newtypes of humans and it doesn't take long for the government to weaponise the kids.

****** He's also got a father pretty high up the ladder in politics and the ministry liaises with the muggle side. The wizards are NOT some isolated tribe who only ever get the chance to see technology from afar. Wizards are the strangers right next door. They can listen in to our conversations if they want, read our magazines, watch our tv programmes, learn our words. If they want. And they then spread those words amongst each other.

But coming back to the contact with the ministry - the ministry has the Office of Misinformation and the Muggle-worthy Excuse Committee, two bodies who are professionally required to at least know the basic meanings of the words the muggles use. And Lucius, commonly associating with muggle-baiters and other ne'er-do-wells requiring the workings of aforementioned bodies, has every reason to be reasonably fluent in muggle parlance and to pass parts of it on to his son.

That does not mean that either of them know more about aeroplanes and helicopters than any random muggle child.

You are wrong. You seem to forget that for all intents and purposes Wizards government control the muggles. We have seen that in book 6. As soon as the government even begins thinking about solar colonies, the Wizards will know. That simple.

Edit: Also in book 3

Edit2: >Meanwhile, muggleborns are born in space with no local wizard authority to handle

Also wrong. According to J.K.Rowling magic genes are "dominant and resilient". That means that Muggleborns can't just pop up out of nowhere. A Wizard has to have sex with a muggle. Considering how suprised parents of the muggleborns are it is very likely that the sex was forced and later obliviated. Either way, Muggleborns wouldn't start popping up in space

** I figured they would just follow. At the very least authorities would realize the possibility of muggleborn being born on different planets or moons and come to the conclusion that while they may not have to join the colonization, they at least need agencies among them to control possible bouts of accidental magic.

I'm pretty sure that while normal magic-raised magicals are not aware of much of muggle technology or their achievements, its not a secret to the DMLE, and similar departments who need at least a working knowledge.

If I give wizards competence in one thing, it would be the upholding of their secrecy.

Whats more important, how would they handle the education of these muggleborns? For example, a wizard born on Callisto would have one real problem: Gravity. 0.1G does not a bone structure make that could hope to survive the 1G of Earth. And even if you bring them to Earth using charms to keep them healthy, how exactly do you explain that on Callisto? "I'm sending my boy to school on Earth... he comes back each summer?" is not gonna work. While I do think that portkeys, Floo and whatnot could already be, or at least could be modified to be functional ways of traveling between the colonies, the actual explanation of the seasonal absence of someone is a problem.

I once wrote a small piece in which the magical schools decide to build an extradimensional pocket in which they place a school. Being extradimensional, it could be accessed by special mirrors given to the muggleborns. Its a day-school and the excuse for them is always that they are sickly and are being homeschooled in their living quarters. But the Schools also decided that this wasn't a permanent solution. The ICW furthermore decided that all wizardkind is supposed to be on Earth, or at least given the option to come, and gave commissions to develop potions to alter extraterrestrially grown human bodies to fit terrestrial conditions.

** They would stop being trained, and without training become dangerous. Eventually muggles would realize there was a chance for anyone to be born as a "psyker" and start to round them up onto gigantic ships to send back to earth. There many of these psykers would be sacrificed to a godlike being on a throne to give him the neccessary energy to fuel a needed lighthouse that powers FTL travel. But psykers that controll their power would never be trusted, only tolerated with a wary eye lest they summon deamons to this plane of existence.

** It depends on circumstance.

1. *Assuming magic is the same everywhere*: they stay on Earth, and eventually Earth becomes a wizard-only planet. This would probably result in the dissolution of the Statute of Secrecy as wizards become recognized as a separate race. There would still be muggle-borns on other planets, and this would result in fringe communities.
2. *Assuming magic is subtly different on earth to how it is in space or on other planets*: it carries on as normal, with wizards exploring alongside muggles (openly or covertly) to learn how to take advantage of the new magical circumstances (yes, I've borrowed this idea from /The Magicians/).
