Are there any good SI Harry Potter fics out there? I mean one's without Garu Stu/ Mary Stu characters?

The ones I remember reading all had female characters, so I'd appreciate if you could recommend any fics with male OC's/SI characters. The only other requests are:\\
No slash.\\
Good English.\\
Male main character [as mentioned above]\\
Thanks!! :)


** I have only ever enjoyed one self insert and the guy dropped in during the triwizard tournament and had some great interactions with all the characters plus Daphne. It was a really good fic Linkffn(a curse of truth)

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

** linkffn(Magical Me) is a Lockhart self-insert. Warning for manipulative!Dumbledore and lot of magical oaths (although there's an original explanation of how magical oaths work that keeps them from being a complete cop out)

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.

  I never pretended to know what I was doing in my last life. Why should I pretend to know anything about this one? Well, the other option is a horrific and bloody death, so...I better start learning how to be a witch. OC Self-Insert/Draco's Younger Sister. [DEAD]

** Haven't read it, just found it. Summary looks like a self-intert type of story: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10851278/1/Nobody-told-Me-the-rules]]). On the other hand, the first authors note says it isn't a self-interest, but really... a pov from an oc that has read the books?

*** Yeah it's not worth reading. The author admits that it's bad and his/ her English is terrible. Thanks for trying though!

*** I liked the first half of it cause it was a super SI with fun ideas about magic, but at the half he just fucking restarts it just because.
