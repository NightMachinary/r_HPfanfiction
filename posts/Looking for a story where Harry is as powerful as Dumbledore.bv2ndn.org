The story doesn't have to have any pairings and I am fine with slash so long as it is well written. Harry can be trained by Dumbledore or just be as strong as him.


** I've actually got three if anybody wants too read them, I have [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/]] (A cadmean victory), [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/]] (Blindness), And [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12516323/1/Defiance]] (Defiance).

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** Just finished [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This Means War]] and it is actually rather well done (background email chatter is hillarious). Unfortunately, in the end Harry collects so vast army against Death Eaters that the final battle is a bit of let-down. There is also linkffn(12155794), which I have a lot of complaints against (except, just to the contrary, the final battle was really good), but it has really great Dumbledore, who just hates to be The Saviour of the Wizarding World (he wanted to be a professor all the time) and doing stuff he doesn't want to do.

**** Just the primarily battle stories (and superHarry) are not completely my cup of tea. However, even with that I have to admit that this one is well written, and that Dumbledore is probably the best (or second best) one I have ever read. I really dislike bashing of him, and this seems like very good explanation of his behaviour (no spoilers).

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files
