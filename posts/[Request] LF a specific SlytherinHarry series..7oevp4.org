For some reason I really want to reread this seven year series, but I can not for the life of me find it. However, I don't remember much of it so I will have to be broad as hell. Harry is sorted into Slytherin and befriends the likes of Tracey, Daphne and I believe Theo. In doing so he slowly gets them to rethink everything about blood purity and to erode the House stereotypes and rivalries. After that all I can recall is them either finding or getting a Sanctuary type area in the castle. They each carry special journals, which they gift to others who join their views. At the start of each new year, they try to convince and recruit the new first years into their group. I believe they form a legit Defense Association with each year having a leader and the Head Boy/Girl as the commanders. I found it originally on fanfiction.net. Thanks for any help, and I do apologize for the vague description.


** This sounds like They Shook Hands by Dethryl. linkffn(7659033)

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

** I think that this is Becoming Alpha by Miz636 - linkffn(6389117). I remember the journals, and checked that they were there - Harry goes to the Davis house for the summer also? Didn't read far enough for DA or Head Boy/Girl though.
