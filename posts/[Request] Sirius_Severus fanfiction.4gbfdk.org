Also pretty much anything by [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Acatnamedeaster/pseuds/Acatnamedeaster/works][Acatnamedeaster]], who makes art and comics! Some are standalone, some are series, some series are part of a very long set of headcanons, and I love like 99% of them. Fair warning, though: other pairings appear, and some of the stuff is VERY NSFW and kink-heavy. If that's not your thing, especially beware of the Sketchbook series--pieces there range from 'so tame you could put it on the Christmas setting and nobody would bat an eyelash' to 'Lucifer is looking at you funny right now.' Individual work titles are not always indicative, so read the tags. It's AO3, they're there for a (very good!) reason.

  When Sirius returns from beyond the Veil with knowledge of Voldemort's Horcruxes, he takes on the task of finding and destroying them. Somewhere along the way he finds an unexpected ally and perhaps something more. (AU from the end of OotP, takes place during HBP period)

  The Order needed Sirius, but he doubted they'd mourn him long when he finally disappeared.
