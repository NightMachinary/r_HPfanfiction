*Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality*

A fantastic fan fiction where Harry Potter is raised to learn science and think rationally before going to Hogwarts. It has a site hpmor.com and there is a podcast. hpmorpodcast.com

*Draco Malfoy and the Practice of Rationality*

Someone wrote a sequel to Methods of Rationality and I love it. There is one chapter which has nothing to do with anything and is badly written but this story is still very good.

*Best Revenge*

The author wants Harry to be happy but he has to earn the good things that happen to him. This is a Snape is Harry's mentor fan fiction.

*Best Revenge Time of the Basilisk*

This really is rather good the author took her first story and made a sequel that was rather fitting. While you guys may not like the way these two stories introduce ways that the plot is resolved but it makes sense.

It's moments like this that really make me realize that other people *don't* hold the same opinions I do. Weird that 90% of the time this happens, it is in regards to either fanfiction, Star Wars or the Green Bay Packers.

** While I like The Best Revenge it is nowhere near the "Best Harry Potter Fanfiction". I also am not a fan of the sequel.

The less said about HPMOR the better.

Yeah, if you've only read 20 HP fanfics you aren't really in a position to declare one as the best.

***** Seconding this. I know it's all the rage these days to squawk about gatekeeping, but 20 fics? That's like watching the Phillies beat the Braves today and declaring them the best team in the history of baseball. You can't even begin to understand how incorrect that statement is by watching one game. You gotta at least try to experience the fandom before you pass judgement.

Even assuming OP isn't just a troll, their opinion has as little value as one anyway simply because saying one fic is better than nineteen other fics has zero value when there's literally over one freaking million more to compare it to.

******* [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/new][I made this intro like two years ago, you can find suggestions here]]

Other than that my go to is this:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=3&lan=1&r=10&s=2]]

Read about, oh, i don't know, the first hundred pages or so? That should be a nice starter.

Everything by Robst is garbage, but openly defines a lot of the tropes that should be avoided, so by reading one you're really reading a couple thousand at minimum.

The ending of Unsung Heroes is almost universally reviled, but really good otherwise. Like Robst it's pretty much a defining example of Twin-who-lived.

Read all of Rorschach's Blot's fics. They're not great but they include contributions from many many other authors, some of whom take great care in their adherence to canon, while others abuse the shit out of it.

Some other must read authors (for better or for worse): Nonjon, Northumbrian, Enembee, little0bird, jbern, BarbLP, White Squirrel, Old Crow, Chem Prof, Matt Silver, Bobmin.

Go through their userpages and look for their favorited stories and read those.

Check the subreddit for all the other 'top fics' threads.

You have so much ahead of you, but don't freak out there's some good shit in there.

******** Thank you so much the ones I hate the most aren't the terrible ones but the ones that are really close to being good but aren't.

My least favourite is Harry McGanagle where Harry is raised in America by Minirva's family. I feel as though the Author hated things about the book and changed them. Like Harry has a wand when he is 5 and there is a magic version of McDonalds

At the point I realised that it was just McDonalds I gave up.
