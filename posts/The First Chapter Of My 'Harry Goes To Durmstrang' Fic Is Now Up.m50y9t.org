Admittedly, Harry's not at Durmstrang yet, but still, the point remains, it's begun. Here's the first chapter for those who might be interested!

The Girl Who Lived In Three Castles-[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30041187]]

The summary is thus

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Vernon Dursley has a friend in low places and Dumbledore is...competent but busy putting out fires in the wake of Voldemort's defeat, Harriet Potter gets put into an illegal adoption 'agency' on the continent. Join her as she grows up, goes off to Durmstrang, and discovers that the Potter name looms large even when you don't know it's your name.

** Love the idea! Love a good Durmstrang!Harry and I love FemHarry, I think this is actually the first FemHarry I've seen who went to Durmstrang.

*** Thank you kindly! I did come across one FemHarry at Durmstrang fic in my research, but it's FemHarry/Voldemort so I didn't read it. If that's something that appeals to you though I can find the link, not gonna judge, lol.

****** Good to hear! I enjoy genderbent (not trans) harry and there aren't too many good ones. And durmstrangs fics are quite rare too. I think it's because a durmstrang fic requires a ton more work, since hogwarts provides so much already in terms of established possible content

******* -nods- I hear ya! (Personally fine with trans Harry, but I get not being too into that branch).

Yeah, Durmstrang is...a conundrum, even looking at the wiki. There's not a lot there, particularly about student life, and some of the information we have is...questionable.

Gonna warn right off the bat this is more of a Grumpy!Harry fic than a Dark!Harry fic, and that I'm going to try and give more nuance and balance to Durmstrang as a whole then the usual Evil!Hogwarts angle that gets applied to the place. This fic's going pretty AU, and while I'll be striving to keep it in line with the tone and elements of canon, Rowling wouldn't necessarily recognize this.

******** I actually prefer gray characters over dark or light anyway. There has to be a balance. Goody 2shoes make for boring characters while it's really easy to make a dark character entirely too chich√©d. Gray is the best because you can actually give them a moral compass outside of black and white, and it allows for a more complicated and nuanced character. Plus gray may not enjoy killing, and/or it may not be their first option, but they have no qualms doing it when it fits the situation. I really hate light harry fics where, like canon, his whole arsonal consists of expeliarmas and stupify...

Gray sounds about right, Harriet's gonna be more likely to kill than canon Harry would, though not often if she can help it.

*********** Admittedly a large part of what makes her Grumpy!Harry is that she doesn't want to be fighting a war but Voldemort won't leave her the fuck alone. She has friends in Britain, but would be prepared to just kidnap them and their families and drag them to her home in the Continent if he weren't so stubborn about things.

** I'm one paragraph in, but usually that's all it takes for me to decide if the writing is decent or not. And yep, I can tell already: it's decent! Cue the excitement that comes from finding something that is both well-written and interesting.

... The one thing I'm nervous about is if Harry is adopted into a muggle family. I thought Durmstrang doesn't allow muggleborns, so I'm worried about how that'll be handled. But I have faith!

I have a plan, don't worry! Though I concede I'm a bit iffy on the whole 'Durmstrang doesn't allow Muggleborns' concept as a whole. I'm gonna be playing fast and loose with much of Rowling's worldbuilding I concede.

Not like, 'magical cores' and 'creature inheritances' fast and loose. Just that my version of Durmstrang is going to be fairly different from canon.

** I've just read this and I love it, I know I'm a bit too early for that but do you plan on making Sofia/Harriet gay? Because there is not enough gay fem Harry fics in my opinion. Plus most fem Harry fanfics end up with Tommy boy being the love interest (wich I personally find mildly weird since he's like 70 and killed her parents but ok what do u know)

*** Hey, I'm very happy to hear that you liked it!

I do indeed plan on having Sofia be gay and getting her a girlfriend! I've got an OC lined up, a French noble girl from the Fisher Kingdom she'll meet during the shenanigans of the Fourth Year.

If you're wanting gay fem Harry fics, I /do/ have another, more casual fic I've got up and am also working on. That one's a time travel fic wherein a fem Harry winds up in the past and ends up romancing Bellatrix (and eventually Tommy girl, but that's going to take /a while/ before we get to that point). Interested?
