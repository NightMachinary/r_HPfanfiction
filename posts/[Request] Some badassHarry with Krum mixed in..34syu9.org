** Have you read 'Harry Potter and the Boy who Lived', by The Santi?

I'm not sure if it qualifies as "badass", but Harry is definitely powerful, it's not dystopian, and there is Krum :) It's WIP, and updates are incredibly slow, but it's my favourite story.

(I shall link later when I'm not on mobile)

I've read this one a few times. Always appreciated this author's characterization of both Harry and Krum. enembee is a great author in general, check out their other works! It may be a tad dystopian for you, but it's really AU and will be dystopian in a new way, maybe? Regardless, it's worth reading.

*** chapter 13 & 14 are some of the most intense writing I've ever read. I remember being in bed at some godawful o'clock after midnight reading both for the first time, shivering and scared out of my mind..
