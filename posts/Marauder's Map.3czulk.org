Look at the placement of the apostrophe. That means a map belonging to a marauder, not a map belonging to a group of people called The Marauders. I suppose it's possible for it to mean that James, Sirius, Remus and Peter called themselves the Marauders, but that was never the impression I got from the books, especially as neither Remus nor Sirius mention it. I was actually really confused when I first came across the term "The Marauders" in fanfiction.

Where does this come from? Is it just poor understanding of punctuation?


** On her old site, JKR called them by the Marauders and confirmed they call themselves that in her FAQ ([[https://web.archive.org/web/20060316221607/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=87][cached link]]).

Personally though, I prefer not writing them that way, where they call themselves that. Just isn't what I imagine.

** I always got the feeling that they:

1) Called themselves that and

2) Expected that future trouble-makers would use the map.

I would say that "Marauder's" is a reference to trouble-makers in general, not their name.

** Given the other reply clarifying the JKR position, I think you can easily reconcile this in your brain as high school kids putting the apostrophe in the wrong place when the map was made. (Which happens fairly often, I'm sure.)

OR, you could look at it as the map belongs to whichever Marauder is currently in possession of it. Kinda like "Plumber's Putty" - there's obviously lots of plumbers, but a vat of putty is going to generally be used by only one plumber at a time.

** I heard that originally JKR did not intend them to be called the Marauders (hence the placement of the apostrophe in Book 3). But then many fans, started calling them the Marauders and JKR liked that so it became [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon?from=Main.SureWhyNot][ascended fanon]] (hence JKR later confirming that they are called the Marauders). I am unsure whether this is true though.
