**** Where does half come from? Magikarp evolves at level 20, and the max level is 100, so a fifth seems better... So given wizards, maybe when he's 30?

***** Technically you could say since Harry was destined to die to Voldemort at 17 it would be 8.5 or rather 3.4

** Lord Hardian Jameson Potter-Gryffindoor-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Slythering-Merlin smiled. Today, he would be acquiring the ultimate weapon. Tomorrow, he would be slaying that pesky Lordy Voldy. And then, he would /look/ the manipulative old coot right in the eye.

For he had discovered a secret. It had been there, in the last, last page, of the old, old tome, in the middle of his stolen inheritance that the goblins had so graciously recovered for him. The line that will change his life.

For you see, everyone thinks that your animagus form is the animal most suited to you. Well, everyone is wrong. In fact, for only a million galleons, you could buy a special potion from Gringotts - exclusively offered to Friends of the Goblin Nation - and get to choose (Not that those Friends ever bothered to ask how it was actually called; they all believed it was "The Goblin Nation").

Ignoring the fact that, by doing so, he would get an animal form less suited to him, Lord Merlin proceeded to buy the potion. And he chose for his form: a Basilisk.

Oh, the /look/ he would give Dumbledork.

After a long, exhausting day, he finally achieved it: The fastest learned animagus transformation in history. The first ever magical animagus. The biggest animagus of the all.

But wait. Why was the chair so much bigger than him?

"You know, Potter," an entirely ginormous Malfoy entered his secret transformation room. Lord Hardian met his eyes - it was only polite after all - and Malfoy screamed and fell to the floor... laughing. What? Laughing? "Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Basilisks live for thousands of years. They start growing big at about 300 years old, develop their poison at 500, and the gaze even later. You? You're 16, Potter. Good luck against the Dark Lord tomorrow. See ya!"
