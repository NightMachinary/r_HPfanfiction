  i think u lost most readers by including a harry/ginny pairing... it is one of the leading dislikable pairings there...

Bear in mind that this was posted on a chapter on my story after it had been on the site for over /seven/ months. I'm not sure why this person saw fit to bring it up, as if I hadn't noticed or even really cared. I didn't post my work to appeal to the largest portion of users on the site, or the lowest common denominator, or whatever, and I frankly don't give a rat's ass about whether the pairing I chose is popular or not.

  Wow, some updates knocking on my door! You don't need any praise to lighten up your day do you? It's pretty hot out right now, and I do live on a hill. I don't get many solicitors these days you see. I think I have some praise around here..I'll be right back. Ahh yes, well, unfortunatly I don't have any money, you can tell the girl scout matriarch to shove it, that her cookies have no hold over me! NO HOLD YOU HEAR! O-oh, sorry about that, hehe. Those blasted girl scouts, always after me hard earned dough. They'll learn there lesson to never mess with SMITTY THE BAKER who's also Italian! So about that praise. I know you only needed 3/4 of a cup of praise, but here's a full cup. Just cus I like you. A lot. Now don't get to weird on me now. Make sure you use this praise responsibly, and stay off the drugs. If you randomly come across the Johnsons, you can tell them and there big red house, with their stupid striped corvette that their daughter and her friends from up the street are NOT welcome at my doorstep! I almost got in trouble with the police last year, can you believe it?! Why last Halloween, they had me throw candy at their preteen selves! They demanded I throw candy at them! Dressed as pixie's and slutty cats, what man could say no, I tell you, those Johnsons...(True story about the preteens though, I was just joking around, but they got really excited. They really did force my hand, and have me throw candy at them...Ahh memories, I even got to cockblock this one edgelord guy with his date, good times, good times)

** Here's one I got a while ago that started out good, then took a bit of a turn.

#+begin_quote
  As I read this "Its all coming back to me now" became a reality. "Potterverse" after "Just Friends" like a sequel. There was a prequel as well. Ginny's relationship with the egomaniac Healer. Did the sequel not take place in like an interview with Ginny in the apartment they share overlooking the bay --as I remember. Something like that anyway. Its amazing that I remember this much as I am long retired after 45 years in business then 7 years masquerading as an English lit. Prof. The number 80 is certainly part of my bio. Your skills as a writer are obvious right? Why else would this ancient Academic wannabe remember your stories at all? Why else when I internally cringe at stories, like yours where Ginny has a relationship with someone other then Harry.
#+end_quote

So far, so good, and then:

#+begin_quote
  Generally you write with such skill, imagination,integrity and good taste--Why the profanity? It serves no purpose other then to demean you the writer and your characters. You are assuming that the Magical World is as profane as the muggle world has become. Why??? Isn't it just as probable that with their limited exposure to the muggle world and their almost puritan morays that they have somewhat maintained the moral high ground ? Isn't it better to assume the best when the choice if fully yours? Remember--It is your choice . This and other web sites are filled with smut and comic book quality drivel to more then satisfy the prurient interest of the intellectually challenged. You are meant to soar with eagles.
#+end_quote

So, I'm meant to soar with the eagles, except when my characters have potty mouths.

** If by favorite, you mean, "most insane and hilarious" I think this one wins.

#+begin_quote
  Well... A strange chapter...

  The reunion, OK... But then, thanks to Alastor, we see how it's absolutely impossible that Dumbledore don't know Prewett's real intentions, nor Harry involvement with the British army, thanks to Harry "home shield" and the fact he have a mitary weapon (obviously saw by Alastor eye)...

  And the part of Petigrew? The Weasleys see how the rat transform into a man... and they attack him without any thought!? They know NOTHING about him and they attack immediately? The man could be imperioused, brain damaged, without any memory, or ten other explications... The attack has no sense!

  The training in magic combat and "air combat" it's totally logical... Probably the quiddich players will be much better and stronger, as they train physically and fly often...

  And then, "brainwashed Harry" making gun propaganda!... Oh, dear!... No, >Harry. Guns aren't "brilliant tools". Guns, in adults hands, are murdering machines, in child's hands, are only a premature death wish.

  Obviously Harry don't know EVERY YEAR, more than a hundred children kill themselves in gun related accidents (800 adults), 20.000 children are wounded, and 75.000 persons are wounded or killed?... Why, all this deaths? EEUU, a gun armed country, has a homicide rate of 4/100.000... Any European state, with very few guns, 0.7/100.00... Harry. Guns don't protect your loves ones, guns will kill them.

  And, not, Ron. Gun will not make you safe. Aurors have guns? Not. Why? Not because they don't know, (a lot of Wizards are muggleborn), but because guns are totally useless against wizards... As simple as that...

  PLEASE, DON'T PROMOTE GUN USE BY CHILDREN. PEOPLE DIE EVERY DAY...

  Great chapter!

  The best part is watching all of the students interact with their Dragons. You made them an interesting part of the story. They even have their own personality traits that match up to their temporary owners.

  Percy was also hilarious in this chapter. I like the way Percy can verbally spar with Fred and George without getting offended so easily. In a down to earth, working class family like the Weasleys, it's good to have someone in the family who is a bit more refined. But Percy isn't the snob JK Rowling made him to be in canon. I appreciate that about your writing. Everyone is different, but remain a close family.

  Keep up the good work!

**** Eh, it depends. Magic is very powerful, and a lone wizard vs a lone gunman it comes down to who gets the drop on the other. Assuming they both know, the wizard would probably win in most cases assuming similar levels of skill and preparation.

However, it would never be a lone gunman vs a wizard in a war against muggles. It would be thousands of muggles to every wizard, and there are more than just guns.

***** Muggles Vs Wizards, muggles win. Muggle Vs Wizard, wizard win.

Although depends on the kind of muggle. An army man would win, seeing as he is trained with guns, and bullets are faster than spells.

I do agree that skill and prep. are the keys to the fight.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. First year complete, second year starting April 2017.
