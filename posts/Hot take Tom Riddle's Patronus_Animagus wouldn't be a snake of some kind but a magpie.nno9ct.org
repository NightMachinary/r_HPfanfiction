I've never seen Voldemort's patronus portrayed as anything else but a snake/basilisk or dragon but when I read the scene in which Dumbledore sets a young Tom Riddle's wardrobe on fire aka the rattling of the box with the stolen goods, this idea popped into my mind.

I gave it some thought and I think it would make perfect sense for Tom/Voldemort's Animagus/Patronus to be an (European) magpie

Magpies are known to steal shiny stuff --> see locket and Helga Hufflepuff's cup for example and they are super intelligent, being one of the few non-mammals who can identify themselves in the mirror-test.

In Germanic mythology, the magpie was both the messenger of the gods and the bird of the goddess of death Hel, so that she got the reputation of the harbinger of doom in Europe. As a ‚Äúthieving‚Äù magpie, it was also unpopular as a witch animal and gallows bird in the Middle Ages.

Of course symbolism differs depending on where you live, but what are your thoughts on my theory?

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.[ON TEMPORARY HIATUS FOR PERSONAL REASONS, NOT ABANDONED ‚ô°]

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. ‚ÄúWhat year is it, Riddle.‚ÄùIt wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.‚ÄúSeptember.‚Äù Tom clipped out coldly. ‚Äú1942. You know this.‚Äù'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, ‚Äúthat's a problem.‚Äù   Or   Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.

It's closer to dogs: he's powerful, loyal (to himself) and devoted to his beliefs. He tries to ensure the protection of his horcruxes [safeguarding & protection]

It acts like cats: he is a wizard [magic], practices dark magic [darkness] and is very independent. He wished to escape death so he made horcruxes believing they were the solution [hope]

It's a fox: he's sly and cunning, He messes with his soul [spirituality] - creates horcruxes [creation] - to prevent his death [afterlife]
