Does anyone want to just talk about pairings and good fanfics? We can do it here or private messages. I don't know anyone else who likes Harry Potter and I just want some conversation. Thanks!


** This sub has a Discord (like a live chat) - sounds like you would enjoy it.

** I like Albus/Harry fics, where harry travels back in time. The idea of a younger dumbledore just facinates me, such an interesting character. I would love to see his character explored and it is interesting to see what harry thinks of young albus too. What pairings do you like? This fandom is so creative they always come up with some good ones. Tom/Harrys are also interesting since there is that obvious conflict right from the start, but are so often out of character or really dark.
