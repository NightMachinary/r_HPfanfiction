I've been tossing around an incomplete framework for one such story, but I don't know if it's even worth asking input on here. I've already had trouble with genderswap ideas of mine not being taken seriously in another fandom due to the meme value, hence why I'm uncertain if I should bother with this one.


** FemHarry stories are mostly seen as A Thing That Happens. Some people dislike them, but they're a minority; I think the unspoken consensus on the matter is that Harry, in fanfiction, is basically just a blank slate, and so switching the "gender" variable on that blank slate doesn't really matter if the rest of the story's good. Of course, there would also certainly be some interest for a story which actually takes femHarry as its point-of-departure and realistically builds from it, though I can't weigh quite how much.

But at any rate, you certainly won't get laughed at by default for a fem!Harry fic round these parts, if that's what you're getting at.

***** A lot of them, as said above, pretty much use "Harry" as a blank slate for an OC with Harry's backstory. That said, a few excellent (very popular) ones, off the top of my head:\\
- *Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus*, by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1318815/The-Carnivorous-Muffin][The Carnivorous Muffin]]: linkffn(9911469);\\
- *When Harry Met Tom*, also by The Carnivorous Muffin: linkffn(12793151) - *The Pureblood Pretense*, by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3489773/murkybluematter][murkybluematter]]: linkffn(7613196);\\
- *crawlersout*, by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1134943/slexenskee][slexenskee]]: linkffn(10942056)

If you're into crossovers, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2221413/Tsume-Yuki][Tsume Yuki]] also does a ton of fem!Harry that you might enjoy. If you're /really/ into crossovers, you could check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5382000/nordiamus][nordiamus]]'s *Game On!* linkffn(11799646) as an example of "really just the backstory."

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

******* Yeah, fair enough. In defence of these stories, though, the first two are more "intense fixation on each other" than anything resembling a romantic relationship (*Art of Being Sisyphus* is about fem!Harry spending a lot of time talking to the Horcrux in her head; *When Harry Met Tom* features a fem!Harry who's totally creeped out by schoolboy!Tom's fascination with her).

And despite the description, *crawlersout* is a parental fem!Harry & Tom relationship, definitely not romantic (though he does fixate on her).

********* Hmm, *Art of Being Sisyphus* has a diary!Tom show up maybe 250k words in, for the CoS arc... but by that point you're so deep into the absurdity that it doesn't really count. It's a doozy of a surrealist fic.

I totally agree with you that having an evil returned-Voldemort (at age, like, a million) come and hook up with 15-year-old fem!Harry is very creeptastic. I also personally can't stand stories where Harry just decides to forgive or worse, join up with the unrepentantly evil characters (ie Voldemort or various Death Eaters), /especially/ when that then becomes a relationship based on nothing.

What exactly can I expect from a femHarry fic? I've never read any such fics so I'm a bit uneducated on it. In my mind, if it's a new character altogether who's taking the place of the lead then isn't that just an OC-centric fic? How are they different? /Are/ they different? So many questions!

#+end_quote

Surely that depends on the specific fic and author.

For myself, I would want Harry to have a different personality, not just anatomy. Consider how being a girl might lead her to respond differently to similar events. Would Dudley's gang respond differently to her? What about Petunia and Vernon and Marge Dursley - and would each of them react differently to each other? Would Harry have different relationships with primary school teachers? Which dormmates would she have at Hogwarts?

But each author will do their own thing.

**** The difference from an OC centric fic would be simply a lot of stories still have the Dursley's raising them and them having similar upbringings and things like that. One thing in my experience you'll expect is a lot of names that give the author an excuse to have her be called Harry/Harri or Harriet or have flower names as some Evans family tradition or something.

** As Achille-Talon said, you won't get a negative reaction; not on this sub at any rate. I've seen people post recommendations or request fem!Harry fics, and they are always received positively.

However, like OC focused or "Wrong Boy Who Lived" fics, it's not a widely popular subset of Harry Potter fanfiction. Your fic may not get as much of a readerbase, but don't let that hold you back from sharing.

** It isn't clear exactly what you are asking. Are you asking if Fem!Harry is taken seriously in the fandom? Or on this reddit in particular?

Just as a note, *Reddit not generally used for fic reviews:* We get them from time to time, but usually people who want direct, immediate feedback use other locations (such as the chat based options).

​

Everyone has different interests, Fem!Harry comes up here from time to time. There are a few items that can be common in such fics that get... frown on here. Quite rightly IMO.

For example, Pillars of Canon (where the story is just a rehash of canon) tend to be looked down upon here. That tends to hit one of the pretty common "It is the same story, but with Harry being a girl". Mostly because HP is an extremely plot-driven series, and many situations are already contrived. Thus, anything trying to stick close to canon ends up being a virtual rehash. (Compare this to character driven universes, where if you change the character even a little, it makes perfect sense you get radically different outcomes).

I wouldn't say Fem!Harry fics get any overscruntiny, although the 'common pitfalls' are different for such fics vs fanfic at large.

Are you talking about BornAGirl!Harry or GenderTransformed!Harry? Surprisingly, the first one seems to be the more common one in HP Fanfic, where in most other fanficiton you get more of the second. They have very, very different pitfalls.

As a gut feeling with little basis other than the reaction to my fem!Harry fic vs. my previous fics, I'd guess the number to be at around 50% for fem!Harry - a similar rate of attrition as if you choose to write slash.

** It really depends on the writing and whether the author takes the change seriously. Being female is more than secondary sex characteristics - it's also different cultural expectations, different upbringing, psychology, puberty process, etc. The simplest and earliest difference would be the Dursley's would be less likely to be able to get away with Fem Harry wearing Dudley's castoffs without the neighbours commenting about how Petunia didn't know how to raise a 'normal' girl or being too cheap to buy her feminine clothing. Bullying from Dudley and gang would also be different.

** So, um... while still not quite convinced there's any point to it, I'm posting the notes I've been compiling for the past few days. I had to split it into three parts due to the comment length limit.

Here goes. *presses Comment, covers head and braces himself for negative reactions*

​

The core divergence point from canon would be Lily deciding to have muggle ultrasound during her pregnancy (the technology dates back to the sixties, so it should be available at this time), which reveals that she's pregnant with a girl. At this point, the prophecy has already been made and the Potters are aware of it, as well as the fact that they and the Longbottoms are the only candidates. But the prophecy explicitly talks about the vanquisher of Voldemort as a male, yet the Potters having a daughter would mean that the Longbottoms' child is the one the prophecy talks about by process of elimination. As the Potters are friends with the Longbottoms, Lily and James decide to pull off an extremely risky gambit and hide their child's gender, going to the extent of Liliy giving birth at home without a midwife and giving the child a male name (hence Harry is still named Harry). The point being that with two possible targets, there's a 50-50 chance Voldemort will go after the wrong child - and Voldemort indeed takes the bait once he catches wind of a Fidelius being used to hide one target and correctly assumes Dumbledore knows something he doesn't. Dumbledore is the only one outside the family who's in the know about Harry, nobody else knows. Not even Sirius.

​

Fast forward ten years. Harry has been relentlessly teased and bullied over her gender-mismatched name by the other kids, causing her to grow up quiet and reclusive. Not the cool kid kind, the depressed child kind. While the other children are animatedly socializing, Harry can usually be seen silently leaning against the wall in the background, paying attention but not butting in unless someone asks her something. She's not antisocial, she just dislikes being the center of attention because it more often than not meant bad things (NOT because of her gender, because of her name) and is highly insecure about her first name, more than Tonks ever was. The latter part is exacerbated even further by Petunia having been aware of James' prankster nature via hearsay from Lily, causing Harry to assume her name was an extremely bad-taste joke. However, she is NOT a fragile wallflower by any means just because she's a girl; she is more than capable of both asskicking and calling people out if she's pushed to it. At age 11, Harry is still androgynous enough to pass for a boy but by her mid-teens, there'd be no ambiguity anymore, even though she's still plain-looking and nothing unusual in terms of endowment.

​

After the stress of bullying causes one accidental magic incident too many, Vernon starts demanding that they get rid of the freak; Petunia, more afraid of Dumbledore than of her husband, refuses. This causes Vernon to get pissed and pull a low blow by accusing Petunia of secretly harboring sympathy to Harry due to the latter's gender, which in turn pisses Petunia off royally. Their marriage enters a downwards spiral and after multiple fights and a few years of toxic atmosphere, ultimately results in Vernon filing for a divorce, with Petunia moving to a downtown apartment with the kids. She justifiably becomes bitter and develops a drinking problem, but there's no domestic violence and she just plain doesn't care what Harry does in her free time (which is usually roaming the streets); although Vernon has visitation rights, Harry makes sure to spend the day away from home every time he comes over to see Dudley in order to avoid running into him.

​

When the Hogwarts letter arrives, it's Harry who finds it first but after reading it, she assumes it's a prank and throws it in the trash, which is where Dudley finds it and brings it to Petunia's attention. Once again, Petunia is too afraid of the consequences to not let her go. Even once Harry is on the Express, she still half-expects that everything is just a prank at her expense (which causes the Sorting Hat to break out into hysterical laughter upon being put on her head) and it takes a few weeks to settle in that yes, this is for real. Although she still runs into Ron and Hermione, her name isn't revealed until she's called at the Sorting because she spends the train ride wearing a hoodie.

​

Due to not being of the expected gender, Harry has to go through some extra identification tests at Gringotts. Although the goblins are satisfied with the result and consider the matter closed, they still forward the paperwork of the anomaly to the Ministry, who quietly have some legilimency experts verify that Harry is not lying about being Harry Potter and her mind hasn't been tampered with to make her believe that she is. This also brings to light the treatment Harry got from the Dursleys but again, there was no domestic violence, so the DMLE simply shrugs and lets the matter go because it's outside their jurisdiction and the root cause of the Dursleys' discrimination is such that they can't involve muggle child protection services without the Statute of Secrecy getting in the way. Her gender only hits the news after the Sorting, with the Ministry adding the DMLE's analysis as proof that Harry really is who she claims herself to be and not just an impostor. Needless to say, this causes quite a stir in the public and quite a major annoyance to Harry due to all the stares and whispering.

​

In terms of inheritance, there's only one Gringotts vault and while it has enough funds that she doesn't have to work for the rest of her life as long as she keeps her spending conservative, she's not ultra-wealthy. As a member of an old family, she has observer status at the Wizengamot (that is, she can attend and observe the proceedings if she wishes, but has no say in the proceedings, ie. no voting or speaking) but is not required to exercise it (most who have the same right don't) and she's perfectly fine with that. She has no other legal or political rights or obligations due to her heritage.

​

Although it's probably going to be a controversial decision, I'm firmly of the intention of *no bashing*. Not on my watch. Not even Dumbledore. In fact, Ron would mention Dumbledore's three major positions early on; slightly later, Hermione would mention only two, Ron would butt in about him being ex-ICW, to which Hermione would clarify that the Ministry offered him the position but he refused and when they tried to force the issue by giving him the position anyway, he resigned on the spot and simply returned to Hogwarts without an explanation. Harry would later (still in first year) ask Dumbledore why did he do that because she can guess that it's an important position, to which Dumbledore would mock-frown and reply that because being Headmaster is fun. The actual reason is because Dumbledore is sick and tired of people assuming him to be a super-badass because of his past and constantly running to him whenever something's on fire, instead of proactively solving their problems themselves rather than waiting for a hero to do it for them. He's only sticking around to make sure Voldemort is six feet under for real before retiring to throw his feet up and enjoy his twilight years in well-earned peace as the tired elder he is.

​

As for Neville, he develops a bit of a hero worship on Harry after she unintentionally gets Draco off his back in first year (she negatively compares Draco harassing Neville to a muggle bully and Draco shifts his ire to her due to the perceived insult of being likened to a muggle). It's mostly unobtrusive, but Harry still finds it annoying - though not to the extend of telling him to stop it. Similar deal with Ron, as his constant blathering makes Harry initially assume that he's self-centered; this opinion is changed after the Chamber of Secrets incident where Ron awkwardly thanks her for her involvement and Harry warms up to him a bit for showing concern for Ginny.

*** For Hermione, the troll incident goes down differently. When the warning comes out, Harry goes back to the dorm without a fuss, insisting to herself that it's not her business. But her guilt doesn't let her be, so she sneaks out to find Hermione anyway. In the end, they get saved by the timely arrival of McGonagall, who promptly demonstrates that she isn't Dumbledore's right-hand woman for nothing and swiftly kills the troll by spearing it through the head with bathroom taps transfigured into iron spears, then transfiguring the spears to erupt into spikes in every direction to messily reduce the troll's brain into swiss cheese. Moral of the lesson: don't mess with the granny who teaches magic to others because chances are, she's competent enough at her profession to kill people with it in a hundred different ways. Hermione is particularly impressed and afterwards holds McGonagall in very high regard, not for being an authority figure but for being a powerful yet moral and compassionate witch (after hearing out the girls, she sends them to Poppy for a Calming Draught then back to the dorms without docking points because Hermione didn't even get the warning and thus wasn't at fault while Harry initially did as told and only disobeyed out of conscience).

​

This incident would be what sets up the general characterization of Harry when it comes to heroics. She tries to get out from under it, insisting both to herself and to others that it's not her business, but when the chips are down for real and it's time to make a stand, she comes running while silently berating herself for it. She still has the Saving People Thing, but is in denial and refusal about it because she doesn't want to risk her neck, but her stupid conscience keeps making life harder for her. This is exactly why the Sorting Hat sends her to Gryffindor: true courage is facing adversity not without but in spite of fear and her helping others isn't by choice, it's who she is. He'd later state that he was sorely tempted with Hufflepuff as his second choice.

​

Speaking of the Chamber of Secrets incident. Although Harry was initially annoyed by Ginny's treatment of her, the same as Neville's, the shared trauma of this incident (both have trouble sleeping for a time and Harry develops a minor phobia of snakes) results in the two bonding extremely closely to the point where Ginny explicitly calls Harry the big sister she never had and Harry reciprocates in kind. No slash, but bed sharing and bathing together at the Burrow is a thing, so there are still accusations (and Ginny tends to be the more outspoken one when defending them both). Still, Ginny is a major positive influence on Harry and they're straight-up BFFs.

​

The prophecy doesn't become a factor until the end of the fourth year, when things start spinning out of control. The attempt to falsely enter Harry into the Tournament fails because Harry very vehemently and explicitly declines to participate, refusing to budge from this position even after being warned of possible consequences. This forces Crouch Jr.'s hand to taking a more direct approach; no details yet, but both Harry and Neville end up in the cemetery. During the ritual, Harry and Wormtail get into a scuffle, Neville attempts to interfere but gets (non-lethally) stabbed by Wormtail, which causes Harry to flip out, tackle Wormtail to the ground and bash his skull in with a rock, killing him. Except as it turns out, Neville's blood fell into the cauldron, which completes the ritual and resurrects Voldemort - except Harry still has Lily's protection, meaning she's untouchable to Voldemort's magic. Abusing this fact to become a human shield for Neville, the two manage to escape.

​

It's at this point where Dumbledore comes clear to both of them about the prophecy and the circumstances of the Potters' deaths. Harry naturally demands to know why she was sent to live with Petunia and in addition to explaining the blood protection, Dumbledore also admits that he hoped to keep Harry uninvolved and spared of any more suffering. As far as the prophecy is involved, Harry is a non-entity. She is not bound by this fate and doesn't have to act in accordance with it, so she's free to walk away. Except even once Voldemort knows the truth, he still keeps going after Harry to make an example out of her, the one who dared to wound him, declaring Neville to be of lower priority. Not that this prevents Neville from being scared shitless by the revelation that he has to face He Who Must Not Be Named in a life-or-death fight only one of them will walk away from, coupled with the one-two punch of being told that he's the reason why Harry is an orphan. Harry doesn't blame him, she blames her parents for coming up with such a crazy plan in the first place, though she understands their reasoning and admits that she probably would've done the same if her own friends would've been involved.

​

So with Voldemort forcing her hand and Harry knowing for a fact that she cannot kill him, Harry decides to stick together with Neville on the off chance that her anti-Voldemort protection as Neville's human shield will give Neville enough of an edge to do what he's fated to do, to say nothing of the fact that although Harry doesn't exactly like her parents' decision, she admits that if Neville bites the dust, Lily and James will have died for nothing. This decision causes Dumbledore to suspect he may have overlooked something in the prophecy, chews through the wording one more time and comes to the conclusion that Harry may not be as uninvolved as he thought. Specifically, the prophecy says Neville is the only one who can do the job, but nothing about by what means he'll achieve it. Or whose means. Because as a wild card third party who chooses to involve herself out of compassion for her chosen side, rather than force or admiration, Harry is a companion to Neville the likes of which Voldemort does not - and never did - have. In other words, Dumbledore has a not entirely unfounded suspicion that Harry might *be* Neville's Power-He-Knows-Not, an ally who isn't in the prophecy's wording but can still indirectly influence its outcome by way of her blood protection allowing her to intevene in Neville's favor as his Shieldmaiden (title drop).

​

But then again, this is only Dumbledore's speculation and the nature of prophecies is such that he has no way of knowing if he's right or wrong. But he doesn't fail to notice that by their late teens, the hero has a bit of a crush towards his Shieldmaiden who isn't exactly averse to the idea herself, especially with Ginny having also noticed and subtly playing matchmaker between rounds of teasing. Smut is not on the table right now and H/N is definitely not going to be official until seventh year. No other pairings are planned to be in focus and I ain't touching Snape or Draco with a barge pole.

**** Some additional minor points:

- Harry is fairly bright, but not genius-level. Her main academic difficulty is lack of motivation to perform beyond expectations. Even when she's asked what job she wants to have in the future, she can't answer because she honestly hadn't thought that far. She has no grand dreams or aspirations, she just... drifts. What she initially sees in the Mirror of Erised is herself chilling out in peace without anyone bothering her, with the image later changing to include her friends also chilling out in the background, later changing once again to Ginny and Neville being in the foreground alongside her. She doesn't want power, she doesn't want riches, she just wants the simple things in life and it isn't because she doesn't know any better, it's her choice.
- That being said, she doesn't hesitate to apply force beyond what's strictly necessary when dealing with Death Eaters. She doesn't have any special powers or training aside from the anti-Voldemort protection, but she tends to fight dirty: laying traps and ambushes, blasting through walls, collapsing the ceiling, opening muggle gas valves and chucking fire into the room when the DEs come into the room after her, etc. She never comes at the opposition from head-on and makes heavy use of the Cloak during fights, making her an annoyingly slippery opponent. She still prefers not to kill people but as Wormtail's example above demonstrates, she's not unwilling to rescind that rule if it's personal. It's never her first option, however.
- Harry's anti-Voldemort protection only applies to being directly targeted by harmful spells. He can still use legilimency (but only as long as he's not actively trying to attack her mind with it and it gives him a major headache regardless) or hurt her with the environment, like blasting the ground next to her to hit her with debris, magically hurling debris at her and letting go of the spell before it hits (if he doesn't, it'll still bounce off) or suffocating her by consuming the oxygen in the room with Fiendfyre, but he can't just AK her and be done with it. Harry is protected but she's not invulnerable and she knows it, hence why she fights dirty.
- Harry's unconventional approach to combat would be stated to be coming from Lily. In particular, it would eventually be revealed that according to what the DMLE crime scene investigators who arrived to Godric's Hollow after Voldemort's first demise were able to piece together, Lily knew she had no chance against Voldemort in a magical duel and surprise-attacked him with a muggle weapon (a sawn-off shotgun) but due to her lack of experience with handling it (she had to obtain it illegally due to British gun control laws at the time), she failed to score a kill shot on the first try and didn't have time for a second before an enraged Voldemort literally tore her limb from limb before Crucio'ing her until she expired (he was supremely pissed that the cheeky little mudblood dared to draw his blood with a muggle weapon). The sounds of this execution is what Harry recalls under dementor influence and Snape gets to hear it at one point when he uses legilimency on Harry, massively freaking him out to the point where he actually stops picking on Harry for good.
- While it's probably going to be a highly controversial decision, although Harry still likes the thrill of flying, her aversion to attention means she does not play quidditch at Hogwarts due to performance anxiety. She *can* do it and is an excellent flier, she just *really* doesn't want to do it in front of an audience. The one time she's asked to fill in for someone as an emergency replacement, it takes over an hour of pleading and begging from Wood to convince her to do it just this once, with the result causing Wood to be mobbed by bewildered people demanding to know where the hell has he been hiding her up until now and why the hell didn't he recruit her into the team already. While Harry feels warm and fuzzy from the overwhelmingly positive reaction, she still declines a reserve position on the team and has no plans to go professional after school either.
- Fudge initially appears to be the incompetent buffoon he always has been. However, when Voldemort returns and Harry is giving eyewitness testimony to him and Dumbledore, Fudge suddenly turns dead-serious and pays full attention to her but insists that they can't reveal this to the public or there will be mass hysteria, exactly the kind of atmosphere Death Eaters thrive in, instead proposing to keep things under the lid for now while he discretely alerts the DMLE and Dumbledore reassembles the Order of the Phoenix. Fudge later reveals to Harry that he's been faking his incompetence to honeypot Lucius and collect evidence against the man from within. Problem is, Lucius is not an idiot and is *very* good at hiding his tracks, so Fudge can't bag him just yet for anything other than bribery and extortion, which is nowhere near enough to nail him to the wall for good (even with Fudge documenting every single transaction Lucius sent his way down to the last knut and keeping the money in a separate vault to be turned over as evidence instead of pocketing it). Harry providing memory of Lucius in the cemetery is the turning point, but Fudge doesn't want to spring the trap just yet for fear of alerting the other DEs that he's on to them (though Lucius, again, isn't an idiot and is already starting to suspect something because the Auror Corps mobilized far too quickly after Fudge claimed Harry was too spooked by whatever she had seen to say anything about what happened).

​

So... input? Pointers on what to avoid? Anything? Note that although I haven't written HP yet, I have writing experience in other fandoms.

Gonna have to make sure to explain that one. How would hiding Harry's gender help? Wouldn't making two targets just make it harder to protect?

I've seen the flip of this a few times (a bunch where Lily takes potion to ensure she births a girl, opting out of the prophecy, and one where she casts a spell so everyone magical percieves a (very male) Harry as female). Anyway, just make sure your logic is well explained, as it is not intuitive.

Given the ease of adopting a gender conforming nickname (Harrie), I would suggest making it a bit more malicious (Dursleys/Dudley frustrating any of her attempts to do so). Could just be a one liners, but fits with their characterization.

#+end_quote

Ok, some things to unwrap here.

First, it would be a good way to make Harry more nerdy/studious in her pre Hogwarts years, if you want.

Second, if she is capable of asskicking in that time period, that is a major character divergence, you will want to explain. (I suspect you mean later, not in primary).

Harry was not Canon capable of ass kicking at 11. If your version is, you will have to explain it. It could work (Harry's insecurities mean she spends more time on learning to protect herself, maybe petunia is more willing to let fem!Harry learn self defense. Remember that bullying of a physically superior person takes a bit of a different form (but still happens).

Although what I think you mean here is Harry's normal development occured and she doesn't fall into the wall flower steriotype at Hogwarts?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

As a side note, decide early how much (if any) gender dysphoria you intend to have. Does Harry feel like she should be a boy, simply enjoys having masculine traits, or none at all and is frustrated to have to deal with this at all.

#+begin_quote
  Similar deal with Ron, as his constant blathering makes Harry initially assume that he's self-centered;
#+end_quote

Not clear here, so Harry doesn't befriend Ron on the train and attach to him as 'first friend'?

#+begin_quote
  In the end, they get saved by the timely arrival of McGonagall
#+end_quote

Having Harry not heroicly saving Hermione kinda undermines the whole 'she is as badass as normal' thing you said earlier. Does she still jump on the back of the troll? I suspect you could do both (Harry being stupidly heroic and jumping on troll, but without Ron to knock it out the fight goes on until McGonagall arrives).

If you don't have her be at least as stupidly heroic as Canon, expect people to assume it is because she is female.

#+begin_quote
  Still, Ginny is a major positive influence on Harry and they're straight-up BFFs.

So are you doing a golden trio of Harry/Hermione/Ginny? Just Harry/Hermione? Harry/Hermione/Ron still?

Alternatively, you might want to consider that gender isn't important for the prophecy (although Dumbledore/Lily don't have to necessarily know). i.e. prophecy is more like a vision that gets translated into language by the seer, so depending on the seer there may be translation problems (like using a default him as is common in the English language).

Or you could have that be Voldemort's thinking, as for why he keeps coming after Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Except as it turns out, Neville's blood fell into the cauldron, which completes the ritual and resurrects Voldemort
#+end_quote

Aww but if you use Harry's blood you can have Voldemort revive female for shenanigans! :P

The only other suggestion I have is to consider using Tonks in a mentoring role at some point.

The wording of the prophecy, as [[/u/tediuminahamsterball][u/tediuminahamsterball]] pointed out, explicitly states that Voldemort's nemesis is a male born at the end of July. By date of birth Harry and Neville are both candidates but coupled with the gender, Neville is the one by process of elimination. If Voldemort doesn't know Harry's gender, he thinks he has two targets, meaning there's a 50% chance he'll go after the wrong one, which gives the other one advance warning.

Basically, Lily and James are planning to use themselves and Harry as a decoy for Frank, Alice and Neville. Harry, of course, was not of any age to consent. If that bothers you, that's normal; while I don't normally write my stories around themes because I hate it when a story's plot becomes secondary to the author's intended moral lesson (I'm in it for the story and the characters, not the preaching), if there's a recurring theme in my stories, it's "if a people can only survive by the blood of their children, do such people even deserve to survive?"

#+begin_quote
  Although what I think you mean here is Harry's normal development occured and she doesn't fall into the wall flower steriotype at Hogwarts?
#+end_quote

Yes. I put in that part to preempt people from reading the "quiet and withdrawn" part and immediately accusing me of sexism for seemingly wanting to turn her into a wimp for being a girl.

Let me be perfectly clear here: I don't like female characters who only exist to be eye candy, love interests or accept being told to stand back and let the guys do the hard work because they're girls. I don't mind if they don't doubt themselves sometimes (on the contrary, self-doubt makes a character much more interesting than unbreakable confidence, regardless of gender), but I prefer my female characters strong-willed and proactive, making a lasting impression on the reader rather than being window dressing.

If you're asking me why am I not doing Harry like that, then, the answer is because I'm not that kind of person and can't put myself into such a state of mind to write such a personality in a way that doesn't come off to the reader as inconsistent and borderline schizophrenic.

  So are you doing a golden trio of Harry/Hermione/Ginny? Just Harry/Hermione? Harry/Hermione/Ron still?
#+end_quote

Harry/Hermione at first, then Harry/Hermione/Ginny, then Harry/Ginny/Neville with Hermione still being important.

I have to admit, I have precisely zero idea what to do with Ron or whether to even include him in the story. I don't dislike him, my brain is just drawing blanks at what to do with him in this story. He's nowhere near Hermione in brains and Harry's preference to avoiding danger means she has less need for brawn. Maybe make him equally as capable at coming up with ideas that don't require lexical knowledge as Hermione for ideas that do? You know, stating the simple solution rather than overthinking and overcomplicating it? Streetwise common sense to balance out Hermione's raw intelligence? Possibly more familiar with muggle thinking than in canon, due to Arthur's influence?

If you don't have Harry imprint on him during the train (with the whole first friend thing), you can pretty easily write him out. You'll have to decide if he transfers that to someone else or you do away with it entirely.

...actually, now you've given me an idea. Stays in the background until after the CoS incident, after which when he comes to thank Harry for saving Ginny, he adds that if there's anything Harry needs him for, anything at all, he's at her disposal because his sister's life is worth more to him than just one unlimited favor. So while he's not in her immediate environment, he's available as an ally she can call upon, kinda like the DA's membership in canon. Add in her later impressing him with her flying skills during one of her visits of the Burrow and there's potential for friendly bonding over quidditch there.

How about this?

** I don't read them, because I don't get the point.

For me, a character's gender is and should be just entirely irrelevant to the plot and characterisation, unless you're specifically telling a story about gender.

As a result, Fem!Harry fics are either

a) written by people who think what's between someone's legs matters

Or

b) specifically written to send some sort of gender related message, usually a hamfisted men r bad women r victims one

So they don't interest me one bit. This is made worse by the fact that the existence of magic, the great equaliser, makes any kind of significant forceful gender roles or differential treatment pointless or impossible.

That being said, if a fic was written where Fem!Harry was just a girl and it had no impact on the story's themes or plot, I'd be open to reading it. Except that in that situation, I'd ask "why gender swap in the first place?"

** First of all, fem!Harry stories firmly follow [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law][Sturgeon's law]], eighty percent of them (or more, probably a way more) is trash. Despite what linkffn(11511190) says, I am afraid crushing majority of them are written just for purposes of smut (many guys fantasize about it from her point of view, I guess), and because the author wanted to write Drarry (or even worse, Harrymort), but they are afraid (or disgusted) to write a slash.

However, I still believe (and if linkao3(4876630) toned down a bit in the smut department, it would be pretty close) there is something in fem!Harry which could be useful (meaning, geneder-bender Harry; natural Harriet Potter is another thing, which I don't care about much at all). It can be a bit of study in feminism, in Harry's sudden recognition how world could be different and a way less pleasant when seen from the other side. “Oh shut, that's what Hermione was on about all the time? Yeah, it really sucks!” (and I don't mean just PMS).

*** *Sturgeon's law*

Sturgeon's revelation (as originally expounded by Theodore Sturgeon), commonly referred to as Sturgeon's law, is an adage commonly cited as "ninety percent of everything is crap." The sentence derives from quotations by Sturgeon, an American science fiction author and critic; although Sturgeon coined another adage that he termed "Sturgeon's law," the "ninety percent crap" remark has become Sturgeon's law.

The phrase was derived from Sturgeon's observation that while science fiction was often derided for its low quality by critics, the majority of examples of works in other fields could equally be seen to be of low quality, and that science fiction was thus no different in that regard from other art forms.

However, I once read one where Neville is the BWL (which made sense to me as I think Voldy 's ego would prevent him from marking a girl as an equal, or rather he would see Neville as an equal as opposed to seeing Harry weak), and James is the traitor secret keeper, and obviously everyone hates her, but she's just so cool, in this fic! I forgot the name of this fic, and really the only non fan service Fem!harry fic I've read to date.

I find GWL fics (I've read till now) questionable because I believe Voldemort would have marked Neville "as his equal".

I also detest Fem!Harry fic , that are written simply for the purpose of a pair off with Cedric, Draco etc.

I also believe a Girl!Harry would be brave, loyal, kind, fierce, everything her male counterpart embodies, and I don't see why Authors would write off a weak-minded Fem!Harry all of a sudden, in which she's nothing like her canon counterpart (Even if she's in a different house, I expect her to still have "Harry" in her.)

*** voldemort made bellatrix his second in command, and actively got pissed off when she died, as opposed to anyone else. what fucking ego (read: sexism?) are you even seeing in the guy? i mean shit, he's at least got egalitarianism going for him or whatever in canon! dude's canonically all for gender equality. as long as you're useful and strong he don't give a shit. voldemort canonically would have no issue marking a girl if he thought she was a better fit than neville.

**** yes! exactly Bellatrix was an exception because she was strong. His senior death eaters are all men. Also, how would he determine that baby potter is strong? You mean stronger than Neville magically?

Canonical proophecy refers to the baby as a boy:

"...he Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not..."

Unless you chose to Change Trelawney's prophecy for the sake of fanon, the prophecy does clearly specify the Gender.

And, my problem is that if you are making a GWL, then make a strong character out of her! (I still don't agree with GWL setting because of prophecy and Voldemort's fallacy in choosing a boy over a girl)

****** Yes, English isn't my first language but doesn't mean I don't understand what you are saying. I was stating my points in order, to prove that , no way will voldy know girl Harry is stronger, unlike in Bellatrix's case. Now I'm asking you, why wouldn't he go after Neville or Why would he go after a girl Harry when Prophecy clearly mentions a "He" pronoun. Why would he go after the girl if he has no way of "measuring" magical strength of the babies.

In canon, he just chose Harry due to combination of factors including that he's a half blood. And when I meant by "fallacy" , I mean it.

He chose Harry, which is neither right nor wrong, he simply did it, that's why I used the word fallacy. This is especially true if Harry had been a girl. He would simply choose Neville for the same reason he chose Harry ( Choosing a male vs choosing a half-blood, aka choosing someone who Voldy relates to more). This is why I have a problem with GWL, now I'm willing to accept GWL if Voldy's also a woman.
