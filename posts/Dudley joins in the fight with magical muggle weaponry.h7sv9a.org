I read a fic a long time ago that had Vernon and Petunia killed by Death Eaters, after Dudley and Harry reconciled, and then Dudley joins Harry and uses magical weapons to fight along with the light forces. Anyone know this fic or something similar?

​

(flaring this as a request because I would love any stories like this one as well )

​

Thanks!

  A childhood love, combined with magical experimentation, and a determination to see his project brought to life. This was all it took to change the world...forever. (A/N: Based on numerous reviews, 'suspension of belief' is evidently required to enjoy this story)
