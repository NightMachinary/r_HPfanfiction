As written in the title - is it possible to crossover Harry Potter and the Dune series and do justice to both source materials (i.e. no bashing, no nerfing and no over powering either side)?

And if it's almost impossible to cross them, what would a HP fic in style of Dune look like?


** I think it's a fascinating idea. I've seen other HP fanfics set in a space faring future, so it's certainly not beyond the realm of possibility. Personally, I'd enjoy reading that kind of crossover.

I wonder how wizards and witches would have fared in the wake of the Butlerian Jihad. Would the Bene Gesseret breeding program be an attempt to restore magical ability to human beings? Do Mentats gain their prodigious mental abilities from practicing occlumency? Perhaps /melange/ allows humans to temporarilly tap into their latent magical genes.

I think any melding of the Harry Potter and Dune universes would require a lot of intense world building, but it could make for an excellent story.

*** Thanks, but this is the reason why I asked is it possible to write a Dune crossover. This fic is bad.

** In *Firebird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy*, Lily has visions of her future son and his role in the world.

Harry, his abilities and birth are manufactured in a similar way to Paul Atreides, but on a smaller scale.

** I do not think it is possible in a way that does justice to both source materials.

1. One is about power and survival, the other about love and sacrifice. It's Nietzsche and Jesus. Not compatible without compromise.
2. Harry Potter would be dead within five minutes, as would every other character from the wizarding world in the Dune universe. A wand doesn't help you if you don't see you enemies coming, especially if you don't know who the enemy is. They are too naive and don't understand politics.
3. Pretty much every character in the Dune books would be capable of taking over the Wizarding world within a month of arriving in Diagon Ally.
4. The Kwisatz Hadderach is ridiculously overpowered.

** "These people have been infected with a religious purpose, I can tell," Jessica whispered to her son. "It was done long ago, but the particulars don't match up with what I was taught to expect... I am not sure to what degree I can manipulate them, or ensure our survival."

"ARE YOU A BENE GESSERIT WITCH OR NOT?!" roared Paul.
