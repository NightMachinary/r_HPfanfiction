I just read a fanfic (dramione) where there is a slight Hansy relationship in the story. That got me hook because originally Im more of a Dramione/Blinny reader but after reading how the author made them interact got me intrigue. Does anyone got any good suggestions? Any thoughts about the pairing?


** You're The One That I Want - linkffn(2481656) - Is the only not terrible one I know of. Most that I've read are in a similar vain as this.

  set five years after the end of the war following a line where harry and ginny don't get married and instead harry and pansy build a relationship. told in alternating perspectives from pansy and hermione.

  Hermione can't... she can't work out their relationship. They seem comfortable with each other, their elbows are touching and Harry's hand is on Pansy's knee, and there's something when they look at each other. No, she doesn't get it at all. When Harry stands to get the next round Pansy touches his arm and asks him to "get her a Gillywater, darling" and Harry nods, his hand brushing across the top of her head, the term of supposed endearment going unnoticed, as though it's used regularly. Hermione wonders what he calls her in return.
