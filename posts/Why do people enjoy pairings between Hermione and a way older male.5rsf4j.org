I'm genuinely curious why people enjoy pairings like HG/SS or HG/LM. I don't read them myself but I'd like to understand the reasoning behind it and what makes it appealing.


** I'd guess that because HP canon lacks well developed characters outside of a small core of the ensemble, so when people want to pair Hermione with someone darker and edgier than Ron, their options are fairly limited. Hermione, of course, is the most readily identifiable girl/woman in HP, so of course she's shipped with everyone. Draco? Yeah, sure, never seen that one before. There are allegedly other Slytherins her age, or slightly varying in years, but in most cases that's pretty much gonna be writing an OC since canon doesn't linger on Slytherins much.

So that mostly leaves the Death Eaters and Lord V himself for your dahk and ejjy needs, and most of them are actual legit terrorists, which is a bit too dahk and ejjy for a romance fic (usually). So that leaves people affiliated with those groups, who are developed enough to be interesting, but who are not necessarily the people torturing Muggles for fun.

Oh boy... that's a very short list indeed, discounting the lesbian options. Mostly just Snape and Lucius Malfoy, actually, and the fact they're played by Jason Isaacs and Alan Rickman really doesn't hurt the appeal. So it's not necessarily that the guy has to be way older, just that the process of elimination has made the older guys seem like an obvious option for a character who is shipped with everyone.

Oh and...

*** If they want someone who is older and hot there's always Tonks or Fleur. For men the prospects look worse but there's Sirius if you go for looks or Lupin if it should be the ugly duckling. Well of course there are the Black sisters, but we already have plenty of those fics (although I would love to read a good Hermione/Andi fic).

***** Because we are looking at a good character for a pairing and not at reality. A Hurt/Comfort setting is interesting in fiction but not so much in reality (unless you are into that kind of stuff). And since everyone in fanfiction takes the movie actors for their image how a character looks like (especially Emma Watson) and not the book descriptions Sirius is in the race.

Also let's look at the competition. There's the guy who turns into a werewolf every month, which is described as rather painful, and there's Mr. look at this technology. If you look a little further we have Mr. creepy crush, Great-great-great grandfather and the half goblin. And that's about it.

**** I did mention that the lesbian option doesn't really occur or appeal to that demographic, as far as I can tell. Femslash is kinda niche (sadly imo), though less so now than it used to be.

All I meant is, if you want to write a story about 'dahk and ejjy' het love, which Gary Oldman is decidedly not, then you're basically stuck with Draco and his goons at Hermione's age (again, disregarding Pansy and the various character-in-name-onlys like Blaise and Daphne). Assuming they don't want to write Dramione, the next stopping point is Snape, because 'hot for teacher' is a fairly common trope, and dat Alan Rickman tho. Who else is dark enough, but not a complete psycho? Lucius has been around from book 2, iirc, and gets more lines than a lot of the other DEs. Hermione getting captured in book 7 is a convenient outlet for a lot of peoples' D/s fantasies, only with magical terrorists in this case, and it's only logical that Lucius would be at the forefront of that after Snape.

I'm not saying shipping Hermione with marauders doesn't happen, because it does, but most interesting guys in this series are old enough to be her father either way. Hence all the time travel shenanigans and stuff to get her to be with them.

Me? I'll be over here with the lesbian option, kthx :)

***** In my opinion, the universe lacks decent guys. I mean there's Harry and Neville.

Ron is a deserter and no sane person would welcome him back after the second time, especially considering Ron owed his life to Harry at the moment he left the tent.

Sirius is fucked up by twelve years in Azkaban.

Remus is a complete failure. He abandoned Harry as a child and then does not offer help during the tournament and still does not check up on Harry. He also wanted to run away from his pregnant wife.

Snape is a bastard. His behavior towards students is inexcusable. He also fucked the entire country with his NEWT course requirements.

Dumbledore (I mean, I have seen him paired) is responsible for many innocents being dead. I bet he (hypothetically) killed more innocents than most SS members.

Well, and most Death Eaters are just murdering, raping, torturing and corrupt scum.

** Some people like relationships, or the thought of relationships, with older people. Older men are specifically romanticized a lot, and in a lot of mainstream television and literature there's talk about the appeal of the silver fox, after all.

A lot of readers identify with Hermione, and part of what defines her character is that she's often interpreted as being older than her years as a result of her intelligence and her focus upon working hard towards her goals. Hermione and Harry (and Ron, though I don't see him at the centre of pairings like this very often) appeal to readers as people who are older than their years because of the war, and for whatever reason might then be interested in the company of someone older rather than someone their age.

Lucius Malfoy and Severus Snape are some of the options; then you see the people that ship them with Remus Lupin or Sirius Black, or with Narcissa. There are very few older characters that are anything approaching well-developed, so Lucius and Severus are obviously going to be popular targets.

A lot of the romance around Lucius is centred not just around his being a Death Eater or a member of the Dark Side, but around his being a member of the aristocracy. Tall, pale, well-spoken, well-dressed, and focused in politics.

Is Lucius Malfoy a good person? No. Is Severus Snape? No. Is their relative "goodness" or popularity with the average straight man relevant to the people who most often write them in pairings? Also no.

Fanfics like these are probably written by people who'd actually be interested in Lucius or Severus, or actual equivalents in real life, to be honest. There's a lot of mystique around the older man - and they're not really "way" older. There's only 20 years or so between the two of them and Hermione - especially in the wizarding world, that could potentially be a far, far bigger gap.

** Why does anyone like anything? There is something about this pairing or that mental image which appeals to the individual.

I do notice that (as often happens) when people query this sort of pairing the two examples given are Severus Snape and Lucius Malfoy - people don't seem to have the same issues around Remus Lupin, despite him being the same age as Snape. Perhaps because he is a "good" guy?

For my two cents, my interpretation of the source material leads me to think my preferred pair make sense - I look at them and see the points of conjunction. Other people look at that same material through the lens of their experience and simply see something different.

However, I will also point out the whole May/December romance is nothing new. For example, "Sense and Sensibility" has the much-lauded romance between Maryanne and Colonel Brandon and there is the same age difference there as between Hermione and Lupin/Sirius/Snape. PLUS Maryanne was 16 when they met in the story and although not stipulated she was most likely 17 or 18 when they married. While social mores have moved on from what they were in the Edwardian period the argument could be made that same does not hold true for the Wizarding world.

*** Hermione and Lily Evans have some similarities, don't they? Maybe that attracts Snape to her in those stories? Both Gryffindors, both excel at schoolwork, both date and then marry a male in Gryffindor who had spent most of his career at Hogwarts goofing off instead of focusing on studying, etc.

**** I know the whole Snape/Granger thing is a big squick for some because of the age gap or because he was once her teacher but neither of those cause me distress (my husband is 11 years my junior) and oddly I always thought they would make a pretty good match based upon character traits.

Both are clever, driven, loyal and ruthless when required. Hermione can be quite sarcastic (although never quite as biting as Snape). I think Snape had his emotional development arrested pretty early having essentially gone straight back into school after finishing and watching the same petty dramas unfold again and again, whereas Hermione is fairly adept and insightful regarding emotional mechanics so the two are not as unequal as it may seem at first blush..

On his behalf, Lily Evans was a kind, clever and brave. Ticks on all 3 for Hermione.

From her side of the fence we know she finds his aesthetic appealing because black haired, hook nosed, and sallow skinned (not to mention surly) are all applied to Viktor Krum (as well as Severus of course) and she liked him well enough. So... I guess that's why I find it works.

***** Eh, I'm just not a fan since Snape's a dick. Being a spy against the Nazis doesn't really excuse you from exterminating Jews, for me. I doubt that Voldemort just hands out Dark Marks to whoever, presumably there's some sort of initiation, and I'm not sure that being a double-agent really excuses you from committing murder, at the least.

****** *shrug* That's kind of the point of my original post.

You feel one way about the material and I don't, (I have zero interest in arguing my viewpoint, I feel no need to justify my stance and wish you all the best in yours).

There is no "right" way to engage. Ultimately it really doesn't matter what rings your bells or turns you off. There is no fandom Thought Police coming to stop anyone from indulging in their favourite pairings and genres. So feeling the need to assert this or that position on a character is unnecessary.

******* Hooray, thoughtful discussion. I do like stories that actually give Snape some development of his time with the Death Eaters, why he became disillusioned with the cause other than just, "I'm the reason my ex-best friend was killed." But I don't think canon-Snape would work out well with Hermione, just like canon-Harry isn't gay, so I can't justify reading slash fics that don't have any internal justification.

Personal preference I guess, like most things. There's enough things in the world to get worked-up over, no need to add Harry Potter fanon to the list.

******** I couldn't agree more.

I like fics that lead me to a deeper understanding of the author's interpretation of character. I may not like the character or feel the same way about them the writer does, but if the author's choices are solid, I'll go along with the ride. When it comes to Snape, I despise a whitewashing, and if he is to be redeemed, I want to see it. I want to see the WORK and the pain that goes with it, on reflection that is true of any character.

I hate it when fics start with a character being in love with someone else "just because" without showing the journey to that realisation.

I prefer that any romance/pairing be B (or C!) story and not the raison d'etre of the piece.

** I assume you're talking about the age difference, not the "pair hermione with Death Eater scum".

First, the age difference isn't that big for wizards and witches. Second, that age difference is not really abnormal. Older male with younger female was actually quite common in the past, in some societies.

What makes it appealing? That's entirely a matter of personal taste. You might as well ask why some people like or dislike coffee, or apples, or peanut butter.

*** So Hermione is this mirror who's easy to identify with and can reflect whatever aspect the author wants because she's the main female character to some degree.

To tag on, a lot of the people writing are either teenagers or older. If they're teenagers, they see themselves and Hermione as mature are aren't old enough to be squicked out by the age power imbalance. So they ignore the age difference to throw her with someone who's her intellectual equal and not as obviously immature as Harry or Ron.

Older women writers can use what you said about the age difference not being that big for witches and wizards and are also drawing on our cultural tropes about romance that excuse age differences to throw Hermione with someone they would find interesting because again, so often Hermione isn't Hermione as much as she's just the coolest female character to write about.
