Basically, post-war stories in which Rita (or any other person) publishes an 'expose' on Harry, his adventures at Hogwarts and his childhood. I know of two, currently:

linkffn(8553100) And another one in which the Weasley Aunt is involved.

Are there any others?

  All was well. Truly, it was. Harry Potter was so happy that not even Rita Skeeter's newest biography could spoil things. Okay, fine, so maybe he'd 'forgotten' to mention parts of his past to his loved ones. It wasn't like this disaster could end in Azkaban sentences or pygmy puff invasions, right? Right. He was worrying about nothing. --- Pre-Epilogue, canon ships.
