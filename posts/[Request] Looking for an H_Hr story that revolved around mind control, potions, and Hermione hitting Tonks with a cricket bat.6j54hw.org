** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3807777/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Acts-of-Betrayal]]) no clue if this is it or not. Just googled Harry Hermione fanfiction "cricket bat" and that seemed the best.

  The Semiclassic 'everyone has been lying to Harry about everything' plot. Very AU. Bashing of pretty much everyone. Mind Control Sex. Language. Dumbledore decides the Old Families won't tolerate the Chosen One being with a mudblood. Sucks to be Ron Ginny
