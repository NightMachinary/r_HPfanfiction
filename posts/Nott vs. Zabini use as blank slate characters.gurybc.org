I looked to see if this was discussed elsewhere here and didn't see anything. I apologize if I didn't look enough.

Many stories use Theodore Nott or Blaise Zabini as "good guy" Slytherins in fics because they are an unknown entity. Essentially an OC with a canon name. In these cases I prefer when they use Zabini over Nott purely because I find the name prettier. Any thoughts or inconsequential preferences?


** I like using Zabini as a more morally neutral character, because we know Nott's family was death eaters.

** I mean, Canon strongly suggests that both are blood purists

  "A lot of boys like her," said Pansy, watching Malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction. "Even you think she's good-looking, don't you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to please!

  "I wouldn't touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like," said Zabini coldly, and Pansy looked pleased. Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair.

  "Granger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth-Granger, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?"

  "No. I don't think so, sir. I'm Muggle-born, you see."

  Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something; both of them sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.

*** I enjoy AUs just as well as canon based stories, and I also enjoy fics where the Slytherin pretends to be a blood purist to save his/her skin. Imagine living with people raised to think murdering and torturing others who disagree with them is ok, when you are one who disagrees with them.

** I like to see both Nott and Zabini in a fic, and I think their "fanon" representation (suave Zabini and studious Nott) make them perfect to form a "Slytherin trio" for when Harry is sorted in this house (I think Draco is better as a minor antagonist, at least at first and the political Daphne that form "alliances" in 1st year is a trope that became old pretty fast).

That being said, I have a little preference for Nott. Just his familly name can lead to a lot of plots or sub plots in a fic :

- As a friend, he could invite Harry to his house during the summer, but would Dumbledore let Harry go to the house of a known Death Eater, and if not how could he act on this?
- What choice would Theodore make after the return of Voldemort? Follow his familly or betray their expectations?
- Theodore's dad is supposed to be one of Voldemort's "friend" from his school years (or is that fanon?). Could he be convinced to fight his old friend, or would the heros able to interrogate him to obtain precious informations on Voldemort?

I just like all the possibilities just brought by his presence in a fic.

*** I don't know if that is fanon or not, but if it's not then huh. I didn't think of any of Harry's classmates as having a parent that old. As of his death in DH, Voldemort was 69 yo... eh, about 55 if one doesn't include his time without a body. I understand wizards probably live much longer than muggles, but producing a baby at about 51doesn't enter my mind very often.

** I enjoy stories that use Zabini more because a lot of the time it includes his mother as some black widower. It adds a unique lore element to Zabini that you can't get with Nott who's family is just Death Eaters. And the general fanon character of Zabini being a suave confident person plays off well of Daphne, who is emotionally colder, and Tracey, who is outgoing and energetic.

** Zabini and Nott are like the male counterparts to Daphne and Tracy. They are fairly blank slates, with minor hints of canon characterization to work off of. They aren't as explicitly "bad" as the rest of the Slytherins, and can be written very easily as decent or semi-decent people surviving in Slytherin.

I see Blaise often used for more neutral characters, generally aloof and less involved in conflicts, but also often showing a sense of almost casual cruelty on occassion. Honestly often I think he is written to be the way Draco probably thinks of himself.

Theo is often written as a more gentle character, often abused by his death eater father, who also is often written as having killed his wife. I've seen him written as being highly academic more often than Blaise.

​

Both of them, as in most fics where Slytherin characters have depth rather than being one-dimensional "bad guys" are usually written as having deep seated insecurities and strong facades that hide them.

​

That's of course for fics where they are good or at least sympathetic. For bad Slytherin fics where they play more of a role Blaise is often proud and aristocratic (kind of like the way Draco probably thinks he acts) and very much "above" others. Still very casually cruel. Theo in these fics is generally sadistic, and vicious. Still with that academic leaning, usually making him excel in the dark arts.

​

The two of the them aren't nearly as set in a fanon role as Ice Queen Daphne, but even then, her fanon characterization has worn down with other representations as time has gone on.

​

Personally, I prefer Theo in most fics that have them both.

**** Honestly, partially for similar reasons as yours. I like the name Theo. Almost named one of my cats that, but it wasn't the right fit. I enjoy reading about both versions of each character, but I like sympathetic Theo more as a person. Though if it is a bad Slytherin fic I enjoy reading about the cool calm cruel Blaise more than Theo.

*** Do you think you'd be Slytherin, or is the emphasis on the "had I been"? I'd beg the hat to put me in Hufflepuff but all my family agree I'd be Slytherin. Either way I'd want to avoid the Harry/Draco drama and get to know the blank slate Slytherins and Hufflepuffs. I'm curious about the Ravenclaws too, but the ones who treated Luna bad would not like me one bit. You don't steal a housemate's shoes when they traverse the rocky Scottish terrain.

***** Yeah, I'm ambitious and resourceful, and I value those traits in others which is why my family argues my pleading with the hat wouldn't be enough. It just seems like Hufflepuff would offer less drama.

People like Hagrid consider Hufflepuffs stupid so no one outside the house is going to bother asking for homework and if someone inside the house pesters too much I can chastise them for not working hard enough.

Reading from Harry's POV, Gryffindor house (decor and otherwise) sounds very loud and just, no thank you...

Only reason I don't want to be a Slytherin is the prejudice. People automatically assuming I'm evil, guilty, or blaming me for activities I may or may not have done would be annoying. Well, 2 reasons I guess really, but the second fits for Gryffindor as well. The Gryffindor/Slytherin house rivalry creates a LOT of drama I'd rather just avoid.

So yes, I would beg for Hufflepuff. To the point of whispering it to the hat before putting it on my head in hopes of my sorting not reflecting Draco Malfoy's.

** I've always been confused as to why Nott isn't used more often as an alternative to Draco. He has essentially the same demographic information but isn't restricted by the well-developed characterisation of Draco from canon. Instead people use Draco and then change everything about him that makes him Draco in the first place. Weird.

*** Good point. I don't believe I've ever thought about it before.

I'm writing a story where Snape is a triple agent and put Draco in as a side character. A very small reason I used him is because a lot of fanon has Draco as Snape's godson even though the logic there is a bit sketchy when Snape is 3 and 5 years younger than Draco's parents. If I remember correctly. Now I'm thinking over my character roles.

So far in my story Harry and Draco have only had one interaction and I think Draco is IC from Harry's POV. I want to go back and check now though because if he's not swapping out Draco's name for Theo isn't that big of a deal at this point. Granted it's Gryffindor vs. Slytherin dueling through an abandoned classroom doorway so not hard to keep the characters IC there.

Thank you for bringing these thoughts to my attention! I might swap the boys out just so I don't have to worry about arguing if Draco is being IC when the Trio is around. I don't plan on writing in the Trio much but you never know where a story might go.

**** That sounds really interesting.

The Draco vs Theo equation depends on what you want to do with the character: Draco has inbuilt characterisation and story from canon, so if you want to use that architecture without having to rehash it yourself, Draco is a good pick. If you don't want to use that stuff, it is really just a restriction on where you can take the character and maintain realism, so Theo works better. It all comes down to where you see his arc going.

** Can I join the party?

To be honest, I prefer Theo than Zabini. Why? Hmm, I read Zabini as a prestigious womanizer that can get everything he wants. He was described like that in the 6th book, which I find it hard to fleshed more his character in the good side

I'm disappointed by this fanfic community disrespect Theo. He mostly viewed as an abused son, weak, and has no friends. If you all read Cursed Child, Theo is shown to have knowledge of machinery and magical technology. I always imagined him as some kind of innovator of magical device and a little bit street smart. He might had good access to the folks in Knocturn Alley since he was arrested because of keeping illegal magical tools in his house.

He had more potential to be the /true Slytherin/ and as interesting as Daphne Greengrass imo. I had several headcanons of him and his connection to the Greengrass family. Too bad my writing skill is crap. Sorry for the poor wording
