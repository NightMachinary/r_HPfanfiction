Anyone got any recs for stories featuring Percy Weasely as a main character? In a pairing with Harry, or as a mentor to a more studious Harry, or anything else really.

I don't mind straight or slash or R rated or anything :)

Percy/Penelope, which I never thought would be my cup of tea, but Percy is so wonderfully in character and grows just so much in such a realistic way that this fic will always be one of my favorites.

*** I'm not sure who I ship more, Percy/Oliver, or Marcus/Oliver. Both work really well.

** Well, if you don't mind smut, I've got two Percy/Pansy Parkinson:

linkao3(crash into me by hexmionegranger) is a little more cannon though also definitely more R rated.

linkao3(You Can't Take The Sky From Me by hexmionegranger) is a total AU & a WIP with lots of other plot going on.

I would also check out olivieblake on ao3 id you're even a bit interested in Percy/Pansy (and okay with au's). Her characterization is excellent and she has some great fics!

** I'm on mobile so I'm not sure how to link, but I enjoyed “The Unwinding of Percy Weasley” by Audrey07 and “Order of Mercy” by MandyinKC. They're both Percy/Audrey (who might as well be an OC as we have nothing more than her name) but they're very well written. The first is post-war and the second is during the war and has Bill and Fleur as main characters as well.

*** Ummm... I tried reading that just now, but the ridiculousness kind of made for a sucky story. Really do not recommend.
