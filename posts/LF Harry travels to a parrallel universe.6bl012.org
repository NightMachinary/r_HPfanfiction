I've read this fic before but I can't remember the name of it, if someone could help me out I'd appreciate it. Harry wins the war but loses everything especially the one he loves(Hermione). He travels to another universe where his mother is alive and he has a sister. Ron and Ginny are both in slytherin.

  Harry has won the war and lost everything he held near and dear. In desperation he gambles everything on a dimensional jump. HPHG Bad Weasleys good Dumbledore. Rated for language and implied sex
