Are there any completed fics where Fleur is a badass main character and not treated like the ultimate trophy girl or wife?

** Fleur in “Remember” by sbmcneil linkffn(4936039) is pretty badass. She is not the main character (it is a Hinny story), but she and Bill are literally secondary (not less).

  The summer after the Chamber of Secrets was hard. Why can't Harry remember what happened? Realizing he's missing memories, Harry and Remus set out to find out what happened. What about that red-head he's been dreaming about? Soul-bond fic. H/G, B/F, R/T

** She hasn't done much yet in The Prince of Slytherin, but she was revealed to be a secret agent (arguably a spoiler, but I don't think it'd ruin anything since I can't think of any events that occur prior to its reveal that are directly related to it) so she'll definitely be more competent and involved than in canon

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
