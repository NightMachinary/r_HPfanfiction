If you have a character you want to share with me for this then let me know everything you know about them! Name DOB, shoe size, hogwarts house, aspirations, blood status; basically anything you know about them tell me so i can get an idea of what the character is and how i can weave all these interesting characters into one coherent and entertaining story

FYI; the plan is for the story to have very few if any canonical characters in it but is set in the uk in the wizarding world in (probably) the present day so Harry Potter et al will be part of the world and these characters will likely know of them even if they dont appear in the story

never posted here before, i have set the flair to 'prompt'. if that is wrong then i can change it


** You need to come up with a plot first. Characters are easy as they are only a mean to an end. You want to tell a story and then decide what you need for that.

Just spamming 68684 "characters" into a "story" means that most are just a name and one trait, lacking complexity and they don't feel real. No one is just the "Potion Girl" or "Guy who is good at Quidditch". Characters should only be included if they contribute something to the narrative (world building, friendship, love, an antagonist).

** Is that a story or more of a role playing game though?

** What you are trying to do is less about writing fanfictions and more about world building. I think it's an interesting exercise to invent all kinds of characters, and you can work with other fanfic authors by offering them your characters.

So, do you have anyone specific in mind?

As for my preference, I would begin with children of DA members. Most readers do not like complete strangers because they have absolutely ZERO emotional attachment to them.

*** I'd rather read about complete strangers than the children of the DA, either because I despise the names chosen by Rowling (James Sirius, Albus Severus, Luna's name choices), despise the pairings which created the kids (Ron/Hermione, Lupin/Tonks, Bill/Fleur) or despise the common ways the family relationship as a whole is written (big Weasley family, Delphi Riddle being a monster because her father was one as well, Draco not being imprisoned).

** Sounds like GTA but with Harry Potter. You're not throwing together a story so much as a sandbox of childrens' toys.

And sure, it can be fun, but I don't go get my kid to tell me a good story of why the slinky is wrapped around the troll dolls head, or why the army men are burying the beanie baby in sand.

*** God, this might be the single douchiest comment I've ever seen. Yeah, getting a bunch of OCs together as the first step isn't exactly ideal, but you immediately jumped on it and explicitly compared their storytelling skill to that of a toddler.

**** I wasn't saying their storytelling was that of a child. I have no idea how their storytelling ability is. they could be amazing or terrible, and there are plenty of authors that got started in writing in fanfiction (see HP MoR).

What I'm saying is the premise is flawed. Characters make the story great, but only when they are grounded first in a compelling narrative.

Here's an example: Pirates of the Caribbean. Practically everyone I know says the first movie was good, mainly because of Jack Sparrow and the ambiguous characters (see Tortuga). But Disney tried to make more movies based mainly on Jack Sparrow, but the problem is they were putting the cart before the horse.

This can work, but I think the author would be better served by trying to develop a plot first, then searching or creating characters for their story that fit.

** I'm guessing this a next-generation story? And you need help developing characters? In that case, just look at a list of the original 40 (most fanfic readers know the entire list, even if the person wasn't used in canon) and then any names that showed up in canon as well and go from there.

Or are you wanting to use characters we've conceived and developed ourselves? I'm not sure you'll get a big response if that's the case. People are rather protective of their OCs.
