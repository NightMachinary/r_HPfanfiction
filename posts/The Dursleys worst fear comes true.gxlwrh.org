Any fics where magic, specifically Harry's is revealed to the Muggles, causing the residents of Privet Drive to look down on the Dursleys. I've seen a few where their abuse (far exaggerated beyond canon) is revealed and they are shunned there, but I thought it might be an interesting angle to see it from their worst fear happening.


** There was one I read where it wasn't that but someone leaked where harry had grown up and number 4 became something of a tourist attraction for wizards. Though everyone thought the dursleys were actors and the threats were part of the experience

  Harry helps Fleur in the second task of GOF and pays the price. HP/Fleur/Gabrielle/Hermione. A Veela bonding fic based on love. T Rated and it will stay that way. Thirteen year old Almost fourteen Gabrielle to start the story. Good Dumbledore.
