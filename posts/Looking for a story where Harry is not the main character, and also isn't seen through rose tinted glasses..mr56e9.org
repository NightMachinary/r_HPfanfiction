In a lot of stories, even where he is supposed to be the good guy or the one the author wants you to support, I feel like slapping him. Often. It's just that he has many character flaws that make him make no sense you know? Anyways, I was hoping for some fics where he isn't the main character and with some Harry Potter 'bashing' so to speak.


** linkffn(betrayal by butalearner) this fic is one of the best fics featuring Daphne Gree grass. Short, beautiful and Harry is most definitely not seen through tinted glasses. Complete.

linkffn(Fate by thetruesparten) Ron MC. This fic... Is long but so so worth it. I really don't know where to start with it except that I like it and the thing is still being updated.

linkffn(The Red Knight by demon eyes laharl) Ron MC. Abandoned but so so good. This Ron has... Problems with Harry to say the least.

Hopefully the bot be working as I heard that ffn wasn't playing ball recently.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU
