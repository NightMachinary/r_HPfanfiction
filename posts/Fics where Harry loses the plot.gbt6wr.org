Basically, fics where Harry just can't handle the stress of the annual attempt to kill him, and just starts doing crazy things. Maybe he just starts laughing hysterically when he sets eyes on the Hungarian Horntail, or just gets so mad that he uses Accidental Magic to blow up the Dementors. Etc. No slash, please.


** Not quite what you want, but linkffn(10707993) features Harry essentially saying “fuck it” and learning the unforgivable and using them to, ahem, remove his obstacles in the Triwizard Tournament.
