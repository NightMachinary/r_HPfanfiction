maybe hes kidnapped off the streets by muggles and in trying to fight back he breaks his wand, gets knocked out and awakes in a shipping crate with other kidnappees. Maybe the destination blocks magical signatures so harry can't be rescued and has to use his wits to survive the charismatic villain and going through the trial by fire changes harry on a massive scale.


** I kinda want to see this interpreted as Harry Potter in a Far Cry scenario with another Ministry/a foreign Dark Lord.

Then again that's just something I've wanted to see for years after Make a Wish and that one story that referenced Moody getting his eyeball by toppling a tinpot Dark Lordship overseas
