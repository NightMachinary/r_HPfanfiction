I believe it was a fic called Dagger and Rose linkffn(4152930) where I saw this term used, I was just wondering if anyone else has found other fics with this principle? ("Joining" with very ancient and unknown runes to gain powers) Any fic would be appreciated.


** In linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings by AngelaStarCat) Harry carves runes on himself as a part of certain rituals to gain power and abilities. I am not sure whether this fits what you meant saying "joining" (as I did not read /Dagger and Rose/).

*** It's not described in great detail, but implies that the runes have to be accepted into the mind, after a fashion, to truly access their meaning and power. I haven't really seen anything else like it in the HPFanfiction community yet, hence my search.
