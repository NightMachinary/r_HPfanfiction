I'm looking for recommendations for Hermione centric time travel fics. I don't care who she's paired with. I just would like her to travel in time by some way or another. :)

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. Hermione is thrown back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over? WINNER BEST DRAMA MARAUDER MEDALS 2016!

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]] is all all time favorite of mine. It's only surpassed maaaybe by Chemistry and Timing now but I'll wait to see how it ends to decide.

Also, if you haven't read the monster [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10772496/1/The-Debt-of-Time][A Debt of Time]] that's also a must read. It's a great Hermione time travel and also a GREAT marauders fic.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** linkao3(5733457; 444457) Both of these are fairly good. I actually just read the one with Theo Nott in it earlier today and really liked it.

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...

** Check out "Many Thanks" by Madm05. Although it is told from James Potter's perspective, Hermione is the time traveler and is the focus of the story. Short and beautifully written.
