  Lily Evans has spent years despising James Potter. He has spent just as long worshiping her. When seventh year pairs them Head Boy and Girl, each comes to realize that their judgment isn't quite what they thought it was. This is the same story that was over on Checkmated, but I completed it here. Prequel to Heroes for Ghosts. Warning: this story is a strong M rating.
