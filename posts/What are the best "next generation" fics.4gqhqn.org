I have yet to find a fanfic with Albus and the others that interested me. Do you have any suggestions?


** linkffn(3979062) is the old standby, and one I love.

linkffn(4389875) isn't about the next-gen kids, but is a next-gen era one-shot that everyone should read.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

Linkffn(Questions and Answers)

I also think that linkffn(Lessons Learned) is a good one, I don't think I've ever seen it recced here.

I also find [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374597/respitechristopher][respite's christopher's]] Mercury trio pretty entertaining. The longest is linkffn(The Mercury Chronicles: Angelica) and then there are a handful of oneshots IIRC.

All three of these are very different takes on the next gen, but they're each interesting in their own way.

** linkffn(8417562)

Complete new series of 7 books following Albus Potter.

The author is halfway through the 7th book BUT it isn't abandoned as it seems, he is simply writing it all and then will release it to not have to worry about keeping wit schedules and can do the ending right.

The plot for it was completely preplanned so its coherent and every sequel doesn't feel tacked on there's a natural flow to the books. They mirror the original Harry Potter books in many ways and have many instances of throwbacks and references like Scorpius Malfoy saying "My father better not hear about this".

If I haven't recommended it enough this plot is my head canon and it fills in most answers to questions from the originals that would be answered by "it's just complex magic, okay?"

EDIT: It is worth noting the first book is quite slow. Not much happens, it spends most of its time introducing and developing all the new characters. The first major bouts of adventure begin in Book 2.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.
