** Title: The Choices We Made

Author: jewelburns

Rating: T

Pairing: None, at least so far, no idea if there will be any in the future.

Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13563244/1/The-Choices-We-Made]]

Comments: I'm a sucker for time travel, as well as Severus raises Harry stories. In this story, an AU Severus Snape goes to a world that is close to Canon. It's rather interesting, and I've been enjoying everyone's personalities so far.

Extra Notes: It's currently ongoing, but according to the author, they have more chapters already written, so I'm hoping it won't be incompleted.

Summary: What if you could change your biggest regret? After a devastating event occurs, Snape from an alternate reality is given that chance, but ends up in the canon universe. Will he be able to gain back what he's left while helping to save the wizarding world at the same time? AU post-OOTP, HP/SS adopt/mentor, Sick!Harry, no slash

** I just finished Linkao3(On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads) by Enigmaris, and it was /sublime/. It's a Gen, which, being aro ace myself, is always appreciated, though it has a very perplexing case of Dumbledore Bashing, complete with a whole "punishment scene" at the end. The weirdest part is that Harry supposedly hates Dumbledore more than Tom Riddle (???) and that he can and will forgive anyone /except/ him. It was fucking weird, let me tell you.

And the author went out of their way to make every decision of Albus' understandable and logical, too! Sure, they weren't the best ones, but what the fuck dude. If you look at it objectively from his perspective, you have the canon "i make this bad choice because the other option literally destroys humanity", coupled with James really being Loki. It is revealed towards the end that the two don't at all look alike, too. So Albus has to somehow hide away the only hope for humanity's survival somewhere while the ministry scrambles to destroy themselves by placing him with death eaters, then Loki, who just saw his wife get murdered, comes half-rabid and asks for his supposed son. I think I can maybe understand why Dumbledore didn't give a vulnerable child who is literally the only hope for the Earth to an insane with grief guy who only looks somewhat like James.

Then the author pins all the bad things that happened to Harry on Albus, who was apparently trying to "scare" demigodness from him? Somehow?

Really good story, but kept from perfection by this weird choice to nonsensically bash a character.

Comments:

This story sad af. /still reading/(Angst + Romance +++)Like damn coming for me at all angles. It's so deep and psychologically, emotionally draining at times. I love it coz it depicts humanity in its greyest form. You probably won't like the main character (hermie), she's super flawed to a fault, but she's got qualities that back up her flaws... somehow...

/warnings tho/ for heavy depression, some suicidal ish in one chapter and all the self degrading a person can do to oneself when they're down down. If you're not in a space where you can handle these topics please wait until you're better or maybe pass it.

**** Sure. 242K+ words, completed through Harry's full time at school. It's a bit odd, and very unique, and in all honesty very hard to describe. It's a world in which Harry knows Victorian flower language, which supposedly causes ripples and the story is very different since.

The following words are present near the start of many of the chapters. ‚ÄúBeing an exploration of the differences in Mr. Potter's life pursuant to his understanding Victorian flower language at age 11. Single Point-of-Departure: Harry has a working lightbulb in his cupboard.‚Äù

It doesn't give away a lot, but that's the general vibe of the story, I guess.

I couldn't put it down, like, I was that enamored. Whether or not you choose to read it is up to you I guess!

Some of the humour references other fandoms but it's quite rare and doesn't play a part in the storyline, but it's very funny. It's a quirky story. I recall the house elves speaking Tolkien elvish at some point?

Enjoy it, if you read it :)

[AU, I think] Bellatrix accidently travels forwards in time and upon seeing the disatrous Future, decides to restore the most ancient and noble House Black to greatness.

Great read, although a bit hard to get into because often the writing derails heavily into talks of magical theory and thus the story overall is fairly slow. But well thought out, extremely elaborate and often positively hilarious. Introduces different races and theories to flesh out canon.

  Harry did not expect to be reborn as Anakin Skywalker in a galaxy where blue girls were considered sexy, sentient dustbins barely rated a glance and giant slugs were criminal warlords. He took it all of that in stride until The Force started singing in his ear. Good thing there were no prophecies lying around... right?

Author: Flying JMW

Rating: T

Pairing(s): (if any) N/A. yet. There will be OC pairings i think.

Link: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26581/rebirth-in-a-magical-world]]

Comments: Not a typical fanfic but that makes it all the better. It's still in progress with a lot of story left. It followings the OC Alexander Fawley who was a reader/fan of the HP books before dying and is reborn into the HP world. Currently 70 chapters in and we are yet to see HP but we see other characters that were in the books and we'll be seeing HP very soon. While the OC will interact with him he also has his own main story arc that will take place along side the the main HP storyline from the books (however the OC is going to try to influence those events). At the rate it's going the author will probably need another 150-200 or so chapters to finish it which is fine by me!

It is one of my top 5 favorite HP fanfics at this point.

Edit for clarification: By "averse to change" I mean Ron wants things to go back to how they were before the war. Which I find pretty realistic. Ron does try to change, but change of this sort is a slow process.

Other than that, the rebuilding is realistic. Most fics and canon do the "We won, happily ever after, the end." and the world is a total mess and a thread away from self-destruction. Harry ends up with a boatload of money and whatnot, but stuff is actually being done with it. And he's not throwing it around, it's more of a "help them help themselves" flavor.

A fairly recent publish. With a promising start.

It's SI, which I normally avoid. However, the tags Friendship and Humor, do mean something. Moments from the story got some genuine laughs from me. With the main character building some meaningful friendships.

Good grammar, nothing to immediately make you close your tab.

I have said that the pairing is N/A. For a good reason. The main character is SI, and an adult. Thus, no romantic undertones. The author has recognized that romance in a SI is creepy. The characters are all 11 and 12. So thank you author. For not being creepy.

So far, a fun and lighthearted adventure. Give it a go.

*** I really had fun reading this. Thanks for the recommendation. As you said, there were moments in the fic where I actually couldn't help but smile. The SI has no knowledge of the HP verse outside of pop culture absorbed information, which prevents the author from falling in a lot of potholes other SI authors fall into.

I like the characterizations most of all. The eleven year old Slytherin feel like eleven year old trying to be cunning and not like a group of political back stabbing adults. This is the first in-character Hermione I have seen in weeks. Ron is wary of Slytherins without it feeling like bashing. I'm unnaturally fond of this Percy. Harry is the only one out of the golden trio that isn't really in character, but he so wholesome, which is great to read in a fandom that loves making him angsty.

Edit: ok on first glance it seemed like a typical power-wank serie I found it was more on it. While true that Harry is ridiculous op it was not flounted for the most part.

In the end it was more of interesting take on the MoD aspect (and no pun intended, u will understand if u read it üòâ) and the multiverse theory.

** Title: The Aurors

Author: FloreatCastellum

Rating: M

Pairing(s): Harry/Ginny but it's mostly in the background, mostly canon pairings but, again, most are barely mentioned.

Link: linkao3(13215861)

Comments: It's a post-canon fic that centers around Harry as an Auror being tasked with training a new Auror. It's not the best fic I've ever read, but it's pretty fun. The OC is a little annoying at first, but I ended up liking her and I like how it's mostly centered around a mystery. The sequel's pretty good too. I'm not sure if I'm going to read the last part or not, I've only read the first chapter and it already really tells you what it's going to be about and it seems like it'd get long, but there are only five chapters up so far and it was last updated on Oct 2019.

Title: Intensity

Author: Marauderlover7

Rating: M

Pairing: None yet for Harry. Remus/Tonks and Sirius/Marlene McKinnon in the background.

Link: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12899733/1/]])

Comments: This is the fifth book in a series, starting with linkffn(Innocent by Marauderlover7). It's dual point of departure: first, the Malfoys have an older son as well as Draco, and second, Sirius escapes from Azkaban early by accident (literally, he sleepwalked out with accidental magic). Without having seen Peter in the newspaper, he doesn't go hunting; instead, he checks on Harry, finds him unhappy, offers him another home, and things snowball from there. There's lots of heartwarming moments, mixed with dire peril, as Sirius teaches Harry about magic and his parents and the world, while they do their best to hide from a massive manhunt led by Lucius Malfoy and Remus Lupin. That's book 1.

Books two to five follow Harry's first through fourth years at Hogwarts. There's a lot that's similar, but also a lot of alterations, with third year obviously being completely different. Perhaps the biggest difference, though, is Harry having a proper parental figure - perhaps not the most mature figure, but still, a caring parent and a somewhat functional home. With Voldemort still working to come back, and being smarter about it than canon, Harry's going to need all the help he can get.

** Title: Carl the Jumper

Author: AngorMike

Rating: M

Pairings: Multiple partners(different worlds) Though it is Carl/Hermione/Luna for the HP world.

Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13488233/1/Carl-the-Jumper]]

Comments: A pretty damn decent jumpchain story that I have no idea where to recommend since it has some pretty diverse fandoms. Starts in BtVS and is ongoing. The Harry Potter part was quite good as the MC isn't perfect and he sometimes forgets stuff as well as actually growing in both power and maturity. No dumbles bashing either, the MC doesn't trust him but thats because he's got so much on his plate that he's gotten a little too manipulative. The quality also increases the more the author write so I recommend it if you enjoy jumpchains. Not a huge amount of actual difficult for the protagonist in the worlds though so theres's that.

Rank: 8/10 If only for the uniqueness of it being an excellent jumper story in my opinion if it was a normal story i'd probably only give it a 6 or 7 as the writing could be a bit better.

The gist of it is that after trapping a murder happy ghost he himself is trapped in the void but when Sirius shows up they are able to stumble their way back to the wizard timeline. Wacky hijinks ensue. Look, it's a fun read, alright?

** Title: It's a masquerade darling

Author: Chubbypanda15

Rating: Mature

Pairing: Harry Potter/Tom Riddle

Link: linkao3(23548960)

Comment: This fic has a really unusual premise - at least for me, I've never seen it done before. All the main characters are at Hogwarts together, either as pupils or teachers. So Tom Riddle and the marauders are Harry's contemporaries. Harry and James Potter are cousins not father/son, and family politics means that they aren't close. Lily and Snape are Harry's friends. Riddle is the kingpin in the Slytherin dorms and setting up his powerbase. It just feels like a really fresh take on the story and it's well written. The fic is still in progress but it has been updated fairly regularly so far. The romance between Harry and Tom is just beginning - I'm still undecided about this part as I have problems imagining them together but I'm invested enough to see where this goes.

  An orphan, Harry Potter has done everything he can to avoid notice during his five years at Hogwarts so far. He's only got one friend, is purposefully in the middle of his class rankings, and his only ambition, wizarding-wise, is to graduate with enough N.E.W.T.s to get a loan and open up a bookstore.And then he somehow finds himself in the sights of Tom Riddle, resident golden boy of Slytherin and darling of Hogwarts...

Comments: I read The Changeling in a weekend pretty much and it hooked be BIG TIME. Ginny's sorted into Slytherin. It follows canon but I found it so interesting. I've never been invested in Ginny as a character but that story changed my mind. This is a continuation of the story, set immmediately post-war. I've just started chapter 7 of 12.

One thing that I did notice in the sequels is that I think Harry and Ginny were held back from resolving their issues by the amount of sex they had. If they hadn't been all over each other every time they visited, they might have had to communicate more and work through their problems sooner.

Pairings: Severus Snape / OC

Comments: On going series, 1.3 million words and counting. Only fic that includes the Founders that I've liked. Incredible depth of background research into Britain at 1000 AD that will delight history nerds and non-history nerds alike. Also includes a bunch of modern era stuff, so there's plenty of Hermione, Ron, and friends. Actually has competent adults, but doesn't actually bash other characters. Has OCs that are developed people. Great read, updates frequently!

** Title: The Pureblood Princess

Author: Grace

Rating: M

Pairing(s): (if any) Sirius Black x Adelaide Fawley

Link: [[https://www.quotev.com/story/11315706/The-Pureblood-Princess-Sirius-Black]]

Comments: I honestly love this book, it's not updated very often but what's there is amazing. It's not really your typical "opposites attract" Sirius Black fic, instead the main character is a girl just like him. I would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of book, and most of the time, the chapter titles are hilarious.

Here's the description:

"Adelaide Rose Fawley, a member of the sacred 28, was widely known as the Pureblood Princess, a name she personally detested. As the heiress to the Most Noble and Ancient House of Fawley, she grew up amongst the proud, noble, and prejudiced. She was raised to conform the beliefs that contradicted every fiber of her being. She acted her part well.

Too well.

Little did she know that there was one person that could see through her act. One person who saw past the mask she wore and into her very soul. One person who knew all too well the mask that she wore, for he himself had worn it many times. Sirius Black."

** Title: Loose Cannon

Rating: M

Pairing(s): (if any) Mostly with OCs

Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/1/Loose-Cannon]]

Comments: It's a post war quidditch Harry fic. No fighting for his life or shadow super villains trying to do him harm just Harry being a pro athlete with the accompanying social life. It's 300k+ words and has been updating more than once a week. Overall just an enjoyable relaxed fic.

** Title: These Accidents of Faith

Author: commas_and_ampersands

Rating: T

Pairing(s): Draco/Luna

Link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4664760]]

Summary:

#+begin_quote
  "Don't worry about letting me go. I won't say I don't mind staying here, but I can be patient. I don't expect anything from you." Her breath whistled in and out. "It's all right. I know you're not brave."
#+end_quote

Lengthy one shot which explores a tentative relationship between Draco Malfoy and Luna Lovegood throughout Deathly Hallows. I can't praise this fic enough. It manages an offbeat ship in a careful, perfect way and the characterization all around is great. Draco is sympathetic in his own mind while starting off as the same pathetic figure from the final books. Luna is kind and always herself, while still suffering under a terrible situation. The more minor characters, such as Narcissa, Bellatrix, and Greyback, are all equally well-drawn.

Comments: Harry Potter / Jurassic park crossover. I'd suggest watching/reading Jurassic park first. Very good story, and I'm rereading it for the third time.

** Title: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136/chapters/9358017][Of Wizards and Heroes]]

Author: [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/storyforsomeone/pseuds/storyforsomeone][storyforsomeone]]

Rating: T

Pairing(s): Loki/Harry Potter

Link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136/chapters/9358017][Chapter 1: Prologue]]

Comments: Okay I've read a number of Loki/Harry Potter fics but honestly the plotline, the character development, the floooow of the story is amazing. Stories like these get you inspired to actually write your own and that is a compliment imho.

It's got a good level of angst in it as well, and if you're like me who is down for a good angst story, then this is the fic for you.
