Harry's personality changed after the war.

Harry made Draco his slave (I believe), he had tied him to Grimmauld Place.

Hermione or Pomfrey or both freed Harry from the spell/potion/curse

Harry goes back to Grimmauld Place, finds Draco, realize's what he's done (I think Draco even calls him Sir or Master) Free's him. Put him on the couch, was looking for food to feed him.

I think Snape was alive, Draco ends up going to where Snape is after he gets feeling better

Can't remember the title or author or even what site it was on.

It wasn't Owned by JordanGrant and It wasn't It Started in the Shower

It was a multi-chapter, not sure if it was on fanfiction.net, or on another site. Not sure about the rating or author.

I've been searching for YEARS. I don't know if I'm thinking of multiple stories if it was deleted etc. But just knowing the name of the author/story would be a huge relief.

I think it was before the final 2 books, but I'm not 100% sure.
