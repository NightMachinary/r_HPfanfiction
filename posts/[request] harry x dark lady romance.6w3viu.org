** Hmm... I admit, I never read Harry/Voldemort slash, but I'd read the shit out of a steamy Harry/fem!Voldemort romance. Especially if she's hot and not a snakey monster. I'm a simple person, I guess.

  The cruel, beautiful smile, the predatory violet eyes of his torturer, lover and savior, Bellatrix Lestrange, ensnared him. Even after escape she became his sole obsession. To feel her touch again Harry will tear apart the Wizarding world, stone by stone.

** "Dangerous" by Blacklotus, with Ã  dark!Hermione leading a group of muggle born terrorists. Harry comes back after 10 years of exil away, after the defeat of Voldemort, only to find the wizarding world again at war... and Hermione very attractive ! Good story, unfinished and hard to find thow

*** I second that, sadly I don't know where you would be able to find that now...

I like the premises of that fic, especially because I think the wiz-world just got complacent/sucked back into business as usual after the war! Many of the changes made are MINIMAL and the guilty once again escape punishment (especially the Malfoys! They should have been either locked up forever or killed outright IMHO and their home should have been turned into either a secondary HQ for the aurors or an orphanage!)...and muggleborns (who aren't war heroes!) kind of remain outsiders/second class citizens! I can see Hermione taking that hard, especially after losing her "innocence" (not in a sexual sense!) during the war and learning that taking action works (hell, Voldemort after all brought the wiz-world to its knees twice and he was pretty bad at planing and his followers didn't fully trust/support him because he was a cruel nutjob!)
