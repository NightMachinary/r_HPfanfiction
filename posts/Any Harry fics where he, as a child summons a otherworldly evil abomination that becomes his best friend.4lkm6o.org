Some kind of eldritch creature or maybe even an evil servant like from fate/zero, mainly Harry wanting a friend very badly that he will do some amoral stuff to have a best friend. It's possible for Harry to make his magic think up a "imaginary friend" but has to be evil or amoral.

I'd like it if Harry was insane.

No slash or angst please.

Also, I've read the Denerian Renegade and A Fallen God.


** Off the top of my head for stuff that is sorta what you're looking for:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2666277/1/Something-Grim-This-Way-Comes][Something Grim This Way Comes]] has Dudley subbing in for Billy from the show and Harry as some 3rd kid. Mandy and Harry head of to Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11188292/1/Deal-with-a-Devil][Deal With a Devil]] has a similar premise to the Denarian Renegade but goes about the whole thing very differently. Harry is also much more likeable in this one and there's lots of fun stuff pre-Hogwarts like getting kidnapped by vampire zombie fairy pirates or some combination of those. Personally I like it a lot more than the Denarian Renegade but it's up to personal preference.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] has wizard Lenin talking in her head. She also goes to visit Uncle Death sometimes too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][On a Pale Horse]] has Harry ending up as Death's sanity crutch after Dumbledore summons him.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/1/Deprived][Deprived]] Harry summons some sort of rage incarnate knight guy. It's kinda cool.

Harry accidentally summons Richard to Hogwarts in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11246463/1/The-Greatest-Prank][The Greatest Prank.]]

*** Deal With a Devil is really good. I couldn't do the Denarian Renegade, it was even grimmer than some of Darth Marrs.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  It was supposed to be a joke letter, but it ended up so much more. Who would have guessed that the 'poster child' of the Light side was a closet Pyromaniac with a distinct inability to care about the trauma he causes? Now there's a warlock teaching DADA, there's Death Eaters on fire, and the mediwitch is hexing everyone! Who knew being a minder for Richard could be so fun? CRACK

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.
