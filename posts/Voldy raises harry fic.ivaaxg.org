:END:
Hi I'm looking for the name of this fic which I had read a while ago. Looked everywhere but just can't find it.

Voldemort takes Harry with him instead of trying to kill him. I can't remember whether his parents are left alive or not. Voldy gets Harry trained by all the death eaters. Harry's best friend is barty crouch Jr and he is gifted a raven. (raven surprise revealed in the last few chapters - don't want to mention it here and spoil it for anyone). From what I remember it is an HHr story.
