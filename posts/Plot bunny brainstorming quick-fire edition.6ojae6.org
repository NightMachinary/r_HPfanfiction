<Taure> Let us have a plot-bunny-off

<Taure> We take it in turns to come up with ideas for HP stories

<Taure> Loser is the person who runs out of ideas first

*NOW YOU*


** Okay...

- Orla Quirke returns to her foster parents from school and the funeral of Albus Dumbledore. She wakes in the middle of the night to see that they've taken her wand and intend to turn her over to these nice men in black cloaks. What's a 3rd year Ravenclaw to do?

- Halloween 1981; Sirius arrives before Hagrid. In a moment of madness, he transfigures toddler Harry into a rat and pockets him before heading off to track down Wormtail. He's caught and disarmed, but they didn't see any point to taking away the guy's pet rat. Harry is raised in Azkaban, a rat animagus from an early age. Now Sirius sees the real rat-traitor in the newspaper, and they escape to seek vengeance.

- Seeing that her daughter intends to join the battle at Hogwarts, Andromeda knocks her out and uses a special polyjuice formula to take Nymphadora's place. Harry returns to the Tonks house after the battle to break the news to Andromeda, only to find Dora just rousing from her enspellment.

- Personifications of evil roam in areas where wizards rarely tread, spreading hate and fear and aggression. Luna suspects that the genocide in Rwanda is supernaturally-induced, and she asks her friends to help her take care of it.

- There are no Asian wizards or witches, except those of British descent. They've all... left. And now, so has Cho Chang, though Harry suspects that it isn't voluntary.

- Neville's really excited to take up the post of Herbology professor at Hogwarts, except for one thing - Snape's ghost.

- While visiting Hogwarts after the war, Ron strolls off into the Forbidden Forest, drawn by an eerie noise. He walks for hours until he finally discovers the strange yet familiar sound; the plaintive horn of the old Ford Anglia. "I'm going to fix you," he promises.

But I actually had a couple silly yet somewhat decent suggestions:

Harry is abducted by aliens and Dobby travels across the galaxy to save him.

Lost in Translation: A slip of concentration turns a language translation spell into physical and possibly temporal translation spell, leaving Hermione lost and unable to find her way back home.

Just days after losing Sirius in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries four little black puppies show up on the dursley's doorstep, and they look just like Padfoot... chaos ensues

** Many of these would work better with a non-Harry protagonist. Remember, the only reason Harry is important is that Voldemort chose him over Neville, so unless the plot involves Voldemort, there isn't a particular reason to favor Harry over others.

For example,

#+begin_quote
  Harry as a St Mungo's healer, modeled on House. He treats a patient with a curse, the cure for which means entering their dreams.
#+end_quote

Not Snape?! Mid-canon Hermione might also work; as could Luna or Trelawney, but that would be a different kind of idiosyncratic doctor.

#+begin_quote
  OotP. Dumbledore has gone down sick, as old people do. But Umbridge is on the prowl, and they can't let her exploit any weakness. Someone is going to have to pretend to be Dumbledore for 24 hours, under polyjuice, while the real Dumbledore recovers. Enter Harry Potter.
#+end_quote

Why not McGonagall, Flitwick, or Pomfrey, or even Snape, who've known Dumbledore for much longer and in a greater variety of circumstances, and who can do at least some of the magic Dumbledore can? (If it's comedy you want, make Hagrid do it.)

--------------

My plot bunnies (though not all of them new). I tend to get mine as reactions to (usually bad) ideas of others, but I'll stick to the few standalone ones here:

- Crossover with Lovecraft mythos. About a year post-DH, Hermione, having graduated from Hogwarts, shows up to take her position at the Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures to advance House-Elf rights. She discovers that 1) DRCMC is also in charge of dealing with creatures left behind by ancient civilizations, cults seeking to summon or resurrect eldrich horrors, and similar nuisances; and 2) they are severely short-staffed after the War, so with her versatile skillset, she'll be working on the task force dealing with these nuisances. In fact, she, and Luna (who also joined, having just graduated), /are/ the task force for the moment.

- At the end of OotP, Dumbledore and Voldemort end up fighting in the Time Room. Their magic interacts with the broken time-turners to freeze both of them in temporal stasis, which can end at any moment, but nobody has any idea when. And so, both sides have lost their uber-wizard, Fudge wants to cover the whole thing up and pretend that nothing is happening, and Death Eaters and OotP are engaged in a guerrilla war, while also fighting for control the stasis site, so that when the stasis ends, their uber-wizard would have enough support to defeat the other uber-wizard. Unspeakables want those damned kids off their property, but they also have their split loyalties.

- Crossover with /Worm/: the following prophecy is made in the 1930s...

  #+begin_quote
    The three multitudes that kill to live eternally approach. All shall offer gifts of power to the unsuited, and mark as their own them that accept. Two shall mark the body, one the mind. One shall take for himself, two give of themselves. The three multitudes that kill to live eternally approach...​
  #+end_quote

  It neatly ties together the arrival of Voldemort, who is a "multitude" due to his split soul, kills to create horcruxes, and empowers and marks the Death Eaters and of /Worm/ [[/spoiler][entities, who are multitudes of semi-independent Shards, empower the most messed-up people they can find, and one of whom influences the mind and the other the body --- though that part might be different, depending on what happens when they land.]]

- At the end of GoF, Harry is returned to the Maze with no memories of what happened. Cedric just disappears. "Moody" disappears shortly after. Vodlemort is not heard from again, and neither is Pettigrew. Life goes on. Harry is eventually exonerated, and goes on to play Quiddich professionally after Hogwarts. Hermione either does her Canon career or ends up teaching Transfiguration after Dumbledore retires and McGonagall becomes Headmisstress.

  Around 2005, the entering class of Hogwarts is "augmented" by a /hundred/ Muggleborns, most with dark hair, aristocratic features, high intelligence and general magical talent, and with an increased prevalence of psychopathic personality traits. In the years thereafter, two hundred each.

  Voldemort had chosen a different form of immortality...

Someone still needs to spy on Voldemort, and luckily Snape had an almost identical cousin Austin, a lazy movie aficionado with questionable wizardry skills. But with a near-encyclopedic knowledge of James Bond-movies, how hard can spying on a dark lord really be?
- Prophecy, Schmophecy: Voldemort learns the part of the prophecy wherein he will mark the chosen one as his equal, and he decides to postpone doing so until /after/ he has conquered Wizarding Britain. How long can Voldemort through dark magic and genre-savvy keep the universe from making him "mark" a suitable hero?
- Obliviated to Oblivion: Many years later, Lockhart makes a partial recovery. He is well enough to return to society, and well enough to practice magic again. There is only one problem - he cannot remember anything from his former life, and he seems to have been some kind of hero! How will he ever live up to that reputation?
- Noble and Ancient: Antonius Malfoy, a minor hedge-wizard, has by happenstance ensured William the Conqueror victory in the battle of Hastings. In return, he is given a lordship - but the court is a den of vipers, and Antonius is out of his depth. He may have gotten kicked out of Beauxbatons for practicing necromancy, but he did pick up a trick or two along the way...

** Goblins are actually D&D-like dark elves. An evil matriarchal race of blue skinned humans with long ears.

Every Gringots bank is an entrance to the underdark.

Wizards believe they have them subjegated but truthfully they're roughly equal in power as a society. Goblins simply despise being above ground. Being a teller is a punishment since they have to work in an above ground building which is why every teller is always pissed off.

Goblin rebellions happen when wizards finally piss them off enough that their natural aversion to being topside is exceeded by their seething hatred.

*** /The sky was the color of a potion's cauldron, left to boil dry./

Increasing Muggle encroachment means it is impossible maintain the Statute of Secrecy while also living beside muggles. To escape, the Wizarding World relocates to a mega-city in the frozen heart of Antarctica. But this city is a imposing artificial place - far away from the wonder and magic wizards need.

To escape this reality, they create a shared dreamscape and the potion needed to access this dream becomes the primary social force. The poor struggle for every drop, while the rich live out their entire lives in custom made dream fantasies. Massive socail unrest is brewing and rogue dreamweakers rewrite the corporate maintained dream adventures to fight the system. Cyberpunk-meets Harry Potter.

*** *Good Bye Mr Black*

"Good bye, Mr Black. Obliviate."

Those are the only words Mr Black remembers before he wakes alone and naked in the middle of a desert. Through luck, he stumbles across a crashed sand-glider, inside of which he finds a mummified wizard with a wand and a badly damaged spell book. The spellbook contains 8 spells. Using only those 8 spells and no other magical knowledge, can Mr Black survive and escape. Sort of Harry Potter meets The Martian.

An elderly Harry Potter deals with a changing world with different dangers. Are Dark Wizards still the primary threat to the Wizarding World or is his son correct and the ever growing Concerns (wizarding corporations) rapidly becoming the larger threat?

The raven attacks and disrupts any attempt to use magic - for example working himself up into a state to use accidental magic. How can he break free?

** People seem to love Harry's life really sucks stories. In that genr: in 1981 Dumbledore found Gaunt ring and realized Voldemort had made multiple horcruxes. He contrived to steal the ancestral Potter cloak, becomes Master of Death which enables him to defeat dark Lord (Maybe as MOD he could easily find the soul jars via astral cords). No prophecy. To cover his tracks he has to frame up James, have them both killed, and Ministry seizes all Potter vaults. Harry is thus raised Harry Evans, is really truly dirt poor, and widely shamed and despised. Harry has to forge his way despite the hindrances, and reclaim the honor of Potter name. (Possibly by entering tournament as Harry Potter, as magic accepts it is his true name, notwithstanding magical Britain's legal taboo on Potter. All the usual tournament fun, and Dumbledore comeuppance. )

** What if the fear of muggles stealing magic as presented in DH was real, and we follow the adventures of Unspeakables trying to supress that knowledge in the hope of stopping total panic. We could also have Mrs Figg trying to unsucessfully steal magic from young Harry, resulting in his accidental magic from canon rescuing him every time, and he mistaking the threat for Dudley and his gang bullying him.
