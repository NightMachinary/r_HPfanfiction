Personal I think AO3 because of how easy it is to navigate and that it has more filters than ffn.


** Ao3 for sure, and regardless of other differences the fact that pairings are tagged makes a world of difference. It drove me nuts that pairings weren't always marked on ffn. It's cool if the author wants it to be a surprise, but that's not the case for a lot of unmarked fics. I used to find fics by going through an author's favorites because the search function was frustrating.

However, Ao3 seems to have way less canon dominant pairings so I imagine for the hardcore Hinny readers that a site design is somewhat irrelevant. (idk the stats for background pairings). I read pretty much everything except harem, Harry/older man and Harry/Ron so that's why I'm especially thankful for the clearly marked pairings- both romantic and gen.

Sorting by kudos yields better results than sorting by favorites because a reader is more likely to hit the "kudos" button than actually favorite a fic imo. Ao3 was a bit overwhelming when I first wandered over there from ffn, but once I figured out how to utilize the site controls for my benefit I never looked back.

** AO3 is better in terms of usability, but FFN has more good fics. I upload to both.

** I used to solely use Ao3 but then stuff happened and I couldn't access it as easily, which lead me to have an appreciation for ffnet. The little communities are good when you're looking for a specific genre or trope. And since the website is older than ao3, you have some really intresting things written post all the books releases. Not to mention, it seems to have more written works on general, though (correct me if I'm wrong) I think that stories are abandoned more on ffnet.

Of course the tagging system on ao3 is a godsave, but it's quite tedious-- for example, if I filter results to remove explicit, then I don't get any plotless smut. But then I might miss out on a good story with one or two mature scenes that I could've skipped. And then theres the overtagging thing too.

I think that both sites have their uses, but I mostly use ffn, after having scoured ao3 for a few months. Especially because I only read hp fanfics. But ao3 has way more abo. /shudders/ but it also has more slash, which I prefer.

Honestly I just get my recommendations on this sub and read it on whatever website it's on.

** There are three things about AO3 that makes it my preferred site:

1. The option to show the entire work on one page. This is great for times when I'm going to be away from a network connection.
2. The ability to select a specific fandom when looking at an author's works. For the more prolific authors this is a must. I despise having to search through dozens of works from fandoms I don't care about for the Harry Potter stories.
3. Series. On ffn, you have to go looking for stories in a series, and read the descriptions to figure out which one comes first. On AO3, not only can you get them listed on a single page, but you can go directly from one story to the next.

For balance, the thing I like most about FFN is the ability to quickly find the "Complete" tag so I can filter out unfinished works. I don't always remember to look for it, but that's on me.

** I really only look at a handful of sites (I came late to the fanfiction world).

The sites i look at are

Fanfiction.net Hpfanficarchive Archive of our own Portkey-archive.org Fanficauthors Adult fan fiction

My two primary sites were hpfanficarchive and AO3 and that's mainly because I typically download the fics i'm interested in and i didn't have a decent downloader for fanfiction.net (I pretty much open my network connection, quickly do what i want, then immediately close the connection. So active on-line time is minimal)

AO3 is currently taking the lead over hpfanficarchive as there are more new stories and more updating stories. Plus the search functions are nicer.

If the search functions improved with fanfiction.net i would use that more.

If i like an author's work I first check out their other stories, then either the authors they like or the stories they like to expand to other authors (figuring if I like the one authors works there's a decent chance I'll like the authors/stories they like.

Boy that was a long winded explanation for a simple answer of AO3. Sorry about that.

** I mostly don't even know where my stories are from, because I download them all with [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare][fanficfare]] as EPubs and read them locally (or on my phone). But, yes, for reading in Firefox, AO3 is a way more pleasant (better than FFN or SIYE).
