I can't remember much about it but I remember that Harry was an only child or his twin died as a baby or something along those lines... either way Lily, using some very clever magic, created a fake child that became known as the 'Boy-Who-Lived' so that Harry wasn't a target. Even James didn't know the truth.

The fic took place when they were adults and the 'twin' died. I think Harry had long since vacated Wizarding Britain with no fanfare as nobody cared at the time.

I might be remembering all of this wrong but i'm almost certain I remember a fic like this.


** Sounds a lot like 'The Substitute'. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/1/The-Substitute]])

*** Thanks but that's not it. Depressing yet well-written story though.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.

  For years, the world has hailed Arnold Potter as the Boy-Who-Lived. For years Arnold was said to be the one who will throw down Voldemort. But now Arnold is dead, and the world turns its attentions to Harry. Mostly H/Hr/L. Finished.
