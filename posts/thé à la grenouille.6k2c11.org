I just had a few questions about the story. Firstly I just wanted to know about Harry's ability with magic, should I expect a talented studious boy or someone like Ron? Is the plot good and is it well written? Thanks!


** It's been a long while since I've read it, but don't go in expecting your typical Hogwarts-style colosseum challenges. Harry's curious and decidedly studious - for an eight-year-old - but from what I remember, the author planned to steer the Beauxbatons curriculum in a noticeably different direction. I think she explicitly mentioned it being less combat-oriented and practical than Hogwarts' classes.
