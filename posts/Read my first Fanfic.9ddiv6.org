So I went looking for my first HP fanfic and came to reddit. I saw someone brought up " *Latet Anguis In Herba"* It was about a group of Slytherins so I though that would be pretty interesting. Sooo...

​

YEAH IT WAS INTERESTING. This felt like it was professionally written! It's 8 chapters and each one is good sized.

​

I'm wondering if anyone has experience with this one and can recommend other fanfics like it, or anyone just wants to recommend ANY.

** You'll be best served looking at the sidebar for the general and frequent recommendations. A lot of amazing fics there.

Also, let me be the first to ever recommend to you linkffn(Seventh Horcrux).

** This is my calling, haha. I love Slide's work, so you probably have a similar idea for stories as I do (there's a good chance I recommended it). Read the author's other works too, such as the sequels Shade to Shade, Falls to Shadow and Beyond this Place, also the Stygian series which starts with Ignite (Starfall and Oblivion are the sequels), semi-sequels to Anguis.

Tell Brave Deeds of War comes immediately to mind, which is on Ao3. I'll add more later.

Who's your favourite character? I have very little opportunity to discuss the stories. For me, I love Gabriel and Tobias.

****** These stories are of a similar ilk to Latet Anguis in Herba. Fleshing out the backstory to Harry Potter and exploring other characters perspectives.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12001201/1/Let-Perpetual-Light][Let Perpetual Light]]: Minor Dumbledore/Grindelwald. The story from Kendra's death to Ariana's death. Plays with canon a bit, but is still very much canon compliant-even works surprisingly well with Fantastic Beasts.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1171672][Professor C. Binns: A Personal History]]: Professor Binns' backstory. It's unexpectedly amazing.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Minds Eye, Souls Reflection]]: Luna's perspective of Order of the Phoenix.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3867967/1/Asking-for-Roses][Asking for Roses]]: Neville in the summer before Deathly Hallows.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613][Ignite]]: Sequel series to Anguis. Next-gen story with Scorpius, Albus and Rose.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307662%22][Muggle Studies]]: Comedy series. During Harry's kids time, about a Muggle Studies teacher and his (hilarious) experience trying to teach wizards/witches Muggle Studies.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3784000/1/The-Scarlet-Pimpernel][Scarlet Pimpernal]]: Percy during the Deathly Hallows.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4007457/1/The-Sleeper-Awakes][The Sleeper Awakes]]: Percy during the Deathly Hallows.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection]]: Luna's perspective on Order of the Phoenix.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11145058/1/][Daphne Greengrass, Side Character]]: Very funny, Daphne Greengrass and her friends during the series from Order of the Phoenix onwards (currently incomplete). Since you're just starting you probably don't know the whole tropes surrounding Daphne Greengrass in fanfiction (who was just barely mentioned in the series)-this is a real breath of fresh air.

*** I didn't see your part of favorite character. Hmmm, Tanith. I think I can somewhat relate to her: Cold on the outside but really kind of a softy and different around your friends vs others. Her dedication to trying to make situations work and manipulate the course of things. I'm not a Slytherin but she just feels more relate-able.

Tobias seemed too oblivious all the time and didn't realize that there was more to his life than work, or school, or what's just in his face. He was always complicating things and could never mind things simple (not like Tanith was a ton better than him lol)

Cal was sort of a lunk head who I didn't really understand until book 3. He's ok but I sort of feel like he should have been a Hufflepuff.

For Gabe, I don't think we really saw that much of him but he seems like he has a pseudo-playboy mentality/lifestyle but really is good at heart and needed to find the right person or people, to make his life better. He was always the jokester. Kind of reminded me of a Weasley.

**** Cal is definitely my least favourite, though I liked him all the same. I thought that of all of them he was by far the most selfish, and self-interested. I'd say he was a Slytherin for his ambition alone.

Tobias is someone I appreciated for trying to do the right thing and his lofty ideals. While Gabriel I always thought he seemed the most interesting of all of them. He had a certain mystique.

Tanith is an excellent character. I couldn't relate to her, but she was so well developed.

***** I could say that Tobias belongs in Ravenclaw, like his parents said. He was such an academic and he seemed to value that over so much else. I found it odd that he went from brains to brawns, as he tried to get into Law Enforcement. Though in Book Two, it is explained why he wanted to do it and I guess it was explained well enough. He would have done well in Ravenclaw but his super ambitious nature and huge drive were probably why he was in Slytherin.

**** Oof. I'm gonna try to recall everything because I read them all in 14 days LMAO.

Book One: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2233473/1/Latet-Anguis-In-Herba][Latet Anguis In Herba]] was about all the events of Hogwarts and school House BS and introductions.

Book Two: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3353818/1/Shade-to-Shade][Shade to Shade]] was about when things really head down hill and certain...innocent...people are killed? Death Eaters take over at the end?

Book Three: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6726813/1/Falls-the-Shadow][Falls the Shadow]] is about living through the Occupation and trying to stay alive because any single thing could get you killed by ANYONE. Dealing with being on the run, having mass amounts of miscommunications of who's on who's side

Book Four: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8395582/1/Beyond-This-Place][Beyond This Place]] is about catching the remaining Death Eaters and war criminals, as well as trying to navigate the whole Legal System. fixing or developing relationships and trying to have a happy ending while also recovering from the War mentality and all the effects that it has left on people and the way they treat others.

​

I'm going to say either book 3 or 4.

Book Three was just SO DAMN INTERESTING. Thanatos really really made me do a ton of think. Just such a good book. But the one thing he sort of made Tanith do was just crazy!

But Book Four, holy shit, Book Four got me fucked up. The plot twist(s) that happened, wow! This one legitimately had me gripped. I lost sleep cause I couldn't put it down and I kept wanting to see what happened next. I could only make so many assumptions. Everything fell into place.

​

This isn't a fair question lmao. I think I'm going to go with Book Three: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6726813/1/Falls-the-Shadow][Falls the Shadow]], just because of the whole twist on how we see Death Eater ideals and they're not so cut and paste. Not all of them are absolutely insane. It was hugely philosophical and you kept wondering when someone was going to somehow fuck up, especially with what Gabe could do and how sort of unreliable it was. Three was just SO DEEP AND SUSPENSEFUL!

​

I hope this was a good comment, and was satisfying! :)

Oh, you said previously that Ignite, book one of the Stygian series, is like a sequel to Anguis? I enjoyed Cursed Child but I know that Slide will do a better job of working with that then JKR lmao. I think I LIKE Slide more than JKR :O.

​

I know i've asked this before and I'm sure it was answered well with your previous comment, but what are stories that are like Anguis? Or something comparable? I take it anything by Slide? Lol

***** I loved Book 3, it added so much nuance to JK Rowling's own world. I loved how the author had her characters working against the ministry in their own ways, and I feel like it was clever to have them achieve something seperate from the series with liberating the people in Azkaban. And I am undoubtedly a romantic at heart, Tobias and Tanith were great in that book.

With Stygian, it has the characters from Anguis feature. Of particular importance is Gabriel Doyle and Nathalie Lockett. If you loved Anguis, you'll adore Stygian. Slide goes to such efforts to flesh out the world and add so much history and lore.

I think you'll like it more than the Cursed Child. I didn't hate the Cursed Child, but having read Stygian I could only think of what it could have been.

​

CC definitely did read like a fanfic but with weird formatting. It was ok but it didn't feel like JKR (because it really wasn't) So I'm sure Slide has done an amazing time.

​

I PM'd her on [[https://fanfic.net][fanfic.net]] and gave her a long story about everything I loved, etc, etc but also what she could do to continue the story. However, it said she was last active in 2016 and at the end of book 4, it said they were done with the series. I sent that PM before finishing 4, though I was like two pages away. So that might have looked bad on me for asking her to continute and saying I finished, though I didn't and hadn't seen the "the end" at the end. RIP Lol

******* I'm pretty sure she has written published novels, which I really want to read. If it's anything like Anguis in Stygian they'll likely be amazing.

Yeah, she started writing Not Fade Away (series on the Marauder's era) but realised she had gotten into something too ambitious and abandoned it sadly. Though she has started up another sequel to Stygian, developing on other characters from that series. She hasn't updated it in a while unfortunatetly.

There is more stories on HPFF of hers that I don't think are on FFN. [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=144658][Slide]], I enjoyed Toward the Height-nice mystery with Ron.

Also for more like Slide, I think FloreatCastellum is your best bet. Nice mysteries, own canon and well developed characters.

******* Definitetly Book 3. I keep going back to read it, but I do adore Book 4 as well.

Though of all six of them (counting Stygian), I adore Starfall the most. Just crammed with excellent action and characters.

******** Just so much to read. I see that almost all of Anguis books are like 150,000+ words. That's around HBP size, which is 160,000 something words.

Am I missing something here? Have I read like 3 HBP books within two weeks? I'm not a super quick reader but I'm not super slow. Is the websites/Slides counting system off???

I actually found it quite interesting. She's one of the few author's I read the notes of because she always has something interesting to say about the process of writing. I love how she talks about her own characters as though they are real people.

********* Yeah basically, Slide wrote a next-gen series before Cursed Child. So it has none of the same plot and they are not the same characters. I assume to have the characters more advanced in magic/character she skipped straight to sixth year.

But there is some funny similarities. Rose is similar to Rose from the play for example. But yeah, definitely just forget about Cursed Child.

If you want something that follows from the Cursed Child though-Put Your Guns Away It's Tea Time is really good.
