Any stories that revolve around Sirius getting his trial, and being free, but doesn't just accept some galleons, and goes on his way, because I don't know about you, but if I was incarciated for twelve years of essentialy mental hell I would be pissed, and taking a piece out of everyone who was even remotely connected. I mean he had good friends, and mentors who should of known better. What did they do. Nothing.

So yes this would probably be a bashing story, but a justified bashing story. I mean couldn't have Dumbledore been like "what would make a man like Sirius turn his back on people he viewed as family, I know since i'm the head of the Wizengmot, and have a great deal of influence let's find out".

Why should people like Bellatrix, and even Snape get a trial, but not Sirius. Why should him being uncomfortable about using such influence decide who should, and should not recieve a trial. Remus I can kind of understand. Being a werewolf, and Sirius having turned his back on Remus first, it would be difficult that even if he did believe Sirius innocent, to do something about it.

Thanks, Warryn.


** Black Vengeance by Teufel1987 linkffn(7254667) was written because the author had the idea of writing a story along the lines of Azkaban!Harry but with the character who /actually/ was unfairly imprisoned and abandoned/betrayed by his friends. And yes, it's about an exonerated Sirius who goes after everyone he holds responsible for leaving him there.

  AU Third Year: He spent twelve years in hell for a crime he did not commit. Sent there without the courtesy of a trial. Betrayed by his friends and allies. Now he has broken out. He will find and catch that rat and then, they will pay!

** I'm pretty sure Dumbledore didn't really have the authority to go against Barty Crouch Snr., who was the one pushing to ship Sirius off to Azkaban if I recall correctly. Sure, on paper, Dumbledore could have outranked him, but I feel Crouch's popularity and therefore clout was such that Dumbledore would have compromised his own influence by openly crossing him. Which means he would have been less effective at getting the people he /knew/ to be innocent, like Snape, out of Azkaban (whereas he had no less reason to believe Sirius was truly a traitor than the rest of the wizarding world).

*** But we don't know that. Also I highly doubt that he couldn't go against Barty. Remember at this time it was Dumbledore. Apart from mostly pro pureblood groups everyone thought the sun shined out of his ass.

He has taught multiple generations of wizards, and was regarded as the most powerful of them. Sure I could see no trial, but i'm 100% sure could have at least got a meeting with him, and that's under the assumption that Barty had some clout. Which he did as people considered him as the next minister of magic, but that was only, because Dumbledore refused it. Dumbledore was their first choice for minister which shows how popular he was, and Barty at most was still second to Dumbledore.

TL;DR. So to the point of my post, yes I do believe he had more than enough authority, and influence to at the very least get a meeting with Sirius, and in the end, unless he had some reason to keep him in prison, he would have requested said meeting just to ask why.

**** Y'know, I never considered this, but maybe it was actually a character moment by Dumbledore. He liked Sirius; Sirius was a young man he trusted, and whom he had just learned had apparently gone Dark behind his back. ...Sound familiar? Dumbledore thought he was seeing Grindelwald all over again. Well, not quite, but too close for comfort, and he didn't want to risk coming anywhere near Sirius and let his emotions and affection for the boy cloud his judgement once again and prevent him from taking appropriate action.

***** Once again there is nothing to prove this, and Dumbledore at that point is over 100 years old, and Sirius was early twentys at best. While the whole Grindewald thing happened much earlier in his life.

Also Dumbledore was not in love with Sirius, nor did the dark have little if any sway over him(Dumbledore), unlike Grindewald. Lastly if he was that worried, and that's a large assumption, he could have gotten one of the order members in an interview/interrogation with him.

So unless you can come up with a better argument, i'm afraid the only real reason there is, is that he purposely had him locked up knowing he was innocent, or at least might be innocent. For what reason only JK knows.

** I think the main problem is that people believed they already knew why- Sirius was from a dark family who chose to fight with Voldemort. Also let's not forget the fact that everyone thought Sirius confessed and was /laughing/ about it. Dumbledore had seen that kind of behavior from Sirius before, too- when he tried to kill Snape in school. Which is a pretty dark thing to do, if you think about it.

So to summarize- Sirius was from a bad family, he'd acted murderously before, and he was caught red-handed, confessed, and showed no remorse, in fact he was laughing about it.

What's even to doubt? You don't need a trial if you plead guilty to start with.

*** But you plead guilty in an actual court before a judge (hopefully) with the advice of a lawyer.

A confession at the scene of a crime =/= pleading guilty. As far as I can tell that's true in the wizarding world too.

**** And as far I can tell, it's not. The wizarding world seems to be stuck in the middle ages in several ways, not just their fashion sense. We don't even know if they have lawyers or judges- there's certainly been no canon evidence of them so far.
