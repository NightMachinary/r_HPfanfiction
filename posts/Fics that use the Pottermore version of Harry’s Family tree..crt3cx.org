I'm looking for fics that include the Pottermore version of Harry's family tree. It seems to be unpopular to take that as canon round here but I personally prefer it. There are several interesting avenues for fics that use this as canon.

Thank you


** I find it very odd people don't nowadays. It really is a non-contentious issue.

I'll take a look.

** I've noticed a lot of fics have Charlus Potter and Dorea Black as James' parents rather than Fleamont and Euphemia. I wonder where that comes from?

*** We only learned about Fleamont and Euphemia 3-4 yrs ago, I think. Charlus and Dorea were on the Black Family tree in the OOTP (movie I think) with one unnamed son and exploring that avenue was fun. Charlus is also far more pleasing to the ear than Fleamont is.

** Here's what makes it unbelievable to me. It says that Hardwin, son of Linfred, married Iolanthe, daughter of Ignotus and the Cloak of Invisibility passed on to the Potter family.

Only thing is, Linfred was pretty much a nobody, while the Peverell family owned an artifact which is on equal tier with items like the Philosopher's Stone or the Elder Wand.

In an age where people married strictly within their class, this marriage is positively outlandish.

*** 1. You're missing a generation - Linfred's son married Ignotus's granddaughter.
2. Linfred is credited with setting the groundwork for many potions including skelegrow and pepper-up. He made the family rich.
3. Ignotus was smart enough to not showoff the cloak the way Antioch showed off his wand and the legend of the cloak would have spread after his death. It's why the story claims he had a son - if he was so well known people would know he only had daughters.
4. They're wizards - their class system would have been different. There would not have been that big of a difference between living standards of witches and wizards no matter their wealth status. By that point, there was no magical royalty or nobility unless a muggle noble family threw a muggleborn. Linfred's son was magical, healthy, wealthy, and presumably intelligent. The two would have met at Hogwarts, fallen in love, and both families congratulated each other for the continuation of their family line.

*** Maybe he was an outstanding wizard on his own and did something big that would earn him the equivalent of a knighthood
