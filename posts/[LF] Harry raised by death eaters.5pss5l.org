I'm looking for a fic wherein Harry is abducted as a toddler and raised to be the heir of Voldemort. His parents still live and iirc have a second child, but Harry was convinced or brainwashed that they abandoned and/or abused him and Thurs hates them. Tia!


** That sounds like The Darkness Within by Kurinoone, linkffn(5957714). A bit bland, but a decent time-waster.

  A rewrite of the first part in my Dark Prince Trilogy. What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? Book One of the Dark Prince Trilogy.

*** That might be it, thanks! It's the first (and only) fanfic I ever read and I was feeling nostalgic.

  A twist of Fate... an opened window... a cradle robbed... two frantic parents... a lost hope, along with a shattered Prophecy. Moved to 'M' for future violence. Extending take down until July 1, 2012, so I have time respond to everyone and its gives people time to finish reading.
