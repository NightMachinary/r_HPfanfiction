Looking for some good, complete works with good grammar and story. Basically, give me the best ones you've ever read. I don't care about length. AO3 preferred, but ffn okay too. No romance please unless it's just a background story.

Ready, GO!

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** Is there anything in specific you want or don't want? That will help people find things that you'll like. You'll get more responses if you ask for specifics. (Also I believe the tag you want to use is "Request", not "Recommendation".)

In the meantime, here's some of my recommendations:

linkffn(13052802) Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider. Now, I normally don't like Starfox5's writing (just not a style that I'm easily able to get into or stick with, which is a shame because they write such interesting plots), but this is my exception fic. I thought it was a remarkably well-written Aunt Petunia who, despite being AU, still clearly felt like the character in spirit. The plot was interesting, and I enjoyed the tomb exploration that happened.

(If you do like Starfox5's writing style, I know a lot of people will recommend their completed fics. They have a lot and also update pretty regularly from what I know.)

linkao3(790488) World in Pieces. This was a really cool AU that pulled canon!Harry from just after he beat Voldemort into an alternate universe where they wanted him to defeat Voldemort there. It's an interesting premise in that you uncover what happened to previous Harrys, and the protagonist Harry develops a genuine friendship with this AU Snape.

linkao3(9821300) Swung by Serafim. The plot is that Harry and Ron lost their memories after Lockhart attacked them in CoS. It gets pretty AU from there, especially because Harry changed personality since he lost basically all his memory after his parents died, but I did enjoy the worldbuilding that happened. There's a bit of romance between Harry and Snape towards the end, but it's not much and the relationship was built on a good base of friendship that the rest of the fic had laid out. The fic meanders towards the end, letting you see the extensive details the author planned out for the happy ending, but on the whole I enjoyed reading it.

linkffn(10070079; 11463030; 13001252) The Arithmancer series. A long fic about what if Hermione was a genius with arithmancy. A lot of people will complain that it follows canon pretty closely and that it has a tendency to drag on, but I found it interesting and enjoyed the third book's exploration of the future.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** I loved The Aurors for a murder mystery novel, though it's a quick read. For something longer and if you like Snape as a character I always recommend A Difference in the Family. If you like next gen then I recommend Hogwarts Houses Divided as a cute well written story and his other series Alexandra Quick but that's unfinished.
