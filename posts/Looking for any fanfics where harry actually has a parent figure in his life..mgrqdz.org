Poor Harry is an orphan and it seems like he got nobody to be a parent to him. So any fics where someone is actually being a parent figure would be great. I don't care who.

** Sirius escapes from Azkaban when Harry is eight, and comes to check on him instead of chasing Peter: linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7). I like it because there's no secret Black family magic, Harry isn't a prodigy, the characters are all just people. Book five is in progress.

Harry is adopted by the Grangers at five years old: linkffn(The Accidental Animagus). Starts out looking like it's just going to fix everything from canon, with Harry having parents and a sister and an Animagus form and more maturity, but as you keep going it turns out that the villains have been level-grinding too, such as Fenrir Greyback invading Hogwarts with an army of werewolves on just enough Wolfsbane to keep them mission-focused and Voldemort gathering several other dark sorcerers with a comparable level of skill to himself, in different specialisations. The sequel is in progress.

Tom Riddle went into politics instead of terrorism: linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense). Harry (actually Harriett) has both of her parents alive, along with Sirius and Remus, but she's legally barred from Hogwarts because she's not pureblood. She's not one to let that stop her, though. Quite an original storyline, with elements inspired by HP canon and by Alanna the Lioness but overall going its own way. Book four recently finished, book five starting soon.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.
