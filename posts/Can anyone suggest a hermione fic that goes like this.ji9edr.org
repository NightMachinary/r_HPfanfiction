Basically last night I dreamt that I was in a school (hogwarts and my old school mix) and on the admission day, I see hermione as a student volunteer helping students sort out the books. She was irritated due to vast number of students but was still kind. So went there and asked for my books too but later I returned to help her and we just talked while we worked. Useless things, venting (she was venting about lavender brown xD), smiles and such which I listened to as she spoke. Turns out that's all she needed and in the end she smiled and thanked me (of course I have a crush on her - AlwaysüòÅ)

So is there any Harry/hermione fic where Harry likes her from the start and they just sit and talk casual stuff. Hermione is always stressed but whenever Harry is there, he calms her down and they both just pass the time talking, reading and playfully bantering. I would love to read a fluff work like this. Action may or may not be there but main focus must be the pairing with trope crush to best friend to lovers.


** Maybe you should write it yourself! You've seemingly got an idea of what you want!

*** Done. In fact I hid the post, considering that people keep down voting (no idea why)... dunno why it's still visible.

If I don't get any recommendations in 24 hrs, I'll delete it üòÅ
