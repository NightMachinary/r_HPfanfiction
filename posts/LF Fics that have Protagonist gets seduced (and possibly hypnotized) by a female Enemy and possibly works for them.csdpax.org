I can only Name "The Master Bedroom of Delacour Manour" and "Harry Potter and the Purification Device". The First is uncomplete and it seems abandoned, while the other has him only for a short time for them as his Rescue was on the Way.

I would like to read similar Fics with such Situations. The Protagonist doesnt need to have Harry...who knows, maybe it has a good Tom Riddle, that gets seduced to the Dark Side by this.

Possible smut scenes are welcome. I would accept femslash Fics aswell.
