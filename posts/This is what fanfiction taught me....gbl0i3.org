Every new leaf turned begins with a change of wardrobe...and burning the old one...also using the soot and cinder to burn Number Four Privet Drive to the ground.


** True but the change of wardrobe does make sense as harry never had anything new of his own (excluding the wizard robes) and was forced to wear very poor quality massively oversized clothes from Dudley.

So "turning over a new leaf" can easily start with Harry getting clothes that fit him.

** An offhand comment about the shopping stuff is fine, a part of a chapter with another character, filled with humour is better - The Merging did this well. But 15000 words describing which precise shade of black goth Harry is buying his T-shirts in is annoying. Very annoying.

****** Yeah, perhaps it wasn't him who did it, but the guy walked around with pocket dimension with very advanced weather charms. Harry having a room with a bed and table on his trunk looks tame in comparison.

******* I would rather stick a wizarding tent inside of it to take out and use when necessary. Hiding and/or explaining away a trunk sitting in the middle of nowhere is easier to explain than a tent.

And the funny thing is, fanfiction did the "world in a trunk" first.

/Not Normal/ did it a full 3-5 years ahead of fantastic beasts. Well, the movie turned the scale up to 11. That fic had a /connected/ trunk country.

** Wardrobe change actually makes sense, since Harry's clothes were pretty bad, and it makes even more sense if he's trying to change his image or something.

Though I dislike when people use 2k words to describe clothing we'll never see again. Honestly, just say he went to Diagon Alley and bought all new clothes/robes and burned his old ones, there, no need to describe every new outfit.
