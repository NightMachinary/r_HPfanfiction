Reading the amount of HP fanfiction I do, I was inspired to do a deep-dive analysis of Tom Riddle's character (like, I really wasn't able to let it go). I thought I'd share it here with you other avid readers to perhaps start a discussion or maybe even for it to serve as inspiration!

You can read it [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/i2i6ut/riddle_me_this_a_tom_riddle_character_study/][here]]. Be sure to let me know what you think!


** What do you think would be different if Tom were raised by his father? Let's say Tom Riddle Sr. comes back and takes custody of young Marvolo after Merope dies.

*** Oh wow, good question. I played around with the idea of Tom being raised by Merope, mostly because JK had said that he would've turned out differently had she decided to live, love and raise him (which I have my doubts about). If we play out the thought experiment with Tom Riddle Sr. :

Being a psychopath does not mean one has to be/become evil. I'll just start off with that. I think the main difference with Tom growing up with Tom Riddle Sr. would've been growing up among Muggles and being affluent (higher class, enough means, a source of pride, etc.). If we assume he would grow up in a 'normal' home, with his grandparents around, etc. He would've had better socialisation but still been a psychopath. Perhaps he would not have developed this hatred of Muggles (or project his hatred). I think it's also interesting to note here that most psychopaths, who are not your conventional evil, thrive really well in high positions in the business world. So, perhaps Tom would've ended joining the Ministry or found another high-powered position, without this self-destructive obsession to form his sense of self - for he would have at least somewhat of a base through growing up in a stable home (but he'd still want to confirm his magical side as well). Maybe his narcissism would not have developed to that destructive point (though narcissism and psychopathy have many overlapping traits).\\
But what would then happen when he discovers he's related to the Gaunts, those disgusting beings further down the road? His mother raped his father through the use of Magic. Would he then become obsessed with ridding the world of magic? Or would he unemotionally view whatever happened? As in, 'well, magic /can/ be used so it /should/ be used for whatever goal you're trying to reach'. Would he still blame his father for abandoning his mother?

Would he even grow up in a magic-friendly household, with a father who has had such a vile experience with Magic? Would the magic be 'beaten' out him, so he comes to suppress it? I can see it already, little Tom would start manipulating his father and grandparents to still get his way. Perhaps eventually Imperio'ing or ruling over them with fear tactics.

Honestly, I really do not know, haha. If Tom was indeed a 'true' psychopath, we must not forget the traits that go along with it. In short, I don't think he would've become a Voldemort if he had been raised in a stable home, especially with Muggles who 'cared' for him.

What are your thoughts?! I'd love to know!
