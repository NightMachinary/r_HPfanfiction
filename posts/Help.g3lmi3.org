Only plot point I fully remember was that the Dumbledore family owned the Giant Squid or at least pretended they did and because of that had the market on Ink for the wizarding world


** I think that might've been Partially Kissed Hero, but I could be wrong.

I vaguely recall something about family monopolies too, so it might be that one where Harry pretends to be an idiot and looks to sell things he's made (turns out he made a lot of expensive things, far more than the ministry who gave him the license thought). I can't remember the name, but the descriptions were something about that whole con-process thing.

**** I asked on another thread with just the monopolies thing I remembered and got it confirmed by multiple sources - it's definitely Partially Kissed Hero.
