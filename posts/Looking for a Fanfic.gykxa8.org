Hi guys

I'm looking for this story if any one can help.

From what I remember, Harry finds solace in the chamber of secrets, and there he finds a waterfall or a painting of a waterfall that allows him to see into the headmasters office. He also learns how to jump into portraits. Where he spies on order meetings, doesn't really trust anyone, not sure if it's a bashing book but could be.

I don't remember much else. If anyone can help I'll be really grateful.

Thanks :)


** I'm afraid I don't know this one, but it sounds interesting to me.

As an aside, this should properly be flair'd with "What's That Fic?

** Could it be “Harry Potter and the Pendant Of Slytherin” by Neednotknowtheirnames?

  6/7th year fic. Harry decides he wants to do things his way, because Dumbledore's method of defeating Voldemort just doesn't appeal. He finds friends in unexpected places and embarks on a method of defeat in which he sometimes holds little hope. H/OFC.
