Looking for story where in it harry is becoming independent but dumbledore is manipulating, trying to get harry back there is this i remember: "Dumbledore plans to adopt harry but before he does tonks gets in with the paperwork first. When dumbledore gets the letter harry is already in his office i think? Dumbledore goes on a rant telling harry new rules he has to follow, completely unreasnoble ones like, and don't quote me but i think snape will constantly use legilimency on him, he cannot leave the castle at all and more before he opens the letter and finds out this plot didn't work" that's all i remember but i know i greatly enjoyed it.
