Ok so I got into the HP FF world after reading Whispers in the dark by Reddhg87 a couple of years ago and I was feeling a bit nostalgic and wanted to revisit what made me fall in love with the fic fandom but it has been removed by the author! I tried reaching out and they never responded so I turn to y'all. By any chance does anyone have a pdf or epub of this fic. I would be forever grateful to read it once more. Thank y'all so much! (adding the only working link that works for the 1st chapter and the final chapter for clarity which fic it is) [[http://www.fanfiction.ws/s/12148453/1/Whispers-in-the-Dark]]


** There's this site called ff2ebook archive where you can download fanfictions into ebooks, it might be there. Or you could use the Waybackmachine.

*** Thanks! I tried the wayback machine but it only does the first and last chapter. I'll look into ff2ebook but idk if it needs a complete valid link that has access to all chapters.

** That happened to one of my favorite smut fics. I was so sad when I couldn't find it on Ao3 anymore.
