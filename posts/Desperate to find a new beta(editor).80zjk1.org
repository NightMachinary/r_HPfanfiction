Hello all you lovers of Harry Potter! I am starting on a new fic and need a beta. Unfortunately I can't find anyone on fan fiction that will respond. Does anyone here know of someone that is looking for a writer or accepting new stories.

I've messaged no less than about 40 people on fan fiction with no response. So hoping Reddit will help me.

This will be a 5-10 Chapter story. Ultimately over 60k+ words. Draco/ Hermione fic. Plenty of twists and turns. Just need someone to bounce ideas off of and help me to stay somewhat true to the universe.

It's been many years since I wrote and I'm a little rusty. Forgive me ‚úåüèªüòú

I sincerely apologize if I have posted this in the wrong section!
