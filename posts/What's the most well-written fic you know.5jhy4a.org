** Well /written/ is a very particular quantifier. PotDK is my favorite HP fic, but I would never say it's the best written. Crafting great prose is a very technical skill, entirely different to coming up with a great plot or characters.

So, keeping all of that in mind, I would say Circular Reasoning.

** Best written war fic I've ever read: The Fallout. It's only here though - [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1]]

Hermione learns about growing up through the redemption of Draco Malfoy.

Excerpt:

"When does war begin?

Hermione thinks she could probably trace it back to her first year at Hogwarts, because a war began then, when Harry first met Voldemort as an opponent rather than a child. Or, perhaps, it was when Hermione first received her Hogwarts acceptance letter; when a young girl saw her world change, and the wizarding world saw another Mudblood. Or maybe it was when Dumbledore was murdered on a tower, in a structure of what was to be a haven for the Light.

Maybe it is bigger than just them though. War. Perhaps the first war just never really ended. Maybe it began with the start of time and the first Muggle-born. Tonks will tell her, days and days from now, that war just never stops - it builds, climaxes, ebbs, and builds again. But Hermione is not the sort of person who can believe in a world that can find no peace."

** Well written in terms of crafting an enjoyable story? I like A Long Journey Home. It's incomplete, and has very sparse updates (last one was April 2016), but what's there is simply amazing. I was a big fan of The Highlander TV series, in part because of the window into day to day historical life. This story has that in spades.

Well written in terms of getting the technical details of writing done, such as spelling, grammar, plot continuity, etc? There are a few that do this really well. A Long Journey Home is one, as is most of what I remember from jbern.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
