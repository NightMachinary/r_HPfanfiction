The discussion thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4ddcd1/wouldnt_lupin_have_see_two_harrys_and_hermiones/]["Wouldn't Lupin have see two Harrys and Hermiones on the Marauders Map?"]] on [[/r/harrypotter]] brought up several interesting points concerning out-of-time people, and the Marauder's Map.

Namely, the going theory on this thread seems to be that the Map does /not/ shown time-displaced people. This is due to nothing being raised in /Prisoner of Azkaban/ about multiple Hermiones and Harrys appearing on the Map at the same time. Likewise, Lupin never mentions anything about it, despite being in possession of the Map.

Having read a lot of time-travel-related-HP fanfiction myself, one common trope of the "time travel" plot is the time traveller being "found out" by his/her real name being displayed on the Marauder's Map. This is after the time traveller uses a fake name to conceal his/her identity. However, if the Map doesn't shown out-of-time people to begin with, this would play out quite differently.

[[/r/HPfanfiction]], what are your thoughts?


** Hell, no one noticed peter pettigrew despite the map clearly displaying him for Harry while in his animagus form. His brothers never wondered "Hey, why's a bloke keep sleeping with Ron, is he a poofter?" No teasing about it or anything- I can't see the twins seeing anything like that out of bounds.

I think things like this have an easier explanation, they just didn't notice.

Way I see it, Lupin was just casually glancing at the map for signs of Sirus black, and when he saw him, he immediately left, not considering anything else, not looking for more- because Sirus black being near Harry potter was enough to forsake everything else, including Wolfbane potion. Hell, maybe he even skimmed over the names and those were ignored as "Not Sirus black, not important"

As for Hermione... Well, I figure a time traveler- and how irresponsible is that- allowing a teen to hold position of one of the only dozen or so time turners presumably to take extra classes instead of moving classes to non conflicting times, putting a foot down on her taking every class or offering her a self study option? But anyway, presumably they told the teachers that a student has an object like that- considering it's potential in pranking and rule breaking, even if it is Hermione, they'd presumably alert the other teachers about it.

So, TLTR: Yes, but the teachers including Lupin knew, and hermonie was careful to only use the time turner for class and just for class so Harry never had the chance to see it on the map.

*** Gryffindors live in stacked dorms in a tower. It would be a massive amount of students. Likely every student sleeping has one or two names overlapping them.

**** Plus, Harry doesn't know the names of everyone in Fred and George's year. It's likely they don't know all the boys in Harry's year either, and might've just assumed Peter's another student; plus furniture doesn't show up, I don't think - they could assume Ron and Peter are two dormmates just chatting.

As well, Fred and George have the whole map memorised by PoA, and they even told Harry they don't really use it anymore - because they only ever cared to see the secret passages, and avoid teachers.

***** It would still be Peter /Pettigrew/. Call the twins what you want, but they are a curious bunch and if some classmate of Harry is named exactly like the war-hero Pettigrew, they'd at least ask about it, or eventually realize that there is one too many student in their brothers dorm - every night, the entire year.

****** They probably didn't know exactly how many boys are in Ron's dorm. Honestly, I wouldn't care to know stats like that for my little brother's class. Also, there were many /many/ war heroes besides Pettigrew, and most 13-15 year olds don't know the names of all of them. Their parents weren't in the original Order, so they probably didn't personally know or mention any war heroes beyond Fabian and Gideon. It's highly unlikely they'd know who Pettigrew was before Sirius' escape (I can't even recall if the article about him mentioned the name of the wizard he killed), when other students (including the very well-read Hermione, and Ron and Ginny Weasley) didn't know about the Longbottoms, who were /also/ war heroes.

**** It wouldn't actually be all that much. Lets say that 5 boys and 5 girls is average for a year per house. Then you'd deal with 70 people overall. Thats /nothing/ for a school. And the twins use the map for an entire year and then some. Eventually they would notice a war hero - Order of Merlin First Class - that people believe dead.

It simply is one of the biggest plotholes in the entire franchise.

***** We don't know that there are only x students. Even in Harry's Year, we hear about 40 and we can suppositionally expect that older years are going to be fuller due to death rates, fleeing the war, and birth control during war time. Those forty are the only named students in his year, there could be more.

Plus, if the school has 1000 students approximately, we CAN accept that they're fairly 50/50 boy/girl as that's the breakdown everywhere except china.

But ignoring the possibility of more in Harry's year, we fall back to 1000 and 50%. If we follow the logic she used, each house gets a roughly equal division--which doesn't really make sense--that means there are 125 boys stacked in seven dorms. Likely, second and third year are smaller as well since they would have been born at the height of the events in the seventies. So fourth through seventh are probably the most populous students.

Also, the map shows everything on one level, doesn't it? If there's no differentiation between floors it becomes more of a proximity alert device than a true map.

There are too many classes to take in a day than can be moved around, right? That was the whole reason she did it.

**** Saturdays or Sundays as much as the students might hate it.

Evenings or mornings if nothing else- they're okay with the kids having to have late night astronomy classes once a week, it's not a problem from that end at least.
