A story i read a while ago. I believe he lived deep in the forbidden forest along with a bunch of snakes. If i remember correctly the snakes had a prophecy regarding him. He lived in a tree house. I think he enden up in the forest as a kid due to accidental magic.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
