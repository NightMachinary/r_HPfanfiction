For a fanfic idea I have, I diverge from Rowling's canon sometime soon after the end of Book seven (not including the epilogue). I have in my head all that occurs in said divergence, but plan on starting the fanfic years after the divergence, with chapters in and between that will be set prior to where the first chapter begins, and thus will explain to the reader what happened. Any tips on how to do that effectively?


** Two of my fics have backwards changes that happened years before the fic took place.

In the first one, I added a series of "memories" from the backstory that tied in with the current timeline. Since it was an AU travel fic, it worked with the storyline to add these little elements peppered throughout.

For my second story, there wasn't any universe changing, so I added the key "memories" (those which caused the differentiation from canon into my AU) as a prequel chapter and posted it alongside my first chapter. Then as the story fleshed out, I would add any details through exposition or dialogue.

We're either of these methods considered effective? I'm not sure, but they made sense to me and I didn't have too many questions in the reviews about what was going on. For the first one, I did leave an Authors Note stating they'd be getting the background throughout, just to give some kind of context.

*** I just hope that the readers will not be too startled or unsettled by the back and forth. Would people be able to just pick up on the cues?

**** It's hard to tell without knowing your context. Can you give any more info on the situation that's changing?

In my first story's case, I had little tags before each memory section and they were in italics to keep it separate from the main story. It also helped that I placed the memory part at the beginning or the end of the chapter, so it truly could be read separately if the reader wanted to.

When it was done in the prologue, I had dates before each memory (I believe there were three or four). The hardest for this story, was putting the rest of the info in exposition and dialogue throughout. For that, I used an outline to pinpoint where each piece of information would fall and then wrote a scene around what I wanted to tell. Again, I made sure to use an Authors Note at the beginning of the fic stating that they'd get the backstory throughout. It is difficult when choosing to write several years after a large changing event, but I found trying to incorporate it into the storyline left the readers anxious to find out what happened as the main storyline unfolds.

It's a Dramione story where they are already married, so I want scenes that explain how they ended up becoming a couple sprinkled throughout the fanfic.
