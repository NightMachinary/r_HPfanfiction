The weirdest request I've seen would be when a redditor asked for a fic where dumbledore's robes would randomly suplex him.


** That guy round here that requested Draco/Sexy bowl of fruit.

****** Wtf? Why did I read that? I read your warning but I was too curious. This will he forever imprinted on my brain. Its worse than than the Hogwarts/Giant Squid smut fic. I need to go read something else and make myself forget.

** Nazi!Harry is up there. From limited experience, white nationalist types usually seem to hate HP.

There was also that guy who asked for fics where Hermione gets tortured and/or killed in a particularly graphic fashion, because "Hermione-Sue". Sure, she can be a douche at times, but that's just unfair.

Not really a request, but someone self-promoted a non-con fic once. His enthusiasm for the events themselves was more off-putting than the fact that he'd written it in the first place.

** I made the robes request and still have not ben answered. It is quite possible i was remebering a dream rather than a fic given the fact that no one else seems to have ever read it
