In this fic Harry becomes a Dark Lord and some of his servants/army members are Draco and the Weasley twins. It becomes Harry/Voldemort and they both work together as Dark Lord's. I think Sirius and Remus join his army as well.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.
