I sort of recently read a story where Harry is in legal trouble due to Misuse of Muggle Artifacts, but ends up getting the case thrown out because it would set a precedent that would basically shut down half of magical britain.. I can't remember the name or author for the life of me, and it's driving me nuts.. Halp!


** Linkffn(daft morons)

This is the one you are looking for I believe. Harry proves that magical Britain uses a huge amount of muggle artifacts and they would all be in trouble
