After I learned that the owner died a few months ago and the SSL Certificate running out a few weeks ago I wonder if it is completely shut down now and whether there is a way to get all of the fics?


** Hope someone made a DB. Was planning on since I found out that the SSL certificate ran out, unfortunately the whole site is down now.
