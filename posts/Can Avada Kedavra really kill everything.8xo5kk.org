In the Potterverse, the Killing curse is infamous for being able to kill any living being, besides Harry. However, it has been shown that it can be intercepted by physical objects (e.g. gravestones). Therefore, could it be blocked by armour that is thick enough? What about crossover fics? Could AK kill someone wearing uru or vibranium?

More importantly, could AK kill god-like beings, especially those who have shown feats to surviving much more powerful magic? Do you really expect someone who could survive a point-blank galactic system annihilation, to be even remotely affected by AK? Potterverse magic isn't particularly powerful, nor are its typical wielders considered tactical or logical.


** Armor is not enough to stop the AK. As to crossovers, well that is entirely up to the fanfic author since Rowling definitely didn't write with those in mind.

As to the point blank galactic system annihilation, well the AK may indeed kill that being. Unless it has equal resistance to magic. You see Harry Potter magic affects things on a conceptual level. According to Rowling magic always takes precedence over natural physics. So a spell that kills things could kill something that's described to survive everything non-magical. Also the killing curse isn't necessarily weaker than some sort of spell that makes a large bang. It just does a different thing.

Of course when you are writing about things that are stronger than the strongest beings in HP, you could plausibly make them above such things.

Also if the being is somehow immortal, the killing curse wouldn't stick.

AS to vibranium armor, if the armor is magically superior to anything in hp verse (and hp doesn't have much in that regard) then it's authors choice really.

*** What if someone was able to create an armour that hovered a dozen centimeters away from the body, not connected physically in anyway to the person's body, but still covering it entirely while also having a secondary body armour to protect against any splinters or shards from the outer armor, if it gets damaged by spell fire ? (I'm talking HPverse, not xovers)

Using Naruto as an example of what I mean by this, IIRC, Gaara has a carapace of sand over his entire body to protect him from physical blows, while also having a 360ยบ shield of sand that protects him instinctly, kinda like Ryuseei Seikuken, from Kenichi, but made of sand, and not just awareness.

**** I suppose it would be the same as hovering a stone brick a dozen centimeters away from you. Should work yeah, but i don't think that Harry Potter magic is quite capable of making it practical.

It's possible that if you have one object like a dome around you, then the entire object explodes to contact, not just the location hit with the AK.

I think that question has been pondered a lot. I think you just have to assume that there's some kind of inherent spiritual/conceptual difference recognized by Magic between clothing and some other object that might block the path. Still doesn't explain why Aurors don't wear shields (and have a Mokeskin pouch full of shrunken replacements) or employ magical bombs they can throw which expel an expanding cloud of debris that would block any Killing Curse coming their way. Hermione or the twins could probably jerry-rig them something that listens for the words "Avada Kedavra" and auto-deploys.

** What we know about the Killing Curse from canon is pretty much what you said. It kills "anything" (we only really see it used on humans and smaller animals). It induces death without any visible damage and without damage detectable by 1940s muggles. It deals explosive physical damage to non-living matter. Magical shields don't stop it, except for Sacrificial Protection. Spells colliding with it will stop it, although I think we only see Harry's brother wand and the Elder Wand do that in the books.

The problem with AK is that it's too powerful not only for crossovers, but for other parts of JKR's world. You need 100 wizards to take down a Nundu? Nope, just keep a couple of specialists who are trained to cast AK and authorized to use it on Class XXXXX creatures.

My headcanon is that AK kills by destroying the nervous system at the synaptic level, so that you would need an electron microscope to see what was wrong. This means that it would not work on plants. (I don't remember if we see any stray curses hit grass or trees in canon.) Also, hair, feathers, and possibly scales are made of dead cells, so they count as non-living matter. If a creature's natural armor is thick enough that AK's explosive effect can't punch through to the nervous system, it will block the curse. (This is what I did with the Nundu in /The Accidental Animagus/.)

I think wearing armor could block AK in theory, but it would have to be thick enough to withstand the explosive effect. If you tried to do that with steel, it would be too heavy to wear, but if it's an exotic material like Vibranium or carbon nanotubes, it could work. (Which I did with Hermione's buckler in /Lady Archimedes/.)

For crossover purposes, I would add the rule that because it acts on the nervous system, AK requires power proportional to the size of the animal. So if you cast it on, say, Godzilla, even if you could punch through his armor, you wouldn't be able to put enough power behind it to kill him, just because it would be ridiculous for any trained wizard to be able to one-shot Godzilla.

*** I think Nundus need 100 wizards to subdue it safely. As in for capture, not killing. But even if it was about killing the Nundu, i'd recon the difficulty is landing a hit on a fast moving agile creature thats spewing the plague everywhere. Also wands aren't snipers so getting close is an issue.

We don't know if things like bubblehead charm are sufficient against Nundu poison breath. Could be a contact poison for example. Or magical eats thru everything and gives you magic ebola in addition.

I think bringing down a nundu is more along the lines of 100 wizards surrounding a large area of thick jungle where the nundu is located and then creating some sort of a box/dome that they start to make smaller as they close in.

**** In Accidental Animagus, it takes multiple killing curses cast by DUMBLEDORE to bring down a Nundu, due to the density of already dead material that makes up its coat.

**** I suppose given its habitat, that would make more sense than it just being so strong that you need 100 wizards to keep hammering it with curses to put it down.

Of course, I also made the Nundu a magically created creature in my story because maintaining a breeding population of large carnivores that spread highly virulent plagues seems like a stretch for even wizards to keep hidden.

** I'm still working on how the Unforgivables fit into my AU magical theory, but I do think that magically resistant creatures will stand a chance of surviving. I refuse to believe that dragons, basilisks, nundus, etc can be brought down with a single spell by a mediocre wizard or witch. I like the comment by [[/u/Wu_Gang][u/Wu_Gang]] below saying that it could be designed to work on humans, and so there isn't a guarantee that it will work on other creatures. It often does (like the spiders in Goblet of Fire), but it isn't a certainty; especially with powerful creatures or ones not understood well by humans.

I also think that armour /would/ work to block the Killing Curse, if it were thick enough. However it'd get pretty messed up from a direct hit, and shrapnel is never fun. I haven't worked out when each Unforgivable was invented in my AU timeline, but if it is before medieval times then I think it could be a good additional reason for why knights wore metal armour.

*** We've seen it kill spiders and foxes, so it's not just humans.

On the one hand, it does feel a little unbalanced to have the Killing Curse able to one-shot a dragon or a giant. But on the other hand, being unbalanced is the whole point of the Killing Curse. It's equally unbalanced that a wizard like Goyle could one-shot a wizard like Dumbledore with the Killing Curse. It's the ultimate equaliser: though there are some measures a skilled wizard can take to try to survive, it still has to be taken seriously regardless of the difference in magical ability between the two people duelling.

**** Well, assuming such armor can be made to be worn by a human, I'd imagine it would only buy you time to get away/and or retaliate. It wouldn't be a solution to the curse, just a defense.
