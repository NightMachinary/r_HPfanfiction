There's this hp fanfic that i read once in a while. The thing is that each time i forget the title. So i search for it and i can't find it.

I need your help, maybe you read it so i will give the description of it ;

It's a time traveling fanfic

Harry gets sorted in ravenclaw, well not really the sorting hat does not sort him so the treachers all come to gather and ask him which hose he would like go to.

He and Draco are friends.

Snap is nice to him.

That's all i can remember.

*** to be honest, the sorting part is probably something more unique
