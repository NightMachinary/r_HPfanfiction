** "It was a duel club! Professor Lockhart said as so!" Harry yelled.

Snape looked severely at him as the whole hall laughed, "That means you were expected to disarm Mr Malfoy, not whatever spell you wanted to!"

"I... I tried to, not sure why my wand responded like that. It was a simple spell though, nothing major," more laughs.

"You just shrunk Mr Malfoy's penis to a 10th of its size!"

"You can fix it, can't you? Professor?" asked Draco.

Snape looked severe, "I am afraid not. Penises is one of the five exceptions to Dickard's Law of Unshrinkable objects."

Professor Lockhart nodded smugly to Draco's panic expression, "We can change its color, if it helps."

"Of course not! Why would I---"

At that not an owl came flying by and released a Howler that boomed with the unmistakable voice of Lucius Malfoy.

"What's the meaning of this Draco?! The magical candles that keep track of the family's pureblood penises have changed! Yours is smaller than a Bertie Bott's bean now! You have been disinherited starting now. We cannot have Malfoy men with such small penises!"

The howler torned itself to pieces as laughs came over Draco's panicked face. The boy then frowned and turned to Harry, "Pottah!"

*** I will say that if Penjses really were one of the five exceptions to Dickard's Law of Unshrinkable Objects, no wizard would be walking around with at least twenty-five different protective charms over it.

**** They surely do. Good protective Equipment must be available. As well as fake equipment sold by the twins that actually makes it easier for your penis to be shrunk down.
