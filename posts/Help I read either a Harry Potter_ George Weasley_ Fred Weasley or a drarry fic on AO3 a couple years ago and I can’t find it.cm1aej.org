:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember that:

- It was a NOT a mpreg

- Dumbledore and some of the Weasleys were bad and Harry changed sides

- Voldie and Fenrir Grayback were together and like grandparents/ parents to Harry

- They blood adopted a baby and were almost were stopped by dumbledore

- I'm fairly certain that Harry had an inheritance and could change into a dragon

Thank you for helping me find it! This fic is amazing!
