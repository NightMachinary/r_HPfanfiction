Is there a fic where Harry is taken to the future and then she lives until the moment when she is taken.

( I dont think I Described it right but Im looking for stories like "A Long Journey Home" by Rakeesh)

Same idea of Harry being sent far into the past and has to wait until he reaches his present time.
