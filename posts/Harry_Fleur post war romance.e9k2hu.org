Are there any fics where bill dies in the final battle and/or the marriage was just a way to protect fleur during the war or that they get an amicable divorce

basically any fic that stays true to canon personalities for the most part

no bashing or fem!harry or slash

*** Besides the grammatical errors (I'm assuming ESL) and a rocky start, this story ended up being really cool and I hope the author hasn't abandoned it. I really liked where it was going.

  An opportunity comes along that will enable him to make the change and once again reunited with the woman he truly loved. But circumstances have its own plan. A sacrifice would have to be made that will make or break everything he work so hard for. This is the story. Attention:Time Travel. Disclaimer: The usual bla3x..

I don't really want to go into detail as not to spoil anything, I think it fits the request well enough. It is a WIP with kind of slow updates though. But I enjoyed what's there even though it is a lot fluffier than I usually like.
