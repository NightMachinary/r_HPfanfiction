** This question essentially boils down to an old debate among legal scholars, which is this: do people have a duty to save others? If people have a moral obligation to save others then the magical world is clearly failing to live up to that moral obligation, and are thus immoral in that aspect of their society. On the other hand, if there is no moral obligation to help others, then wizards withholding aid from Muggles is morally neutral. It's not good, but it's not bad either.

So should people be under an obligation to save others?

It's easy to construct extreme hypotheticals which would make you think "yes": the typical example used is that of walking past a baby drowning in shallow water and doing nothing to help them. In that hypothetical, one's moral intuition is to say that it would be immoral not to save the baby.

However, that is an extreme scenario. When you think about the everyday realities of a duty to save others, the issue becomes much murkier. There are many implications for human behaviour if we adopt it as a rule.

Think about it for a moment: all of us who live in western societies have the means to help others which we choose not to utilise. We have resources and we have skills. Is it immoral for a person not to donate their entire wealth to charity? Is it immoral for a person not to quit their job to work for a charity? It is a dangerous thing to say that everyone is under a moral obligation to sacrifice everything in their life to devote themselves to helping others.

And that is what magical people having to help Muggles would amount to. You can't just wave a wand and remove all the cancer from the world. You'd have to cure each cancer patient one by one. That would be a full time job for magical society, and that's just one of a thousand problems that wizards could help with. Wizards wouldn't be able to live their own lives anymore without such an act being immoral. Every second they spend enjoying themselves is a second they have failed to save someone.

Ultimately the issue is one of liberty. Helping others is morally good, but to make helping others a moral /obligation/ is to say it is more important than liberty. I for one am not willing to do so.

But that isn't really an extreme hypothetical in this content. Every day people muggles die from wounds and illnesses that wizards could effortlessly cure. They can saves the lives of dying babies with a wave of their hand.

Reductio ad absurdum.

Nobody is saying that wizards need spend every minute of their waking lives helping muggles. They could still make a massive difference in the lives of muggles while only putting in the minimum amount of effort.

On top of that, wizards can be payed. They don't have to help for free; we muggles can compensate them for their work. We muggles aren't a charity case. Imagine how rich wizards would be if they charged for their services --- Mrs Weasley could buy new dress robes for all her kids.

#+end_quote

That's a false dilemma. Moral obligations and liberty aren't mutually exclusive. People do have an ethical responsibility to help others, but they also have the freedom to act selfishly if they so choose.

Just because you're free to act apathetically doesn't mean that apathy is somehow admirable. Liberty means you're free to make your own choices; liberty does not mean that those choices are all equally commendable.

In canon wizards actually lack freedom because it's illegal to help muggles. If you're pro-liberty, like you claim, then you should be against International Statute of Secrecy, as it removes a wizards agency to choose for themselves.

***** But I'm not demanding anything. Wizards don't have to help if they don't want to.

The problem is that at the moment wizards can't help /even if they want to/. The International Statute of Secrecy /demands/ that wizards spend 0 hours helping muggles. They don't have any freedom or liberty.

Wizards should be able to spend any number of hours helping muggles, from 24 hours a day to 0 hours a day. The extent of their interaction with muggles should be a personal decision.

I also don't like you calling it a "burden" on wizards. We muggles aren't infantile morons that need depend upon wizards. We can solve our own problems perfectly fine. And again, wizards don't need to work for charity. Considering the relative sizes of the magical and muggle worlds we, muggles are, as a whole, significantly richer than wizards. 0.1% of the muggle British GDP is probably more than the GDP of all magical Britain. We can pay them for their services.

Removing the International Statute of Secrecy isn't about forcing wizards into becoming muggle slaves; it's about giving wizards the freedom to do good and/or get rich by selling their valuable services. Any wizard that doesn't want to interact with muggles can just stay in their own segregated magical communities that muggles can't access.

****** But that's not true, wizards are allowed to help. They can help using nonmagical means or they can help using magical means so long as they are subtle about it. They just aren't allowed to endanger their fellows by helping with obvious magic.

If you start compensating wizards for helping then it's no longer an issue of morality, it's a simple matter of commerce. That's arguably even worse since now the magical wizard will still be exposed but the benefits will flow only to the wealthy.

By claiming that wizards are morally obliged to help you are demanding they participate under penalty of societal opprobrium if nothing else.

Not at all.

- competition between magical and technological industries drive down prices for everybody (for example, pharmaceuticals can no longer charge ludicrous prices for medicine because they'll be undercut by cheap alternative magical cures)

- environmental issues that effect humanity as a whole can be mitigated with magic (like the vanishing of hazardous materials)

- massive leaps in science as an entirely new side of reality is revealed (and all the potential new technology that entails)

- physics defying magic can create perpetual motion machines and other free power sources (finally ending muggle reliance on fossil fuels)

- reverse engineering and/or exploiting certain magic could lead to humanity colonizing the universe (for example, broomsticks are anti-gravity, bubble-head charms are automatic oxygen replenishing, undetectable extension charms are warping of space-time and apparation is teleporting)

It's just plain spiteful to deny magic for all mankind just because the rich will benefit more.

The International Statute of Secrecy removes a wizard's agency to do good. Wizards can't do good or else they'll be punished by law, and so they are justified in their indifference towards the plights of muggles and their fellow man. Their lack of freedom absolves them from any personal responsibility. Their ignorance frees them from any guilt. The International Statute of Secrecy shields wizards from the burden of self-awareness and self-reflection.

Without the The International Statute of Secrecy, some wizards would be selfless and some would be selfish, and they each would be viewed accordingly. The International Statute of Secrecy forces all wizards to be apathetic towards muggles, and thus protects the selfish from being compared to their selfless contemporaries. The selfish benefit while everybody else is worse off. By taking away the individual's right to choose the individual cannot be judged for making the wrong choice.

In this case, societal opprobrium isn't a bad thing. It is what instills guilt into the selfish and pride into the righteous. Wizards have traded their personal freedom for peace of mind. They live placid and docile lives free from guilt and personal responsibility, and the world as a whole is significantly worse because of it.

The issue is that it would be making muggles literally dependent on wizards for everything. Who needs muggle medicine when you have Potions. Magic as a whole makes scientific advancements irrelevant since magic defies science.

If wizards needed had to help muggles and fix their problems, it would just prove that Grindelwald was actually right: wizards ARE superior to muggles because they can do everything muggles can do but better, and thus would lead to a system where wizards rule over muggles because of the unchangeable power imbalance. Wizards helping muggles means that muggles would never put any effort into doing anything themselves. The very concept of muggles needing magic just to make advancements in science also proves Voldemort right to a lesser extent. After all, if wizards and muggles were actually equals like canon tries to make the reader believe, then muggles wouldn't need wizards or any magic-related stuff to advance in the ways you mention.

Who needs muggle doctors when you have wizarding healers and potion-makers? Magic makes muggle life redundant since the muggles couldn't offer the wizards anything of equal value to what wizards would give to muggles (that being magic). Wizards helping muggles would pretty much make every single muggle employee redundant and would inevitably lead to a situation where either muggles try to destroy the wizards (and fail), or it creates the Grindelwald ideal of wizards ruling muggles by monopolizing all innovation (i.e. all the newest innovations would be Potions, which cannot be made by muggles, thus it creates a dependency culture).

Wizard-muggle relations are not, and never were equal. It has always and would always be wizards being superior to muggles. As such, the inability of muggles to give wizards any ability comparable to magic makes it an imbalanced relationship. Why would wizards have any reason to help muggles if the muggles can't offer an equal exchange? Hagrid was right in PS when he said the Statute exists to stop wizards being pestered by muggles. What wizards SHOULD do is teach muggles how to fix their problems using muggle methods (i.e. science and technology), rather than doing everything for them. It would be better for both in the long run.

If the debate topic was about wizards and goblins helping each other, then its more even since they each have their own unique aspects that they keep from each other which is touched on in canon and fanon alike. With wizards and muggles, the muggles cannot offer wizards a single thing that is even remotely as valuable as magic. Especially since there is no muggle-exclusive concepts or advantages. So while wizards aren't obligated to help goblins, the goblins aren't obligated to help wizards. They mutually benefit from each other. Goblins give wizards access to Gringotts to store money and make goblin-made objects for wizards, while wizards give Goblins money to store and some help as Cursebreakers.

Though honestly, I find wizard-goblin relations far more interesting than wizard-muggle relations, since muggles are worthless compared to wizards whereas goblins are at equally matched due to their ownership of Gringotts and their unique goblin-made enchantments (most notably the Sword of Gryffindor).

Not at all. There aren't enough wizards to go around. They couldn't do everything for us if they tried.

Besides, we muggles aren't infants. We can take care of ourselves. Magic would be immensely useful in solving the few problems we have, but on the whole us muggles are perfectly competent. [[https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ourworldindata_world-poverty-since-1820-in-absolute-numbers.png][We don't need to rely on magic, so why would we?]]

Just because broomsticks suddenly exist doesn't mean all the cars and planes in the world will disappear. Magic wouldn't replace technology, it would exist alongside it.

#+begin_quote

The majority of the world? Wizards can't brew enough potions for everyone.

Unless, of course, potion making was industrialized by muggle technology, which would be the best case scenario.

#+begin_quote
  Magic as a whole makes scientific advancements irrelevant since magic defies science.
#+end_quote

Magic would fall within the realms of science. Magic doesn't defy science as a methodology, it simply exposes the flaws in established scientific thesis. Science is versatile; it accepts new evidence and adjusts old theories accordingly.

And if you're trying to say that magic makes scientific advancement unnecessary, then I'd say that that is wrong for two reasons. First, science is done solely for the sake of new technology or any tangible benefit. Secondly, the only way magic could make new technologies completely unnecessary was if magic turned the world in a perfect utopia without any problems.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Wizards can't do everything better than muggles. Just between the time of Philosophers Stone being published and today, muggle technology has already surpassed magic in many areas.

For example, look at how amazing our communication network is now. I'm casually talking to you, a stranger, on the other side of the world, at a speeds faster than humans can comprehend. Wizards use fucking owls. I can translate [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06olHmcJjS0][things in real time]] with a phone in my pocket, while the Minister for Magic is stuck making vague hand gestures to his Bulgarian counterpart.

However, Grindelwald was partially correct. Wizards have a massive advantage by being able to use magic. If a muggle and a wizard are equal in all things mental, spiritual and physical, then the wizard is indeed inherently superior solely because of his ability to use magic. That's just an unfortunate truth.

That being said, a muggle can still be superior to a wizard if they are mentally, spiritually or physically superior. Magic is just one aspect in which wizards have an advantage. Magic can't compensate for a lack of knowledge, wisdom, charisma or any other trait.

#+begin_quote
  and thus would lead to a system where wizards rule over muggles because of the unchangeable power imbalance.
#+end_quote

Assuming that the power balance is unchangeable. If magic is passed on genetically, then through genetic engineering magic could be spread across all of humanity. If magical artifacts and magical technology can be developed and mass produced, then the gap between wizards and muggles will be drastically reduced.

#+end_quote

We don't need magic to advance. We muggles have been advancing at an exponential rate.

However, magic can help us advance even faster. There are people dying today of a disease that will be cured tomorrow. Magic can save those people.

Also, don't forget, wizards are going out of their way to hide the existence of magic. They obliviate any muggles who see magical phenomenon. Wizards are sabotaging our understanding of the universe. They are actively suppressing our development.

Wizards like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOFAnpb8I3E][gold]], silver, diamonds and other forms of material wealth just as much as we muggles do. They aren't so different to us. They like fancy clothes, tasty meals and large houses. What do you mean we have nothing to offer? As a whole, we muggles are really quite rich. We can offer wizards the things all men want.

To you, material things might not seem like an equal exchange for magic, but to wizards magic isn't something exotic. It's normal to them. Magic is commonplace in the wizarding world. They peel potatoes with spells that could revolutionize our muggle world. Magic is free for wizards.

Money, however, is worth just as much to them as it is to us.

I'm not saying wizards are stupid or naive, it's just that they haven't yet entered their equivalent of the Renaissance. The idea the wizards can match muggles in terms of innovation is just insane. If wizards could improve at the rate we do then they should have colonized Mars by now.

As I've said, for money. As I've also said, technology is already superior to magic in some ways, and we're likely going to surpass them in even more industries in the future. On top of that, material wealth isn't the only thing we can offer them; our art and entertainment is pretty fucking good.

Wizards are basically the same as us. They like sport. They enjoy music. They like food, which they can't create magically. Most things that appeal to you and me would also appeal to wizards of our age, if only they had access to it.

You're also forgetting that there are good people in the world, who would willing help muggles if given the chance. Wizards wouldn't have to work for free, but charity still exists nonetheless.

#+begin_quote

Nobody is saying that wizards need to do everything for us. Hell, if all they did was sell us broomstick enchantments then that would let us muggles colonize the solar system. Wizards don't have to do everything for us, they only need to let magic exist alongside technology.

At the very least they could stop suppressing muggle knowledge of magic so that we could work out how to exploit it for ourselves.

 

You act like wizards could build smartphones if they wanted to, or that wizards could create their own global internet infrastructure if only they cared. But they can't. Wizards can't just wave their wand and magic a GTX 1080 into existence.

We muggle /own/ the oil fields the produce the raw materials that eventually become the plastic in a BMW's dashboard. We /own/ the factory that slaughters a thousand chickens a day. We /own/ the fiber optic cables and the satellites overhead. Wizards don't have the knowledge, space or ability to create their own equivalents to our stuff. They might have magic, but we own the vast majority of the world.

Just like how Goblins own Gringotts. Just like how Goblins can build stuff wizards can't. And hell, our stuff is a hell of a lot better than shitty Goblin silver.

To be fair, wizards have a different mentality. They only innovate when they need something. Its not that wizards can't innovate as much as muggles, it is that those innovations are trivial since there is only so much that magic couldn't do.

Space travel is appealing due to our population. We have a massive population compared to wizards so space travel is far more important to us than it would be to wizards. If wizards had the same population as we did, then I am certain that space travel would easily become just as important to them as it is to us.

I think that wizards are just comfortable with everything they have and are generally too lazy to innovate since they lack a motive. When wizards do innovate, often its is in ways which are exclusive to one single person (e.g. Snape's HBP spells, Dumbledore's Deluminator, Voldemort and Snape's unaided flight). When muggles innovate, they share with other muggles without hesitations whereas a wizard who has innovated may keep their creations a secret (e.g. Snape with his spells) or the only user(s) of an innovation die and there isn't a replacement (e.g. Voldemort and Snape's Unaided Flight).

Ultimately, wizards are more self-interested than wizards when it comes to innovations and that attitude holds wizards back in a way it wouldn't for muggles.

Wizards, at the end of the day, are human being just like muggles. You can teach wizards how to build smartphones or make computer programs the muggle way but you can't teach muggles how to use magic. That is why magic cannot be equalled, especially when looking at muggleborn or halfblood wizards.

You seem to believe that wizards are incapable of learning how to create muggle technology or to do muggle things. If given the same education, a wizard could create muggle technology without magic just as well as muggles. You seem to think that wizards, because they are magical, are incapable of building smartphones or an internet infrastructure. The only things stopping them from building those things is a lack of muggle education. For example, if Hermione wanted to learn how to build a smartphone, she would be able to learn that using the same resources as muggles: education and training.

You seem to be equating muggle technology to House-Elf magic or Goblin magic in the sense that you think only muggles can create muggle technology without magic. Except that the only things stopping wizards from creating muggle technology is a lack of education about said technology and the fact that 99.9% of wizards just have no interest in muggle technology.

House-Elf magic and Goblin magic however, cannot be done by wizards because they are not House Elves nor are they Goblins. Even if they comprehended what those types of magic were like, they would be unable to perform it since they are exclusive to House-Elves and Goblins.

Mate, you can't just start "building smartphones or an internet infrastructure." It's not a matter of knowledge or handwork. It's a matter of logistics. Google alone has over /twenty thousand/ people working in research and development; that's more than the entire wizarding population of Britain. Wizards can't compete with that.

And what, you think Malfoy is going to walk up and down the British Isles, laying down his own fiber optic cables? I suppose Pansy Parkinson is going to create the DNS servers, right? And Zabini is going to code the browser, and Goyle is going to code the GUI, all to run on PC's built by Marcus Flint. I mean, all that's stopping them is a lack of muggle education, right? If Crabbe had gone to a muggle highschool then he'd be able to build industry competitive smartphones in his basement.

Come on, we both know that this isn't the case. In the real world, maybe 1 in 1000 people truly know how a microprocessor works. Maybe 1 in 50000 people are actually smart enough to be industry leaders in developing new technologies.

You and I, right now, have access to the internet, which contains everything there is to know about how a smartphone works. Can I make a smartphone? Can you? Of course not, yet all the "education and training" we need is available at our fingertips.

Hermione is smart, but she's not 1 in 50000 smart. Statistically speaking, there might not be /anybody/ in magical Britain smart enough to develop a new smartphone, no matter how educated they are. There just aren't enough wizards. Even if there were a couple here and there, they can't compete with the 20000 researchers and developers at Google, or 16000 engineers at Apple, or the 43000 engineers at Microsoft.

It's not going to happen. Just educating wizards on muggle technology would itself be a monumental task that could take over a decade. Even then, wizards are just normal people. Normal. The overwhelming majority of normal people can't build a smartphone. That's not going to change. Dolores Umbridge might be able to turn a hedgehog into a pin cushion, but that doesn't mean she can out-think and outproduce the crème de la crème of /seven billion/ muggles.

Reading a book on C++ doesn't mean you can suddenly code an operating system that can compete with Windows. Logistics matters more than any individual's education. Wizards don't have enough individuals to keep pace with our muggle geniuses.

 

Also, the way you treat magic as something utterly inaccessible for muggles is wrong. This is what Rowling said about muggle-borns:

#+begin_quote
  J.K. Rowling: Muggleborns will have a witch or wizard somewhere on their family tree, in some cases many, many generations back. The *gene* re-surfaces in some unexpected places.
#+end_quote

We muggles have genetic engineering. Our biotechnology can manually insert DNA into organisms, including into humans. We can do this /today/, with out /current/ technology. We could give the magical gene to the entire next generation. All of our offspring could be wizards, if only we had access to that gene.

In a hundred years the entire world could be magical, if only wizards gave a fuck.

Being uncaring and not helping is, potentially, of dubias moral grounding, but preventing someone from helping that wants to and is capable of doing so is definately immoral.

So the Wizarding world as a whole is immoral by denying their citizens that would like to help others from doing so.

** It can be moral for the magical world to withhold magical solutions.

The world's 'problems' are not inherently bad, nor is resolving them an inherent good except in a tautological view (problems are bad because we call them problems). Rather it is just a means towards an end, which end will be determined by what you choose to classify as a problem. And those ends may be entirely immoral themselves.

To a communist the world's problems boil down to capitalist oppression of proletariat. To a scientist the world's problems are bureaucracy and ignorance preventing the adoption of technocratic solutions. To a racist the world's problems are the presence of other races. To a libertarian the world's problem is government regulation distorting free markets.

It should go without saying that fixing some of these 'problems' would only exacerbate others. If we cannot even agree on a set of problems how can we possibly say that not rushing out to solve these conflicting needs is immoral?

*** This statement doesn't make logical sense. Your claim is that we cannot know what is moral, thus not helping is moral, because you don't know if it will make things better. If you are of the stance that we can't properly define what is moral and what is not, then we cannot declare denying help as moral.

**** The debate topic is "Is it moral for the magical world to withhold magical solutions to the world's problems from the Muggle world?"

If we cannot come up with a common definition of what are 'the world's problems' then it seems impossible to qualify a reaction to them as moral or immoral. It's not morality I am saying we can't know here.

** In Favor.

As stated in the book, if the magical world were to help with magical solutions, everyone would be asking for them, asking how they made it, and a lot of muggles would attempt to replicate it which would result in many disastrous possibilities of harming themselves in the process or forcing others to participate and experiment on others without having the necessary magical qualities required to make them work and would result in many poisoned people and is harmful in general.

Morality here is also on a precocious steep cliff. On the other hand, sharing magical solutions would help save lives and shorten the amount of effort required for most of people's life, but on the other hand their magical solutions could easily be turned into tools to create magical problems back on the magical community themselves as muggles might threaten to drop a bomb on their communities and force them into producing more of their goods against their wheels.

There will be a great cultural upheaval and scientists will have most of their fields turned upside down by the existence of magic and their subjects. There will be experimentations upon unwilling muggleborns should a single one of them show signs of magic, etc. Akin to the witch hunts, only far more brutal and less direct.

Even if there were attempts at anonymously helping the Muggle world's issues, cancer, transportation issues, global warming, poverty, etc, this will simply get rid of the objective issues which are an issue for all but not for the subjective problems of politics. Wizards and witches may attempt to even interfere with muggle politics through use of imperious should they wish to provide a 'magical solution' at the request of any muggles who've seen their magical solutions and demand one for their governments as well.

The things I've described are just the very few as to how not withholding magical solutions would result in a greater crisis for the Muggle and Magical word should magical solutions be provided to alleviate the world's problems for the Muggle world.

As they say, solve a problem, and another will take its place. Not really, I just made that phrase up, but the thing is, /nothing/ will ever be perfect and free of problems. Someone will find an issue within a seemingly perfect world.

To provide the Muggle world, solutions that are out of their own individual reach would simply cause more problems than there are without. If the magical world were to say, no longer share their solutions, die out perhaps, what would the muggles do? They don't have access to magic themselves. They would be too used to the help of magic, that they simply won't know how to solve the same problems that magic have solved without what they've been over depending / relying on. They will have to go back being on their own two feet again, trying to solve things their own way without the help of magic and sharing the magical solutions would have simply damper down their progress regardless of the reprieve its given them.

** Assuming that the Statute of Secrecy is moral, then the most "moral" thing that could be done would have to coincide with it. Off the top of my head, bringing in one or two muggle scientists who try to reverse engineer magical solutions to problems from their field and use that knowledge to form a muggle solution. IE a chemist and a doctor study a theoretical potion that cures diabetes given to them by the magical government, and from their studies make a more muggle cure that is then released to the population. Directly releasing any such cure while ignoring the Statute of Secrecy would have to be immoral.

** AGAINST

It is immoral for the magical world to provide solutions to the Muggle world.

If the magical world were to offer solutions to non-magical problems in the Muggle world, it would increase the imbalance in their relationship to one another. Already the magical world is in a position of power over the Muggle; muggles have no idea that magic exists, but magic is hyperaware of its lack. This allows magical folk to exploit muggles without their knowing. We see this most often in mass obliviates, depriving muggles of their own memories. To offer solutions to muggle problems would be to further skew this relationship toward paternalism, where muggles would be seen as dependent on their magical 'benefactors.' Most magical people have already small regard for the abilities of muggles. Add to this a sense of misguided responsibility, a "magical man's burden" to protect the weaker person from the harsh world, you engender a sense of entitlement. When muggles benefit so much from magical labor, surely it can only be right that magical people benefit from muggle labor. Inevitably, magical people will use their generosity as a justification for their "right" to muggle bodies.

In addition to a loss of autonomy, muggles would suffer from stagnation if world problems were all magically solved. Necessity is the mother of invention. If there are no incurable diseases to center research on, science will discover nothing. If sickness is cured by potions, muggles will stop going to medical school. Even if something as simple as road safety were addressed magically (shield charms on all vehicles), it would stop muggles from inventing safer cars or safer means of travel.

To take away all their problems would be a death sentence on muggle culture. It would make them dependent on magic, which they have no means of learning or producing, instead of their own intellect. They would no longer have the opportunity to grow or to thrive.

** I hope I am not too late with my response.

In favor

Ideally, the magical world and the muggle world should coexist peacefully because there are things to be gained from both sides. As others have stated, magic has the power to cure disease/illness, repair objects, etc. At the same time, the muggle world has powerful electronic technology with great capabilities, weapons of all sorts, etc. (For example, I bet a .50 cal can make some problems disappear). It's foolish to think that only the muggle world has something to gain. It is in fact very much a symbiotic relationship.

However, this can never happen because if the magical world is ever discovered, all magical folk will be in danger. There are two possibilities.

1) Fear/Jealous of magical folk Right now, the world is still not as progressive as what you might think. Take the USA. The presidential candidate who just got elected is a white supremacist/racist, misogynist, scammer/con artist, sexual harasser, narcissist, compulsive liar, among more things. The fact that he has such a huge following is the scariest part and shows that we have a long way to go as a society. If we have so much difficulty accepting those who are like us, how do you think we would react if some people are revealed to have magical capabilities? I believe individuals will lobby for politicians and others in power to imprison magical folk, in the name of national security. They will claim that magical folk has the capability to hurt the rest of us or they may even claim that the magical folk has already hurt some people. This will be an ever growing problem that I do not see resolving. Jealousy could also play a role in complicating matters that could lead to harm being done to magical folk.

2) Love of magical folk You might ask how this is a bad thing. Well, as you know, magic is powerful. I can imagine that in time, individuals in powerful positions will find a way to blackmail and control people who can do magic. They will force these individuals to commit heinous acts or even force them to give up their lives for the sake of scientific research and experiments. I am sure that as soon as the muggle world realizes magic exists, private corporations and governments will develop technology to control and suppress magic. Perhaps special handcuffs that stop a wizard/witch from using magic. You get the point. Magical folk will eventually be enslaved.

Okay, I guess to wrap up, I feel that there are many benefits to both communities if there is a continuous exchange of ideas and help but it should not be done for the sake of the magical world. It is a shame that it has to be like this but I don't think the muggle world is ready yet for this.

** I think in some cases a magical solution would be preferred to a Muggle solution in medicinal cases (curing diabetes, cancer, mending broken bones in a "heartbeat", growing bones back with a potion), but it could be deadly if a magical solution was offered for everything. For example, if a Muggle farmer wanted to harvest his corn he was growing for his family to eat and to sell to the public, a magical solution instead of buying a harvester would be impractical because there is only a finite amount of magical energy that could be used at one time. A wizard would take about 2 weeks to farm corn using magic on a 10 acre farm because the magic in him would be exhausted by lunchtime.
