I don't want triangle, harem story.

I want their relationship starts from 1 year or 2 year


** I would recommend a story called “A little Lunacy” by BellonaBellatrix. The main character is Luna and the love story is between her and Tom Riddle the story starts in her first year as you requested. It's very unique and a bit surreal but also a great character study of Luna and something interesting to read.
