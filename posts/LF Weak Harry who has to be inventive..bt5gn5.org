I'm sick of all the overpowered "I've got a yggdrasil wand and a magical core twice the size of Dumbledore's and Voldemort's in their prime and I'm just gonna breeze through every single confrontation in my entire life", it's so overplayed. Give me some weak as hell Harry, Harry who instead of resorting to power or even skill, has to be fucking tricky, has to cheat and scheme to win, etc. Harry who manages to overcome his problems not because he has a strong hand, but because he's literally got a entire deck of cards under his sleeve and has been trying to hypnotize the other players at the table to fold.


** This is the only one I can think of along those lines:

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

*** Just read through it at your suggestion. It's a heck of a read.

A few of Harry's actions had me going "Oh nOoOo!" in mingled mortification and glee.

** /The many Deaths of Harry Potter/ is a bit like that. He is forced to fight competent adult opponents so he resorts to trickery.

  In a world with a pragmatic, intelligent Voldemort, Harry discovers that he has the power to live, die and repeat until he gets it right.

*** I've seen this recced a lot recently. I was intimidated by the word count, but now that I finally got down to reading it and just blasted through. The first part had me on the edge of my seat just seeing where when and how Harry was going to bite it next. Thanks for the rec!

Also happy cake day! :)

** linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff) is along the lines of Almost a Squib, except rather than being underpowered, he's undermotivated (except for putting hilarious effort into crafting devices to do work for him which inevitably have strange results).

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five
