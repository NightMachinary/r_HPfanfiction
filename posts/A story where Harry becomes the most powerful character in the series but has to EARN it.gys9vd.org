In this case Harry doesn't just become the lost powerful character. He spends years in universe working and practicing. Through his own blood, sweat and tears and constant struggles.

So when he does become badass it's not an ass pull.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

** Try linkffn(a second chance at life) He transfers to another school in the US where he learns blood magic and all kinds of abscure magics. The school is only for the elite and there are vampires, werewolves and many other types of creatures there. Harry is nowhere near the strongest there so he works his way up, eventually being able to surpass your average vampire with ease. Most people there have at least 2 animagus forms that they train for and they get attacked by demons which are vicious, winged creatures that want to overtake the Earth. Its worth reading but it's quite long.

Edit: I think there might be a sequel to it.

*** I really don't like this story. I tried reading, I really did. It has a lot of the things I like in HP Fanfiction. Wandless magic, unique creatures, unique magic, and good world building in general. It's just so slow, and bogged down. It is so different from HP that it should require a bit more info, but it goes way to far, and has way too much. I'd say if you like exploring whole new worlds with a crap ton of world building, this is the story for you. For me though, it's way too much, and barely keeps anything from HP beyond names.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8215565/]])

This is one of the more unique stories I've come across where the difference in the power of wizards really comes into play. Remember how Moody mentions in canon that the entire 4th year class could shout Avada kedavra at him and he wouldn't even get a nosebleed? This fic is probably the only fic that actually remembers that line and uses it properly.

I don't know if it fits your description exactly but it's very interesting, there's a lot of power involved and I don't recall any ass pulls.
