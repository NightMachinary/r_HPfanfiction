Harry is wandering the castle and stumbles across a forgotten room. The room is a maze and doesn't seem to end. After spending untold hours wandering, he comes out to find a dystopian Hogwarts/world waiting for him.

30 years have passed in the time he was wandering the passage and Voldemort has won the war. Harry however is the same age as when he entered. The initial scare that happened when Voldemort won has long since passed and the world has already begun 're-building'. Pureblood Wizards reign supreme and the Death Eaters have become the military police.

Sentient magical races like Werewolves/Veela/Vampires have been hunted down and exterminated. Muggles serve as slaves to the Wizard classes and Wizards are divided up by blood status and given sectors to live in. With Pure-bloods having the best riches and lifestyle, Half-bloods enjoying middle class comforts, and Muggleborns living in poor environments. Not as bad as Muggles, but not pleasant either.

Muggles are kept in slave pins and auctioned off to Section Two and One Wizards. (Section Three Wizards or Muggleborns are not permitted slaves.) As such the Muggle race often experiences rampant diseases, death, and other horrors. To fight inbred traits, Voldemort figured out he could sacrifice one or more Muggles in a mating ritual between Wizard couples which would eliminate any negative effects from birth. Since defects were eliminated, Wizards no longer needed to mate with Muggles and Voldemort decided to outlaw Wizards of different blood status from mating which would further divide the three sectors.

Hogwarts only allows those of Pure and Half-blood. Muggleborns are banned from practicing magic.

Muggle life has halted and technologies that interfere with magic have been destroyed. The world has been completely reverted to the Victorian era.

Even though Voldemort's forces possess powerful tracking spells, a resistance exists and has been in motion since the disappearance of Harry Potter. Only those in the resistance know of the prophecy. A prophecy which is still valid if Harry returns, and they fight with the hope that Harry returns one day to save them.

Harry needs to make his way out of Hogwarts, and find allies. He will find that his name is spoken as a curse among Section 1/2 Wizards and as a prayer among those of sector 3 and lower status. Fortunately for him, 30 years have passed and none of the students recognize him. Unfortunately, Snape is Headmaster and the staff is divided up among Harry's old classmates. Some potentially on his side and some not.

He will overcome many obstacles and find friends where he'd least expect. This is his journey.


** Firstly, You have to give something to Harry. Otherwise it looks like 30 years of gain to Voldemort and co, and nothing on Harry's side. In this world, he is dead even before a single movements happens.

Secondly, is it only Britain based? I highly doubt outside England, anyone is going to align with Voldemort. And Voldemort is not going to leave the entire world to Victorian era. It's way too big for that. The simple reason - the knowledge is there. I highly doubt Voldemort would have the ability to censor science from Europe to Africa, to USA, to Brazil, to India, to Australia. In a large scale of thinking, I doubt wizards can control the entire muggle world because it's too big in quantity. It's not as if anywhere canon says Voldemort was a threat to someone outside England.

I like your idea but I don't think it works in a realistically.

The British minister of magic can casually control the President of the United States schedule, as well as having silently slipped agents into the British government with no detection. Given the existence of mind control in HP, canon all but outright states Wizards are the illuminati and control the muggle world.

*** It would really not be that hard to topple muggle society and technology. All that really needs to be done is prevent overseas trade as most places kinda rely on imports from other nations. While most nations are having food shortages, then he merely needs to take care of power plants then most of our technology would be useless. Sure there would be other ways for muggles to generate energy, but without large scale energy production large parts of the world will be without power.

Doubtful that wizards can control most of the world. But they don't need to. As long as there is no communication between muggles and no place where muggle power can centralise, muggles would play no real threat.

**** I don't really agree. This is coming from someone who hates muggle wanks, and believes wizards in HP world are superior to muggles.

Suppose Voldemort conquered England. As soon as muggle England fails. The whole other world knows wizards exists. And there will be other wizards from other countries who wouldn't support Voldemort. They can and will come against him. (Think how USA, Russia, England, and France cone together against Hitler.) It will be way too chaos for Voldemort and co to remotely be able to do anything. Voldemort has more to lose by attacking muggles. If Voldemort rejects peace treaty with muggles, suppose Russia/USA/China decided to nuke England. Even if wizards can protect themselves against nuke (and I believe they can), England will be too toxic to live anymore. I also think they will have an arrogance that Muggles couldn't do anything against them which is simply wrong.

Secondly, muggles will always be able to communicate each other. The radio technology isn't going anywhere. Wizards are too ignorant to cut muggle power supplies and that type of stuff. Voldemort has way too less man power to do anything. A mere 2-3 thousands of death eaters are walking deads in muggle world if muggles know these guys are death eaters simply because they don't know how muggle world works. Suppose death eater A is in charge of cutting power supply in Singapore, I doubt an arrogant death eater as depicted in canon, would be able to do it. It's entirely possible that they would rather kill themselves accidentally in hilarious ways.

*** In the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/10461539/BolshevikMuppet99][Downward Spiral series]], Voldemort eventually wins the war and eliminates the entire muggle race. I don't know if it's plausible for Voldemort to enslave them all, but it certainly seems more likely than killing every single one of them.

In my fic's world, I would probably go with using ley lines to interrupt muggle technology and enslave the world. They would have to be activated manually (at the same time) via blood sacrifice by a wizard, meaning it would require (insert occult numerical value) of wizards to work and would engulf the entire Earth. This would still leave a large muggle population, and Voldemort would need to use population control to make sure there are only enough muggles to use as slaves.

His long term plan would be to breed wizards to eventually be more common than muggles. He would also breed house elves and when the time was right, eliminate muggles altogether because they wouldn't be needed anymore. I don't think his cruelty is stronger than his pragmatism.

I agree with your point on Harry's power level. His 'power the dark lord knows not' would have to be something that lets him get by in a world that would be hostile to his very existence. I'd have to brainstorm to come up with something that would make his journey a little easier. I'm always wary when considering powers for characters because the line between powerful and OP is often murky.

Something which I think may work is that anytime Harry dies, he is instantly sent back to the passage so he can restart his journey (and keep memories). This idea is from a [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/874260/The_Forgotten_City/][game]] which is coming out soon. I think it would work, and any choice Harry made would be devastating since he'd have to start over again if he made a wrong one.

** This is so unrealistic that to make it work it has to be a dream.

A test or a challenge set by the labyrinth to test Harry's character, he must overcomes despair in the face of a true nightmare from which (it feels like) there is no escape.

It is a remnant of a failed experiment by Godrick Gryffindor to create a room for training and strengthening courage and will.

Time does not pass much outside thebroom but he comes out half an hour later with 30 years of experience in guerilla warfare, distorted values and serious PTSD.

Once this is over Harry gets to read (pretty useless) journal by Gryffindor which only rubs sault over the wound of this whole situation.

Once he is out, he feels spaced out, unbelieving that he is back, that decades of freaking hell on Earth was some sick fantasy conjured up by broken experiment of half-witted Gryffindor.

Bitterness against magic and people who did not have to experience what he had, becomes a prominent feature of his character.

The fic is dealing with how he is an irritable and paranoid asshole to everyone. Luna ship, with her dragging him out of depression kicking and screaming so to speak, lots of fluff after 10 chapters of agonising torture porn.

Here is what I think this prompt should result in :).

** In a scenario like this though I think muggle-borns would have a worse status than muggles because they “stole” magic, if they weren't outright killed off.

*** That's usually how fascism works, yeah. A constant tightening of what it means to be "pure" - at first, the muggles would be enslaved, and "made useful". When that's done, simply being magical isn't enough anymore - now Muggleborns are murdered or "made useful". Once the muggleborns are all gone, Halfbloods are next, with ever-more scrutiny - eventually, even a single drop of muggle blood will be enough for even a pureblood to be exterminated. If the resistance doesn't overthrow the government at this point, humanity is gone for good.

Fascism /always/ eats itself alive. And I have a huge problem with any fic that attempts to portray it as functional in any way.

** Beyond the Curtain has a very similar premise and is one of the greatest fanfics world building wise I've read in the last years. Sadly it seems abandoned, but it's still a great read.
