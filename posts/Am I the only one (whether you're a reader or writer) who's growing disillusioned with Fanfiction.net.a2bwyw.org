As said above, I've been growing disillusioned with [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]]. due to the fact a lot of the writers who publish stories there aren't as good as writers as they think they are. and have been considering moving to AO3 permanently?


** There are things I don't like about FFN, but I find I'm far more likely to find fics I like on FFN than on AO3. Also, the tags on AO3 stories drive me up the fucking wall.

** After the plagiarist scare earlier this year, I have become really disillusioned with FFN. Seriously, it was frustrating to see the guy make so many sick accounts and to see writers being threatened by him. And it's been really frustrating in the months since to see copycats rise up to continue the asshole's work.

That being said, I still use FFN -- some of the best stories out there are on it, and a lot of people haven't cross-posted to AO3 like others have.

*** The cross-posting is the same reason I still use ff.net as well, but it is pretty much now just going back to fics I've already read and not finding new ones.

** Archive isn't really better. Just by filtering out the truly ridiculous shit (Death Eater pairings) already takes away roughly half of the content, there are plenty of fics below 1k/1k per chapter.

If I use a harsh filter, I'm usually left with a 1k base out of 190k, and that's not even talking about quality. Specific searches usually yield between 5 and 20 stories.

*** Which site has writers who truly have a handle on the various characters from various franchises they write about in your opinion?

**** Generally Dark Lord Potter has some great reccomendations and a somewhat lively Work By Author forum that has stories pop up weekly. (I wpuld actually check out thier re-read of the Harry Potter series. If only to recognize some of the fanon as just that, fanon. In particular wards. Everything of importance is actually charms work, but the fanon is so pervasive that's wards have been imprinted into memetic existence to the point where it's in every story and I want to pull my hair out.)

I literally almost dropped a story that was one of the few that didn't have Death Eater Pairings (I'm getting real tired of He's Hot, he's just misunderstood that covers 95% of every page on A03 for Harry Potter) just because they used wards when they should have used charms. It was only in its first paragraph.

Other than that SV and SB have reccomendation threads I keep an eye on. They generally have good standards. Not as high as DLP, but generally plenty acceptable.

***** You know, /we/ have frequent "wait is this fanon?" threads just like DLP, and, hopefully, a less bullying attitude.

On the matter of wards in particular, these days, most people know it's not canonical as such, but argue that like how Arithmancy works it's just one of those things where they think the fanon is /better/ than Rowling's original idea, and they'll keep using it because they prefer it that way. We're mostly past the days where a majority are using them out of ignorance, and you'll be missing out on a lot of great fics if you drop them just because they use "wards".

****** It's a become a recent pet peeve of mine. My tolerance for general fanon acceptence ( Such as Ron's terrible table manners. It happened ONCE. And in that same scene we got him saying 'Mione. ONCE. And it was because his mouth was full. Not deliberatley as a nickname) tend to wax and wane depending on the quality of the writing. If everything else is good, and it makes sense in context and isn't just thrown in there I can accept it and roll with it and let the author do his or her thing.

As for DLP. Yeah they can be asshats. I never said interact with them, but to go browse thier reccomendation/library thread, because they DO reccomend quality works, regardless of the individual(s) in question. It's why I lurk there and don't post.

** I've not spent much time looking at AO3, but when I have, it was hard to find anything interesting. I'm generally on ffn.

** I generally struggle when I want to find a story I might enjoy. Those I did enjoy were on ffn, and I'm not talking about Harry Potter fanfic specifically. And still, I have to keep reminding myself that it's only fanfic, that it's not the end of the world if Dumbledore is described as wearing horn-rimed spectacles, or if Hermione's father says fall instead of autum, or if I can't make sense of someone's actions and think that character is a Mary Sue.

** I'm rather disillusioned with fanfiction generally but that's only because I don't really fit. I recently deleted my Ao3 account altogether (orphaned one fic, deleted the others) because I got so few readers it wasn't worth the trouble of having an account to keep an eye on. I don't think the quality is particularly better on Ao3, it's just that there are more fics on ffn to trawl through.

** I think they both have cringe-worthy fics in addition to their good stuff. Just maybe different kinds? Like FFN has the emo throwbacks and AO3 has the tumblr virtue-signaling.

** I read a lot of stuff on Wattpad when it comes to Harry Potter fanfictions. Harry Potter is kind of dying on AO3 and with Fanfiction.net enforcing their no MA content rule they don't have the things I'm looking for.
