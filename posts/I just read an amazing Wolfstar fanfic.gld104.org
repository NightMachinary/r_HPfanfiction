‘All Kidding Aside' by ms. commas and ampersands

“When Lily jumps to conclusions about Remus and Sirius, the duo decide to get revenge on her, James and Peter with a wonderful joke. However, they wind up getting more than just a good laugh.”

I love Lily's obsession with Wolfstar in this, the boys' plotting is hilarious and DramaQueen!Sirius is spot on.

The rift between the Marauders is believable (if only because of how dramatic both Pads and Prongs are), it's well-written and it's adorable how protective Moony is over Padfoot.

I could go on about it for ages but it would spoil the actual fic so read it yourself!
