Having just re-read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again]]... again... I'm curious which fics people find enjoyable to read over even knowing whats coming.

*** You're right, there's so much about that fic that I love. I can still remember starting it, and being so incredibly hooked by this new and crazy Harry.

Also, I tend to add this on quite a bit, but it's always worth mentioning. Joe is a published author, and his writing in [[http://joeducie.net/the-reminiscent-exile/distant-star/][The Reminiscent Exile]] actually feels very much like a spiritual successor to Wastelands/Heartlands. Not the same characters, but there's so much similar stuff that a Wastelands fan will instantly recognize.

More than plot, more than characters, more than anything else, I want to read somewhere where I feel like I"m in the hands of a good writer, a good storyteller. Those two have that feeling, in spades.

I've also read Oh No Not Again multiple times. It's like comfort food.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][Lie I've Lived]] by jbern In my opinion the best written H/F fic out there. It is the perfect mix of humor and romance that i can't get enough of. I have most likely re-read it three or four times

*** Best H/F? It may be, but that doesn't mean it's any good. The best that can be said for the H/F in /The Lie I've Lived/ is that it manages to avoid Veela nonsense. Fleur is still incredibly objectified, to the point that Harry first properly encounters her by massively breaching her right to privacy.

But, when Fleur later finds out about this, of course she can't be allowed the agency to be disgusted by the betrayal of trust. No, she's Harry's Love Interest and therefore nothing Harry does can be bad. Her entire purpose of existing is to make Harry more awesome, so of course she can't react to Harry's behaviour realistically.

*** I think The Lie I Lived suffers from a certain lack of technical mastery. No doubt it's a great story - jbern has excellent characterizaton and plot structure, while making the story engaging and the interactions realistic. It just has this shaggy edge to the writing that's especially odd considering the quality of the story.

**** I would also add that it just really doesn't pass the smell test. Don't get me wrong, I /really/ enjoy that story. Even with the technical aspects (though I would say, go and read some of Jbern's earlier stuff, and you'll see /massive/ improvement). All that said, Harry is a Mary Sue. I never once worried during that story that Harry would ever die or lose in /anything/. He was always cool, always suave, always the biggest guy in the room. His magical ability was consistently better than all of his peers. He had one major character flaw (arrogance), which barely had the chance to show its face.

It's one of those stories that you read because even though you know what's going to happen, the journey is consistently enjoyable, if not epic or even really titillating.

Not bashing on it, but c'mon. That story was pure wish fulfillment. I happen to like it, that doesn't change what it is.

***** It's probably worth pointing out that he was an adult in a school full of children. I'd imagine that the 'challenge' wouldn't have kicked in until Act II... which sadly currently suffers a critical existence failure. He was arrogant because it was all just goofing off to him.

Pit him against grown ups again and that arrogance would likely come back to bite him but we never got that far in the timeline.

****** That's kind of my point. Sure, he was an adult in a kids body. That said, we almost only ever saw him be the top dog, with very few exceptions. He was a badass, and he didn't really do anything to earn it.

Sure it makes sense, but that doesn't change the fact that the character is a mary sue. There are hundreds of thousands of fics where Harry gets super powers from one facet or another, and they all make sense with context.

Once again, I'm really not hating on the fic. I personally enjoy it, and can turn off my critical mind to read it. That said, I look at it like a popcorn action movie. Yeah, it's very light hearted and you know the main characters are gonna make it out okay, but I still like watching it.

It's written like all the contributing authors were sitting around a big-ass table in an executive conference suite getting trashed on cheap beer and laughing their asses off at the HP universe, and reading it absolutely feels like you're right there with them. The fact that it is very self aware makes it a timeless classic, and I've found rereading it enjoyable every time I've done so (probably between 7 and 10 times).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/When-A-Lioness-Fights][When a Lioness Fights.]] Gritty, dark, captivating; Hermione becomes a Death Eater spy. One of my top three.

I'll have to check out your SS/HG stories! Pet Project was the first of the pairing that I read and it really sold me on them. I haven't read When a Lioness Fights because I just couldn't get over the fact that Hr becomes a DE spy!

**** I've found that the later books are harder to read because they get really, really dark. There are super graphic descriptions of torture and rape, and major character deaths - I'm talking, ones you thought they wouldn't have DARED kill off, and some you never saw coming, but nonetheless the books remain superbly written until the last.

WALF is definitely an OOC story for Hermione, but it's a good read! Definitely dark as well, but well written - though sometimes h's character gets a but too dramatic, or overwritten imo. Still good.
