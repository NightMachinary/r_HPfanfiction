Can be as canon or as AU as possible. Would prefer it if they were out of Hogwarts, but it's fine if they're in Hogwarts.

Can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived, by Diane Castle]]: A non-magical AU in which "Harworts" is a school for superspies and skill and occasional superscience replace magic.

** The classics:

- Stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] ... start with “Tales of the Battle” and go on (you can return to the earlier ones later, but he is by far the best in post-war stories).

- Stories by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger]] (Summer goes before Winter).

- “Inner Demons by serendipity_50” linkao3(601124)

- I used to like “The Missing Moments by Ash-and-Vine” linkffn(12377803) very much, now I am not so sure, but I still think some (especially later ones) are very good.

#+begin_quote
  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)
