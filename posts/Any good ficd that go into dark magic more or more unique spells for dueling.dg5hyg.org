** Some fics that I remember that vaguely have what you're asking for are linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) and linkffn(The Merging). Be aware that The Merging is as of yet incomplete. It isn't completely fighting or anything like that, but it has some cool fight scenes, plus dark magic such as Harry using the cruciatus and killing curses near the “end.”

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?
