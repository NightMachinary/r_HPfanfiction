** I would love to find a decent Dark!H/Hr fic myself, but the best ones I've found are one-shots rather than full length stories. I'll post them if you're interested.

**** Thanks for the support! If you haven't already, check out my other story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8885902/1/Remedial-Lessons][Remedial Lessons]]. It focuses more on a Dark!Hermione than Harry, but it's close enough to what you asked for and I'm not above a shameless self-plug now and then ;)

Now, to answer your original question:

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes][Faery Heroes]]: Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny.
#+end_quote

I can never recommend this story enough. It's funny, it's original, it's a little twisted, and it's entirely entertaining throughout the whole thing. It was just finished this week, and I already plan to go back and read through it from start to finish when I get a chance. So good.

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9028035/1/Dirty-Little-Witch][Dirty Little Witch]]: It's the summer after 5th year and Harry is not a happy camper. With his godfather dead, Harry has nobody left to turn to. Except one. One who has been with him since the beginning...
#+end_quote

WARNING: This story contains some smut (fairly mild, but it is there) so if that's not your cup of tea then you might want to skip this one. If it doesn't bother you, then read on, because this story is very good.

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8837257/1/Wizards-Fall][Wizards' Fall]]: A different spin on the Potter Verse featuring a manipulative Dumbledore and an evil worse than Voldemort. A look at what could drive three people to destroy the Wizarding World.
#+end_quote

This one isn't your standard Dark!Harry fic in that his actions are pretty much morally defensible. That said, it is an /excellent/ read, especially since you mentioned earlier that you liked psychological fics. The meat of the story happens in the first chapter, with the rest filling in many of the background events leading up to the main story. At least read the first chapter, because that's where most of the fun happens.

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8413116/1/Never-Leave-The-Complete-Edition][Never Leave]]: After Ron's second and final betrayal, Harry begins to see Hermione in a whole new light. He reacts in a way neither of them expected him to. Light and/or Dark!Super!Harmony. Rated for sexual situations and non-graphic violence.
#+end_quote

This features a badass Harry and Hermione, but it's also another one where their actions may be morally defensible. That being said, they basically declare war on the British wizarding world, so at least the Ministry of Magic would call them dark.

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7662761/1/Charade][Charade]]: He wasn't the misunderstood victim everyone thought him to be or the chosen savior decked in the purity of the light. He was the exact opposite, and he had fooled them all. Dark! Evil! Harry. Slight Dumbledore and Weasely Bashing. Harry/Hermione! One-shot.
#+end_quote

Not much else needs said about this one, except that it's good.

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4780695/1/A-Collection-of-Harmonious-OneShots][A Collection of Harmonious One-Shots]]: Chapters 1, 3,4, and 15 all deal with a dark H/Hr (well 4 is actually a Dark!Dumbledore/Fawkes, but it's still really badass.) The other chapters are good for a read too, if you don't mind allusions to smutty situations.

  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4478398/1/Riddick][Riddick]]: He was ostricized by the very people he was destined to protect and sent to Azkaban. However, they never imaginged that sending Harry Potter away would create something much darker, and a helluva lot more badass. H/Hr
#+end_quote

Okay, this one is just plain fun. Yes, it is a quasi-crossover with the Chronicles of Riddick, but really, that right there should be enough to make you click on it.

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10300874/1/Weary-Wizard][Weary Wizard]]: When a few inappropriate questions derail the meeting at the Hog's Head, Harry lets the situation play out. Eventually, he refuses to commit his free time to teach a bunch of easily distracted fools. - Set during fifth year; Harry/Hermione
#+end_quote

I almost didn't include this one because it would be a stretch to call it even grey, let alone dark, but it's still a well written story and one of the more satisfying stories I've read.

I'm also going to include an author recommendation in the form of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2758513/Romantic-Silence][Romantic Silence]], whose stories are all very well written, are usually Dark!H/Hr, and commonly feature a strong characterization of Hermione. A few of them are pretty tragic and angsty though, so watch the story tags if that's not your thing.

** I am monitoring with great interest.

The only grimdark fic i know which is worth the read is Forever Knight and it was on portkey - dont know if its still alive.

For the endless amount of H/Hr fics, finding a Dark hermione fic or dark harry and hermione fic, is pretty much digging in mud for diamonds.

if anyone has a list - please post. Even if its 1-2 stories

*** Amen to that. I wouldn't mind any other dark Harry fics either. I just love the dark side haha. I read Curse of Fate, the Riddle Answered, Harry Potter and the Descent into darkness. They were all true dark Harry fics. If you haven't read them, they are recommended. If you have do you know any like them?

*** Sounds like a very psychological fic. I appreciate those a lot. Mind magic has always been a cool concept for me as well. As an AP Psychology student, I like these kind of fics. Does it focus on him becoming crazy and unstable?

** Not sure if this counts: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains]]

When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.
