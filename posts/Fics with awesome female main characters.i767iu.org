After reading The Changeling and The Pureblood Pretense, I want to read more fics with strong female main characters. No pairing preference, but I would prefer if romance isn't a major plot point. Complete fics are better, but not necessary!


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17661095][Flutter]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/bking4/pseuds/bking4][bking4]]) is one that focuses on Ginny and the other main characters are Luna, Hermione, and a female slytherin first year. It's also complete!

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3836023][Dances, Dulcimers and Marginalia Dragons]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Gehayi/pseuds/Gehayi][Gehayi]]) is a fun historical oneshot on Helga Hufflepuff/Rowena Ravenclaw.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12901407][Ottery St Catchpole]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Erisah_Mae/pseuds/Erisah_Mae][Erisah_Mae]]) is about an OC, but it's very enjoyable! Not complete though.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3459731][The Two Body Problem]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Tozette/pseuds/Tozette][Tozette]]) has a Hermione who's a little bit dark and really amazing. Complete.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6997183][the train station]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/dirgewithoutmusic/pseuds/dirgewithoutmusic][dirgewithoutmusic]]) is a oneshot on Ginny's "train station" when she's dying on the chamber floor.

  The traces of Dark magic aren't swept away with a summer and a trip abroad. It leaves marks on its victims, deep gouges in their soul, and just being in its presence can irrevocably change a person. You can never really overcome Dark magic, only survive it and hope for the best. This is Ginny Weasley, doing her best.

  Tumblr Prompt from accio shitpost: "i wanna see a muggle who goes stealth among wizards purely by having a ridiculous aesthetic" A muggle moves to Ottery St Catchpole a few months after the Battle of Hogwarts, and there's a slight misunderstanding.

  Ginny made a thin, distressed sound. “I ... Look, I promised Tom I wouldn't let him be handed in,” she said in a small voice.“Well, if he's going to go around petrifying people, I don't see much reason why people ought to keep their promises to him,” said Hermione crossly. [Hermione gets the diary. Things go differently from there. AU.]

  angelsarenamederika asked: "Have you ever written any works about that clean, empty train station Harry ended up in? Or rather, what that place may have looked like for other people?" At eleven years old, Ginny Weasley almost died on the cold Chamber floor.

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.
