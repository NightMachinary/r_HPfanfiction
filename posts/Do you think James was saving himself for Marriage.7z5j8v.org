** I don't know but you just reminded me of this weird-ass fic I read years ago where female students who got knocked up would be put in a time bubble until they gave birth, then have their baby put up for adoption and their memory erased. That's where all muggleborns come from apparently and Lily was Molly/Arthur's from when they were like 14. Ewwwww I wish I hadn't remembered this

** IMHO magical britain is probably relatively progressive in regards to sexuality: Women appear to be fairly equal to men and considering their advanced medicine I'd expect contraception and STD's as something that no-one has to worry about. Widespread, cheap and reliable contraception were one of the main reasons for the societal changes in the Muggle world in that regard.

Also the separation from the Muggles was already in place when Victorian values took grasp in Britain.

So I doubt anyone "saves themselves for marriage" (because it implies that something worthwhile and important is lost during sex). James may have still been a virgin, but not for that reason.
