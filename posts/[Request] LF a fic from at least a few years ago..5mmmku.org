Basic premise was that Harry was killed by Voldemort, and sent to another dimension or reality. This reality was, iirc, encased in a mist or fog. There was a light and dark, and killing the other group would increase one's own power. Near the end, Harry and the person he was traveling with, realized the way out was either suicide or deliberately killing someone from your own group. I can't remember which was the proper ending.

Any help finding this fic would be appreciated. If I remember anything else I'll add it.

  Harry's trapped in the cemetary, Voldemort laughing at him with his Death Eater. Thankfully, he learned a spell enabling him to escape this trap. He should have known things would go wrong if he tried to take things in his own hands...
