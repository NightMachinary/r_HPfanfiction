  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) is a bit different than the others.

It's canon divergence after 4th year, so she's a Gryffindor and her Muggleborn Resistance effectively replaces the DA, with the difference that it's muggleborns that want to overthrow the pureblood-dominated government.

She's the effective leader, although she struggles to maintain control of her group later on when a boy two years above her has different opinions on acceptable targets.

After Umbridge effectively makes it impossible for muggleborns to stay at Hogwarts for their NEWT years, Hermione has to leave after 5th year and the group starts the war by bombing the summer ball at Malfoy Manor the summer before 6th year. Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy as well as the parents of almost all Slytherins in Draco's year and many more unnamed Death Eater sympathizers dead in an instant.

Well, Dumbledore wanted a war against Voldemort, just not with the Ministry on Voldemort's side.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  "The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep on wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen." Hermione looked at him then, and smiled. "And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore." (Dark)

  "Daphne, do me a favor and go befriend that poor girl," Circe nodded to where the scared, bushy-haired girl sat with her eyes fixed on her plate. "We'll teach her the beauty of the ambitious." A take on the 'Hermione in Slytherin' trope.

  Hermione and Draco team up after the war to overthrow the Order and take over wizarding Britain. "I don't even especially mind belonging to you most of the time," he closes his eyes and just breathes for a bit, savoring not being in pain. Finally he adds, "Just... try to take better care of your toys." Dark Dramione. COMPLETE

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10654712/1/Lady-of-the-Lake][Lady of the Lake]] (wow, i seem to be recommending this one a lot lately.) post-canon, Hermione stages a political coup surrounded by the children of Death Eaters. Dramione, hints of ritual magic, quite a bit of Weasley bashing but it's well-written and OOC. kinda dark later on and might be potentially triggering to some.
