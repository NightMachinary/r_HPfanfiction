The Dursleys go on winter vacation and leave Harry behind. Dudley turns the heat off on the way out (or Vernon could do it? Your choice). Harry's heartrate slows enough to where the horcrux thinks he's dead and exorcises itself, which sets off a lot of Ministry sensors. They show up, omgwtfbbw.jpg! Is that Harry flipping Potter!!!1one? The abuse is discovered (even if there being no heat wasn't Vernon's fault, he was raised in a cupboard, underfed, worked like a slave, etc. That is still abuse). Investigations lead to unsealing the Potter will.

Who was Harry supposed to go to? What does the will say?

Examples:

- Sirius, because /Sworn/ (can't hurt their god daughter/son) Godfather. This leads to investigation.
- Andromeda Tonks: /possible/ Tonks Pairing.
- Madam Bones (Or Susan's Parents): Possible Susan pairing.
- Lovegoods: Possible Luna pairing. Save Pandora?
- NO WEASLEYS! Seriously, their economic situation and brood of kids would instantly disqualify them from any consideration. This isn't bashing, this is facts of life. Dumbledore is already in a lot of hot water, so he can't wave his hand and go "I have complete faith in them" to make it so.

Since Harry's original wand chose the Scarcrux (in this AU) and the Scarcrux is gone, he gets a new wand. What kind of wand does he get?

Hogwarts House: Whoever he lives with determines his Hogwarts house. Sirius? Gryffindor (BORING!), Lovegoods? RAVENCLAW!, Bones? Hufflepuff. Tonks? Slytherin or Hufflepuff.

Who are his friends?

​

Clarification: the will can't say who the secret keeper is, have eighteen thousand lordships, or a bajamillion galleons. The Potters can be old money, but not "buy the world" levels of money.


** So, just for clarity, you're asking for:

1. Harry, before he learns about magic and goes to Hogwarts, almost dies and the horcrux leaves him.
2. This sets off some kind of alert spell, presumably linked to his mother's blood protection.
3. The MoM comes to investigate.
4. Harry is taken away from the Dursleys and placed with a magical family. Realistically, not a poor family or the family of a suspected Death Eater. (Unless handwavy Godfather magic proves that Sirius isn't a Death Eater.)
5. Harry, when he goes to Ollivanders, doesn't get the brother wand to Voldemort's.
6. If there is a girl in the magical family, Harry should end up in the same school house as them and be shipped with them.

**** Logically speaking, they 100% should have had a will. They were in hiding since before Harry was born (about a year and a half total) and KNEW that Voldemort was after them. There's no way they wouldn't have written one under those circumstances.

Canonically speaking, we have to assume there was no will because it was never mentioned - even as a possibility. This is more a reflection on JKR missing it than anything - or just choosing not to include it as it would change the direction of the story she wanted to tell.

Which is why we now have 300 million “the will is found/unsealed” fics, because it seems obvious that there SHOULD be a will.

I don't think I've ever seen one that does your prompt though, cool idea. As for pairings, I would say that the most likely would be if he was adopted by Bones he'd end up with Tonks, and vice versa. I don't think Tonks would see him as anything but a little brother if Andy and Ted adopted him, and while Susan might not have the same problem she'd probably have some reservations about dating someone raised like a brother to her. Though it also depends how young they are when the adoption happens.

Why and how would he? In PoA Fudge tells us James told Dumbledore Sirius was his Secret Keeper. So he had no reason to suspect Sirius wasn't a Death Eater. In PoA he had no proof Sirius was innocent save for the word of two children Snape said had been confunded.

Second, no matter what you do not dump a child at a abusive home. He could have gone to anyone but the Dursleys! And don't give me the blood wards bullshit, it never was mentioned much and no one has specific information but the renewal of it when Harry spends the Summer there. Supposedly if it's such, then it wouldn't have been enough to last a year. (I'm grabbing this off another book) Percy Jackson lived with Gabe(which is an abusive drunkard) for years and only left when he had boarding school in which he goes back home for every break(Winter and summer). We see it work perfectly for the almost the whole school year then directly before Summer break a monster manage to find him because his demigod scent wasn't covered by Gabe's stink enough and later a minotaur too, which almost kills him. So if Dumbledore was actually serious about the wards he would've either warded the castle better or sent him home for every single break he gets.

Third, even Dumbledore said so himself, you have to do what's right not what's easy. Does that answer to your reasons to what happened in OoTP and what should have happened in the first war and after?

** Well, I don't think the Potter ever had a will for Dumbledore to seal, and I personally don't think they should have one for 2 reasons :

- From a "realistic" point of view, they joined a civil war (where even a simple thing like a will could be used to paint a target on someone back) right out of school, and once Lily became pregnant, they went into hiding because of the prophecy. They didn't really have the possibility to go to Gringott to create a will (and may not even have thought about it). Also, it's not like they needed it. Will or not, in most country (and we will assume it includes Magical Britain), everything they had would have gone to Harry. And in the case of Harry death, it's not like they would have cared much about who gets what (and Canon Potter are just upper middle class, or low wealthy, they don't have mountains of gold enough to fund a war by themselves).
- From a story point of view, the unselling of the will is one of the most boring idea I have seen in HP fanfics. Most of the time, it's just used as a plot device to make bash Dumbledore and kill the scenario ("/nobody, not even Dumbledore knew that we switched the Secret Keeper, but we wrote everything about on a piece of paper that is ever into the definitively monitored and unsafe Ministry, or with a bunch of Goblin that hate all wizards the same and may give it to the bad guy with enough incentives"/).

Also concerning the abuses of Harry, the Dursley were bad, and the cupboard under the stair is a can of worm that may see them condemned in a court. But outside of it, nothing in canon say that Harry was underfed (I'm pretty sure a scene in PS even clearly say that the Dursley never starved him, and that his biggest problem was Dudley devouring his favourite meal every time). As for "worked as a House Elve", we only see Harry do chores 2 times in canon. The first time is in PS during Dudley birthday, where he is watching the bacon (not cooking, watching the bacon, most of the breakfast was still done by Petunia). The 2nd is in CoS where Petunia gives him a list of chores to do, /as a punishment/ after he made Dudley think he was going to use magic. Canon Dursley are bad ,but not /that/ bad, the abuses we see in some fics would be in complete contradiction with being "completely normal".

​

But, assuming we follow your prompt, Harry's guardianship would cause a lot of problems. In a normal case, at the 31st of October 1981, the 2 main candidates would be the Sirius (as the Godfather), and the Dursley's (as the next of kin). Both candidates would probably already have been disputed at that time in not for Dumbledore tactic of "I did it, too late to change now" (Sirius because he was, at the end of the war, a young adult just out of school with no house under his name of a job, easy to declare as an unfit guardian, and the Dursley because they are muggle and unfit to raise the Boy Who Lived, though a bullshit excuse would have been invented in this case).

By the time of your prompt, with both of them out of the running, Harry would have ended up as someone with no clear guardian to take care of him, but pretty much every witch or wizard alive would have voluntered to raise him (for a multitude of reasons). Honestly, none of the names you gave would have been strong candidate (not clear relation with Harry to rise, and no political/ economic power).\\
Assuming Dumbledore would have been out because of his responsability with Harry placement with the Dursley, the best candidates would have been :

- Any really rich Pureblood family who would have been able to bribe the people responsible to choose his guardians (though I can't help but think that being closely related to a condamned Death Eater, or a known victim of the Imperius curse may be a deal breaker). So any family like the Malfoys, the Notts (Theodore Nott is supposed to be an equal of Draco unlike Crabbe and Goyle,so probably equivalent level of life) or any "rich" family you want to invent (like fanon Greengrasses . . .).
- A political figure, like a high level member of the Ministry who would use his fame. Crouch Sr would have been interested (though probably out of the runing between his Death Eater son and his recently dead wife), but Fudge would have loved to get Harry, not to mention any Ministry member you could once again invent. I guess Bones may be a potential choice in this case (even if nothing in canon says that she raised her niece).

*** First, there was physical abuse. It was mentioned offhand that Petunia took a swing at him with a soapy frying pan. That is such a wild escalation that it makes it look like a casual response on her end. Second, the "Harry Hunting". They knew, that makes them just as responsible and probably egged it on.

Third, didn't Dumbledore mention "not as well fed" in his 5th year reveal spiel?

Fourth, they used twice as much niceness on Dudley than they did abuse on Harry. That is abuse of its own sort. That's two kids they are abusing now.

--------------

They weren't in hiding ever since Harry was born. Quick visit to Gringotts or the Ministry after he was born isn't that much to ask of someone.

Painting a target? How? They most likely made the will before they knew they were being targeted.

I'm not a fan of putting the secret keeper in the will either. Simple, standard will. "All goes to harry, Lily manages it if she is still alive. If we both don't make it, here's who we arranged for Harry to go to..."

That's my main problem with the situation. I don't know for the rest of the world, but in Europe, if all your will is going to say is "Everything goes to my spouse, or child if we both die", you don't need to do one, it's what would already happen. A will could be usefull for a case like Sirius' one, where his beneficiary is not the next of kin, but for the Potter's? Canon didn't have a will, and yet Harry still got everything.\\
As for the arranged guardian, well Sirius? I mean, I didn't live during a civil war, but I'm pretty sure people who did didn't have a 50 names list of potential guardians in importance order. And even if they did, I doubt it would have any legal power. Godparents are the potential guardians in case of parent's death, and if they are non available, I guess a judge would have to decide where the child goes. If the Potter wanted another potential guardians, they should have chosen a godmother.

I don't know about England, but in my country Godparents aren't the first candidate to take an orphaned child unless they are specifically assigned that roll in the parents' will. They ask your next of kin to take your children first and only after they run out of Grandparents, Aunts, Uncles, and Cousins do they start looking for other options, like foster homes. A Godparent's only job is to instruct their Godchild in their faith.

​

But, for sake of the prompt, let's say that Lily and James wrote in their will that they want Harry to go to a Godparent if no relatives are available. It still leaves the question of how many Godparents he actually has. We know for sure that he has one, Sirius, and if he has one then he's been christened. What faith has he been christened in? He was born in southern England, so logically either the Catholic Church or the Church of England. If he is Catholic, one Godparent is the minimum requirement but two is traditional. If Harry is Anglican, then the minimum number of Godparents that he has is three.

​

So, you can see, there is some wiggle room here where we can introduce almost anyone as one of Harry's Godparents.

** AN: Here's part 1. Don't know if I'll finish it or not, so if anyone else wants to continue it, that's fine.

It was late at night and the neighborhood was dark. Everyone was sleeping, even the little boy in the snowy back garden, propped against the door. Hours ago he had desperately leaned against it, begging to be let back in. Now he lay curled in on himself.

First had come the shivering. Then his fingers and toes went numb. Then he couldn't feel his nose, couldn't breathe through it. The cold air was painful, like swallowing knives with every lungful. After that, his skin began to prickle and tingle. He was so cold! He had been tired for hours, but it was only after the tingling that he began to feel sleepy. He slipped down to the pavement. The flat surface was so comfortable. His eyelids fluttered. There was a headache. Someone had a headache: was it his? Whose was it? Should he try to return it to its proper owner? But he was sleepy, and that seemed insurmountable. He blinked and, because there was black smoke obscuring his vision, he blinked again. The second time he failed to open his eyes. Lying there on the pavement, safe under the blanket of his heavy eyelids, he finally felt warm.

Deep in the heart of the Ministry of Magic, five hundred and thirty nine brass whirligigs sat on a long table, each affixed with a nameplate. With a snick, one stopped moving. The man at the on-duty desk stared blankly at it. His face morphed from shocked incomprehension to devastated horror. In a flurry of movement, he jabbed his wand repeatedly into the air. A department wide alarm went off. A file flew from a cabinet to land before him. A map pulled itself down from a shelf. A set of glowing numbers spat out of the whirligig when a spell hit it. Hastily, he wrote them down. With a series of rapid pops, he was joined by his boss, a healer, and a baker's dozen aurors.

“The endangered orphan lives at Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. His current latitude and longitude show him to be at home. Here, on the map.”

“It's a muggle area,” his boss said. Who's been nearest?”

“I've been to Dorking,” an Auror offered. When no one else spoke, she dropped the silvery memory into a shallow stone dish, placed on the desk for that express purpose. Everyone had a brief look.

“Everyone has their brooms?” His boss asked.

“Wait. There's one other thing you should know. The boy's name. It's Harry Potter.”

A brief stillness crept over the room as every witch and wizard paused.

“Let's go.”
