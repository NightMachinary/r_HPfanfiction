Is there a fic like 0800-Rent-A-Hero where harry is summoned to another dimension to kill another voldy but refuses just out of of spite for having all his friends gold power possessions taken away from him a kind of 'cut his nose to spite his face'.


** While I can't honestly see a Harry joining Voldemort it would be fun to for once see a Harry that was summoned and out of pure spite chooses Dark Lordship either seriously (even if he is a puppy dark lord), as revenge or as a prank.
