On my right, we have our champion from Azkaban, one of the darkest magical creatures in existence, the unstoppable soul-sucker, who has won every match in a matter of minutes: The Dementor!

On my left we have our new contender from the house of Boston Dynamics. Equipped with custom infrared vision, anti-freeze heating elements, a brand-new fighting software and sporting irresistible dance moves: Atlas the Android!

Let the battle begin!


** Initially I was thinking of Atlas as in the guy who is holding the sky on his shoulders (especially as Percy Jackson is so loved around here). He would have quite a hard time fighting Dementors off without dropping the sky on the earth.

** Stalemate, neither can really harm the other.

I suppose there's a chance a dementor could physically harm him, they're solid and invulnerable so could be quite strong.

** Honestly, my money's on Atlas. Robots can't feel negative emotions or have their souls sucked out, it can't be frozen because of the antifreeze heating elements, and as Dementors can't phase through solid objects it can just dig a hole and trap the Dementor.
