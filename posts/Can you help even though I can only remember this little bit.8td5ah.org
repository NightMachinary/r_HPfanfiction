I can barely remember this anything about this fictional I read, but it had Lucius Malfoy having two sons, the younger being Draco. Lucius was convinced that Harry was going to be the next Dark Lord (since he defeated Voldemort) and started to train Draco to be a Gryffindor so he could have influence over Harry if he ended up in Gryffindor instead of Slytherin. Does anyone know it? I'd love to read it again, since I can't remember it.


** I'm pretty sure I just read this one! I think you might be looking for Innocent by MarauderLover7. It involves Sirius escaping Azkaban earlier than in canon and raising Harry after taking him from the Dursleys and has Draco being groomed to become a Gryffindor while his brother (Hydrus, I think?) is still being raised to be a Slytherin.

*** And yet, years 1 and 2 are total canon rehashes, despite so many changes.

Very very disappointed.

***** I hadn't considered that they were canon rehashes because the question is mostly "what would happen if sirius was inserted at age 8?" and so Year 1 would have still had the stone, year 2 Malfoy would still have tried to get rid of the diary. But there's major divergence with a bunch of stuff that would be spoilers. In my mind, the first 2 books are slowly slowly turning from Canon. A butterfly flaps its wings and it causes a hurricane... But it doesn't happen overnight.

I guess it does have the stations of year 1 and 2, but there's so much before year 1 and non harry storyline that I guess I didn't notice. But like, year 3 doesn't have the prisoner of Azkaban because sirius is already out. Shit is a lot more intense going into year 4 than canon. If moody gets polyjuiced and the graveyard scene happens and Cedric dies, you can all have I told you so rights.

***** No, Year 3 still dealt with Wormtail and dementors, so freaking unimaginative and a total slave to canon stations.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
