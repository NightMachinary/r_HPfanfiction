:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a book a while back about Harry living on the street and he ends up first stealing severus snape's potions bag. Then he also ends up stealing professor Mcgonagall while she is in her animagus form. I can't remember the title. It's also a slytherin HP fic. Plead help.

  What would happen if the Dursleys abandoned Harry Potter before he could attend school? What kind of problems would a street wise, self-reliant, and Slytherin Harry could create?
