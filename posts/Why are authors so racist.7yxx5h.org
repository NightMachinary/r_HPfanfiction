Well, I can see where those calling it "racist" might be coming from. In a fanon-HP context, the "upper-class" is assumed to be the Malfoy-style purebloods, and few would argue against pureblood-supremacy being racism.

*** If you equate being uperclass with pureblood or at least see being upper class as having a strong - or even automatic - link to being pureblood (which seems to be what Klopp -and admittedly quite a few authors- is doing)?

Aeeing as pureblood doctrine (and it seems like one genuinely had to try to stay several generations pure, if Harry's class at Hogwarts is at keast somewhat representative....) is the magical version of racism?

Yes, there is imo what one might call... "condoning" (?) magical racism in certain fics. (especially in dark!harry, pureblood Harry, good Malfoys, Dumbledore bashing fics. Which might be what Klopp is reading...)

** Draco lovers are overwhelmingly women.

Many guys like to see Harry paired with Bellatrix or Narcissa. I admit I tremendously enjoy "Delenda Est".

People often give attractive members of the opposite sex a pass. Draco, who often gets confused with his attractive actor Tom Felton, is also rich.

--------------

Some people equate Purebloods with aristocracy and think they are somewhat sophisticated. One of my top favorite fics is [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], which plays out in a non-magical AU. Its author flat out wrote 'Purebloods' as European aristocrats:

Weasleys become Wellesleys. Arthur is Marquis of Duoro, heir to the Duke of Wellington. The Duchess of Wellington, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Wellesley,_Duchess_of_Wellington][Diana Wellesley]], is depicted as a snobbish but scary ex British intelligence officer, who told Hermione bluntly in Year 6 that "Ron had to marry a proper princess, not some Mudges (Mudblood)!".

It's actually fun to read about posh circles sometimes. The main conflict of this story comes down to the fight for the British democracy, as Riddle led a gang of die hard elitists trying to overthrow it and impose a totalitarian aristocracy.

******* It's not really the same. The way I'm looking at it, pureblood-supremacy /is/ racism: the belief that two sorts of people, based on arbitrary criteria, constitute different "races", one of which is to top it off supposedly "lesser" than the other. I think there's no argument that wizards who think of muggles as lesser beings are racists, and pureblood supremacy is based on the idea that having muggle ancestry "pollutes" your breed and automatically makes you lesser. It's not actually a matter of culture and money (consider the Gaunts, who had neither), just of what physical criteria you have (magic vs. no magic, pale skin vs. darker skin) and who your ancestors were.

******** I'll have to disagree. Racism does not mean oppression based on physical feature. It is in fact exactly the reason nobility in europe didn't marry commoners. The dilution of blood. While without magic, they certainly considered themselves a different breed, more intelligent, etc.

Purebloods are exactly the same, they are in fact magical nobility/upperclass. It is classism. Not racism. Magical people can have non magical children, muggles can have magical children. Which means they are not in any sense different races of people.

But... to me, racism is the ideology that holds that "races" are a /thing/. A medieval commoner and nobleman are no less different than random white-skinned and black-skinned people, or as a Jewish and non-Jewish person. It's just a set of arbitrary physical criteria.

********** Racism is not the idea that different races of people exist. That is genetically and physically apparent. Racism is the idea that people should be treated differently/unequally compared to others based on their race. People around the world are different, they are not the same, but they should be treated equally regardless.

Magic is not a race, it is an ability. It is not able to be deduced by appearance. Magical purebloods act like its the 1600's and the class system is still around, (mostly in fics)

Racism is the oppression of people on the basis of race. Classism is the oppression of people on the basis of social class. Maybe it should be ‘magicism' - oppression of people on the basis of magical ability.

The point is that treating people unequally is oppression. But the reason varies and means it is called different things.

*********** Disagreement over the factuality of "races" aside (again, I see no more difference between someone with white and black skin than I see between people with red or brown hair), because pursuing that argument would get us nowhere...

...I would still argue that pureblood-supremacy is more than "magicism" or classism. "Magicism" (discrimination purely on the basis of magical ability) covers Grindelwald's ideology, but not the purebloodists', because it doesn't account for the purebloodists' hatred-on-principle of /wizards/ who have muggle blood. And classism would imply the purebloods are "upper-class", and the muggle-borns not... which is a fanon misconception. There are a few rich pureblood families, yes, but most purebloods aren't any richer than muggle-borns (see: Gaunts, Weasleys, etc.). There's not really any "pureblood culture", nor any difference in how muggle-born and pureblood wizards are treated most of the time, except by the bigots themselves.

************ Just on the factuality of races, i think i should have said many different cultures, since race, while able to identify continental ethnicities, doesn't really have any solid implication beyond physical appearance.

I do get what you're saying. And practically theres no difference in the treatment of muggleborns and muggle ancestry by purebloods when compared to how most european americans treated people with african ancestry around 60 years ago. But i'm just trying to point out that oppression looks the same in many different cases. Its the reasons which define what it is called.

That doesn't really work either, though. A mark of racism as opposed to xenophobia is that it's about people's /genes/ regardless of who they are as a person and to what culture they belong. The Nazis went after people of Jewish ancestry whom they considered "Jews", even if these people were completely integrated in German/French/etc. culture and neither held Jewish beliefs nor traditions.

** ...Huh. I was expecting this post to be about the enslavement of house-elves, segregation of centaurs and giants, stereotyping of goblins as violent and veela as sex objects, and how writers never seem to actually have meaningful characters of those races that defy those roles.

Seriously, Firenze shows up in the first book to save Harry, later reappearing in the 5th as a teacher, and while he isn't traditionally-magical he has an interest in foretelling the future and Harry's wellbeing. Why doesn't he get more screentime in fics, guiding Harry on addressing his ultimate destiny?

However, there's actually a canon explanation:

/Firenze pointed to the red star directly above Harry./ *"In the past decade, the indications have been that wizardkind is living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars. Mars, bringer of battle, shines brightly above us, suggesting that the fight must soon break out again. How soon, centaurs may attempt to divine by the burning of certain herbs and leaves."*
