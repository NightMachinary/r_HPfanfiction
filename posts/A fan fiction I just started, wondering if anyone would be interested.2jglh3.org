Hey guys! To be honest, I generally stay away from fan fiction because I'm extraordinarily anal about detail exclusivity with stories (basically don't want to read something not cannon and think it's canon or have it mess with my notions of the cannon). Weird, I know. However! I've recently started working on an idea I've had for a long time. It's set after the trio have died, but still (of course) within the HP universe and set at Hogwarts. I've only come up with a short prologue so far, but if some of you would be interested in reading it I'll definitely start to post it all somewhere. So let me know what you think and if you're interested! Thanks!

Here's the [[http://slytherclaw13.wordpress.com/2014/10/16/davin-prologue/][link!]] Just for a little context, the story is Davin's, it just seems to be from Guinevere's PoV because of how the story is introduced. I hope you enjoy!


** I read your prologue, but didn't really get a sense of what the story was about, aside from different characters in Hogwarts and the Davin suddenly appearing without a memory. Maybe if you gave a rough outline of where you envision the story going it would be easier to tell if someone is interested.

Is there a particular reason you are having it set so far in the future? are you including futuristic elements or do you want the story to tie back to cannon in someway. Because otherwise I think just making it AU without the Trio existing and different characters would be much easier. Just in terms of referencing muggle things and explaining the world.

Personally I think you writing style could use some work, but I think that will just come with practice, and will get better as you progress.

*** Thanks for the response! I am most definitely a total amateur, so I do hope to improve in the future. Do you have any tips to improve the style?

The first chapter sets up the story much better because they go into Davin's mind and get some clues as to why he's there. Maybe I should combine them to give a better view. I may post an outline. I liked the idea of going future instead of AU because I still wanted it to be in the HP timeline. I want to stick as closely to the HP world people know as I can (without it being the exact same setting of course), and that just made more sense to me.
