  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

***** Those are false choices. Quality long stories are a real thing. Abandoned stories are disappointment in the making, however good it is you don't know what happens. The only story I wish had never been completed is canon, JKR blew it with the last two books.

**** Oh my...that sounds like a trainwreck. Thanks for the explanation! I've been in the fandom for quite some time now and didn't know that those kinds of fics have a specific name.

**** Unless it's slash, in which case Lucius also happens to be non-evil ... for whatever nonsense reason.

I've nothing against slash, but trainwrecks have some ridiculous stuff going on.
