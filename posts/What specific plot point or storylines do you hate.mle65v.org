I hate that every Creature!Harry is an excuse for harry to be in a relationship with Snape, Malfoy or Voldemort, Instead of an interesting look at a different species or magic we get a pathetic Harry who needs babies or he will die. Vampire fics specifically.

Harry calling anyone Pa or Da.

Harem stories.

Harry who reads a book over the summer and is suddenly able to defeat Voldemort.


** Harry being bad at math. It's something that is especially used when he somehow meets Hermione before Hogwarts, so she can end up tutoring him or something, but it doesn't make any sense. In philosophers stone Harry literally tells Hagrid „I know some things. I can, you know, do maths and stuff.“

If he was bad at maths it wouldn't be his first thing to mention. If you want to tell a person that you're not stupid, you won't go along and start talking about a subject you're bad in. You talk about the thing you're best in. So, Harry is good at maths. And I'm unreasonably annoyed by people acting like he‘s not.

Like Gred and Forge, the twins (actually just George) refer to themselves like this /once/, as a funny joke about Molly putting their initials on their jumpers, and then IIRC it's never used again.

** There are a ton of plot things I tend to dislike but can imagine liking if done well.

​

- I usually don't want to read any of the fics with an absurd number of lordships, but there is probably a way you could make it work.
- I usually don't like Harry becoming overpowered in like a month of "self-study" but I could see it being enjoyable in a crackfic or if they worldbuild around it properly (like how the manga One Punch Man has an overpowered protagonist but it still works because they work around that)
- "Gray Harry" when they really mean "mercilessly kills the people I disagree with" is stupid, but a morally gray protagonist isn't necessarily a bad thing
- "Independent Harry" could be interesting, but usually it's just a heap of bashing which is resolved in a few chapters at most by some random Deus Ex Machina
- I can see the fun of a harem fic but every harem that I've encountered had like 0 personality or reasons for the people to be into Harry.
- Creature fics, even if the creature is kinda OP, could be interesting, but any time the concept of "mates" or whatever comes out I die a little more inside.
- Arranged marriages being used as a romantic thing without bringing up the issues (like this one fic - I think it was Harry x Daphne - where Harry exploited an unequal marriage contract to get several dates with his assigned partner and it worked for him)
- Harry/the DA being like, big players in the war, could have some really interesting exploration of the effect of war on people's morality, but it's often done badly. Either the children are way more competent than they should be, take to killing way too easily, or some other issue.\\

​

Of course, there are some things I invariably dislike such as bashing, Harry being an asshole, certain ships (Harry/Snape comes to mind, why the fuck is that as common as it is), characters (especially kids) portraying murder as the "objectively best" option and immediately becoming cold-blooded killers, and supporting certain prejudices (like if they portray blood purity as okay).

I mean, if you're referring to Death Eaters they tried to kill him first, multiple times, returning lethal force is a reasonable escalation. Obviously if "Grey Harry" starts assassinating his political enemies he's gone overboard, but I love any AU in which Harry realises he's fighting in a war not duelling Slytherins in Hogwarts corridors, and takes the kid gloves off.

Although I don't think it's right to assume every single Slytherin is a prejudiced bully and even think JK lost the opportunity of teaching a nice lesson had she made them deeper characters, I hate that people ignore their mistakes and pretend they're perfect.

Salazar Slytherin himself was prejudiced and this is one of the traits the Sorting Hat takes in consideration when it sorts a student. There is a Hitler Youth vibe there and it should be addressed, so it can be fixed. Pretending they're perfect is like justifying every arsehole character's actions because they have a sob story.

**** Imo, one of the biggest problems in the wizarding world is that as much as Dumbledore and the other teachers act like they're not prejudiced, they do absolutely nothing to try and change the bigoted/wrong views a lot of students (Ron's comments about muggle devices weren't exactly unprejudiced) have.

It comes down to being in a position of power: most teachers were probably pure bloods and knew nothing about the muggle word. They didnt have to care about it, despite having a considerable influx of muggle-borns at Hogwarts. They (students) had to adapt and because they were foreigners, they had to go through the prejudice coming from their peers. My impression is that teachers like McGonagall, who I love, maybe thought ensuring muggle-borns having a place at Hogwarts was enough. There's no way they'd live with the kids/teenagers and not know about the name calling, they just didn't care, because it didn't affect a majority.

If the teachers actually made an effort to try and teach that muggle-borns aren't different, they're as much wizards as the next pure blood, that they wouldn't come scot free after name calling, actually trying to stop the hateful comments and stuff it could make a difference. Instead, they ignore it and the prejudice runs free.

If a child is raised in a prejudiced environment they most probably will be prejudiced as well. But at eleven they left for a boarding school, they had to interact with people outside their social bubble, if the teachers had tried to show why they were wrong for thinking themselves better because of their origins, they could change.

***** Even going with your logic, which is really good, I still wonder if it makes sense to have Muggle Studies with a professor that is likely accepting of Muggles and still have the school not put any effort to stop the prejudice. Maybe Muggle Studies teachers are like Mr. Weasley. He is very interested in "Muggle culture", which is okay if you appreciate it, but sometimes it seems like he does what we do with animals (study their habitat and behaviour in a scientific way). Even so, as we can tell from the Weasleys, a Muggle Studies professors would not accept name calling and persecution at all.

And another issue is that they had a whole war that lastes for eleven years based on this supremacist mindset. One would think they'd put an effort to avoid a second war. Maybe have some meetings with all students to answer any questions they might have regarding Muggles, explain the good side of being a Muggle, and how they are equals to wizards. They could make Muggle Studies compulsory for the first three years too.

Slytherin wanted to accept only students with full magical ancestry (Pure-bloods). I think wizards' prejudice against Muggles and Muggle-borns come both from the fact that they believe not possessing magical makes you inferior (like Squibs) and the persecution they suffered from Muggles.

But then again, he hated Muggle-borns so much that he hid a monster inside the castle to kill them all, so I'd say he's an elitist at best and a Hitler wannabe at worst.

To add to this, Luna's bullying in general is overstated.

While it is true that the notices that Luna posts note that she has clothing missing, she's never described as missing her shoes in canon. And given that a /lot/ of attention is given to Luna's eccentric appearance, if Luna were forced to walk barefoot, it would have been noted.

What was likely is that anything stolen from her was something that could be easily explained away by her bullies--scarves and gloves for example.

She's also not physically harassed. Unlike Malfoy and his goons, Luna's bullies don't cast harmful jinxes on her. And given that Luna would be outnumbered and outgunned in her dormitory, it'd be beyond easy for them to do so if they wanted to.

Similarly, the decisions made by characters in the earlier books (e.g. Dumbledore RIDING A BROOM to London) make no sense in the context of the later books that suddenly have more worldbuilding/context (e.g. addition of Floo, Knight Bus, Apparition, and Portkeys). Therefore, it's easy to see the early decisions as "stupid" in light of the options not chosen that were added later.

  "This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old hat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?"

But Dumbledore tells us later that Fawkes came by himself:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire.

  "Sit down, Harry," he said, and Harry sat, feeling unaccountably nervous. "First of all, Harry, I want to thank you," said Dumbledore, eyes twinkling again. "You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you."

  He stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his knee. Harry grinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him.

And further proof that he didn't know it was a basilisk:

#+begin_quote
  "She's not dead, Argus," he said softly.

  Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented.

  "Not dead?" choked Filch, looking through his fingers at Mrs. Norris. "But why's she all - all stiff and frozen?"

  "She has been Petrified," said Dumbledore ("Ah! I thought so!" said Lockhart). "But how, I cannot say . . . ."

If an intelligent creature like Fawkes knew where CoS was, are we supposed to believe that his owner didn't know?

My in-universe interpretation of the second book is like this:

1. Dumbledore knew it was a sanke/basilisk. Remember that he asked Harry whether Harry knew something or not.

2. Dumbledore also knew the entrance was in the Moaning Myrtle's bathroom since Tom Riddle's time at Hogwarts.

3. And he knew a parselmouth was needed to open it.

4. He knew that the events were linked with Voldemort somehow. He was looking for big pictures. Hence, he let the events go through because he wanted to know how Voldemort was able to pull the stuff. (And at the end, he did discover Voldemort's secret of Horcrux).

5. Then why didn't he ask Harry to open it? He didn't want Harry to be in a danger intentionally.

6. As soon as he knew Harry and co were in the CoS, he sent reinforcement to Harry.

The out-of-universe interpretation, the only way Dumbledore doesn't know about it because JKR didn't want him to know.

Then just add a little bit of "Dumbledore didn't realize it was a basilisk because petrification via indirect stare is rare and thus not commonly recorded, and the odds of it happening multiple times in row are astronomically small compared to the odds of dark magic being used. Not knowing about the spiders or the voice in the walls, Dumbledore let his preconceptions get the best of him and didn't give enough consideration to the basilisk theory, while Hermione's youthful lack of preconceptions and additional information from Harry and Hagrid allowed her to arrive at the correct conclusion first.

Now, I really like the way that /Leaving Home/ - linkffn ( 4539064 ) - handles this: Harry says "Oh hell no, this is a scam, I'm outta here" and, even though he is publicly hated by basically all of Britain (and is basically forced to flee to America) for not accepting Draco as his mate, Harry perseveres, never once even thinking of giving in.

Remember: Harry Potter Is Not A Pussy. This is the kid who, when 12-13 years old, killed a snake about 10x bigger than himself to save someone he barely knew; the same kid who, just a few years later, would be pitted against an army of the Dark Lord's forces in an unfamiliar place after having just seen Voldemort get resurrected, and yet still takes the time to retrieve his friend's body while retreating. Harry Potter has the spirit of a fucking Spartan, and I'm tired of seeing people write him like he's a pathetic pushover who can't do shit without the help of whatever character he's being shipped with. Of course, this doesn't mean Harry can't have weaknesses or flaws: everyone has them, and Harry shouldn't be any different; the strengths and the weaknesses should just be spread evenly and not super lopsided (too many strengths and not enough flaws, or too many flaws and not enough strengths). Canon Harry is a strong-willed person who will fight for their loved ones and their beliefs, but hides a history of abuse and is afraid to get confrontational with those loved ones in fear they may lose them.

TL:DR - Harry Potter is not a dumbass or a pushover, and he would most definitely resist against anyone claiming to be his mate unless he had absolutely solid, 100% undeniable proof of the claim being legit; and even then, he'd still find a way to fight against it.

****** In the book Ron seemed more upset by the slur than Hermione. Hermione was all like "eh who cares". In the movie she was all upset and knew exactly what the slur meant.

Not saying it was okay at all, or that she would ever want to date him. But if James could go from despised by Lily, who specifically said she would pick the giant squid over him, to marrying her and having a kid together I don't think it's far fetched for someone to write an AU redemption arc that takes Draco from an 11 year old bigot to actually having some character growth and realizing he's being a cruel dumbass.

******* it can work if the author is willing to put in the effort and time. It has to be a long-fic and can't be done in a simple one-shot.

It basically needs to be a fic that goes over multiple years for it to be feasible and believable, and sadly that is not what I see in most fanfics. In most fanfics they basically skip the whole 'characer-development' part and go straight for the romance.

******** *Measure Of A Man* by inadaze22 on AO3.

/To truly know someone is to differentiate between who they once were, who they are now, and who they're capable of being. Hermione realises the duality of one man as she rectifies what she knows of the past and begins to understand the pieces of who Draco Malfoy is now: a father, a son, and a man./

This is a Work In Progress with no signs of slowing down and is currently at 280k words. Hermione is 30-ish (MANY years since the Battle Of Hogwarts) and a Healer, there's a complex Ministry of Magic Subplot, complicated relationships with other characters, and more. Draco doesn't even come into the fic until a decent way into the book; basically, this isn't centred on Draco's development and is equally as focused on Hermione's. It's got a good portrayal of grief, parental control, and the struggle to grow. Somewhat of a spoiler - They kiss once in the entirety of the 280k words

~~~~

One that is recommended a lot for first time Dramione readers is *Isolation* by Bex-Chan. While there are certain tropes in this fic that I struggle with, this has some of the most emotionally charged "conflict" scenes between Hermione and Draco and some iconic lines. This is more Draco focused for development, it can be a good introductory read.

If you are genuinely wanting to check out Dramione, let me know and I'd be more than happy to throw a few more intro fics your way. :)

** Moving the plot forward by a decade or three. I get it, most fanfiction writers are tweens who haven't the slightest idea what the early 90s were like, and they assume that everyone since Ghengis Khan had cell phones and Netflix and Snapchat. But that's not Harry's world. It just doesn't work. If all the characters in Buffy the Vampire Slayer had cell phones, the plots of nearly half the episodes would fall apart because they depended on things happening in different places at the same time, with the other parties not knowing. HP has similar issues, so just trying to shoehorn it into the 2010s or 2020s ruins the whole story for me. Moving it around a year or three to try to fit better with a crossover of the same time period (e.g. Buffy, Stargate, etc.) is fine, but moving decades makes the world so different that it's no longer the Potterverse.

Soul mate fics, A/B/O, and just magic in general leans to a repetitive plot that people are die hard over it. Voldemort, Harry, Snape are quite popular in the Slash world. And pretty sure other Fandom crossover have popular pairings. Like Harry/Edward, Harry/Winchester, Harry/Loki, ect...

It's a convenient excuse to pair ppl because it's a trope for said pairing and I'd suggest using your search engine/Filter and put Creature as an exclusion. It's the magic world. You're gonna see it.

It's how these ppl change up the trope to make it /new/. I've seen dragons, centaur, thestral, werewolf, vampire, werewolf, Death, Veela and even a Dementor.

** Three main ones: Hermione being a damsel in distress(thankfully, there's not a lot that I know of). She was the brightest witch of her age, which I assume means the graduating class she was in, so odds are she'd be able to escape a lot of things.

Draco or Snape being redeemed by the grace of the author. No work needed, just a sudden "oh yes, they're both redeemed because fuck logic!"

Romione where there's not an effort to try and make Ron someone who embraces the persona of a great chess player. Seriously, in the movies he's just the annoying sidekick. In the books, he has moments, but they're few and far apart. Give us the Ron we deserve, damnit. He deserves better than what he was given!

This might make me unpopular but I just can't stand cross-overs. Even when I like the other fandom(s) being integrated. I just want to read about Harry Potter's world not every Avenger ever or The Shire.

Personally I think it would work best in an AU where Magical Europe retained a far greater Greco-Roman culture in comparison to muggle Europe, perhaps one where the Eastern Roman Empire didn't fall to the Turks.

** I hate that Snape is forced to protect Harry. Harry turns into a asshat from his first year at Hogwarts, he's a nice kid at first but he turns right into his father before its all over.

I hate that people seem to love Sirius who was a cowardly bully who needed three of his friends to torture there's no other name for it, the poor half blood for seven years.

I hate that people seem to think that Severus who joined the DL did so out of anger and revenge and then people have the nerve to say he should have gotten over it. Well going undercover and getting tortured because the rest of the so called army is too damn scared and cowardly to do it themselves was something I hated.

People tend to forget that a entire castle of people were aware of what the Maurauders were doing to Snape, and they all were aware that Albus let them get away with it. That's why when Sirius went to jail everyone who knew him thought he was capable of murdering his friends, after all if he tortured a fellow student for seven years and hurt him plenty he wouldn't have a problem with murder.

I hate that Harry who is mediocre gets a inheritance test and is suddenly the heir to everything but the planet and is the richest wizard in the world. *Also where Sirius was able to give his home to Harry and make him his heir, when the author made so much of blood and magic, Draco should have been the next Lord Black and not someone who isn't even a direct Black but some third or fourth cousin.*

*** As far as I know we only have Snape's side of his interactions with the Marauders and only then a few, almost certainly cherry-picked instances. We don't get to see the full picture.

We have seen that Snape is petty and vindictive, immediately bullying Harry from day one. He also allowed Slytherins to torture and attack other houses.

We know that /he/ gave Voldemort the prophecy that led to James and Lily getting killed. We also know that he created at least one violent murder spell while a student. That's in addition to calling Lily a slur that was hurtful enough for her to end their relationship.

Of all the despicable shit that happened to Snape in his past people actually expect him to be smiling and generous to the students. Be nice to potter and get cursed, don't be nice to him and you're petty and vindictive. Most if not ALL of the problems of the WW can be laid at the feet of Albus.

He let a abused kid like Severus be bullied, instead of taking care of them he just did his usual leader of the light schtick. Dumbledore's needed a dark lord to stay in charge of policies in the WW. Unless Severus is making things up in his head, he has no reason to lie. Seven years of bullying and attempts on your life, and being treated like your life is worthless can make you petty and vindictive.

Harry was a lazy loser, and a LOT of kids grew up without their parents, a LOT of them lost their entire family and didn't make everything about them.

Harry attacked Draco with a spell that he didn't know what it did and almost killed Draco, he didn't get expelled for it a soft punishment, you can bet your ass if Draco almost killed Harry he would have been in that wizarding jail before you could say AK! Harry should have been expelled for flying that car...........nothing happened to him.

Snape had that oath to keep the idiot safe, a hard job when you tell him not to do something he runs to do it. Harry and his friends were the new marauders and everyone at that school knew it.

He had to be begged to study harder, and encouraging bullying? Harry's attitude about the Slytherins helped inflame the school against them. The kid ignored common sense more than Carl in the Walking Dead when he was a kid.

He got a guilty spy, he almost got the Marauders as fighters for the Light and he got Harry's parents killed.

Draco had a snake faced demon in his home, yes he grew up with a version of magical nazis and he talked the talk but he couldn't kill Albus.

​

Harry on the other hand had anything illegal covered up, forgiven and praised for anything he did even if it was the wrong thing. Anyone can be do something stupid, if spying for the ungrateful asses of the light for years wasn't enough I don't know what is.

As for the almost killed thing, I assume you mean the thing with Remus right? In which case don't make me laugh, the mental gymnastics Snape fans jump through to ignore the entirety of that incident baffle me. He was looking for Remus on a full moon to get photographic proof that he was a werewolf, you know, the thing that would have gotten Remus executed like a rabid animal if he'd been successful? Should Sirius have told him where to go? No, absolutely not but it's hardly like he was just minding his own business when Sirius jumped him and forced him down the passage at wand point.

Snape is not a hero, he is not a victim, he is a pathetic cowardly bully who tormented a child that had never done a damn thing to him as petty revenge for not being able to get the girl he wanted.

As for the rest of your crap, all I can surmise based on how many of your “facts” are blatantly wrong is that you're either deliberately choosing to misremember the actual events of the books or you've never actually read them to start with and have simply put together a timeline you like based solely on Snape centric fanfiction.

I mean, You-Know-Poo was used once in the whole series by Fred and George, but it was the smallest joke made by people who are actively fighting Voldemort. They aren't known to be particularly serious, and the purpose is to bring a bit of levity to the time, mocking him, but not denying how dangerous he is.

People who are absolutely terrified of someone aren't going to just go around spouting out nicknames for someone who is arguably a mass murderer.

And I know that with I'm going to say, I might probably be hating the whole Harry Potter plot, but you need to understand that I'm in my “Evil Dumbledore” era.
