Well. I am honestly bored of having to read over and over again how some HP in an AU lands in the Marvelverse and becomes the asslicker of Nick Fury. I mean, some of those fics were really well rounded but it honestly gets boring quite fast.

Are there any good crossovers featuring a more badass - I dont follow your orders - Harry? Preferably Greater Good or Dark or Evil. But whatever you can dig up is fine anyways. We all know we bingeread anything :D
