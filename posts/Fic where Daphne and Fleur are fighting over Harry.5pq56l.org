Title says it all pretty much. I remember a fic I read a while ago where both Fleur and Daphne fancied Harry. I think Harry got with Fleur in the end but another part of me thinks Fleur cheated on him with Bill...

Any help would be good thanks â˜º


** That might be Letters by the Endless7? Linkffn(6535391) which is a fourth year fic in which Harry and Fleur exchange letters over the holidays and Daphne takes an interest in him at some point and tries to win Harry's affections, competing with Fleur.

**** And it's way better written than Letters, too!

Even if chapter twelve might kill my 'update every weekend' plan...Who'd have thought writing a massive set piece battle would be difficult?!

****** Actually pretty much finished the battle last night. Just a few details left to fill in here or there. Weirdly how deciding to approach it more like a quidditch scene than anything seemed to help. Having a beta review it early to see if it works as well as I think it worked.

After that it's just future Voldemort's plotting moving toward the Christmas Holiday. The battle scene will take up the vast majority of the chapter, so finishing it effectively means I shouldn't have an issue updating by the weekend, barring car accident.

**** I prefer complete stories myself, but with an update that recent I didn't realize it had been abandoned. (I usually check the last chapter of an incomplete story to see if the author has announced that they're bailing.)

***** I don't really think it's abandoned either, I guess that he just has life stuff going on, as the story began during spring and went well into summer. I also enjoy that this is only his first fic, he has so far managed to make good of popularly used tropes, despite being new to writing. Although the corner is definitely visible, he made this "Shadow King" (Merlin) a little too powerful, and I'm unsure what else he could call upon to give Harry a boost, short of just making the Shadow King see reason and join him.

****** Yeah, when I'm pulling stories and one hasn't been updated since 2012 I consider it abandoned. A last update of September 2016 isn't that bad, they're just not pumping out chapters.
