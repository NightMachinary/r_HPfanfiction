Any fanfics that centre around Harry and he ends up time travelling into the past and interacts with his grandparents?

Stepping back by TBR was something, I liked it but are there any more in this category (time travelling and meets grandparents)?


** linkao3(The Heir Of House Black) Harry is reincarnated as Sirius and Regulus' older brother. He of course meets not only Fleamont and Euphemia, but Charles and Dorea, his great aunt and uncle, as well.

Bit of a stretch for this second one but in linkao3(Strange Visitors from Another Century), it's revealed that Harry actually /is/ the Heir Of Slytherin. Harry actively calls Salazar his Grandfather afterwards. It's really sweet actually.

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Updates once every two to three weeks. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

** Face Death in the Hope by Lullaby Knell.

Unfinished but Harry is sent back in time to 1980ish and meets his parents and things happen. It's really good anf how harry deals with it is great and I can't say too much without spoiling it..
