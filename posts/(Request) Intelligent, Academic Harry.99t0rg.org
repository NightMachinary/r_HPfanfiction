I'm looking for Harry... well, the title is self-explanatory. Less parody, and more drama and dueling maybe? And a novel length fic.

*** Please not Taking control. That fic has the worst of the !indy harry genre.

That harry is so edgy and full of himself you start to hate him while you are supposed to be on his side.

**** If you think that's Indy and edgy, you really need to take a step back and look at the wider HP fanfiction community.

It's definitely an Indy!Harry fic, but nothing about it is overly angst and horrible. To a degree Ron, Hermione and Dumbledore are bashed, that's true. But it's nothing compared to what I've seen before. Hell, at the beginning it makes a point to bash Harry himself, something that the fandom needs more of to keep things on firmer footing.

On the other hand, it has a Harry who actually works for it. He grinds away at magic, trying to improve himself little by little. And he's is still utterly outclassed by Dumbledore and Voldemort by the end. The romance actually isn't unctuous like most fics, and it feels like it was reasonably built up over time. I'll admit the circumstances are dicey (putting it mildly) though, and I'm not necessarily a fan of the wandless magic here either.

But what's different among other fics is the tone. Harry never turns into a smug dickish arsehole. He's just an overall nice guy, and it's so refreshing compared to real Edgy Harry fics. Nor does he fall into the Dark Arts, something that is exceptionally common. It keeps more of the canon feel than 95% of other HP fics, a shockingly surprising thing given its length.

You want an example of a bad Indy Harry fic, go read Defiance by Dark Lord Slytherin.

***** Harry makes an overnight shift due to dream Sirius and starts acting totally different. Than expects people do accept as normal what is clearly abnormal and is a dick about it. (tbh the Hermione bashing is the one thing i really like about the fic as a guilty pleasure.)

In the end you start to side with the people you are supposed to be against.

Ginny decides to make her life about his and that is the basis of their romance. She giving up her life to serve him basicaly.

Harry goed arround bullying people wit his wandless abilities nobody can track. While ofcourse having two animagus forms.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
