When I learn of the idea of lordships as world building to the Harry Potter Universe, I thought that it was a good conclusion about JKR universe and its apparent state of corruption and of the importance of old blood and money.

Now there is some dubious realisation that may have perverted the potential of the idea :

- We have the fics with Harry being Lord Gryffindor - Peverell - Ravenclaw - Pendragon and Emrys that have so exaggerated Harry standing that it ridiculous.

- We have the fics with Harry being pardoned all his actions against others because of his ignorance.

- We have Lords basically being the ultimate master of the inheritance of non members. Able to choose who they want despite having no blood relations.

There is of course the often reproached kids being political geniuses but that is not so much true as every heir would have been educated from year one to behave accordingly. It is the consequence of being noble, you are from birth pushed to be perfect in everything.

There are other cause that I encourage to share.

Now I will formulate some propositions to how one could fix those problems :

- It would be good if the Lord of the House could not evict from their place in the succession by selecting or blood adopting someone else without the majority approval of the members of the House . Ex : Sirius cannot choose Harry to be heir without approval from Bellatrix, Narcissa and Draco.

- If an heir is muggle raised, until such time as they prove that they have been assimilated to the Wizarding custom and that they have been educated on the knowledge to be fit to be heir or Lord, they should be considered as being unfit to to be heir and have all their assets frozen.

- Harry should be limited to the Potter, Peverell and possibly Slytherin lordships.

- The Lord must have unanimous approval as to any change to the political aims of the House.

- The Lord must act accordingly the general principles of the House.

- The Heir must take control of the House by his own will if he is the last of his line. like a King decide to take control back from the regent.

- A Lord cannot reverse a ruling from a previous Lord of his line if he doesn't have the unanimous support of the House.


** I think a fair bit of the backlash against the lordship thing is... it doesn't work like that irl. Remember, Lord Voldemort is a /name made up by a teenager/ having fun with anagrams.

***** I think also it would have added a supplementary level of complexity because each title of nobility has a rank but the noble families are already ranked between ancient, noble, most noble, most ancient, arcane, ....

You would have to explain the ranking between Marquis, Baron, Earl, Viscount, etc

** One reason the lordships might be exaggerated is because it places Harry far above everyone else. He's Lord Gryffindor but no one else is his peer or superior in title. I've read a FF where the old family names (Slytherin, Peverell, Le Fey) came back into play and it ended up being interesting because of the more even playing field.

Readers want the anticipation of what is going to happen next, basically gifting or giving Harry with a title ruins the fun of suspense. With such a â€˜mighty' title, readers are instead either wondering why Harry doesn't use it to his advantage or are rolling their eyes because he announces his title on every page.

Thoughts?

** I don't like the trope because in all fics with it that I've read, the lordships contribute at best to one minor scene, at worst they contribute nothing to the plot other than making Harry awesome and give him a million seats in the Wizentgamot which he doesn't really use for anything relevant to the story anyways.

I would totally not mind a lord Harry where the inheritance creates an actual conflict:

- find out that your family has massive debts because the ancestors used a lot of money to finance wars;

- someone else that believe they are the real heir or someone that is next in line to Harry as a heir fights Harry over the inheritance;

- if you are going to use your powers to evict someone from your property, make it have consequences such as violent retaliation or estranging people;

- if you are going to give Harry majority seats in the Wizengamot, create some conflict out of it. Say most people are not happy that the legislative and the judicial body is ruled by an inexperienced eleven year old or show that (as per canon) the Ministry is the real power and have a hostile Minister.

In any case you get the idea.

*** Totally agree with your propositions, I would have probably come up with them myself but I was too busy against the deux ex machina of being Lord and Sirius deciding to reverse from Dark to Light the Black Family.

** I really don't like that trope because Harry Inherits power and does not earn it. It is given to him on a silver plater with nothing more than a signature standing in his way. I think that that destroys the inherent qualities that make him interesting because he is no longer the underdog who we are rooting for but the victor who just hasn't stepped up to receive the gold medal. We know who is going to win the second we read the line "Welcome back Lord Potter Black Gryffindor ..." there is no suspense anymore no question who is going to win because Harry can just lap his enemies with his Moneybag and call it a day.

But you know what really surprises me is the lack of "Goblins using Harry to further their own agenda fics" because that would make sense they use Harry to destabilize the Wizards making the next goblin rebellion easy.

*** What really surprise me, is the lack of fic when Harry vulnerable position is exploited by others because Harry is the last of his line and wasn't raised properly . For ex Malfoy or someone else could argue that because Harry isn't fit to be the heir or even the Lord of his house, House Potter should be absorbed by House Malfoy or House Black, or become a Vassal. And there is none one who could protect him because Sirius Black has been disowned and in jail, and Harry has no one else because there is no other Potter alive and whatever family Euphemia is. Or perhaps even a forced mariage contract with loss of control of the Potter House to his spouse.
