** 1. Don't use them.

2. If you must use them, have them predict a possibility, not a certainty.

*** I thought they were option 2 in canon. Because yes the prophecy DID predict that Voldemort would mark Harry as a Horcrux and stuff, but it wasn't a certainty about dying at the hands of the other, in that Harry could have just walked away at any time and been done with it, and nulled the rest of the prophecy. :)

**** Not quite; Prophecies in canon transcribe a possible course of events, such that if /one/ happens, the others will too, and the first event is directly caused by reacting to the prophecy. When it was first Spoken, the main Prophecy could indeed not have happened --- but as soon as Voldemort decided to act upon it and Harry had been Marked, it was guaranteed that the rest would come to pass, like a stable time loop.

***** Oh. So it's a possibility, but if the first possibility happens then it yes /locks you into it/ like a track? :)

******* :( But if it's still NOT magically binding then why COULDN'T Harry just walk away? :( I kind of want to know because ACHILLE I wanted to make a fanfic ABOUT Harry walking away in the middle of Deathly Hallows! :( But if he's physical incapable of that then I can't. :(

******** It's not that he's physically /prevented/ --- the Prophecy is more of a prediction, like... well, like stable-time-loop time-travel as seen in /Prisoner of Azkaban/. It's not that the Prophecy being spoken /makes it so/ that Harry can't walk away, it's that the Prophecy was retroactively made /because/ Harry wouldn't have walked away in the future.

That being said, the Prophecy's /words/ must be realized, but it can mean many different things. Just off the top of my head, the Prophecy says that "Either Must Die at the End of the Other". What if a mage went around calling themselves The Other, fighting alongside Dumbledore in the war? They could then kill Voldemort (because the terms of the Prophecy would allow them to kill "either" Voldemort or Harry) and Harry wouldn't have had to do anything.

********* Oh! So it's just that the Prophecy KNEW what Harry would do beforehand, and it described those events? Like in Prisoner of Azkaban how they already saw what they would do the first time around with the TIME TURNER and then they did it anyway when their time came? :)

*********** Oh ok! :) Achille that also actually FITS with the time turner that the future is already written how it is the whole time and you just don't understand it. :) That's very neat!

But yes also sad because it means Harry Potter universe has no free will? :( The universe already KNOWS everything that's going to happen in it before you actually do anything... :(

************ No. In Prophecies' case, that's where the "track" idea comes in, you see. Prophecy can accurately predict the bare bones of a basic sequence of events once /one/ thing happens, and that first thing is a matter of choice. Again, if Voldemort hadn't gone after Harry, or if Snape hadn't repeated the Prophecy to Voldemort, it would have been null and void.

As for the Time-Turners, they're not /always/ stable. It's actually a little more complicated than that. Essentially, the universe/Fate/God doesn't /want/ a paradox to happen, so when you travel back in time, as long as you try not to contradict the past /as you know it/, magic will recoagulate the new timeline into one that was consistent with the old one, giving the illusion of the stable time loops. However, if you willfully make changes, it /is/ possible that you'll actually change the future... but in erratic, dangerous ways that have threatened to destroy the universe, or, as faras less extreme but still very unpleasant side-effects go, accidentally resulted in Voldemort being termporarily brought back to life (as seen in /Cursed Child/).

** 1 - Scansion and meter : prophecies are not just a prediction of the future, they are a transcription of the seer's knowledge in an understandable way, and HP magic tends to be strongly symbolic.\\
2 - Origin of knowledge : the prophecy is not utered before the chain of events leading to the one described by the prophecy has started (in canon, the second is uttered when all factors are here : protagonists, full moon,... ; the first is for the birth of a second generation under the war, after Harry conception, when Voldemort is on the verge of victory and will start hunting people instead of leading a war, where he will be confronted with magic he cannot understand)\\
3 - A prophecy is not a complete description of the future : it's the warning of a coming fulcrum, a point where all the current threads of destiny and decision comes to be intertwined
