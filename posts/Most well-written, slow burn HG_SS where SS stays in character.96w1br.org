I've really enjoyed stories by desert_sea and subversa - I enjoy how they write - very talented.

However, I don't love how Snape gives cutesy nicknames for Hermione, suddenly becomes overly loving etc. I like a good slow burn that seems "realistic" (as realistic as you can be when a magic couple).

I'm open to whatever plot as long as it's interesting (if the writer has made a smut or time Turner or marriage law fic interesting, I'll read it!) But Hermione has to be of age! Any younger than 17 and I'm going to stop reading. She doesn't need to be a student either.

So to summarize what I'm looking for:

- Well written
- Slow burn
- Sexual tension
- Canon characterization (as close as possible) no sappy Snape.
- Hermione is at least 17
- Eventual relationship/sex/whatever. I need resolution.\\
- Completed
- Any length

  What begins as Severus' anger at Sirius Black's attempts to seduce Hermione leads to a life he never thought he deserved to live. The past and the present mesh together in a story of protection, betrayal and trust, and how the Battle of Hogwarts might have been fought. Rated MA for tender sensibilities.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

  Accidents happen, but when this accident happens Hermione finds herself in a whole different decade at Hogwarts with people that are long dead in her time. Trying her best to find her way back before there are too many changes. SS/HG time travel story. Rated MA.
