Lost my interest actually. Even with me getting stuck inside the house because of the pandemic, I tried to continue but nothing comes to mind anymore.

My ideas: Its a Harry x Yuki pairing

The curse is lifted but the trauma is still there

Because of the curse, its hard to find love with the opposite gender so yuki became attracted to the same gender. Since hugging a female turns them into animals, might as well look at the same gender

Since the curse is already lifted, that idea carried over and he fell in love with harry


** That is such a shame. Of course I am not trying to guilt trip or blame you. I was looking forward to another Fruit Basket Crossover, there are not enough. Do you have any recommendations? I enjoyed the first two chapters!
