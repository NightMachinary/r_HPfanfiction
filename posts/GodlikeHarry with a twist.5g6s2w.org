If you've ever seen fate/stay night, you know Gilgamesh is OP. Basically, I'm looking for the main character to be like him- extremely overpowered, yet losing due to arrogance.

Over 70k+ words!


** do you mean for harry to be more powerful than voldemort and then loose the war?

*** I think he means that Harry is like a magical genius, prodigy, etc... But his overconfidence is his downfall at times. I imagine a scene where Harry allowed Voldemort to be reborn just to duel him in fourth year, and he inevitably gets in over his head and needs priori incantatum to save him.

It actually seems like a good premise on paper.
