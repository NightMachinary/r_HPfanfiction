I imagine this being set in the "lost years" ie before harry goes to hogwarts but after the wizarding war. You could also have this be set in the first wizarding war with the hunters being death eaters and kidnapping remus for some fun.

Another interesting situation would be Lucius forcing Draco to do this as some kind of pureblood rite of passage thing.
