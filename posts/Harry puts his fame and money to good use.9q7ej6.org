We all know how Canon!Harry feels about his fame. Are there any (well-written) fics where Harry -- e.g. after hearing about the alarmingly high number of orphaned children -- goes "I'm having none of that" and utilises his fame and money for altruism? Bonus: He realises that, even with a vast fortune and several connections, some things can't be fixed for a long time.

Why do you think Canon!Harry never took advantage of his fame, try to cultivate connections? Sure, he would be gritting his teeth while doing it, but think of the potential good he could have accomplished! Harry, as a character, wouldn't have to change on a fundamental level -- he would still rather live a frugal and/or minimalist existence. Additionally, the goodwill generated would have put him in a much more favourable light down the road.


** We don't know canon Harry wouldn't have made change with his fame. He was a bit busy during his school years and all we see of after the war is him dropping his kids off at school.

Cursed Child notwithstanding, I see no reason that canon Harry couldn't have done a LOT of things after taking down Voldemort.

** That's a good idea. In my own story, I've had a similar (but ultimately very different) idea in the fact that, having obtained accusatory material on Lucius Malfoy, my main character doesn't have him arrested but instead forces him to regularly donate gold to various worthy causes.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

** Honestly, it would be even better if Harry was the head of the ministry of magic or some such.

Has Harry sent back in time to help out at Hogwarts before the war got really started, he uses his money and abilities to transform Hogwarts into a state of the art school.
