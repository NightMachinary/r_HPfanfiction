There's HPL, which is great for things that happened in the books (and has things like day-by-day calenders), but doesn't have much post-DH content. Errors are pretty rare, but it does feel like it's kind of stuck in 2007.

The only other option is HP wiki, which is pretty shit in terms of actual accuracy and kind of all over the place. It's like canon, only with lots of assumptions about the character's childhoods and a sprinkling of movieverse.

I seriously wish that there was another site that was focused on the books like HP Lexicon.


** Post-DH canon content is pretty much limited to the recent Skeeter article and the fact that Dumbledore was gay.

**** The epilogue was in DH.

**** Just read between the lines and the epilogue tells quite a story - Harry and Ginny have a loveless marriage and are both cheating on each other (Harry with Hermione since that's basically the only other girl he knows, and it's his boss).

Ron and Hermione lasted a few years together before the divorce, then a drunken attempt at patching things for the sake of Rose and she got pregnant with Hugo. She didn't let that get in the way of her career, of course, and busted balls to the top of the DMLE as she fought her way through the muggleborn glass ceiling for as long as Kingsley was still Minister.

Ron lasted nearly a year as an Auror - his glory year - before dropping out to 'help George with the shop'. He greatly prefers this more lackadaisical lifestyle to the paperwork and occasional danger of the Auror Corps, but still flaunts his connections to the Aurors at every available opportunity - right alongside his Order of Merlin, Second Class.

As Head Auror, Harry's life was bogged down by a slew of paperwork and meetings that he knew was slowly killing him and making him hate life. He went to work as an undercover Hit Wizard for Hire, taking international bounties on the most dangerous dark wizards in areas where the only jurisdiction doesn't have the kind of Auror task force to bring them down. It's a job he's been doing his whole life - he thought he'd tired of it, but when he gets those calls it's the only time he feels alive.

EDIT: this is very much like what I had in mind when I wrote "Mr. And Mrs. Potter", part of my story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9900724/6/Seven-Deadly-Drabbles][Seven Deadly Drabbles]]. Note that there's only one long chapter of this but you might find it worth a read if you want to play in the playground of the above idea.

***** Rita skeeter is that you? I say this in jest it sounds like how she'd spin it. Although your guess is as good as mine. You read a heck of a lot more into the epilogue then I did, although what you said about Ron makes somewhat sense. Hermione too although I'm not sure about your opinion on their marriage. But to each his own. In my opinion Harry as an auror never really made sense, to me Harry would've gone on to become a quidditch star. He always enjoyed it a lot more and I don't see why he would want to take on a job that would remind him of those times at least not without enjoying a few decades first. Please don't take any offense.

****** Plenty of kids who play football in high school never go on to be Tom Brady.

I'm quite glad the epilogue wasn't that ridiculous, at least.

***** I just read the chapter and, modified with the contents of the above comment, the idea is making me giddy. Secrets, lies, double lives, plenty of bitter and horrific body-breaking violence combined into an exploration of the more sordid aspects of a wizarding world slowly losing their element of secrecy to the surveillance-crazed world of the 21st century... Oh hell yeah!

****** Idea 1:'The transition files-a selection of classified events and happenings that came to define the new ministry and its relationship with the rest of the world. 'Basically a collection of short stories chronicling the crises faced by magical Britain in the early years of the 21st century and the clandestine activities undertaken by a selection of deeply flawed/disturbed/traumatized/crazy/heroic individuals to address them.

Idea 2: The double life

Unpredictable. Heroic. Famous. Prone to trouble. Words that suit one Harry Potter well. Bored. Restless. Trapped behind a desk as a peacetime Auror with only a few petty criminals and lots of paperwork for company. Words that suit one Harry Potter less well. This was not what he signed up for. So he decided to do something about it. Of course, the department of mysteries just so happened to have a few odd jobs on offer as long as he didn't tell anyone about them. How could he resist? Now, ten years later, he gets promoted to the position of head auror. Woopee. When his new boss walks into the room, however, he knows that things were about to go wrong. Because Hermione Weasley was a lot more dangerous to secrets than Hermione Granger ever was. And Harry Potter had a lot more secrets to keep than he did as a teenager.

H/hr of course, though with a degree of adversity mixed into it as both characters and their varied coworkers fight to keep their secrets and hidden agendas from blowing up in their faces. Lots of violence too.
