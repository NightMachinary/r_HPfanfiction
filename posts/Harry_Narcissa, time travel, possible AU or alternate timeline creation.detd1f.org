The Core about the Fic that i had in mind would be Harry time traveling to the Past for whatever reason.....maybe to perform a Task. There he meets a yonger Narcissa, circa in her Teenage years and she has a crush on him. Maybe it gets mutual, but at some Point Harry travels to a later Point in that Time for his next Task. Narcissa is getting older by the time and is mad at him for "disappearing without saying any word". But her Crush still remains and they get together again. Maybe at some Point he travels again into a later Point before he returns to his own time.

â€‹

Now i will add some details about the Story. Keep in mind, that not all of these need to be included in the Fic, if its even possible to have them in there at all.

What im unsure is, if Harry keeps his physical statue when he travels or if it adapts to the Time that he travels to and with this i could think about a "malfunction" that he remains mostly in his Teenage/younger Body and only grow older for a couple of Years. So while Narcissa is getting older, he stays in the Younger Form. She would mention this to him.

Another Point would be that because of his "interference" Voldemorts reign might not happen at all or differently than in "his" time.

Im totally fine, if they get intim with each other, especially in later Times. How detailed its described isnt important.
