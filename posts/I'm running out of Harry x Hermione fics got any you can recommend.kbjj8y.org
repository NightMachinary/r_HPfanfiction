I really like stories Harry doesn't go in blind to what his "destiny" like "cant have is both ways" or "Proud Parents" anything you could recommend would be appropriated through


** What have you read already?

He goes in blind the first time in linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter)

If you're into bashy stuff I think the best time travel bashy HHr is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Last Chance)

** I recommend blindness by Angelastarcat. Harry is blinded at birth which makes petunia sympathetic to him so they raise him kindly and the wizards don't think Harry can do magic is he's blind so they cast him aside and somewhere in the process he meets hermione (because there was no one to protect her from the troll). And that's it I won't say anything else, don't want to spoil too much. It's a great Harmony fic, definitely recommend.

** Given the fact that not everyone has read the fics you did and that sometimes multiple stories with the same title exist, it would be helpful if you reformated the "Like fic A" to "Like fic A by B", or even better "Like fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6829556/1/My-Immortal][A]] by [[https://taragilesby.net][B]]"

**** Use square brackets for the text, and round brackets for the link, with no space between them.

For example,

[Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]([[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]])

will result in:

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]]

(Which is a story I favour if you like the Harmony relationship to develop quite slowly and organically.)

That's the one. Also not a fan of Wattpad, since there is so much copied stuff without credits floating around. Nowadays I like Ao3 best, but ff.net is okay too.

  If you are forced to participate in a competition that's reserved for adults only, doesn't that mean you should be considered an adult? Harry gets some much needed help and advice before having some fun by allowing his marauder heritage out to play. H/Hr
