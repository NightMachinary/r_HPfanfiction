  Massively AU. Assume nothing. Harry Potter is born into a very different world than the one in canon. A world where the Greats of history walk among mere men. A world where power is all that matters, and young Harry Potter is a commodity desired by many.

** That definitely sounds like something I would read. It also reminded me of a fic I read where Hufflepuff house secretly trained in like an obstacle course of sorts in Hogwarts (it was pretty badass). I don't remember what it was though and I just searched for ages. Ugh.

** This would also explain the reason some look down on Muggleborns. Because they don't take Sorting and other traditions seriously because they don't understand the significance of them, which is interpreted as insolent behavior.

** That sounds interesting. What happens though,when a child gets sorted into a different House from their family?

Does this child get adopted by a family of that House?
