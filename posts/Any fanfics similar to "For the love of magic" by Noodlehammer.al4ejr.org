It is a Star Wars crossover, though.

****** But the point is that LoM is infamous for its controversial opinions first and foremost (be it on religion or the "role" of women). If you want a harem fic say that and say who do you want involved. If you want a smartass Harry who lacks proper opposition say so. But just "I want something like X" is not very productive.
