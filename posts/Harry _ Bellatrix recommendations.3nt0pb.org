Hello all, I was wondering if you could recommend me something like linkffn(Delenda Est; Para Bellum) i.e. a Harry / Bellatrix fiction with both of them magically powerful.


** linkffn(2896398) Only Enemies is by far the best Harry/Bellatrix story out there. The only problem is that it's abandoned, which is what should have happened to Delende Est after chapter 20.

  Hogwarts Castle decides to change the future by changing the past, bringing together an unlikely pairing separated by time and will set events in motion that will not only radically change the Wizarding World, but their own lives as well. Not Canon compliant. AU, OOC, OC. Some bashing of certain characters.

** I literally just finished reading Delenda Est and it was one of my favorite all time fanfics now. I had never read or had the inclination to read Harry/Bellatrix before but I just stumbled across this story. The idea seemed intriguing, it had time travel and dimension travelling which I had recently come to enjoy stories about so I thought i would give it a try, not expecting much and not sure how Harry and Bellatrix would mash. I strongly recommend this story to all. It has a powerful Harry buy not as ridiculous as some I've seen, it has a slowly building romance, awesome new spells and lots of political intrigue that isn't overdone. It was a long story but not once did I get tired of it. I would have read it in one sitting if I had the time. If anyone decides to give it a shot let me know what you think.
