I actually found it an interesting concept, but it was done terribly. Could you guys recommend any fics that do it better? Thanks.

  Hermione was just a normal girl with an abusive father who didn't care about her. At least that was what she thought until one day she received a letter that said she was a witch.But surprises don't end there. After that, she sees herself being forced to deal with the truth about her real parents, a crazy Azkaban prisioner who's on the loose trying to kill her for some unknown and odd reason, and more. Way, way more.

  Just before midnight on the final day of July, Bellatrix Black gave birth to a child and promptly fled Britain. When the Dark Lord found her at last, he killed her. Then, he turned the wand on the little girl she had been shielding and, with a flash of green light, the Dark Lord unwittingly marked his daughter as his equal.

  Bellatrix gives birth to a daughter after the first wizarding war, without the Dark Lord's knowledge. As Persephone Black grows both sides want her for their own. But nothing is more powerful than A Mother's Love...right? Very slow burner, starts off fairly innocent, lots of character development but a lot of messed up stuff later on.

**** I read one fic where what you said was the whole purpose of a horcrux. That all of Voldemorts attempts to create a horcrux only created cursed objects and only the Accidental creation of the one in Harry allowed him to cheat death.

Originally the first horcrux was used in ancient Egypt where the Pharaoh put a horcrux in his own son and when he was too old, committed ritual suicide and then bonded with the horcrux in the son and killed the host soul. He did that over and over, but eventually made the mistake of the Gaunts and married incestually until a child was born as a squib and wasn't able to hold onto the horcrux and then died.

Voldemort didn't know this and didn't know he could do that as he also thought putting his soul in objects was keeping him alive, so he worked on reviving himself in another way.
