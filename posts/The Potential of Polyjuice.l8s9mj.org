An idea occurred to me today. Has there ever been a fic about a couple who, in an attempt to "spice things up", have the idea to use Polyjuice to turn into each other and have sex?

Obviously, it would be smut and/or crack.

  Severus makes a little extra Polyjuice. Hijinx ensue Rating: MA/NC-17 Warnings: Professors getting it on. Multiple pairings (sort of): f/m, f/f, m/m. Maybe some crackiness around the edges. Oh, and non-con, in a way. Characters: Minerva McGonagall/Severus Snape

  Starts immediately after OoTP. Lord Voldemort is still after the contents of the Prophecy and will stop at nothing to get the information. Harry is grieving over the loss of his godfather, and Hermione must rescue him from his self-imposed exile.

** It's on my Snapefic to-do list. Alas that list is quite long and I haven't actually written it yet.

But he /is/ the potions master, after all. I've also got drafted scenes with a topical Elixir to Induce Euphoria, a highly effective stamina potion, contraceptive, and more.

By Valentine's day I should have a new Snamione published with smut based on their post-war fan mail and easy access to some /enhancement/ potions in the lab ;)

I think the only sex potions in what I've /already published/ are both dubcon in nature. First is my one-shot Snack fic, where Sev is testing his latest innovation on Sirius. In the other one, Ron dosed Hermione with a love potion to spice up their sex life, and she breaks up with him when she figures it out.

Since I'm a touch wary of Rule 8 for the dubcon, I won't link my fics but if you're interested, you can find me by my AO3 pseud jalapeno_eye_popper

TL;DR: sex potions in general are one of my favorite smut devices :):):)
