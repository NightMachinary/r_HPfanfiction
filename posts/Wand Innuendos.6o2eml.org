What are some clever wand innuendos? Wands are such a major part of Wizard culture as are /ahem/ men's wands so I have no doubt that there would be quite a few innuendos.

*** I'm 80% sure that I've read that before. Perhaps I read the story a few years back? Still a good one though.

** Something like this?

#+begin_quote
  "So, as your wand is much more than a tool, you should spend time getting to know it... intimately. You and your wand are learning magic together. It can become a partnership of give and get, where your words of power flow seamlessly through its center to erupt... as a perfect transfiguration or an enduring charm. A wand speaks for you, but it can only feel and translate your intent if you establish a deep and abiding connection with it."

** I suppose there's a lot of 'failure to perform', 'compensating for something', 'not the length but how you wave it', and 'wand in your pocket' jokes to be had. A lot of innuendo can be had just from /how/ things are said or from the situation as it's pretty easy to make a mundane comment about a wand into a phallic metaphor.

*** Instead of fake wands that turn into mice, Fred and George could've made fake wands that look normal except they droop when you try to cast spells with them...

** I remember reading a story where Hermione and Ron had an argument and she told him "oh go polish your wand" without realizing the innuendo. Cannot recall the title, but I got a good chuckle out of her eventual realization.

** I am sorry, I can't not say it. "Is it your wand, or are just happy to see me?"
