As in, a Harry with tons of super-duper powers, but doesn't do stuff like beating the snot out of the Malfoys, sending people to Azkaban, draining Gringotts accounts for random legal violations, doesn't gloat at Voldemort, et-cetera.

Basically, just a super-Harry who is also super-nice to everyone. Using his prodigious powers to give everyone their ideal Christmas present. Making a genuine effort to talk Voldemort into showing some remorse. Being irritatingly cheerful towards Malfoy and Snape, especially when they're rude. That sort of thing.

Its post war where harry defeated voldemort. So not actually pacifist. But in the story itself he acts like you described.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?
