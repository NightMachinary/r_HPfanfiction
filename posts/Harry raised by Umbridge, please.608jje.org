I really want an Umbridge fic where she raises Harry as soon as she finds him at the Dursleys that night. How does he turn out?

Preferences

Umbridge POV mainly. I want the narrative to try to make the reader feel with her.

Parings:

15 points Umbridge: Lockhart

10 points Umbridge: Skeeter

5 points Umbridge: Moody

2 points Umbridge: Doge

1 point Umbridge: OC

No Lord Gryffindor Slytherin Hufflepuff Ravenclaw Peverell Black nonsense. No Goblin heritage nonsense. That is a completed trope.

I want an exploration of Harry if he had her--as she climbs the civil service ranks, starting with principles and trading them when expedient-- raise him instead of Petunia. What would happen? How would her inculcated attitudes change his story, how would she change?

*** That said, the Umbridge one is probably far from the best (of the ones in the story, that is). Personally I am partial to chapter 52.

been a while since I read it, but I remember it to be a fairly interesting story about her gaining custody of Harry when he's around 7 and slowly feeding him her values, all while trying to advance her social status.

*** I just started ch 1. It looks exactly like what I hoped for.

(Umbridge is criminally underused. There are a be be of fics where Lockhart rescues and Skeeter rescues. I wanted this so much!)
