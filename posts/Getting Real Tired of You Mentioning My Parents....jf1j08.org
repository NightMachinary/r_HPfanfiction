*/Tired with everything, Harry decides to leave his stressful job as an Auror to step out of the limelight. However 'someone' attempts to pull the "James and Lily" card on a far from patient man./*

▪︎▪︎▪︎

My parents would be disappointed in me? Why? For "abandoning" my country or screwing over the Ministry?

Mate, there are only two magical skills that require you to be licensed and a certain age. Yet my dad learned both of them years early then never registered, because he didn't feel like it.

And my mum was a Muggleborn raised during a period where half the government were trying to kill her, whilst the other half... wasn't really doing anything to stop them.

Oh! And they both happened to be vigilantes, my mum probably learned some illegal dark magic to save my life and they probably never paid taxes.

I'm pretty sure they'd have been more disappointed that I became an Auror in the first place...

So am I. Honestly, it sounds like Stockholm Syndrome. Working for and taking orders from a government that treated him like shit, and even tried to railroad him through a sham trial because he survived an attack from government-controlled Dementors.

Harry's a super-hero. He'd be minister in no time.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to “Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider”.

****** /Kind of/ Bungle in the Jungle. Harry isn't an official curse breaker himself, but after finding out about the usual manipulative Dumbledore (a trope which I personally hate, but the rest of the fic is so good that I can look past it) bullshit, he runs away, runs into Bill Weasley, who, after learning about the shit Dumbledore did, offers to take Harry with him on his curse breaking trip in Brazil. It's a lot of fun, and I heartily recommend it. (He /does/ learn some curse breaking from Bill over the course of the story, which should fit your query, and they spend a lot of time delving into ancient ruins)

However, a Healer's license isn't a license that allows someone to be able to perform healing magic, it would just be a right to practice. E.g: it would be illegal to open a clinic or work at St Mungos without a license, but it wasn't illegal when Luna fixed Harry's broken nose without one.

I am /entirely/ willing to believe that it'd get /called/ dark magic because it was done by a. a witch of the wrong social class b. a muggleborn and c. outwith the parameters of 'acceptable, decent, respectable' magic.

Magical Britain bears entirely too strong a resemblance to the Muggle Britain of which Vernon Dursley is such a regrettably illustrative example for me to believe that 'dark magic' really means much more than that in the mouths of most of the characters anyway.

/Maleficium/ and 'magic that requires inherently criminal acts' are certainly dark by any reasonable definition, but we're not talking about reasonable people here, are we?

****** There might not really be any elaborate ritual- Lily didn't have time to do one, unless its something she could do in advance and leave sitting there to activate at an indeterminate point in the future. I always thought it was more like Pettigrew's supposed connection to Harry, or wands switching allegiances- something more vaguely defined which just happens if the right set of circumstances occur. Heck, we see a similar magic invoked when Harry sacrifices himself in the wood, and there doesn't appear to be much to it beyond "person (magical person?) is willing to sacrifice themselves to a completely avoidable death to protect others" (its obviously not enough to just die in battle- you have to have had the chance to escape death and chosen not to take it). One can see parallels to Christ sacrificing himself to redeem humanity in Christian mythology- Rowling has described herself as a Christian, albeit obviously not a fundamentalist one.

I do think it makes Lily a stronger character though if it was something she knew about and deliberately invoked. Otherwise, there's no reason for her not to at least try to fight Voldemort, and it makes her a much weaker character who just got lucky.

As to the mechanics of how the magic itself works, that would be something that's probably difficult for an author to describe. In-universe, it would probably something locked up in the "love" room at the Department of Mysteries by the Unspeakables.
