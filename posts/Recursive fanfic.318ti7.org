** I think you might be looking for something like Joe's Sword of the Hero trilogy. Truly one of the best series to grace this fandom.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3994212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-the-Hero][*/Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero/*]] - /The Hero Trilogy, Part One. After the tragedy of his fifth-year, Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts and to a war that will shake the Wizarding and Muggle worlds to their very core. Peace rests on the edge of a sword, and on the courage of Harry alone./
