Someone recently requested Hermione/Fred stories on the sub, and after falling into the hole and binging Falling in Time I have to say I am wholly addicted. So I'm requesting your best Hermione/Fred stories that take place during school years. I'd love some with Fred still in school, but I'm not opposed to after they leave and Hermione is still at school. Rating doesn't matter, though I love smut, which is always better when you're sneaking around to get it. No opposed to Hermione/Fred/George either.

** linkffn(The Arithmancer) has Hermione / George.

What /is/ the difference between the two twins again?

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

*** At the start of year 1? No difference in canon. Actually, I think that's true right up until George loses an ear. They never appear separately, they even have the same Quidditch position, and their own mother can't tell them apart. Fanfics that take a closer look tend to draw distinctions between them, of course.
