There are so many old HP groups on Yahoo Groups, some of them with fanfic that is nowhere else. I see that a few of the still-active ones have plans for how to back up their data and move somewhere else, but many do not.

If you're in any yahoo groups, back them up while you still can!

You can join efforts to back up auto-join/public groups to the Internet Archive [[https://github.com/davidferguson/yahoogroups-joiner][here]]. (This is currently very fandom-centric since we've sent them a priority list of fandom groups.) This one is super easy. Anybody can help. They just need more people.

Info on fandom-specific efforts and backing up less public groups is being coordinated [[https://yahoo-geddon.tumblr.com/][here]].

​

And on a more discussion-y note, what were /your/ favorite Yahoo Groups?

I saved a PDF of the sequel somewhere....

****** Nope, stalled out near the beginning of story #2 (a rather compelling AU where Katie Bell was the Girl Who Lived and Dumbledore had sacrificed himself back in the day to redeem Riddle, who serves as the haunted Headmaster of Hogwarts)

It's all good though, #1 ended really well. It had some of the best action scenes ever written in the fandom, a Voldemort that wasn't 100% crazy but actually had some fairly cunning plans, and a climax involving the Muggle world in ways that I haven't really seen extensively elsewhere

** Man I haven't thought about Yahoo groups in like a decade lol. Pretty sure the last time I used one was when ExcentrykeMuse made hers private in like 2010ish?

​

Crazy shit.

​

I re-read Ivy Kissed every couple of months. I loved that fic lmao. The idea of getting pregnant while under the effect of a Polyjuice potion and getting stuck that way? Is way under used imho. Especially for gender changes.

***** He totally is. I'm writing a long fic right now that really plays up Kreacher as the best for Harry. Honestly though, the house elf was absolutely ancient when he died. (Rowling in an interview joked that when Kreacher died he was 666). He had to be the best elf cause dang he survived how many generations of Blacks?

****** From fandom wiki:

The Enchantment Series --- "A series of short fics centering around otherworldly enchantments."

#+begin_quote
  Thanatos --- Draco/Harry, Draco/Death. Harry dies in the Chamber of Secrets as well as Ginny Weasley. Now, six decades later, Draco is having hallucinations of the boy whose memory has haunted him ever since when Death finally comes to claim him. (Published 14 February 10)

  Swan Song -- A Veela Love Story --- Harry/OMC Veela. AU of fourth year. The night Harry's name comes out of the Goblet, he goes down to the Black Lake where he sees a beautiful mute swan who, unknown to him, is a pure Veela in its natural form. (Published: 11 January 2010; updated 25 January 2010.)

  Vitula: My Beloved -- Harry/Sanguini. AU. On Harry's tenth birthday, a violin calls to him in his dreams. He begins to have nightmares of wizards and magic and soon finds himself the beloved of a vampire.

  Book of Hours --- Harry/James Sirius Potter. Jamie never knew who was his father was, and knew that his mother, Ginny Weasley, had given him away to her brother George. When a stranger enters his life, causing time itself to murmur to him and slow almost completely, all thoughts are wiped from his mind and he falls in love at first sight. Based on the legend of ‘Cupid and Pysche.' EWE. Harry/ James Sirius.

  The White Stag --- Chronicles of Narnia crossover, Harry/Peter Pevensie. When the White Stag is spotted in Narnia, Lucy wishes for cordial, Edmund for Turkish Delight, Susan for a brave husband. Peter's greatest desire remains unspoken---for a boy who will love him and not see the crown on his head.

  To Sleep, Perchance to Dream --- Harry/Barty Crouch Jr.. The fog of the Imperius Curse had kept Barty unthinking for years until, one day, a young boy with bright eyes and black hair changed his world. Harry/Barty Crouch Jr. Ravenclaw!Harry.

  Ink Stained Pages --- Harry/Tom Riddle. AU. Then he did it, setting the nib carefully down and imparting his darkest secret: Perhaps I should have let the hat sort me into Slytherin like it wanted to. Gryffindor friendship is a fickle thing.Harry/Tom. (Published: 05 June 2010; updated 23 June 2010)

  Ivy Kissed --- Harry/Viktor Krum. The only thing that Harry Potter had in common with pureblood ladies was his father's status as a pureblood. But that was before George Weasley got a female's hair for the Polyjuice so Harry could attend Fleur's wedding. Now, he might look like a pureblood lady, but he still isn't one. That won't last long; Viktor Krum and love are worth any sacrifice.

  Llyr: Call of the Sea --- Harry/OMC merman. Harry/Merman. The night he turned eleven, the sea and the waves called to Harry, and he found himself in the arms of the only person to ever love him. Although Hagrid dragged him away, his heart remained with the sea, and he'd do anything to get back to it.

  Changeling --- Harry/Albus Severus Potter, James Sirius/Scorpius. Ginny dies giving birth to Albus Severus. Because of the remnants of the Diary's control, her magic feeds off the baby's magic, trying to keep her alive. It doesn't work. Albus is a Squib. Harry is more horrified that his wife's magic ate his son's than he is that she died. Magic is the most wonderful thing in his eyes; it saved him from hell. So he dedicates his life to loving and caring for Albus, but doesn't spoil him or neglect James Sirius, who also loves his brother. Eventually, Harry finds himself falling for his son, who's never wanted anything but Harry's complete love. (Published 24 July 2011; updated 05 August 2011.)

  Through the Looking Glass --- Harry/Charlus Potter. Blood dripped from his hand, evidence of the quill Umbridge used on him ... but all Harry can do is stare at the reflection shown to him through the Mirror of Erised, wishing, somehow, it could be real. AU. Written for hp_lovealion, Prompt: #22. (Published 05 August 2011.)

  Undrentide --- Harry/Astoria, Draco/Astoria, some Harry/Luna. AU. Chamber of Secrets never happened because Lucius Malfoy never slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's books. Instead, it remained in his library, half forgotten. Voldemort gained a body, as per canon, in Goblet of Fire, and believed that this Horcrux was as safe as any of the others ... Instead, the diary finds its way into the hands of a young witch Draco Malfoy loves, and begins to haunt her dreams where only Harry might be able to save her. Written for Harry Potter Het Big Bang. (Published 21 August 2011.)

  A Rose by Any Other Name --- Harry/Voldemort, Fem!Harry. She did not have a name. Not yet. One had to be given to her. But once, not too long ago, she had been Harry Potter . . .

If you can find a copy of all of them, they're all worth a read in my opinion.
