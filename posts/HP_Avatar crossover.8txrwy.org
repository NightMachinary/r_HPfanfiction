Im looking for somethingto satisfy my current urge concerning elemental bending. Wether its Harry or someone else becoming the Avatar, or just learning to bend in any other way.

Preferably super!maincharacter, 200k+ words. Only completed fics please. :)


** Dude you might want to say Avatar: the last airbender/legend of Korra

For a moment I thought you actually wanted a Harry on Pandora fic, and no, I do not mean a smut fic involving Mrs. Lovegood.

** On AO3, there is the Ninja Wizard series, which is complete, and starting in the third or fourth story, it becomes about Harry spending a year in the Avatar world - it's long and covers the whole show. The rest of the series is then him convincing the magical world to move to the avatar world and become the fifth nation. It's really good, characterization is great, and Harry is more than just an extra, he actually influences the story without taking anything away from the other characters.

** The closes one that I read and you may like is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12232814/1/The-Mysterious-Traveler][The Mysterious Traveler]] by TJ Jordan. Basically teenage Severus Snape got sent to the Avatar world and everyone think he gifted with â€˜spirit powers' similar to the Avatars. It is really well written too, so I would highly recommend it. Though it is around 109,459 words and ongoing.

Also, the problem with your request is the fact there are not that many you can choose from that are long, good, and completed under that crossover. I actually tried looking for this crossover awhile ago as well so I kind of understand how difficult it is.

  After an 'incident' during his sixth year, Severus Snape is transported to another world and is forced into a war that isn't his own. While searching for a way back, Severus journeys down a path of 'self-discovery', forcing him to reflect on his life and question everything he's ever known - 2nd installment to my Severus Snape Series
