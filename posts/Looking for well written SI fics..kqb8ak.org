Lookg for some good SI fics. Last poost i saw regarding that was a year kor two ago, and i find myself wanting more. Recenly read Umbrus Shade, the incredibly annoyed Ravenclaw, and it got me in the SI mood. Any recs appreciated!


** the only SI I like, and one of the best fics hands down, is What's her name in hufflepuff. that one got me into SI, but so far I didn't like any. the closer to a better one is Sunflowers, but there's a lot that I don't like about that one too. mostly the mc. I will try the Umbrus one.

linkao3(22283053) linkao3(24552382)

both of them are still ongoing.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship.

  Once upon a time, a young girl fell into a wishing well.  (Peter Pettigrew was fated to die, and he was bitter about it.) Or:A girl is reborn into the body of Peter Pettigrew. The world of Harry Potter is a slight bit different from what she remembered it was supposed to be. The one in the book didn't have soulmates, after all.

*** Not only do they look like the sun, and track the sun, but they need a lot of the sun. A sunflower needs at least six to eight hours direct sunlight every day, if not more, to reach its maximum potential. They grow tall to reach as far above other plant life as possible in order to gain even more access to sunlight.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27126473]]) Two SIs who are a little older than the trio. Good at avoiding repeating a lot of the canon plot.

linkffn(13195996) SI comes up with some creative solutions.

  The fuckery of Lyra Malfoy and James Stark, two idiots who can't agree on how their thrust into the wizarding world should be handled. Double SI. Co-written with darienqmk.“Of course you'd measure the value of a human being by their ability to get some fake approval points designed to turn children into obedient, unthinking citizens,” James said.Lyra frowned. “What else would I measure a person by?”“There are more important things,” said James. “Like their personal wealth, their talent at tax evasion, and their faith in God.”“What God in particular, James?”“Satan.”

  I am a 18 year old fanfiction writer, schoolkid and computer nerd. I also just woke up in the body of 8 year old Harry Potter. How did I get here? No idea. What am I going to do? Priority one, survive. Priority two, drag this world into the 21st century.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?[ CURRENTLY ON HIATUS ]
