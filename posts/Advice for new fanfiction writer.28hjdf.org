Hello. While reading fanfiction recently, I thought a few times about writing some myself. Before I start writing a (most likely horrible) first fic, I would be very thankful if anyone could give some advice, tips or resources regarding writing (not necessarily fanfiction, but writing in general). I have visited [[/r/writing]] as well, but there are probably some fanfiction-specific mistakes one can avoid, if one knows about them. Thanks very much in advance for your help.

EDIT: Thanks for your responses everyone!


** The key to writing is silencing your inner critique. Most of the time when I'm writing the little bastard will pop up and say that this or that sounds stupid. Ignore them, it indeed may actually sound stupid, but don't worry about that. Write. Later once you've distanced yourself from your work then look at it an revise it.

I would also suggest looking at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1591992/ScytheRider][ScytheRider's Writing Tips]]. They toward the bottom and are really informative and helpful.

*** I agree. Just get it out there, you can come back and edit your story later. That's the only thing that helped me finally get over my chronic procrastination. Trying to stick to a steady update schedule also helps motivation.

*** I second this. It doesn't help overall, but the clich√© of writing while drinking (in moderation) really does work for that. Helps to shut down the part of your brain going "no no no no". If that is a problem, find a way to (safely) get into that zone, the one where ideas flow and you don't take time to analyze them first.

*** Yeah! Kill your inner critique and burn it with fire! Nothing good comes from listening to the little bugger (but of course, you'll have to ressurect him when you edit...)

I'll add that writing FanFiction, you absolutely must strive to write something new, original, that has not been done over and over already. I think that's what people like best about my fics judging by the reviews I get.

Last advice is to just write, and write some more, and enjoy writing as you go!

Good luck!

***** It would be my pleasure!

My story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10073115/1/The-Savage][The Savage]] is the one that gets the most comments of originality, but it's still in progress.

The Savage

AU. After the war, Severus has resumed his life as best he could, taking back his position as potions professor at Hogwarts and Head of Slytherin. Everything is monotonously normal and dull, until a mysterious person saves his life from what he fears most. Now, Severus has a purpose again: discovering who his saviour is, and give him a sever tongue-lashing.

Rated: Fiction T - English - Romance/Mystery - [Severus S., Hermione G.] - Chapters: 10 - Words: 45,035 - Reviews: 113 - Favs: 55 - Follows: 134

Then [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8776626/1/Patronus-Totalus][Patronus Totalus]] was original in some aspects but not as a whole.

Patronus Totalus

AU after Order of the Phoenix. Post Hogwarts. The Order of the Phoenix is sill fighting Voldemort and his Death-Eaters. In a desperate attempt to fight off dozens of Dementors, Hermione creates a new powerful Patronus. Rated T for language. A RL/HG story. Rated: Fiction T - English - Romance/Adventure - [Hermione G., Remus L.] - Chapters: 20 - Words: 75,032 - Reviews: 227 - Favs: 187 - Follows: 230 - Updated: Sep 29, 2013 - Published: Dec 8, 2012 - Status: Complete

And finally, I have a Mary-Sue-but-not-really story, which was more popular than the other two for some mysterious reason.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8348025/1/The-Fairy-Godmothers][The Fairy Godmothers]]

What if Lord Voldemort had attacked immediately after Dumbledore's death? All is lost when Hermione is mysteriously sent back in time to the Marauders Era, where she discovers she has surprising new powers. Lots of friendship, romances and surprises! A HG/SS story with a twist of RL.

** Fanfiction specific advice: Get the names right. Nothing will infuriate a dedicated fan more than if they're yanked out of a story because the writer keeps using Voldermort or MacGonall.

Here's a writing 'hack' in case a word keeps tripping you up- use a substitute while you're writing, then use Ctrl-H to find-and-replace your short word for the right one when you go back to edit. I do this for Quidditch [qdt ], McGonagall [McG ], and Dumbledore [Abd ]. Just make sure you remember to do the substitution before you post!

** Read what you write. If you don't like what you're reading, then you screwed up. Throw that away and try again, until it is something /you/ would want to read.

Reread some professional published writer whose work you like. You know, the one who wrote that one book you've read twenty times? Copy their style, but add in your own touch until it feels right for you. You aren't meeting a page count or word count for some assignment. You're writing something that should meet your own personal standards for quality entertainment. So make sure you've done that by reading what you wrote.

As a writer, sometimes I think this is the only thing I'm good at. I miss spelling and grammar mistakes, misuse words, and screw up formatting. But I always read what I've written many, many times before posting. And what I write I enjoy reading. My work also seems to hold together as fiction better than the work of the vast majority of my amateur peers.

Proofreading is your new god. Pray to it every day.

It will make the single biggest difference to the overall quality of your writing. Do a first draft all the way through, or as far as you can in one go. Then read it and correct. Repeat until publishing deadline or it shines like a perfect little angel -- one that you'll want to strangle by this point. Then read it all from the start again and more corrections, damn the deadline.

Rewrite the parts you don't like. But just those parts. Less is more, so maybe just delete those bits you don't absolutely love on an "nth" reading. They'll be there, trust me. Did you write something that was really cool sounding when you wrote it, but seems long and boring the second time through? Cut it.

Then read the chapter backwards, by major section. Read every paragraph as usual, but from the end to the start of the chapter. Read sentences backward. Find what works, but have your eyeballs on the things you wrote for as long as possible.

--------------

You have change controls on in your LibreOffice or Word, right? Turn that on. You'll never accidentally lose text in a chapter again. Just make sure to save a "clean" copy as .odt for uploading to FFN, or however you do it. Use /free/ Google Drive or Amazon Cloud to save synced backups, and even losing your laptop won't lose you your /precious/.

--------------

Then, at the moment of truth, right before posting, read it all again, beginning to end.

I /try/ to make sure I'm able to read the entire chapter from start to finish once without finding a single mistake before posting, but I honestly can't always do that. But it helps to approach it like that.

Good luck, and have fun with your writing.

--------------

Oh! And don't tell people it is your first fic when you publish. You can ask for constructive criticism, but don't prime people to find imaginary style faults in a first time writer's work. Your style is your own, don't let people tell you something "isn't done" stylistically. Be polite to people suggesting grammar and spelling fixes, but don't let anyone bully you into thinking you should write a different way. Accept writing tips gracefully, but make actual changes to how you write based on what you think is good.

Remember, you are writing something you'd want to read. So, if someone says no one likes a particular way of telling a story, you already know they are wrong. Because you like it.

*** Very sound advice, and I agree with it-- but I would caution on /too much/ proofreading. I have gotten caught up in proofreading so much that when I open a fanfic with full intentions to begin writing that new chapter, I instead start reading over and over what I've already written, looking for those mistakes, or changing words here and there in an effort to achieve a better flow. It can slow you down considerably.

Perfection is a great goal, but at some point you have to let it go.

**** Gotta have a plan. Write drunk, edit sober, for example. But yeah, know what you are sitting down to do, and make writing different from editing and proofing in your planning and approach.

I like to read on a different device, my tablet, and only write on my laptop. I also don't let myself read AND correct at the same time. I keep a list of all the areas with mistakes, a text file with the the word or phrase that was wrong pasted in, then I go to the laptop to fix them all at once, finding them again by those snippets. Keeps that creeping edit cycle from happening.

** Write and re-write. NEVER go with the first thing that comes to mind, you're inevitably going to look back on it later and hate it. Use a drafting process. I write long-hand and then transcribe everything into a word doc, which I then edit down even more. Then I have a beta go through and hash it further before I have a final draft. Writing is process. Don't feel pressured to throw something up online simply because it's a fleshed out story. You'll know when it's finished.

Grammar is God. If you think you know that you're using a word appropriately, double check. So many fanfiction authors use big words improperly and it throws the whole piece off. You think you sound witty; you end up sounding like a kid with a thesaurus and a lack of education. Look up how to quote dialogue correctly, and make sure that your characters are using a dialect appropriate to their world. Someone in the 19th century isn't going to be calling a younger person "kid", that's a goat. Interjecting slang or verbiage that doesn't mesh with a character is off-putting and a mark of poor writing.

If you think it sounds cliche or purple prose; it is. If you think that your plot is campy; it is. If you think that you're using the your/you're/lose/loose wrong; you are. Second guess yourself. That's pretty much the best advice I have.

** Something I am bad about is picking a genre and sticking to it.

If you want to write romance, then write romance. If you want to write action/adventure then do so. If you want to follow a single character then do so.

If you want to write an EPIC though... don't fall into the trap many of us have done.

First step is to write a plot out line, this can be overarching and envelope all characters and all plot devices as well as all relationships.

Then break that down into your action/adventure plotline only. If need be and the characters will be separated, then write an outline for each characters journey.

Then write the outline for your romance. If there is more than one romance, then you need a separate one for each.

Now try to layer these together in one massive outline so you know when characters will interact, what dangers they will face separately or together, and where the romance fits in so that it feels believable.

My biggest problem is letting the story get away from me until I don't recognize the current product from my original thoughts.

That does NOT mean you can't let the story grow organically. If two characters suddenly seem right for each other based on what you have written then do not force them to be with other people. If someone has to die based on the situation you have created, then you might just have to let them die (or rewrite to stop it). If you try to force your original thought onto a growing story then you will end up pulling a lot of unbelievable stuff out of your arse.

It is harder and easier to write fanfiction, because you get immediate feedback. But that feedback may lead you to change the story and next thing you know your muse decides she's had enough and takes a vacation.....

Not that I know anything about that... Nicky is around here somewhere with the rest of chapter 29 of 'Hogwarts Shuffle!'.....

** - Avoid over-explaining emotions in the narrative. If it is crucial to describe something going on in a character's head, try and work it into the dialogue instead.

/Not so great:/ "Is something wrong?" asked Hermione, because she was worried there was something not right about the situation before her.

/Better:/ "Is something wrong? I've been worried all day," said Hermione.

- When you think you might be too wordy, you probably are. A good rule of thumb: If you were telling this story out loud, would you still load your sentences with all those words?

- Before you publish, get a beta. A beta is someone who is part reader, part editor. A beta will help correct spelling, punctuation and grammar, and will also catch little errors. This subreddit is a great place for finding betas.
