[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3669651/9/Carry-On][Carry On by teenlaunch]] One of my favourite stories of all time. If anyone has read any similar stories, I would love to hear about it. Totally recommend it.


** Is this complete? I'm excited to read something new! I will have to go through my history and find the fun marauders era fic I read a couple of months ago!

*** No, sadly it's incomplete and hasn't been updated since 2015. I really wish it was complete though, the story is so good. Probably the best marauders time travel fic I've read. I'd love to hear about the story you read.
