It's really surprising that we don't see more of this in stories considering that becoming rich is one of the first thing we think upon hearing of time-travel. I'm talking about going back in time and putting a winning lottery ticket somewhere past you is going to find. Going back in time some hundred years to take world-famous art and selling it for entire fortunes, taking some treasure that was supposedly destroyed and taking it back with you, or even taking an extinct or in risk magical creature that produces rare potion ingredients (like re'ems) and making your own farm. The sky is the limit.


** I think once you have a time-turner, using it for something as frivolous as money seems kind of pointless. The time-turner gives power without the intermediary of money.

*** It would be true if we are working with the Cured Child brand of time-turner. If we are working with the cannon time-turner thought you can't alter story to the point of causing differences in your own past, it would therefore take away many possibilities.

**** Betting on sporting events doesn't change the timeline. Of course, there's always the possibility that the game will not end how you think it will because of chaos theory.

Playing the stock market, if done judiciously, won't necessarily change the stock prices.

(Also, as I saw in one time travel fic, make sure you get and study a copy of the NEWT tests for the target year.)

***** Now this is what I'm talking about!! You have freaking TIME-TRAVEL it is not only your right but also your duty to abuse it dry any and every way you possibly can and then invent some others to abuse it even more!

We always see the angst ball character going back in time to save the world or to get together with another character that is like a tenth of their actual ages, where are the smart ones that are looking at it the right way and taking everything not nailed down and at least half of what is. Where are the clever thieves who go back, take an extinct animal and then sell for astronomical prices, where are the too smart for their own good children who suddenly discover that yes, they actually can have a pet T-Rex?
