I remember reading this Snarry fic where Harry is pretty powerful and travels back in time and rescues the Potters. It was a really enjoyable read, especially since the author wrote Lily Potter with flaws (She was jealousy of Harry and Severus relationship) instead of writing her all perfect.

I was wondering if there are any other stories like that. Where basically Harry saves himself and his parents. Or Him traveling during back in time/alternate where the Potters are still alive. He can be powerful, MOD, or just lovable old Harry. It be a long fix, short, or heck I can take incomplete fics. I just need Harry traveling places to bring me confomfort during my writers block.


** Okay, this is a long fic and it doesn't look like it at first but it is time-travel Harry. And it's great. Also it's over a million words so it'll keep you busy for a minute. linkao3(11284494)

** These aren't specifically about the Potters but are time travel fics that might be of interest.

Basilisk Born linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born]])

Gelosaþ in Écnesse linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10712904/1/]]) Harry travels back to the Founders' Time and spends some years there before traveling back to the present.

The Wizard from Earth linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8337871/1/The-Wizard-from-Earth]]) Harry is sent back to Ancient Egypt. Abandoned.

A Long Journey Home linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home]]) Jasmine Potter gets sent back in time, story jumps around between different time periods telling different plots. Incomplete.

** Somebody's already recced Of a Linear Circle, which I heartily endorse.

Here's an author who has done five different time-traveller Harry stories, conveniently saved as a series even though the stories are not linked: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1003017][Harry in Time - Variants on a Theme]] by LindaJenner.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4167129][The Games They Play]] by DebsTheSlytherinSnapeFan and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15375369][A Brand New Start]] by Faewm have the ever-popular Harry-raises-himself trope. Neither managed to save the parents, although Faewm has an abandoned sequel where they try again: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22140478][This Time the Potters]].

In the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622538][Travel Secrets]] series by e4mj, the Potters are still alive (faked their deaths), which Harry finds out before time-travelling. Two complete and one unfinished stories.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2060][Escaping the Paradox]] by Meri and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10140137][Tapestry of Fate]] by Minxie are my go-to "Harry goes back to marauder-era" fics. Both have at least one parent saved.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125771][Ah, Screw It]] by mjimeyg and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/209494][Xerosis]] by Batsutousai both add sci-fi elements to the basic time-travel story.
