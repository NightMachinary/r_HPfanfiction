  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** There are quite a few fics that have Harry delving into dark magic, but more intimate explorations of /what/ dark magic actually is (regardless of the world-building) are much rarer. I'll try to give some of the better examples or at least more interesting ideas:

- linkffn(12723942): Out of the Night is more of a world-building of dark wizards than anything else, but you can't deny its more fleshed out yet reasonable than 95% of what comes out of fanfiction.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived): solid chance you've read this one, but some of the more detailed mechanics of dark magic are handled fairly well and with a more academic touch. It doesn't go the route of "all harmful magic is dark magic," but rather its the intent behind the magic itself that makes something the Dark Arts.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): in many ways the antithesis of HP and BWL, but it goes into quite a depth with its exploration of dark magic, though admittedly this is a fic I enjoy more for the world-building and unique storylines than magical exploration.
- linkffn(Lesser Evils): more of a focus on the brutality of dark magic, this fic nevertheless goes into fair detail showing the Dark Arts.

There is probably more, but those come off the top of my head.

  After 5th year, Harry takes charge of his own life. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war, and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Long, slower-paced fic. Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, NOT Evil!Harry, No Romance. -ABANDONED-

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Dark magic, Death Eaters, politics - and in the middle of it all, Harry Potter. Tested against enemies old and new, he learns that power requires sacrifices; revenge, doubly so. Book One of Dark Triad Trilogy.

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE
