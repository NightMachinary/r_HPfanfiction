** The stories where Harry's looks are focused on (other than his resemblance to his parents) are all romance/smut focused fics. Are you looking for a romance fic where Harry is unattractive, or just a fic that doesn't obsess about his 'dishevelled hair' and 'emerald orbs'?

** Linkffn(Fantastic elves and where to find them)

Harry is a crazy kid who prefers to sleep in a tree in the forbidden forest instead of the dorms, is utterly convinced that he's an elf, makes weird trade deals, even with the minister, and just randomly disappears for months.

#+begin_quote
  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
