:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've read this fanfic just a few months ago, but can't remember it much cause due to reading far too many fics. Here are some points I remember:

Harry is secretly friends with a girl, which may or may not be Voldemort's daughter. He kept this friendship a secret from Ron and Hermione.

On 3rd year, Harry's boggart in Lupin's class is a girl speaking in parseltounge. The boggart is taunting Harry, but no one else except for Harry understands it. The taunts from the boggart is something like "I would no longer be your friend", and other insults.

Later, Hermione asks why Harry's boggart is a girl speaking parseltounge, and Harry just made excuses. Forgot the exact excuse, but Harry might have said that he fears anyone speaking parseltounge.

I already searched through many Harry/Delphi and Harry/Voldemort's Daughter fics to no avail. Also searched for HP fanfics using the keywords harry's boggart is a girl but tough luck too.


** The only example I can think of is my fic, Departure from the Diary, where Harry's boggart is Tam Riddle (a female version of Tom Riddle), who taunts him about their similarities in parseltongue.

****** It was supposed to be a two word first name that the nurses mistook for a portmanteau name. Here's the relevant excerpt from chapter 18:

#+begin_quote
  “My mother wanted to name me ‘Tom Marvolo Riddle', after my father and her father.” She shudders at the thought. “Thank gods that never came to pass, though not for a lack of trying. The Nurses refused her attempts to name a girl ‘Tom'. She then tried to have me named ‘Tam Lin Merope Riddle'. Tam Lin was a character in a Scottish ballad of the same name.”

  “And the nurses mistook it for the name Tamelyn?”

  She nods. “They thought it was a combination of ‘Tam' and ‘Evelyn'.”

****** It's a "the people who delivered her didn't understand what Merope wanted to name her situation and stuck her with Tamelyn" instead of the name she actually wanted, which was Tam Lin.

*** This might be it. Also contains the scene with Hermione grilling Harry about his boggart, and Harry keeping Tam's presence a secret. Can't believe I've missed it. I've actually passed this title (along with Scrambled Sorting and Unseen Perspective) when I'm skimming through my history, but immediately dismissed it since I'm convinced the girl is Delphini and not Voldy herself lol.

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.

  Dumbledore was surprised when Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived, came to Hogwarts. He expected a saviour, what he got was a damaged boy who has no interest in playing hero for anyone. What does Harry want? He wants to be left alone. Will have my own characters starting from chapter 26. Dumbledore, Hermione, select Weasley bashing. Dark/grey, strong, intelligent Harry.Harry x Fleur.
