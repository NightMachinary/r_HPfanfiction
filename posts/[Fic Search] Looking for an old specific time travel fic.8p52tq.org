Can anyone help me find an old Harry Potter fic that used to be on fanfiction.net?

It was a GOF au where Harry attempts a dangerous spell for one of the tasks and ends up sort-of going back in time to Marauder era. But instead of physically traveling back in time, only his mind/consciousness goes back. At one point he was in Snape's head, another point in Peter Pettigrew's or Sirius, etc. I remember there were time skips, like for Harry it would seem like only a few moments would pass, but for Snape/Peter/Sirius/etc months would have passed before the 'mysterious voice' came back.

I remember it wasn't super friendly to James+Sirius, and Harry ended up befriending Snape + Peter more. It had a very sympathetic portrayal of young Peter.

I think the title started with a C but I really can't remember.


** I know the exact one you mean, forgotten the name of it completely. Harry uses some soul destroying curse on Voldemort in the graveyard, it was very similar to Avada Kedavra but the second word was changed in some way I have forgotten. Snape realises later on what he has done, and there is a whole lot of Harry bouncing between past and present in peoples heads. If I find it I will edit this.
