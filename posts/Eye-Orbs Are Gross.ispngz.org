It tickles me how we all seem to agree that describing eyes as "orbs" is awful and shouldn't be done.

But I did it today when I wrote this:

"Tonks' eyes went wide. Extra wide. Bugging out in a way that only a metamorph's can. It was kind of gross, actually, seeing so much of the white orbs."

O_O

*** Thanks these are awesome!

In this case though I think I will leave it. In the scene, Tonks is having a visceral reaction to some disturbing news, and the POV character is literally seeing her eyeballs bug out. If my readers have a disgust response from the word 'orbs' then that kind of works for me lol.

**** Very true. It does add to the story, in your case. :)

** Using "orbs" instead of "eyes" reminds me of roleplaying on Proboards back in 2008. lol For the most part, I don't actually see this often, and I'm glad that seems to have died off a lot. I think it probably stems from teachings to avoid too much repetition (avoiding "said", using physical descriptors instead of repeating Harry/he/him all the time, etc.), but sometimes ahh... using the thesaurus is not the right call. :P
