Does this Harry Potter Fanfiction have a Harry/Hermione romance pair? It's my favorite and I feel like it's going in a Harry/Draco direction after reading 7 chapters. I mean it was written in A/N that it could be a Draco mpreg one. Sooo please help.


** No pairings. Characters are 11 year-olds for God's sake and the story covers only first year. The sequel linkffn(Significant Digits) was moving towards Hermione/Cedric. No pairing for Harry.

  (Continuation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) It's easy to make big plans and ask big questions, but harder to follow them through. Find out what happens to Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, Hermione, Draco, and everyone else once they grow into their roles as leaders, leave the shelter of Hogwarts, and venture out into a wider world.
