** Not quite a fidelius but Harry does end up creating a "fake Earth" to help protect the Earth from alien attack. Takes a while, more then 20 chapters in, to get to that point though. linkffn(9443327)

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.

**** It is, especially the first five to ten chapters as things get started. After that it seems to start moving towards a distant outlook with plans and plots that might not be finished till 5-10 more chapters down the road. Good thing is the author is still updating and doesn't seem to be slowing down so the story should actually get to a point of completion.

** Is it ever established what happens to someone who finds themselves inside a Fidelius without knowing the secret? Because I can imagine that causing some problems.

  A Harry Potter cursed with immortality must not only survive the ravaging of Earth by monsters far more powerful than any humanity has encountered, but he must rise to save it, and in the process exact one wizard's revenge against the Galactic Empire.
