Hi. I hope you can help me, I'm looking for a fic where the main couple is Fred / Hermione. I don't remember very well, but it seems to me that Hermione and George manage to revive Fred, I can't remember if it was with a potion or that, but Fred doesn't remember anything and little by little he falls in love with Hermione. God, I wish I could remember more. But I read it so long ago and then I didn't find him again :(, I don't even remember if it was in Spanish or English.

  Hermione Granger. Wasn't she meant to be Ron's girlfriend or something? Weren't they meant to have the fairy-tale ending? She was surely more a sister than a lover, right? That's what Fred Weasley thought before realising five years of his life were erased from his memory -- five years of his life that was spent with her. Rated M for the brief smut that may entail in future. R&R :)

**** No, I think that is not it. Although I gave it a read and it looks pretty pretty, it's a shame that it's not finished :( at least it would have stayed in a good part, but no. The one I'm looking for is definitely complete, and now a scene comes to mind, they are skating. I think? I dont know !. And it's not that Fred had an accident, he hit himself and lost his memory. The fic I remember literally revived him after he died in the battle of Hogwarts. (Not exactly at that time, maybe a few days later) I wish I could remember more: '(. Thanks anyway, you shared a beautiful fic, but as I said, it's a shame it's not over.
