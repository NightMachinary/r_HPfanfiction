** I find such ships like Hermione, a teenage girl, being paired with, say, Lupin or Snape as creepy -- same deal with Harry with Snape and Voldemort -- because of the huge age gaps. But, do I consider the average readers/writers of such things P's? No. Terrifying fangirls, yeah, but not P's.

That is, not unless there's a subtext to the story from the author that sets off warning bells (to keep a long story short, I actually stumbled across a story in the Harry/Luna category where the author was either a P or a *very good* method actor/writer, as they self-torturedly described "Harry's" attraction to eleven year old girls in a very poetic way. Yeah, no. I closed that shit in disgust after realizing what the fuck it was and reported it. It was gone the next day after I checked to see if my report did anything. Looks like the FFn staff *do* listen, if there's the threat of law being involved).

Anyway, Americans have this weird cultural view about sex and age-gaps: most of the UK's and other countries' views would cause them to have aneurysms, lol.

For example, I was on the verge of dating this Aussie bird when I was 17 and she, 23. The only thing that stopped us from meeting up was my own shitty health and the typical long-distance issues. We eventually lost contact, but I always wonder what happened to her.

Other friends of mine met their future spouses when they were 16/17 and their future spouses, like 21/22: they've all been happily married for well over a decade now with 2.5 children.

Hell, my own mother met my dad when she was 17 and he was like 21, and they've been happily married for fucking decades and have two kids and over four dogs out of it (myself included -- the kids I mean, not the dogs, lol).

So, yeah. Tonks hitting on a 16 or 17 year old Harry or Fleur doing the same at 17 to a 14/15 Harry doesn't make me blink all that much. Hell, they're favorite ships of mine.

A 13 year old Harry being seduced by a 30-odd Rita Skeeter, for example? Yeah, *that'd* make me go "what the ever-loving fuck", as would a 14 year old Harry and a canon aged Gabrielle (since, you know, she's goddamn *8* in GoF) -- unless it's a fucked up subversion like that grim-dark fic "Playmate".

Context and cultural views. British culture and society isn't American culture and society.

No, I'm not defending P, as I'm sure some overreacting people will cry, but I /do/ criticize primarily American hypersensitivity ("They're 17! They're just a baby, just like that 11 year old-- oh wait, they turned 18 a week ago? Meh, they on the "the Hub", Instagram, or the local strip club?") towards sex and age, and that's what influences a lot of the HP fandom because the bulk of fans are Yanks.

For Christ's sake, I saw an American woman shrieking at this guy (it was one of those videos that narrates stories from Reddit) in a YouTube video comment section: he was 19, his girlfriend was 16 or 17, I think?, and they had an argument. He was asking for the best way to apologize or if he should break up with her manipulating ass. She was calling him a P/sex-offender... because of a two/three year age gap.

Yeah. sigh

** You're not wrong.

People are too eager to score imaginary points. Fanfiction is allowed to be 'problematic', it's allowed to have age gaps and pair characters with shitty people.

You're allowed to write rape, torture, incest, child abuse, power dynamics, racism, sexcism, various phobias etc even pedophilia without being any of those things yourself.

I've written rape scenes before, they were actually pretty cathartic to write as I was sexually abused by my stepfather for several years

Just because people write about awful things doesn't make them awful. It makes them a writer.

Even then I saw a fic where a cartoonishly bashed Severus Snape was repeatedly sexually brutalized by the protagonists, but since it was meant to be “funny” (and I guess because Snape's an asshat) nobody cared.

Mignonnes (the title 'Cuties' was a real misfire imo, it doesn't really capture the sense of the word) features girls dancing, copying the pop singers they see on tv. This happens, in countries all over the world. It was even in Mean Girls, briefly!

The poster and promotional material brought attention to it, yes, but I'm pretty sure the controversy would've still been there, just not to this extent. The marketing material shone a spotlight on it.

I write it short-hand and everyone knows what I'm talking about when I use P in a post's context. What, should I start writing Laughs Out Loud or Rolls On Floor Laughing in full, instead? Or write Harry Potter/Fleur Delacour instead of HP/FD? Stop being pedantic.

But when those people were all raised in the same culture that ascribes sexuality and sexification to everything related to nudity or the body - including e.g. the very act of being nude, breastfeeding, even something like school age girls daring to /wear shorts/, then I think that has to be taken into consideration when considering how unconnected they are.

That said, this sub has a history of not permitting "anything goes" but rather enforcing politeness - see rules 2 and 3 against hateful speech and personal attacks. So I do think there's a good argument that consistent moderation would require preventing /all/ personal insults and attacks.

Honks is probably one of my favorite ships.

Regardless, though, I'm not sure how I feel on the topic as a whole. I don't think reading fanfiction where two intimately-linked characters with a significant age gap necessarily makes you prone to pedophilia anymore than a story about Harry murderhobo'ing every bad guy in Britain makes someone prone to murder.

It's important to note that these types of fics should /not/ be posted here, however, regardless of anyone's opinion. It's against the rules of this subreddit and against the rules of Reddit as a whole. If the moderation team let it slide, we'd be on the fast track to having the subreddit banned. That's just how it goes.

I don't think we should be using the word pedophile to describe someone who likes these fics, though. No matter how solid your argument that the writing is describing grooming characteristics, it's still /fiction/. Violent video games do not make people violent.

#+end_quote

I think this is my biggest issue with the current fandom discussion of age gaps and fics containing underage characters. It just feels like a rehash of when people were calling everything abuse. It just feels like we're watering down really heavy words that have significant meaning.

It also feels like a cheap, name-calling cop-out. "Yeah well if you don't wholly agree with what I'm saying, then you're a pedophile!!!!" isn't the most conductive response to a discussion. Personally... I do not feel like "problematic" media like this is in and of itself harmful. If the issue is that young people are reading this and taking their social cues from fanfiction, then we should be doing more to stop them reading it. Stick a disclaimer on them. Make it strictly 18+ content. Address the actual issue instead of campaigning for the impossible goal of preventing people from ever writing it in the first place.

Personally, I don't particularly go for ships with age gaps. I have no interest in going out of my way to ship an adult with a minor. But, I do have some ships that fall into questionable areas. A lot of times it's about me really liking the characters and how they go together. I'm well aware that if this were a Real Life Situation things would probably go very wrong, but this is fiction! We can bend the rules all we want to say "I like these two characters together and I'll warp the entire world around them to bring them together and make them happy."

What we /really/ need to target in addition to properly labelling and flagging works is how fans interact with each other. We need to emphasize holding adult fans responsible for how they interact with younger fans and do our best to educate younger fans (and internet users in general) on dangerous signs to watch out for when communicating online. Fanfiction isn't meant to teach younger fans life lessons, and even then... like... you can't ignore the fact that kids and teens just don't know things. They don't have experience. It's not problematic fanfiction that made you a target to groomers in fandom.

It just feels people are blaming the wrong thing for an existing issue... and that getting rid of this ~problematic material~ won't actually do anything to solve the problem.

***** Yes - because patriarchal structures socialise people into very rigid gender expectations that are harmful to all genders.

Specifically, when it comes to sex, our culture perpetuates the idea that women are sexual objects, while men are sexual subjects.

Men are viewed as the actors in sexual encounters, and women are not. Thus, it is portrayed as mad to talk of women sexually exploiting or assaulting men, in the same way it would be portrayed as mad to talk of a bed or lamp sexually exploiting or assaulting a man.

Similarly, as the other commenter has said, men are expected to be hyper-sexual beings. Virility and sexual appetite are virtually synonymous with being masculine, hence suggesting that a boy or young man be unwillingly to participate in a (heterosexual) sexual encounter is seen as a flaw.

This is why when news breaks of statutory rape by female teachers of male students, comments inevitably crop up by (often) older men saying that the kid is "lucky", and "living every guy's fantasy", and how they'd "have loved it" if it was them.

It's a mistake to think that patriarchy is harmful only to women and girls. It hurts all humans by restricting their freedoms of self-exploration and expression.

As per their definition, I'm not suggesting that one doesn't matter because other is worse. I'm explaining why the comment is reacting more to one then the other, because one /is/ worse. It's normal /and/ logical to have stronger reaction to worse things. That doesn't mean lesser things don't matter or are good as you incorrectly inferred from my comment.

And no, I was pretty clear as I quoted exactly what I was replying to. Any good/bad attribute you deduce from it is on you, I was only explaining the difference not where the scale starts.

The person you were originally replying to said that honks is one of their favorite ships, which implies that their reaction to those types of ships is that they don't matter or are good. You were saying that's logical because one is worse than the other.

If you disagree with the person you were replying to about that type of thing being good, you were unclear about it.

** Naive characters are fine, authors less so. Write underage romance, write whatever messed up thing you like... But then have awareness of what you're doing. It's okay to write rape, less so to have rape in your story and not understand that you do.

Freedom to do what you like comes with the responsibility to understand what you are communicating. A character can accept pedophilia, an author cannot.

If you're saying that people have been misidentified as pedophiles because of their subject matter, fair. Subject matter should not be determinative. If you're saying we can't call a spade a spade when pedophilia is naively accepted in the story, I don't agree.

Granted, I would feel someone out, writing is difficult, things can get miscommunicated. I would want to know if a reader got the impression that I accepted pedophilia.

** Okay, a few things to cover here:

1. We really need to draw a distinction between "underage" and "age gap", because a lot of people are conflating the two, and that's a problem. The issue with pedophilia is not that there is an "age gap"- its that one of the people involved is an adult and another is a child who is not old enough to consent. In the past, I have seen people who would argue that, say, a thirty year old and a forty year old is just as bad as a 20 year old and a 10 year old because its the same age gap, and that's fucking insane. It shows a complete failure to understand the importance of consent.
2. With that in mind, my view is that, theoretically, Harry/Tonks where both are adults would be fine, but Harry/Tonks where Harry is underage would be pedophilia.
3. It is perfectly legitimate for an author to write about abuse so long as they are portraying it /as/ abuse, and not excusing it, or depicting it gratuitously or for the purposes of romance/porn/titillation.
4. I have not read the thread to which the OP refers, but speaking generally, there IS a disturbing strain of pedophilia and pedophile apologism in a lot of online fanfic communities (as there is in most facets of society, to one degree or another, see the Republican Party, the Catholic Church, Hollywood, etc). It is particularly troubling given that many of those who write and read fanfic are minors themselves, and are therefore being exposed to this ugly and dangerous underbelly of fandom. It should be called out, and yet when it is, it seems that there is always a group of people that jumps up to accuse the critics of being prudes, censors, etc. I certainly hope that the moderators of this sub will push back against that bullshit, because I could not otherwise continue to post here.

Edit: Having read through the thread, and having seen that the bulk of the comments here appear to be defending, to one degree or another, pedophilia, I feel I have no choice but to terminate my participation in this sub. I don't know if this discussion is reflective of the views of the group as a whole, or simply who is being most vocal in this thread, but I cannot and will not affiliate with a sub where such views are widely accepted.

** I am just now seeing this when clearly it was aimed at my post about age gaps from earlier this week. No one is calling you a pedophile. I didn't call you a pedophile in my post and I didn't see anyone else make the accusation. I did say that when an adult has sex with a child (which is depicted in many fan fictions) that it is pedophilia, which is true.

Now, as someone who has literally lived that scenario in real life, I feel like I have the right to say that I am not comfortable with that. In fact, anyone can be uncomfortable with it if that is how they feel. So with that being said, I obviously do not read those types of fan fiction.

I literally posted about how unrealistic fan fiction can be with age gaps, not talking about pedophilia at all, but somehow my post became about that.

For real though, we don't need to be defending pedophilia, but I guess to each their own.

I was one of the people who got called "fucking disgusting", among other things, merely for pointing out that if you call everyone who ships something you don't like a pedo, it makes it harder to spot actual pedos in the community.

For the record, I ship nothing and I hardly ever read romance fics, so I wasn't even defending a ship, just explaining how the behaviour can be harmful to actual kids, not fictional characters.

That said? Stories that have an adult character twice their age or more trying to start a relationship with a pre-teen are writing about grooming. Textbook grooming, when said adult has authority over the child, like a teacher, caregiver, or religious or secular authority.

Tonks being a cop who's 7 years older than Harry, trying to ship the two while he's in school is creepy.

***** I respect your opinion that a large age gap is weird. 90 percent of the time I would agree. But in fanfiction you can take a more lenient stance on morality etc. I'm of course not advocating outright and excessive law breaking, especially when it deals with such a controversial and really awful topic matter, ie CSE, however for many (including me), fanfiction is a form of escapism. I cant say it is the same for everyone, but particularly 2 to 3 years ago when I was going through a rough patch, I clung to fanfiction as something to escape my every day problems. Sometimes that escapism does involve morally grey and sometimes morally wrong things. Would I ever consider paedophilia, sexual harassment, rape, murder, drug use, torture, etc. in my daily life? Of course not! I like to believe that I can separate what is right and wrong, and therefore read material with "wrong" situations in it. I dont want to bang on about this much longer but I will give you an extreme. On AO3 there is a series of fics about actual awful incestual paedophilia. It is bad and I feel shame admitting that I have read it. However, the fact that I read it does not mean I am a paedophile. I was curious and now I hate that I was curious. I am not saying avoid anything morally wrong, but I would say without hesitation that there is material that tackles morally wrong situations, and material that endorses and glorifies it. Those fics are an example of the latter. They are wrong. Honks to me is one of the former; it is a but "spicy" and a little morally grey, but it is exploring the dynamics of that sort of relationship. I have read many Honks fics that really develop the problems of society endorsed marriage and relationships - exploring the moral and social problems that they create. Tl;dr some fics are wrong. I wish they didnt exist but they do and it is every individual's right to dislike them and not read them. Some fics explore things that are "grey" or that bend the rules of the real world. If you can safely identify that there is a difference, I see no problem with you reading them out of curiosity or enjoyment.

Thanks for indulging my mini rant - I have thankfully never experienced any form of paedophilia irl, but I know my father dealt with many such cases during his time as a lawyer. Paedophilia is (in my opinion) the worst kind of crime - intentional paedophilia is far worse than murder to me. Please take everything I say with a pinch of salt - I am here to find some new fics and be a part of a great community. I dont often engage in these sort of conversations. Read safely!
