Possibly crack, or something where he employs a really weird form of Occlumency to keep the hat out.

  A mild send-up on a popular genre of Harry Potter fanfiction. As much as I enjoy them, some practical considerations come to mind. Inevitably, Harry has one specific ally in all those fics ... but what if that entity took a different view on things?

** In [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][Enter The Dragon]], Harry has (due to circumstances) spoken with the Sorting Hat several times before officially starting Hogwarts.

When the Sorting Hat is finally placed on Harry's head (part 2.3), the instant reaction is the Hat swearing in shock for the first time in living memory as he had been unaware that Harry was not what he seemed.

Edit - In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230151/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Hermetic-Arts][Harry Potter And The Hermetic Arts]], Harry becomes paranoid about the possibility of having his thoughts forcefully modified and so uses a tattoo to help him shield his mind. The Sorting Hat cannot even find Harry's thoughts, let alone read them, as a result.

*********** Happens. I don't really come to Reddit much; only even knew about this post because somebody brought it up in a review.

When I wrote it, I had written it with the intention of Harry treating it like a named item in an RPG, like "Holy Avenger" or "Flame Tongue"; "Harry Potter's Key" would have been the full proper name for the item, and I wanted Harry to play on that, because he is, after all, an RPG player, so it became Harry Potter's "Harry Potter's Key", which can make the whole thing kind of confusing.

It's also why, for a while, Harry actually referred to Hagrid by his entire name and title, because it was being played as an RPG element, like an NPC getting their full name and title.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

  What if the founders built in a safe guard to protect incoming students from abuse at home, in the form of the hat? How would the hat react to Harry's so called childhood? Rated for language and expected violence. As complete as it is ever going to get. Revised as another story.

** I may be mashing things together, but in one of the many do-over stories, Harry's future knowledge is blocked to avoid overwhelming him. The Hat tries to remove the blocks to sort him, causing Harry incredible pain. The Hat is surprisingly unrepentant - 'This is my job. Don't tell me not to do it.'
