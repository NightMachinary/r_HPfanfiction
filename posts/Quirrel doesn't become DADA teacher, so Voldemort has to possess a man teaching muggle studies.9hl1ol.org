The idea just popped into my head, and it sounds absolutely hilarious!

Edit - Changed to be prompt


** Hmm...are you envisioning a competent Muggle Studies teacher, or an incompetent one?

I can imagine Voldemort-possessing the Muggle Studies teacher to be quite competent, giving accurate classes on understanding muggle road/pedestrian rules, use of various common devices, how to learn the current fashion...but at the same time, focusing on the negatives of muggle life; stuff like the genocides by Ottomans and Nazis, and Gandhi and Martin Luther King and other good guys being assassinated, ongoing gang problems and terrorist problems and the ongoing Cold War, and various spells that help to protect magical from muggle. Basically, painting muggles as violent, aggressive inferiors, but really subtle about it.

*** It would be more hilarious if he was competent, but hopelessly out of date since Voldemort never bothered keeping up with muggle current events. Like, he still thinks there's an Empire, or that King George is still on the throne, etc

*** I should have been more clear on the fact that I meant Quirrel would be said Muggle Studies Teacher. That was his position at Hogwarts before he became DADA professor.

  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.
