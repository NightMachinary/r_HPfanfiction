I want to read an AU where atleast one of his parents survived ( it may or may not have WBWL) and where Harry kills them and I prefer a Death-Eater Harry.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
