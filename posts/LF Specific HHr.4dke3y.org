**** Slingshot was the search word there, made it easy, though I recognized the rest, would have been more difficult to find the title.

  Title says it all, this covers summer 5th year through 6th and does contain adult themes though not much of an adult nature is written. The story is complete and will be posted as time and attitude permits. The focus is on Harry and Hermione with appearances by others more by accident than intent.
