I've recently been thinking about writing my own fanfiction after who knows how many years of just reading them. My first instinct was to write a post-GoF fic and essentially ignore the last three books, as I'm significantly less fond of them compared to the first four. However, there's a stumbling block: I can't come up with a good alternative to the prophecy. I was never really a big fan of it, but it did tie things up nicely. If I eschew OotP, however, there are tons of loose ends. Why was Voldemort specifically targeting Harry? At the end of Harry's first year, what was Dumbledore holding back for when Harry was older? Any suggestions or ideas?

EDIT: The relevant portion of PS/SS that flat out states Voldemort was targeting Harry, not just the Potters:

#+begin_quote
  “Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?”\\
  Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\\
  “Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are ready, you will know.”\\
  And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.
#+end_quote


** An alternative to the prophesy might be that Harry is actually a descendant of Salazar Slytherin, through his mothers line. This mirrors Riddle in a nice way.

It is established in cannon that Voldemort wishes to be unique, he rejects the common name Tom etc etc. So when he finds out a mudblood (Lily Evens) is also a descendant and with child, he moves to destroy her and make sure that he is the only living heir, after all he is immortal, so Salazar's line will exist forever.

As to why Dumbledore didn't tell an eleven year old that he was the only one who had a chance at defeating a wizard so powerful that others still feared to speak his name, a dark wizard who had killed 'some of best wizards and witches of the age, a dark wizard who would always seek Harry's destruction, a dark wizard who cheated death itself...

You tell an eleven year old all that! What kind of sociopath would put that kind of pressure on a child?

Voldemort targets Harry in OotP because he is the child of prophecy, to which Voldemort has been a victim. He also suspects that Dumbledore and Harry have a closer relationship and tries to posses Harry while in Dumblefore's presence to tempt Albus into killing Harry in the hopes that Voldemort would die too. Remember when Riddle possesses Harry at the Ministry? "Kill me now, Dumbledore".

Voldemort's main goal in OotP is to hear and understand the prophecy, toying with Potter and Albus is a fun, twisted side project for him.

*** But the DoM not happening would have fallout. Sirius wouldn't die, for one, which gives you the chance to write a whole new storyline with him (there's really only so long you can expect him to continue living in Grimmauld Place without saying fuck it and leaving or going completely off the reservation and/or killing himself) and his being alive is going to give him chance to influence Harry's opinions and actions. Voldemort's return isn't going to become public knowledge, so all the shit from 5th Year is going to continue and the battle against Voldemort will be harder. The escaped Death Eaters are still running loose, able to cause havoc.

Voldemort would still want Dumbledore dead, but without Lucius getting arrested at the MoM, Voldemort isn't likely to task Draco with the murder, which means there's not going the be the Hogwarts battle at the end of 6th Year. If things go down differently with Dumbledore's death, that could have repercussions for the events of 7th Year--or even 6th, if the new assassin kills him sooner than Draco+Snape managed too. If Snape doesn't do the kill, how does that change his place as Voldemort's favourite? Would he still end up headmaster?

Also without that battle, Bill Weasley doesn't get semi-werewolfed, Fleur doesn't give a heartfelt declaration of love in front of Tonks and Lupin, so they might not get together (and that relationship might be affected by Sirius being alive and his approval, especially if you happen to ship SB/RL as well as RL/NT) and then Teddy might not exist.

If there's no prophecy, then Harry isn't the Chosen One, he's just a kid who wants vengeance, and Dumbledore might be less compelled to teach him about Riddle's past because he doesn't want to put this task on the shoulders of a kid. Harry might also feel less pressure to be the one to defeat Voldemort--he'd still want him dead, but he might feel more willing to leave it to the adults (at least until he realises they're useless, if you write it that way). What happens if Dumbledore dies without telling anyone about the Horcruxes, or if he tells someone other than Harry?

There's probably more than I'm not thinking off, but basically it's not possible to remove an event like the DoM and expect things to still fallout exactly as they did in canon.

*** To me, that's one of the reasons why I love JK Rowling so much. So many stories fall prey to the Chosen One trap, making the main character the reluctant hero. While it does just that, in HP the prophecy is all about choice and will, it's a very nice twist really.

*** DoM could still happen. Voldemort would just be after some artifact, classified research, or sensitive intelligence info that could only be retrieved by either Harry or the dark lord.

Voldemort would originally go after the Potters for similar reasons, such as using the two children born at the end of July for a ritual. Maybe Snape gave him that idea in the first place, and became horrified later on. Then after his defeat, he became obsessed with defeating Harry.

Voldemort can perfectly reasonably go after the Potters without the prophecy. They are enemy combatants that had defied him multiple times and gotten away with it. That's enough of a reason for a Dark Lord to go after them - several order families had already been wiped out by that point, so it's not unreasonable to think he would go after the Potters as well.

** Without the prophecy, setting up Harry vs. the Villain might be driven by the main characters. So Harry or one of his friends decides to make Voldemort's defeat a personal goal for various reasons. Killing a main character off could provide impetus but that could get angsty (Forging the Sword does it right, Tears of a Veela not so much IMO).

Actually, now that I think of it, there's very little reason for a bunch of kids/teens to target the Dark Lord. It's suicidal for even the average person. So extreme circumstances aren't necessary but they're the easy way out. Prophecy, noble birth, magical power, mental unbalances, etc. Most stories give their main character a physical/magical/social/prophetic advantage to force the conflict.

Or you could ignore Voldemort and have a fun magical school adventure in the vein of the first three books. That might actually be more interesting. Voldemort is a clichéd villain that forces the end result of the story to pass through at least some form of horrible war (not to mention an inevitable Horcrux hunt). For example, Prisoner of Azkaban was an amazing book, and it had very little mention of Riddle.

With regards to why Voldemort targeted Harry on Halloween 1981: it doesn't have to have a special reason. Voldemort was a pretty bad dude; maybe he just killed the Potters because it was fun, not because of a prophecy. Or maybe Voldemort needed a bunch of babies for a crazy dark ritual.

**** There are just way too many better plot devices than the overused prophecy thing.

For example, Voldemort needed magical children born at the end of July for some kind of ritual. Snape could have given him the idea in the first place, only later to realize what he had done.

Or the Potters could have gotten some important stuff that could pose serious threat to Voldemort (such as render its owner certain immunity against Voldemort). Voldemort attacked, the Potters were cornered, James gave it to Lily, but Lily injected the item into Harry's blood stream. Later, Voldemort bypassed part of that protection by using Harry's blood in his resurrection. But taking Harry's blood also turned Voldemort's horcrux in Harry vulnerable.

Because HP is a fantasy series, the options are virtually limitless.

*** ... It would make sense that the Unspeakables would be put in charge of guarding the Ministry's Magical Intelligence assets, but that only those 'with a pure heart' or special dispensation from the DOM head could access the controls of the system. Since the Death Eaters are too busy reforming to even attempt to breach the security system, they elect to manipulate a pure-hearted soul into breaching security for them. And it just so happens that Voldemort has a direct link into just such a soul's mind...

ED: Note that 'pure heart' is a generic idiom. You can replace it with virtually anything related to Harry (like a back door built in by the wardmaster-a Potter-that would allow family members to force the security system into maintenance mode) and it could still work. Also note that magical Intelligence can refer to anything from details of the country's various spies, a Nationwide Ministry Wards For Dummies grimoire collection, actual magical weapons that can level mountains with a simple word, fucking Excalibur-anything even vaguely related to the term 'important Ministry assets-handle with care, do not drop the box' will do, the more powerful/dangerous, the better.

** There are tons of alternatives to prophecy that can be used to much the same effect.

Terry Pratchett's theory of narrative causality can be easily used as a substitute-where a boy survives a direct attack by an evil wizard, then he's virtually guaranteed to become the hero that slays said evil wizard.

Hell, it'd also more than adequately explain the /laissez-faire/ approach adopted by the greater wizarding world-only one-in-a-million chances of success are guaranteed to work when a Story comes into effect, therefore any help lent in the hero's quest would negatively impact the chances of said hero saving the day. In order to guarantee success, the heroes have to discover the truth and fight by themselves.

Dumbledore is bound by the demands of the narrative here-he has to fit the all-wise and knowing mentor to as great a degree as he possibly can to guarantee that he remains within the narrative. Though bound by it, his position will be an influential one in the story, a position he can use to manipulate the outcomes for the better.

Similarly, the entire wizarding community has an inkling that this stereotype exists and know what roles they have to play. It explains why Malfoy senior acts like an idiot-he has to in order to not end up converted to the light side, a move virtually guaranteed to kill him & his family when the Dark Lord inevitably returns. It also helps explain Draco's actions in book six too-the reluctant villain, after all, features heavily in such stories and is also virtually guaranteed to survive all confrontations right up until the end. The fugitive, on the other hand, would have no choice but to team up with the hero and die heroically battling against his father at the end, thereby banishing any doubts as to his final alignment.

Snape as the repentant spymaster for the light is a good example of this.

Hermione and Ron fit well into the plucky side-kick roles, which again keeps them alive throughout the drama.

Being trapped in Hogwarts in year seven, Neville's idea to found La Resistance sees all but a handful of background characters (who die screaming horribly whilst being tortured by Nazi-lite sadists-a necessary sacrifice for a La Resistance story group) survive until the Hero's return.

See, they have lived through such events before-unbeatable Dark Lords with a penchant for mass murder are pretty common in the magical world. So, when you have a large subsection of the population of ultra-powerful causality breakers all wish that the Hero would come forth and save them all, what do you get?

A Hero that will come forth and save them all.

The Price is that a Hero comes with a story attached. No story, no mysterious & painful past, no Hero and the Dark Lord of the day wins by default.

This is not something muggleborns or half-bloods with minor ties to the wizarding world are ever told, mostly since most of them would either dismiss it as rubbish or find a way to hack themselves into the role they desire-if they aren't central to how the Story itself unfolds.

Which is what Tom Riddle (probably) tried to do-become a Hero and get the keys to the realm-and failed spectacularly.

Only the purebloods know of this happening in their world. They attempt to mask it by upholding divination as something other than complete bullshit, but it's there when you scratch the surface.

And so, in the face of a Hero coming to be, they assume the roles they want and hope that this is the Bulfinch's mythology kind of heroic adventure rather than the Robert E Howard kind of hero that'll save them in their Darkest Hour Of Need.

Harry Potter and co are, of course, completely clueless as to this. The only one that could possibly know and would be close enough to tell them would be Ron-if his parents ever deemed him to be old enough/intelligent enough to know and not tell the Hero and his bushy-haired sounding board/2IC/sister-possibly-upgradable-to-main-love-interest figure BEFORE the end of the Story because, if Harry knew, it would be a disaster.
