Earlier today I was watching an episode of Star Trek TNG where the entire crew of the Enterprise loses their memories. They're trying to figure out who they are, where they are, and what they are supposed to be doing. Some other nonsense comes up too and it makes for an interesting episode (to me at least).

Does there exist a fanfic with this as a premise or important plot point? I know the fact that people Obliviate others can sort of apply, but one guy Obliviating another doesn't really have the effect I'm looking for.

It does have its share of dark moments.

  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
