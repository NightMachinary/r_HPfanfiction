Looking for a Fanfic where Voldemort doesn't sit in the background and is actually a main character. Usually fics have Voldemort who sits in the background doing nothing after he takes one hit. I am looking for a more cunning and intelligent Voldemort who adapts better to what Dumbledore and Harry do against him.

I would prefer a fic after or during fourth year, however any year will work. No Dumbledore bashing please.

Thanks.

Edit: As [[/u/sefera17][u/sefera17]] just pointed me, Voldemort doesn't need to be the main character.


** MoR?

No, I guess not. Heâ€˜s definitely more cunning, actually quite intelligent; but Harry's still the main character.

*** No, Voldemort doesn't need to be the main character. He just needs to be more cunning, after all he is the heir of slytherin, a fic where he acts like it more.

PS - Thanks for the time-line of MoR

** The problem with Voldie (besides being a mass murdering, sadistic racist sociopath, I mean) is that his plans are /too/ cunning. As in, they're overthought and needlessly grandiose.

Cunning Voldemort would have Imperiused or Crucioed Flammel into giving him the Philosopher's Stone before every declaring himself (avoid the Horcruxes because of the negative side effects). If he must make Horcruxes, conceal them as random, everyday objects. Then he would have used that charisma to run for Minister of Magic, created some crisis (like pissing off the Goblins to start a Goblin rebellion, or a Statute of Secrecy breach) to justify a declaration of martial law, and poof, he has everything he wants. If Dumbledore actually decided to intervene directly against the Ministry for a change- get someone into Hogwarts polyjuiced or invisible (he infiltrated Hogwarts multiple times), then AK Dumbledore in the back.

But no, Voldemort did everything stupid and round-about. He overthought everything.

*** That is true AF. It feels as if he already makes a second plan if someone manages to oppose his first plan. However, in the end his second plan clashes with his first plan nullifying both of them.

Although the part about Voldemort using his charisma to become Minister of Magic doesn't sound as intresting. Not that it is a bad plam but as a reader that would be all politics and not magical enough, if you understand what I mean. :D

Same with AK-ing Dumbledore in the back. Although I doubt anyone could catch Dumbledore off guard to kill him in one shot.

**** Eh, political stories are only boring if they're badly written. Especially as I'm sure Voldemort would not play entirely by the rules.

As to Dumbledore- he's not omniscient. Even he has to let his guard down sometimes, and Voldie infiltrated Hogwarts repeatedly. Its a risk, sure- that's why you send an obliviated, imperiused expendable agent to do it.

***** Perhaps you are right about Dumbledore, perhaps you are wrong. I will continue with the idea that he cannot be caught so off guard. Not because he is the most powerful and stuff but because I have started to understand his decisions and character, which I used to criticize before and just don't feel like contradicting my beliefs for now. :D

But your view is appreciated. Thank you for sharing it.

** Somehow your fanfic request made me think of linkffn(10129276) but I am afraid this isn't quite what you are looking for.
