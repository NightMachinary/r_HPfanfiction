Hello!

I'm a sucker for terrible fanfic. I'm hoping someone can find it..

I read about this one about decade ago, Harry, Hermione, and (I think) Neville are 'heirs" to the Hogwarts houses. There's a fancy Gryffindor castle, and Harry has driver's license and a tricked out Hummer for some reason? There's a roundtrip chapter and I think Vampires. At one point Harry throws a rager at his castle.

Help me Reddit, you're my only hope.
