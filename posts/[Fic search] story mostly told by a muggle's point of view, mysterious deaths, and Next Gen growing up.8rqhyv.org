It was incomplete last time I looked and I closed the tab for it on my phone. Remembered how good it was but I cannot remember the name of it!

James, Albus, and Lily are really little. James is the new kid at thr local muggle school and he becomes BFFS with the muggle woman's son. The muggle woman is super helpful and nice to Ginny, giving her rides to drop James off at school. Muggle woman was a competitive swimmer and invited Harry and Ginny and their kids to join them for weekly swims. There's some kind of werewolf mystery that Harry is working on and we also get a bit from his point of view. The author is English and the flavor of the story is just amazing. She is busy and doesn't have time for frequent chapter updates, but it's so good that doesn't matter.
