Hey folks! I'm hoping you can help me find some fics where Harry is friends with people from the other houses. It could be during or post-Hogwarts, though I would prefer them to be 3rd years at least. I'm just looking for Harry with a genuine, easy, comfortable friendship outside of Ron and Hermione. Some that I've read and enjoyed that have aspects of this are:

Harry Potter, PI by neymovirne (Harry and Pansy are friends and work together) GOODNIGHT FROM YOUR FUTURE HUSBAND by GallaPlacidia (kind of - Harry and Blaise are friends but it deteriorates) Vital Paramus by TheEndless7 (Harry and Titus Button) Evitative by Vichan (Harry is resorted to Slytherin which isn't quite what I'm looking for, but I love his relationship with Pansy)

I'm not fussed regarding het, slash, etc. and while complete stories are preferred it's not a dealbreaker. I appreciate any help you can offer!


** “Honour Thy Blood” by TheBlack'sResurgence is a good fic. It is a Harry Daphne pairing while maintaining friendship with others
