Hey guys,

I am looking for fictions involving Hermione's obliviated parents (bonus points if they are really angry at her for being a patronizing bitch and meddling with their minds and free-will - I mean it's betrayal of the highest order if you delete someones memories because that effectively destroys them as a person (We are the sum of our memories and experiences after all!) and makes them your unwilling puppets! I for one would rather be dead than let something like this happen to me (I'd allow someone to do it to keep important secrets, but not to re-arrange my whole mind and delete a very very larger portion of it...they have to swear an unbreakable vow to not do that before I'd allow it!))

Don't care about the ship much - though I don't like Ron/Hermione much (I think they just clash too much - not only in personalities (hard working overachiever and couch potato slob who doesn't want to apply himself!) but also in ideals and upbringing (remember SPEW - maybe it wasn't well thought out but Ron's reaction shows that he's quite the asshole IMHO!)

Oh and: No Slash, it's just not my cup of tea (at least not for the main character - side character slash is ok!), much less if it's HP/DM (they'd kill each other and Harry ain't gay IMHO!) or HP/SS (damned the guy had a hand in his parents death and hates Harry - Harry would rather kill him than love him!)

greetings LAX

*** That one was really worth the read IMHO, so THANK YOU! (sadly it seems/is unfinished WIP -.-)...do you know any more like this? (or similar ones, where Harry does argue with Hermione and she's wrong, really wrong, for a change? Whether it's something she's done that's morally wrong or if it's something else along those lines (I love debating, so I enjoy two characters having a go at a debate in fiction, too!))

  During Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts Dumbledore asks Snape if Harry will be happy after Voldemort is dead. He doesn't like the answer. Snape decides to clean up the mess. DH except Epi.

** Here's how I see the scene between Hermione and her parents transpiring. Apologies for the sketchiness and the script format.

*Hermione*: ... And that's why you need to go somewhere far away from there --- ideally Australia. I've Charmed these forged papers to appear real to any Muggle that examines them.

*Parents:* Thank you so much. But, there are only two sets of documents here.

*Hermione:* Mum, dad, I have to stay. Ha- I can't tell you the details, but it's our only chance to stop Voldemort.

*Parents:* If you're staying, we're staying.

*Hermione:* But you can't! They'll go after you to get to me. I can't protect you!

*Parents:* Yes, and you might hate us for it, but if taking ourselves hostage is the only way to make you leave with us to safety, then we will do it.

*Hermione:* Mum, Dad, I'm sorry...

*Parents:* We are sorry too, but...

*Hermione:* No, not about that. /STUPEFY!/ /STUPEFY!/ So sorry... /OBLIVIATE!/ /CONFABULUS!/ /OBLIVIATE!/ /CONFABULUS!/

--------------

/CONFABULUS!/ is a plausible incantation for a False Memory Charm.

*** Possible and still morally wrong! Just as wrong as her parents are in that scene (Hermione is off age, so they get no say anymore and blackmail is almost as bad as total betrayal by memory modification!) - Hell, I'd love it if her telling Harry what she has done makes him go ballistic on her and her parents, too after she gives them their memories back (Parents: "We can't trust you ever again. You decided to play god and wreak havoc with our memories and you would probably do it again in a heartbeat. You aren't truly sorry and you wouldn't let us decide for ourselves, so we don't have a daughter anymore!")

**** Oh, I agree that it's still highly unethical. However, I think that it's helpful to try to think through /why/ Hermione, who seems to have the closest ethical position to yours overall, would do such a thing --- why she wouldn't, say, try to reason her parents into it, or why she would fail, with nobody being an unambiguous villain. (They want what's best for her; she wants what's best for them; she happens to have power in the situation.)

Harry reacting particularly strongly to this would probably be hightly OOC for him --- he doesn't really think in those abstract terms, not as an adolescent, nor as an adult, for that matter. (The canon example that immediately comes to mind is that he's perfectly OK with Ron Confounding an examiner to get his driver's license.) To have him go ballistic would basically be him acting as the author's mouthpiece.

Lastly, Hermione was plenty sorry in DH; her parents may have been the victims, but she has also sacrificed much. And, while her parents would have a right to resent her, they also have the right to forgive. Feelings and relationships are not black-and-white.

***** Of course they have the right to forgive - but in cases such as this it should take TIME and not happen immediately -.- (it's something I hate in fiction - be it on TV or in books - people tend to forgive the most heinous acts too soon IMHO...I mean a good example would be: "Evolution" where the main character (Charly) easily forgives her mother for leaving her and her father and - after she learns of it - for being responsible for the world being more or less destroyed...sorry, but I'd have resented her for ages probably!))

A power-shift like that in a parent-child-relationship is always a bad thing IMHO - I mean how can you ever trust somebody who can take away who you are with a flick of a damned stick (or worse: Make you do whatever they want with the Imperius-Curse!)? More so if they've done it once already?

Well, I do think that Harry would be outraged because she treats her parents like Dumbledore and the Order treat him (!) - not giving him information, keeping him in the dark and using him as a pawn! - which is something he was outraged about, too!

She sacrificed? Yes, she did, but not for the conflict (she'd have been a target either way, much more so if she's stayed at school because Draco would have surely had his revenge against her and any supposed slights against his honor!) - she did the day she married the slacker (also known as: Ron Weasley!), as she IMHO burried her dreams that very day!

A drawn-out reconciliation isn't what you postulated, though. You wrote "we don't have a daughter anymore."

A power-shift like this occurs thousands of times every day, as aging parents come to rely on their children for support.

I don't think Harry's moral reasoning is that abstract or universalist. Anyway, there is no "would". We /know/ that he wasn't. If you think that that was uncharacteristic behavior relative to the rest of the books, make your case.

#+begin_quote

She's a Muggleborn. Those don't get to go to school under Voldemort. Anyway, if she'd gone to Australia with her parents, she probably wouldn't have needed to False Memory Charm them.

#+begin_quote
  she did the day she married the slacker (also known as: Ron Weasley!), as she IMHO burried her dreams that very day!
#+end_quote

That would be the case if her dreams were limited to "marrying well" (rich, handsome, brilliant, high up in the society). However, her dreams tended to lie in the direction of reforming society towards justice, and WoG is that she is well on her way there. To that end, she could have done much worse than Ron:

1. Among the men close to her in age, the ambitious ones are either Slytherins (whose ambition is quite questionable in the first place) or Percy; so she doesn't really have anyone with whom to form a proverbial "power couple", so her husband will have to be someone who would work mainly as a prop.
2. Ron is a pureblood, and she takes his name when they marry. That makes her less threatening to the proverbial old guard who, while no Voldemort supporters, likely harbor implicit anti-Muggleborn prejudice. (Think Slughorn.)
3. Ron is a war hero, but not in a way that would overshadow her the way Harry would. No matter how illustrious her Ministry career, her achievements are unlikely to ever be as famous and popular as Voldemort's defeat, and Harry would get 80%+ of the credit for that.
4. Ron is a known quantity, and we know that she finds him physically attractive. He is also a rather talented wizard, given that he does significantly above average while putting in the least amount of work she lets him get away with; as is his whole family. I.e., good genes.
5. She has few interests in common with Ron, but that's not necessarily a bad thing: it means relatively few demands from him on her time, so she can focus on her career.

******* AND: Why not? - If someone did this to me I'd think about never forgiving them -.-

Yes, but those are natural and it's not like most of those children are barely out of their teens (and it's not as if they can do something like destroying your mind -.-)

I don't know about Harry, he's kind of strange (then again: He's emotionally stunted, damaged (no sense of self-worth!) and has a lot of baggage!), so I kind of can't exactly put myself in his shoes (I don't have that baggage - I've got my own, but it's nothing like that at all!)

Well, what do they do then? Are they slaves? Are they put into camps (I've never finished the last book - I just couldn't, Rowling destroyed her hero too much for my taste! - so I don't know!)?

Sure she could have gone with them - but she's not a coward and (unlike Ron IMHO) she's also a good friend!

What - society didn't change (that's something I hate most about the ending of Harry Potter!), people like the Malfoys still get out of prison (they should have received life-sentences for being members in a terrorist organization and for crimes commited before and during Voldemorts reign of terror!)

Yes, Harry is there (and she'd be a better influence than Weaslette/Shesley - no popping out kids ASAP for example! Not to mention that their experiences make them much more suited for each other (both are "muggleborn" - Harry was not told about the magical world before he became 11 years old either, so they are very similar in that regard - and both have been exposed to muggle society and technology!)

Harry would not overshadow her, she's much more into knowledge etc. than he is (sadly - I can never figure why so many muggleborns wouldn't be over-achievers in a world of magic, I myself was never the best student, but I bet I would be in such a world!)

Genes - that's another thing, I'd have thought that children would not be her goal (she does seem to have other ambitions and muggles do have them a lot later than most wizard-couples seem to!) -.-

Well, Ron's needy, too so I bet he'd constantly interrupt her studying/learning/experimenting etc. -.-

Oh and Harry has a pureblood name, too ;) and he does not have the stigma of poverty (and lack of common sense: more children than you can afford, a house that's kept together by magic and still looks like it will fall apart any minute etc.) and he's a highly eligible bachelor, too (his name would open more doors!)

I don't see him as emotionally stunted, certainly. My sense is that he is more in touch with his emotions than the rest of the Trio --- the sort of thing that, IMO, gives him a great Patronus but poor Occlumency.

#+begin_quote

As far as I can gather, those who turned themselves in lost their wands and were mostly let go after that. Those who didn't and were caught, went to Azkaban (though Dementors had abandoned earlier, so it's not clear what that means). Those who resisted escaped or died. Quite a few went into hiding successfully, emerging for the Battle of Hogwarts.

That explains a lot; please do finish DH --- or at least the Wiki entries on the relevant concepts --- before you speak on Dumbledore's and others' character. It's not great literature --- DH was a bit of a slog for me as well --- but you've got a lot of fanon to clean out.

Do I need to recap all the things Ron had done for Harry? For that matter, one could make a pretty darned good argument that Harry is often a poor friend to Ron and Hermione.

#+begin_quote

Their relationship to Muggles didn't, and this is unfortunate. But, other magical beings are much better off, at least according to WoG.

#+end_quote

Harry dislikes the Muggle side of his life, they have little to no chemistry / physical attraction, and Hermione treats him like a little brother she never had.

And, well, magic makes childrearing much easier, so what does it matter when they have children?

#+begin_quote
  Harry would not overshadow her, she's much more into knowledge etc. than he is (sadly - I can never figure why so many muggleborns wouldn't be over-achievers in a world of magic, I myself was never the best student, but I bet I would be in such a world!)
#+end_quote

It's not about knowledgebility, it's about politics. As for other muggleborns, what fraction of RL smartphone owners become programmers or electrical engineers?

#+begin_quote
  Genes - that's another thing, I'd have thought that children would not be her goal (she does seem to have other ambitions and muggles do have them a lot later than most wizard-couples seem to!) -.-
#+end_quote

It's certainly a factor --- and, again, magic makes it easier. As for when, given how poorly romance was written in canon in general, I, personally, would rather the protagonists waited until their twenties to meet the love of their lives, but oh well.

#+begin_quote
  Well, Ron's needy, too so I bet he'd constantly interrupt her studying/learning/experimenting etc. -.-

Interrupt with what? The ways in which he is "needy" are not ones that he would go to Hermione with.

#+end_quote

I am not getting into Harmony debate here, but will just say that they both have issues (though not ones you'd listed), and some of those issues would make living together day-to-day very, very hard. Both would need to grow up more before it could have a chance of working.

And, don't knock the Weasleys. They've raised seven successful children to productive and prosperous adulthood over the course of two civil wars. And, as long as they can afford a wand and a Hogwarts education for every child, the Weasley strategy will be ruling the wizarding society in a few generations (because labor is far more valuable than capital in the wizarding world), while the Malfoy strategy leads to extinction.

********* Note: I have read the wiki and several summaries of DH (years ago, so my memory might be failing me at times - probably because I don't want to remember the damned book...I love the world of Harry Potter because one can tell great (fanfiction) stories in it, but I certainly don't like most of the canon characters and what happened in canon...Harry himself is a disapointment - he had potential but he squandered it all and then sacrificed himself for a world that does not deserve it...sorry, but a decade or two of Voldemort's rule might have cured (or destroyed!) the wizard world, without that happening most things stay exactly the same! Malfoys avoid punishment, just because they helped Harry (despite the fact that they are terrorists and criminals (after all Lucius did bribe the Minister even before Voldemort was resurrected), Hogwarts isn't re-done (new curriculum, Binns dismissed, Trelawney fired etc.) and purebloods are still the wealthy elite -.-)

Makes it easier my ass - if so, why does Molly Weasley stay home when she could be helping to keep her family afloat by WORKING (or is she that old-fashioned that she thinks that women should stay at home and clean and cook and have children -.-)? (They often enough seem to barely make do, I mean some of Ron's problems with being dirt-poor are very justified and his parents aren't that great - Molly is overbearing and her husband seems whipped, despite him bringing in the cash while she is just a housewife -.-)

Yes, I will knock the Weasleys - they are irresponsible (contraception must be an invention by the devil -.-) and Molly's smothering is why her really successful children (Bill, Charly and - yes! - Percy) left as soon as they were able (and not only did they leave the Burrow, they left the country (ok, not Percy, but the others!)!)

Ok, tell me what "the slacker" has done for Harry - I only remember the chess-board in first year ok and maybe the rescue with the flying car (but that was probably more the twins then Ron himself), otherwise Ron could not be relied on!

Harry at least has a good excuse: Voldemort! - Ron does not have that and neither does Hermione!

It's not retribution, it's the law (I mean at least in Germany we have a law that forbids membership in terrorist groups - even if you are only a card-carrying member and don't actually help in planning of attacks) and letting them off sets a terrifying precedent (again! "I've been under the imperius"-anyone?)

The comparison isn't a good one IMHO as programming is quite boring compared to magic with near instant results!

CoS: Followed Harry into the Acromantula nest and the Chamber of Secrets.

PoA: Stood on a broken leg to tell what he thought was a mass-murdering Death Eater that to get to Harry, he'd have to kill him first.

After Voldemort's restoration: Despite being a pureblood who could have sat the whole conflict out, he joined the DA, went to the Department of Mysteries, and joined Harry on the quest for horcruxes in DH; and it took wearing a horcrux around his neck to give him a mere moment of weakness. Don't underestimate the value of an extra wand.

Now, tell me, what has Harry done for Ron?

Speak for yourself: some of us find it very interesting and engaging. Nor is learning magic easy: think about how many times the books just "fast-forwarded" to the next major event, only remarking that Harry felt overwhelmed with all the work. Going from turning a matchstick into a needle to using Transfiguration to improve your life standard is hundreds, perhaps thousands of hours of study.

*********** Or a real leader? If the DA shows that he can lead after all and he'd do even better if he didn't rely on Hermione so much -.-

That's not exactly Harry's problem is it? I mean being a little selfish is not a bad thing (if you don't go over the top and only care for yourself)

Hell, I sometimes ask myself why Dumbledore etc. didn't just steal that Hogwarts book or whatever they use to find muggleborns and then vanish with it and all is supporters (do a parallel British Wizard World full of muggleborns and pure- and halfbloods on their side!), they have things like the Fidelius charm after all and can play the long game, too (in a century or two Voldemorts supporters would have probably bred themselves to extinction!)

Even if Lucius didn't - Draco (the little ferret!) did!

Exactly my point: Why have 7 children? I mean Ron harbors some resentment for his family because of this (IMHO he is right to!) because it lead them to poverty, despite Arthur being a senior ministry official (head of a - small - department!)

It's not wrong, but if 3 of seven children go either far away or cut contact (Percy did that) then that's suspicious IMHO!

He followed Harry into that because of his SISTER (at least that's my take on it!)

Yeah, wearing that thing...I never understood why they didn't wrap it into something or - even better - hid it somewhere (somewhere so muggle to Voldemort would have a hard time getting it even if he knew where it was!)

  Or a real leader? If the DA shows that he can lead after all and he'd do even better if he didn't rely on Hermione so much -.-
#+end_quote

If not for Hermione, there wouldn't be a DA for him to lead in the first place. His teaching record is quite good --- though it's not clear how much of that was Hermione's preparation, both during GoF and during OotP --- but I can tell you from personal experience that teaching a large class of people most of whom don't want to be there is much harder than a small group of people all of whom do. Also, Harry brought in Cho, Cho Marietta, and then they were betrayed.

Also, that "leadership" of his at the end of the year got Sirius killed, Hermione almost killed, and would have probably gone even worse if Death Eaters weren't trying to avoid damaging the orbs or killing Harry and the pureblooded children. (Fun fact: as far as I can tell from that scene, only Hermione was ever targeted with a deadly spell... I wonder why?)

  Hell, I sometimes ask myself why Dumbledore etc. didn't just steal that Hogwarts book or whatever they use to find muggleborns and then vanish with it and all is supporters (do a parallel British Wizard World full of muggleborns and pure- and halfbloods on their side!), they have things like the Fidelius charm after all and can play the long game, too (in a century or two Voldemorts supporters would have probably bred themselves to extinction!)
#+end_quote

There's a fic about that (thought it was post-Dumbledore-death). I can't find it at the moment, but it was linked in one of the more recent threads.

#+begin_quote
  Even if Lucius didn't - Draco (the little ferret!) did!
#+end_quote

I don't have much sympathy for Draco --- I wouldn't have minded if Harry's Secumstempa had hit just a tad higher than it had --- but given that he was coerced and given that he didn't actually succeed in killing anyone, I'd be inclined to let him off with probation.

#+begin_quote
  Exactly my point: Why have 7 children? I mean Ron harbors some resentment for his family because of this (IMHO he is right to!) because it lead them to poverty, despite Arthur being a senior ministry official (head of a - small - department!)
#+end_quote

And yet, according to your own words below, he risked his life to save Ginny. Maybe Weasleys know a thing or two about family bonds...

#+begin_quote
  It's not wrong, but if 3 of seven children go either far away or cut contact (Percy did that) then that's suspicious IMHO!
#+end_quote

I think that the reasons Percy cut contact --- while the others never did --- were amply explained, and had little to do with Molly. You know all those fics where Hermione is portrayed as incapable of questioning authority? That's fanon for Hermione but canon for Percy.

#+begin_quote
  He followed Harry into that because of his SISTER (at least that's my take on it!)
#+end_quote

  Yeah, wearing that thing...I never understood why they didn't wrap it into something or - even better - hid it somewhere (somewhere so muggle to Voldemort would have a hard time getting it even if he knew where it was!)

And he does learn these things, as do most Hogwarts students, it's just that he's also an 11 year old who likes flying much better an any of those things. The marginal utility (extra usefulness) of learning the more obscure stuff is small, unless you plan to specialize. Hermione probably mastered hundreds of spells off-screen, and most of them she never got to use at all, but among those were a handful of dimension-warping and protection and concealment charms that kept them all alive in DH, for example.

Also, I think she wasn't certain it could be undone.

She didn't make a hard decision, she stole their decision. Circumvented their consent and removed their free will. That's not even getting into the aftermath. Her parents would be psychologically messed up-their very foundations (identity, past, personality) have been messed about. Who is going to help them? If they go to a Muggle therapist, counselor, psycholoigist, whatever, they'll be tossed in the hospital for appearing crazy. If they lie, treatment will be useless.

"Glamour-charms" are entirely fanon. Disguise makeup applied unskillfully is worse than nothing because it draws attention, and Hermione probably put makeup skills very close to the bottom of the list of skills to acquire, to say nothing of Harry and Ron.
