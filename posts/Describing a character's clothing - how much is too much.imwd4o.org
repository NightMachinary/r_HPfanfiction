What are you wearing? and more importantly... WHAT ARE THOSE?!

Ahem.

So I'm sure we've seen the extremes, from Ebony's fishnets to fics that make no mention of clothing at all. I've also read fics that describe a character getting dressed in a Patrick Bateman level of detail.

I get it, nobody should care what the characters are wearing, because this is an Action/Mystery/Adventure/Horror/Time Travel/Romance and the character development and the plot are what's important, right?

But we all acknowledge one simple fact - clothes make the man. Even some of the best fics I've ever read devote some time to wardrobe descriptions. (I'm looking at you Haphne writers).

So I guess the really real question is - how much is too much? What level of detail do you use when writing about what characters are wearing? What level of detail do you feel comfortable reading? Do you feel like it enhances the story? Ruins the story? Doesn't really matter?

I have a few general guidelines for myself when I'm writing:

I don't describe the school uniform in general unless something is happening to it, usually something bad. You are reading Harry Potter fanfiction so I assume you know the color of the trim in Draco's robe.

I also don't describe the school ties unless someone's grabbing it for some reason. I once read a story where the author was identifying all of the characters by the color of their ties. i.e. ‘the green-and-silver tie girl', ‘the red-and-gold tie boy'... needless to say, it was dreadful.

I give clothing a cursory description if it's something that you'd expect the character to wear, i.e. ‘Ron changed into a pair of faded hand-me-down jeans and a Chudley Cannons jersey'.

I'll get a bit more of a description if clothing is unique or unusual for the character, i.e. ‘Hermione's black robes glowed with the violet energy of the runes embroidered in the seams' or if Ron finally caves in and wears the expensive casual clothing that Pansy bought for him (that last one is coming soon, btw.) I'll describe the general colors or color schemes of clothing to give the reader a general idea, again only going into detail when color is descriptive or important.


** I guess it depends on why you are describing a character's clothing. In the books as I recall, clothing is often brought up in accordance with character traits. ie, Ron's second hand robes, Umbridge's imaculate pinkness, Dumbledore's quirkiness, Lupin looking like a vagabond, etc. Once you set up a baseline for how people dress, you only need to bring something up if it adds to the characters or story. In fanfiction, it's difficult I think because we already have an idea of what people look like, so its unnecessary to draw attention to a person's dress most of the time.

A situation that you would bring up dress is like so:

"Harry furrowed his brow in confusion as he stared at Hermione. Sure, they were going to go after the horcruxes but she was wearing a rather sturdy set of what he assumed was American military-grade camoflauge body armor."

*** Now I'm imagining a scene where Hermione shows up in the uniform of a general of the Red Army after having purchased the equipment for an entire armoured division Lord of War style (the Ukraine scene) and proceeds to arm the DA out of her arsenal handbag.

Also makes for a hilarious if short Battle of Hogwarts since that is the one scene where muggle weapons could be absolutely lethal due to the position of Hogwarts and its wards which prevent apparation.

** Characterisation dependent.

If your scarf signifies their connection to their mentor who gave it to them, describe it. If that scarf will be a murder weapon later, mention it. If it's not relevant to plot or characterisation, let the reader imagine if they have a scarf or not.

If your POV character is Lavender Brown, describe the clothes of people she encounters like a fashion magazine might. If it's Harry Potter, maybe make a mention if they wear something outlandish.

** Personally, if they mention a brand clothing i am out. I am not here to read about a 12 year olds dream clothing. Does the scene require mention of clothes? Such as a convo while getting dressed? Yes mention them wrangling with the clothes. -chop up their sentences as they pull something over their head. I do however NOT ever need to know the brand.

...if i have to read one more fic about some chick wearing her jimmy chochoo (or whatever) shoes, im staging a intervention.

** Like many other details in a story, they have to add something. I like when we get a brief reminder, for example, of Ron's background being not very rich especially if it's a factor that comes into play in a scene, and he's wearing hand me downs or old quidditch team t shirts. If clothing brings to attention someone's status, someone's demeanour, something relevant to the scene, I think it's as valuable as other details.

And sometimes it just adds the the reader's mind's eye, so to speak - helping them understand the environment or the type of person that individual is.

In saying that, the majority of the time that I read about clothes they don't add a lot, but sometimes I feel like because we all know Hogwarts and the dress code, it can become superfluous. Also, when details are laid on very heavily by a narrator, it can feel like we're lingering our attention a lot on one detail. Writing ultimately communicates thought, and so it makes us spend a lot of time thinking about clothes. If there's a good reason why, then be my guest, but I usually like actions. So someone fussing over someone else's collar or pleats on a dress, to me, is more interesting than a narration itinerary of exactly what everyone is wearing. It might show a character being nervous, for example.

Also with girls? You can do a lot with this - someone can be friendly by adjusting your clothes, altering them with spells, repairing them, changing colour. Or they can pay compliments and wish they had those clothes because they don't have money. One thing I saw someone do was depict Lavender as quietly gossiping to figure out where Hermione got fancy robes, because she was awkward about asking (showing lavender's sometimes poor social skills) and because they were awfully tasteful for a muggleborn (hermione in that instance had been lent them).

So clothes are never just clothes. They do tell you about someone or about events, but I kind of want to see how they contribute - to someone's character, or to plot, or conflict, or something. Irrelevant lingering on clothing can lag the reader behind so whatever you do decide on, try to make it fold in to the scene. As a woman, I can say that in women's circles clothes contribute a lot to social dynamics and when I see an author do this capably I always love to see it, and they're often women. When I see male authors do it I'm like 🙌 well done, well done. A lot of blokes miss those kinds of details. Makes me wonder what details of men's lives I miss actually.

** By what metric, though? It's your story. Add as many details as you like.

Generally, I agree that words should serve a purpose. But the purpose might require a very detailed approach. So for instance, we are never told in Canon what a "robe" is. I wanted to define exactly how that looked like, and what "fashion" would mean, in terms of robes, so I just spent some 2,000 words on getting dressed.

That covered my purpose. And that aside, it was a fun thing to write, which already is enough justification.

On the other end, it might be nothing more than a line -- a few words -- a colour, playing with contrasts and characterisations. There is no universal answer to "too much", really. It's a you-know-it-when-you-see-it thing -- if you're in the middle of an action sequence, and go off on a tangent describing in detail mudstains on socks, you're /just/ doing something wrong, it doesn't mean that it's too much as a matter of principle in general.

  WHAT ARE THOSE?!
#+end_quote

Taking me back to high school lol.

When it comes to clothes in fics I think a) Is the character's clothing relevant to the scene? If yes, then b) is it necessary to decribe every little stitch and colour? Usually, it's not.

** Honestly, variable.

Normally it's a case of clothes being something that attracts the eye because they're big things people see, but people don't usually care about minuta of the design. If it's something 'common' or just establishing, then probably a vague type/cut/colour and maybe image description or if there's something that is liable to draw attention to the clothes. If it's something special or there's a major change, particularly if it's something not commonly seen then it's more likely to get more attention, though it's also situational. Someone in the midst of a conflict or under pressure probably won't have much attention for someone's looks at that point.

For a couple of examples:

#+begin_quote
  From the smoke a pair of shapes ran through a deserted section of the city. Two girls, tall for their age and well built, *one sporting a blood covered hand to go with her red t-shirt, the other wearing soot covered blue.*
#+end_quote

First intro for the protagonists in a fic I'm trying to write, note in the bolded section how there's little there on the clothing apart from contrast and indicating they'd had encounters.

#+begin_quote
  There was the sound of shearing metal as she turned to find her sister standing tall once more, *dark plate armour covering most of her body*. “Should keep a watch on your back, sis,” Megan commented over her shoulder.

  “That's what I rely on you for,” Sally replied, checking the abyssal before turning to the rest of them, a *second turret attached to her arm. A backpack shaped like her hull locked to her back, two pentad torpedo launchers locked to her legs and several other items forming over her body.* “You good?” she asked.
#+end_quote

Once again, the same pair in the same fic, but things changed, so there's things happening, though even then there's not too much description of what some things are right there.

#+begin_quote
  Commodore Shipperley met her gaze easily. “Commander, let me introduce you to the beginnings of your new command. Angela Kilburn, HMNB Devonport,” he indicated the young woman in an *older navy uniform.*

  As the woman stepped back, Shipperley indicated the blonde teen. “Robyn Stevens, HMS Zenith, pennant number R95,” this time the fourteen year old in a *cadet working uniform* nodded.

  “And you obviously know the other pair, Megan Jones, the new ‘Rhyfelwr' of Plymouth and Sally Jones, newly awakened HMS Zephyr pennant R19.” *Both her nieces were wearing what looked like their cadet uniforms.*
#+end_quote

Once again, they've changed outfit, but there's not much to the descriptions even then beyond 'navy uniform' or 'cadet uniform'. Most navies tend towards somewhat similar styles for working uniforms so people can probably imagine it.

** Look... I'm not great at writing but I do strongly believe in being sparing about descriptions of anything... including clothes. It's a lot of extraneous detail in many situations so what matters is to focus on the important stuff.

For example, I've been working on an Azkaban escape fic so descriptions are obviously pretty important. First, naturally, comes the Prison Description (of which there are many in even my short, WIP fic, but only one describes the clothes). Second, comes the "escape" description. And I guess eventually there'll be a third important description: the resolution/ending... with a possible epilogue description too. But even in this context I don't think I've been over describing. Consider the escape description (prior to acquiring a hat to hide Harry's scar):

#+begin_quote
  C crossed the plaza with purpose. She looked a lot better than when she'd gone into the hospital. So did Potter, of course, but Alice had proved a better judge of C's size than Potter's. Where her second hand muggle t-shirt and jeans fit C well, the suit Alice found for Potter was made for a larger man who'd followed 90s fashions closely. It wasn't the 1990s. Worse still, the salmon colour scheme did not suit the auburn beard Potter opted to keep, despite the barber's advice. He did agree to have it tidied up, though. Fitting in was important.
#+end_quote

(Alice is an OC muggle Doctor, not Alice Longbottom. She's barely in the story and gets a very cursory description (she had a pimple)... her colleague gets a tiny bit more because I wanted to make a joke.)

There are also two more muggle OCs in the third (as far as I'm in) chapter. They don't get any description of their clothes at all. Vernon is also in the chapter. As it happens, I do mention the colour of his tie, but nothing else.

I would argue that the quality of the writing has to be pretty good to sustain more detailed descriptions. I mean, that paragraph above is reasonably wordy but the actual level of detail is pretty scant, right?

** If you want to have wizarding clothes very different from the normal ones AND you even care for it, then you should have very firm idea what you are talking and some background document like [[https://is.gd/z6uqnT][this one by /u/Taure]]. However, the point is that you cannot overwhelm reader with it. You can use it only when it actually makes some point in the story. So, yes, I don't want to know what color of jeans Ginny had when went shopping groceries to Ottery St Catchpole (I don't want to know that she was putting on her clothes at all, that is just assumed by her getting up), but it MAY be important when she is going out for the ball and she is trying to impress Harry.

** most fanfiction is good because it goes over the top with details. you wouldn't want to read a dark-harry without extremely long winded inner monologues. if your harry is getting on with his life describing the things and places he chooses to live it in sets the scene and mood the same way.

of course if you want your story to read like a regular book you should leave out all these descriptions so your reader can imagine themselves as the main character.

** It depends on the situation.

It can give you great inside of a person or situation. You could describe how everybody in the office wore a dark blue slim suit, and it gave the pov character a uniform feeling.

Or in a smut scene you can describe the clothes in really great detail, if you describe how those features make the other character feels or thinks about out it

Describing clothes is a way of show in writing, but sometimes tell is just enough to tell
