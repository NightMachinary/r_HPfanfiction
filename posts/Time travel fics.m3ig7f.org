I will read any time travel fic you recommend, but i want to know if anyone has seen a fic with Harry time traveling while he's in sixth year, i always see fics with him from Ootp or after the war, but i think it could be really interesting seeing him time travel to marauders era while he's in HBP or DH He wouldn't know everything about the horocruxs, so he can start doing research about them, he could know about Regulus real loyalties if he travels in DH but not Snape's, or if he travels in HBP he would still trust Snape

Anyways, please recommend me any time travel fic you like

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

** I'd really like to recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410]] but Harry is from OotP (beginning cjapters) However, I figured since it doesn't have to deal with the typical OotP time traveling plot (i.e. Department of Mysteries) you might be interested.
