Like Harry, Blaise, Anthony and Susan become friends early on and go through the adventures and dangers Harry and they by proxy, have to face.

Like in a story I ones read: "Any individual of any house can become great but when all put together on one goal... They become unstoppable." Or something along those lines.


** This happens in the latter parts of linkao3(The Perils of Innocence by avidbeader), which is awesome even for some other reasons. Unfortunately, it is still unfinished and upgrades are very slow (but still ongoing, the last one 2020-04-06).

  AU. In an institute to help children with mental and psychological problems, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.
