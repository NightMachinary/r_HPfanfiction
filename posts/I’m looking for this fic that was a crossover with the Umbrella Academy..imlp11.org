The plot was that Klaus was Regulus's son. It had a gender bent Regulus and it took place during the Order of the Phoenix. If you have any recommendations that would be great.

*** I read it on ao3, I don't remember a quote but I do remember that the first chapter had a lot of stuff from the scene in the book when they were looking at the tapestry.
