** WBWL with a believable story. Not an extremely powerful Harry not the cliche Lord of multiple houses or the creature inheritance. Preferable with redemption arcs. (And please don't say Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin. I have already read it)

*** In my opinion the only believable wbwl story in the Fandom is linkffn(Three Black Birds). Unlikely to have read that one. No abuse or major neglect. Harry is on good terms with his family in spite of wbwl.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL
