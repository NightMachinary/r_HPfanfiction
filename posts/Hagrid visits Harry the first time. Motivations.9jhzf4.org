What if the reason that Hagrid was sent to rescue Harry from the Dursleys had less to do with Dumbledore's machinations and more to do with Hagrid? I imagine Hagrid asking Dumbledore every single day about "little Harry" for ten years straight. And it would seem in character for the man with the biggest heart in cannon. I can see other characters forgetting about him at the Dursleys, but not Hagrid.


** It was nice that it was Hagrid that showed up to give Harry his letter. Im not sure Mcgonagall, of Flitwick would of knocked a door down, bent Vernon's shotgun, and given Dudley Lardass a pig tail for the way they treated him. To think, if Hagrid hadn't picked Harry up, he likely would of never met Hedwig. I think Hagrid's motivations were to James and Lily, and he would of been deeply disturbed to find out how the Durleys treated Harry when he was growing up.

** I'm guessing the timing just lined up. Dumbledore was getting annoyed with Harry not receiving his letter and it coincided with Hagrid's errand to pick up the Stone. Two birds, one spell.

**** "Albus, it's been a week and Mr. Potter still hasn't responded to his letter. I think it's time to send someone there in person."

"Yes, Minerva, I agree. Where is he now?"

"Cokeworth, apparently."

"I see. Unfortunately, I cannot spare the time necessary to meet young Mr. Potter myself. Would you perhaps be able to do so?"

"No. Not for a while. Perhaps..."

"...perhaps what, Minerva?"

"Well, there's always Severus. He lives nearby, I believe."

"..."

"..."

"...I think I'll send Hagrid after him instead."

"Yes, that's probably for the best."
