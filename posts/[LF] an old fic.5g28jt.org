I don't remember much.

Pretty sure it was Hermione POV.

And all I remember for sure is that at one point during second year Ginny is possessed completely by TR and TR goes skinny dipping in black lake after talking to Hermione and gets caught by a teacher

*** Thank you so much!

I found it this morning lol and read it. I now realized why I sorta forgot about it. The ending was disappointing :(

Oh well, still I really appreciate you finding it for me!

Edit: sorry I just got on Reddit today!

**** All good, I'm glad you found it! It was a bit disappointing for me, as well, I just started skimming towards the end.
