** Sincerely Yours, by The Sorting Cat, is a pen pal fic between Harry and Fleur, told through the letters. You need a DLP account to view, though.

** Well, it's not exactly about pen pals, but I'm going to leave the [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/category/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][Shoebox Project]] here anyway. Letters play a central role in this story and if you read the PDF chapters, you even get an impression of the handwriting. If you haven't already read it, give it a try; it's a classic. Features notes and letters from Remus, Sirius, James, Lily, Severus and Peter

** A term to use in search if you haven't already is "epistolary fiction" or "epistolary novel" (see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistolary_novel][Wikipedia]])

A fun non-fanfic example is /Sorcery and Cecelia/ co-written by accomplished fantasy authors Pat Wrede and Caroline Stevermer.
