Hit me with every story featuring three people trying to make a relationship work, preferably fairly lengthy ones.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]], linkffn(5604382), is a long Harry/Multi fic and does a good job in writing the relationship, but it involves magical compulsion and contains serious Dumbledore/Molly/Ron bashing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942), also uses some form of magical bond and adds Force connection on top of that. Luna sort of offered herself to balance out Harry because Hermione could no longer contain Harry's darkness. But overall, this is a very entertaining story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771), has the romantic Trio. The story is not very long and is a crossover with Kantai Fleet Girls, but Trio relationship is well done and the fleet actions are excellent.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]], linkffn(10493620), is M/F/M and handles their relationships very well, although the story is only 25k words long.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), mentions the Trio living and sleeping together, but there is no indication of conventional romance. They mostly comforted, plotted, and trained together.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

** Apologies for not contributing, but I just thought I would comment that I too would like to see some good ones. Most stories I have seen have Harry marrying two women and them just miraculously not minding (because the wizarding world is just like that, eh?). The sister wives thing is rarely developed in a healthy or believable way. While I prefer normal single pairings, a well written story centered on a poly-amorous relationship with all members in love with each other could be fun to read.

*** Is Sister-wife even a word? I read it a couple times but found it odd. I mean, a three-way marriage should not involve sisterly feelings, right?

**** Description for a situation in a polygamous marriage where the multiple wives have no romantic relationship for each other, just with their husband. They are part of a family though, hence sister-wives.

Describing these situations is a bit difficult, but a marriage with a husband and two 'sister-wives' is not what I would call a three-way marriage, because the two women are not married to each other, just both to the man.

Of course when this shows up in fanfiction it is quite often not just two wives, but a massive harem because apparently a lot of people find that appealing.

** linkao3(Trichromatic) is pretty good. There are several James/Sirius/Lily or James/Sirius/Remus shorter fics on AO3 as well, but few go past the 10k mark and most are under 5k. Are you interested in those as well?

  The loss of magic had started, as do many things like it, with good intentions. The past century, it was reasoned, had been overshadowed by two of the worst Dark Lords in history. What better way, then, to make sure it never happened again than to stop it before it started? After all it was a well-known fact that those with an affinity for Dark Magic were born with it, so why not tackle the problem at the source? The Department of Mysteries were set on the problem, and two years after the final death of the Dark Lord Voldemort, they released their solution into the world.It worked for all of two months before the magical disease began to mutate beyond their wildest nightmares.
