****** I'm just going by what Wikipedia tells me:

#+begin_quote
  Omegaverse, also known as A/B/O, is a subgenre of speculative erotic fiction, and originally a subgenre of erotic fan fiction. Stories in the genre are premised on societies wherein humans are divided into a dominance hierarchy of dominant "alphas", neutral "betas", and submissive "omegas".

******* Yup that's it But it's not always erotica in the sense that there are omegaverse one shots with only fluff

******** Still doesn't really seem to be something that would be typically in my wheelhouse. Anything I've read that came close to that had Harry as an alpha.
