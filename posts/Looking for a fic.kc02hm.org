:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I know this might sound odd but I'm looking for a fic that at the end of one chapter it has a little omake where one of the teachers uses a japanese version of a devil snare (can't remember the name and maybe that's why I can't find the damn fic) and says that it prefers females to males and it ends up picking Cedric Diggory as a “female”

I know that they are on the triwizard tournament at that point (I think I do at least) and I know that it is a somewhat long fic, having more than 60K words at least.

Please oh please help me find this damn thing if only so I can remember if it is worth the time it took to search for it!!
