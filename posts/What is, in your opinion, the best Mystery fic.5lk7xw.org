I suddenly really want to read a mystery fic.

Bonus points if Harry is the one causing the mystery; where he's running the show, so to speak.

Over 100k+ words.


** linkffn(Murder Most Horrid)

Has a couple of whodunit type arcs.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.
