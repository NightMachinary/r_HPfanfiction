Have you met any fics where other characters Intercede for slytherins in hogwarts? I mean, not just other slytherins and Snape but griffindors, hufflepuffs and ravenclaws. Story should be set in 5th or 7th year I think. For example, Umbridge is going to give a detention to little halfblood slytherin for using magic in the corridors and Potter who stood near takes blame. Or 7th year, Neville receives Crucio for defending little pack of children from all houses.

Any mentions?


** If you're alright with drarry, linkao3(3101099) has Harry standing up for Slytherins/trying to get the other houses to treat them better a few times. It is an 8th year AU, though, so doesn't fit your timing preference.

  On returning to Hogwarts for their Eighth Year, Headmistress McGonagall decided to room Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter together. She may have hoped for a leading example of house unity; the other students fully expected insults and fights. But nothing happened.That was, until Harry sleepwalked into Draco's bed.Sep 2015: now available in Indonesian here, thanks to akira-tm/neko chuudoku :)Dec 2015: now available in Chinese here (registration required) and here (no registration), thanks to greencherry :DNov 2016: now available in Korean here, thanks to persephon!

** In Pet Project linkffn(2290003), Hermione steps in to stop a younger Slytherin from being bullied by people from other houses, and there is an ongoing arc of changing attitudes towards Slytherins, including having some joining the DA. The story is SSHG, but only really towards the end. It centers around a growing mentor/student friendship between Snape and Hermione and has some very enjoyable magic in it, as well as a Dumbledore who is painted in shades of grey without it veering into bashing. The Slytherin-vs-everyone else issue is examined quite a bit.

  Hermione overhears something she shouldn't concerning Professor Snape and decides that maybe the House-elves aren't the only ones in need of protection.
