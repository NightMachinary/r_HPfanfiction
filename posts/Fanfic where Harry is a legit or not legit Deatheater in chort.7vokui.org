** I read a one shot like that where his brother was the boy who lived, and Harry was an undercover deatheater under the orders of Dumbledore. The one shot was about his trial, but sadly I don't remember the name.

****** Might've been better with an evaluation or something.

'I read that one...'

'and liked it. That's the sort I'm looking for.' or

'and it wasn't bad but also dropped off incomplete. If you know similar stories that are complete or still updating, add them in.' or

'and it left a bad taste. Hopefully we'll find a better example.'
