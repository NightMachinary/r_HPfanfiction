Arthur and Molly had seven children, and it wouldn't be farfetched if the siblings aren't on good terms on each other (In canon for example, the twins burnt a hole Ron's tongue, killed his pet puffskein with a bludger and transfigured his teddy bear into a tarantula which ended up being his worst fear (even though he faced Voldemort), Percy Weasley and the rest of the siblings and also how nobody noticed that Ginny was possessed by Voldemort in book 2)

  The war is won, Fred is dead, Percy has failed to come back, all the other kids have temporarily moved back home, and emotions are running high at the Burrow. Who gets into a big fight? What horrid thing happens, or almost happens? What will the consequences be? Will there be a divorce? Whose side will each family member take? Most importantly,will the Weasleys be able to fix this?

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** linkffn(Yellow Submarine)

Story is pretty fucked up but it's good for the most part (Barring some clearly abandoned plot threads that definitely cross the line into being in poor taste)

Though I'd also just say, like I'm not exactly sure how any of the Weasley's could have known that Ginny was possessed. It's not like they teach you how to recognise signs of Posession and it's not even a common occurrence from what we know, and even in the case of the Imperius curse, it's hard for people to know for sure. That's at least part of the reason why people could claim they were under the Imperius curse to escape judgement, though obviously not the only factor.

  Alternate Universe. Two hurting, almost broken people reach toward the sunlight. This story has implied sexual violence and a Ginny who is two years younger than she was in canon.
