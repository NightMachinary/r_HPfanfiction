  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

  When the past and present collide with the Potter/Weasley children... A bit AU with characters' names and some pairings. Family tree now posted on my profile page. 3/16/10 -- going back and cleaning up a few things; nothing major will change.

**** I understand that part. But whose family did you want to see? Ginny and Harry's? James and Lily? Ron and Hermione's? Snape and Hermiones? (shudders)

linkffn(12192798) is rather solid even with the H/Hr.

  Post OotP - Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. But, the war is escalating outside and the Order of the Phoenix needs to rise to the challenge of defeating Voldemort and his Death Eaters once and for all. They just might have to make bigger sacrifices than they had imagined. Harry and Sirius bonding fic. No slash. Semi-canon compliant.

  The war is won, Fred is dead, Percy has failed to come back, all the other kids have temporarily moved back home, and emotions are running high at the Burrow. Who gets into a big fight? What horrid thing happens, or almost happens? What will the consequences be? Will there be a divorce? Whose side will each family member take? Most importantly,will the Weasleys be able to fix this?
