Just had this thought. He just sealed his fate by doing that I reckon.

If there was a one-shot dealing with this, I'd read it.


** Ron looked at the body in horror. He couldn't believe that his friend was... ‚ÄúHey! That's not Harry. Harry wears glasses.‚Äù

‚ÄúStupid purebloods‚Äù Voldemort muttered.

Ollivander would probably recognise him, however, due to being too busy talking about wands and thus not noticing the glasses at all.

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

** Not the funniest possible way to write this, but...

‚ÄòDumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you, little boy -- I reached the wand before you could get your hands on it, I understood the truth before you caught up. I killed Severus Snape three hours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine! Dumbledore's last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!'

‚ÄòYeah, it did,' said Harry. ‚ÄòYou're right.'

‚ÄòI'm Neville,' said Neville Longbottom.

‚ÄòOh, OK.' Harry turned toward a tall figure wreathed in flames. ‚ÄòAnyway, Voldemort, before you try to kill me ...'

‚ÄòI'm Ron.'

‚ÄòSorry.' Tall and bald one, then. ‚ÄòI'd advise you to think about what you've done.'

‚ÄòKingsley.'

‚ÄòMerlin! Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle ...'

‚ÄòYou're talking to Bellatrix's corpse, mate.'

‚ÄòAccio Harry Potter's Glasses!' Voldemort broke in. ‚ÄòNow, can we get this over with? I regret this already!'

** ‚ÄúAvada Kedavra!‚Äù

‚ÄúExpelliarmus!‚Äù

Even as the sickly green of the Killing Curse left the tip of the Elder Wand, moans and gasps of dread could be heard echoing throughout the hall as Harry's spell flew wide of the Dark Lord, hitting his friend Ron Weasley instead. Ron's wand arced gracefully through the air, coincidentally interposing itself between the Boy Who Lived and his approaching death. The impact of the spell caused his wand to violently explode. The hall was silent.

Harry cleared his throat awkwardly. ‚ÄúWell, then,‚Äù he said.

Ron gazed fornlornly at his now-empty wand hand.

‚ÄúLet's try it again?‚Äù Harry suggested, unconfidently.

‚ÄúI suppose,‚Äù agreed Voldemort

And thats the story of how the Battle of Hogwarts eventually resulted in the destruction of almost every wand in Great Britain

** Similarly to this, I'll never understand why Voldemort sent Narcissa of all people to make sure he was dead. Outside of Hagrid, she was the most likely to lie to him. He could have called on anyone other than her and they would have told him that Harry was alive. Seriously, Harry's one lucky bastard. Apart from... you know... the last sixteen years of his life. So in a way, it all balanced out. kinda.

At the end of the story, they finally kill Voldemort. Only for Draco Malfoy to have backstabbed them, called them all terrorists (again), take over the Ministry, and send them on the run.
