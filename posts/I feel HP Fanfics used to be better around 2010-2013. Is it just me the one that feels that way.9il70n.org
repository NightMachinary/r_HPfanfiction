I'm not saying there are not great fics outside that timeframe, or that every fic in that time frame it's good. It's just that I have been in this fandom for a long time and I feel I found the best fics in between 2010-2013 (I'm not counting fics published before the completions of the books because I can see how they may clash with canon). Before 2010 most fics were mostly OC oriented, with a Mary Sue that was supposed to be edgy because they listen to MCR (No hate on MCR) or super powered-Harry fics or shipping Hermione with everybody. And then in 2010, fics started to get better, we had fewer Mary Sues, and more original plots. And then I feel like from 2013 and on, people are so deep in headcanon and fan theories that they forgot what's actually canon and that lead to terrible characterizations and plot holes in fics. Maybe it's just me that feels that way. I would like to hear you guys opinion.


** I have been reading HP fanfiction for about 15 years now and I think that itself is the main problem. For me as well as for others. I have read it all and if there is another fic that did this or that a little better I probably have read it as well. I am overly critical, because I have found and read exactly what I like, but cannot seem to quit. Most of the ideas bore me nowadays, simply because I have read another better fic with them before and the truly unique ideas out there usually stay in a oneshot or never make it past the prompt.

I do not think the authors became worse, I just became more whiney.

**** By 2010, most of the people who grew up on Harry Potter were old enough to write well. In 2007, many of these people were angsty teens, which characterizes much of the fanfiction written during that time.

The difference you've noticed between 2010 versus 2014 is probably due to the fact that there are fewer people writing and thus fewer good fics. After you've already made up your mind confirmation bias takes over. The overall quality probably hasn't changed much or even increased since 2013.

Examples, three of the highest quality fics ever written were published after 2014: Linkffn(Resurrexit by Master Slytherin; Grow Young with me by Taliesin19; The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger)

*** I been in the Harry Potter fandom since the very beginning but I only started reading fics in 2007. I don't know if it is nostalgia, maybe. I feel like in the earlier days fics were not very well written, then they improved and now while the qualitity is good the characterization is off. As if it is a very good story, but not a Harry Potter one. As in people had forgotten what is canon. IDK how to explain it.

Edit: I don't mean like canon couples, since we can ship whatever we want and fanfiction is a place where we can explore AUs, What if and so on. I mean like characters tend to be OoC now.

You can bet on that. For example, Summer of Change is one of the most iconic Harry/Tonks stories. And while it definitely influenced my own writing, I never got through the whole thing because its concepts have been done to death by now (OP Harry, Training montages). You can cut 100k words from the story and end up improving its writing quality.

** I can compare this view to how I think most anime series produced from 2006-2010 were the best ever in history. Right now though, I can't stand watching just any anime anymore. The story has to be either unique or really well-written (as in no glaring plotholes) for me to get into them. It could just be fatigue from seeing stories get rehashed through time.

Of course, younger anime fans will scoff at my view and say the newer series are better. Older fans will of course say the older ones were better.

Anyway all I want to say is that age and life experiences plays a role, in the appreciation of a story, whether anime or fanfic.

** I started reading fanfiction probably around 2008/9 when I was in middle school (and boy were some of my reading choices strange). I'd have to agree that the best fiction was written then. It took me a while to get to the really good, more serious fics, but because I'd read so many stupid ones I appreciated it more. I have read some good ones that are recent, but the truly legendary ones were all written between 2010 and 2013. The vast majority that I re-read and would recommend are all from that time period.

** I personally don't think it's better I think it was a compounding of a few factora

More Fanfiction coming out at the same time, when there were dozens of fics being updated a day it was simple to find new stories to read and lose yourself in. I started reading in like 2010, it seemed like every few months there was a new epic that stuck with me, now I'm waiting months on end to find the 'next one'

Less fear of building off each other, many stories of the time use the same ideas and game plans on basic ideas aka Azkaban Harry stories. But many did radically different things which lead to more writers joining on and making new threat Ideas and on and on til the idea became stale but writers weren't afraid to go 'that's cool this is how I would do it'

We all know what we want to read, 8 years ago many of us were just starting reading, we didn't know what to read and so even the dumbest ideas that make us close the tab we're things that kept us hanging on for chapters on end. As I've become older I'm done with much of the slice of life, fluff and now I want high octane action fics. As our horizons become for focused the more we can see what is quality and what isn't
