All I can remember: Draco has a squib son. The Malfoys have had a number of squibs over the years (including a sibling to Draco) that they killed. I'm pretty sure Hermione and Draco have a developing friendship as Draco slowly realizes his son is a squib and Hermione helps him in integrating his son into the muggle world.
