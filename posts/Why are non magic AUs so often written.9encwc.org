Like at that point, why not just change the names and write your own original content? Is it just so people can practice and have a large fan base to review their work?

I just don't really get it.


** Some people care far more about characters than settings (including magic).

Most of non-magic AUs indeed disappoint, but I've a couple exceptions:

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and Boy Who Lived]] is great and often recommended here, but it's set in a sci-fi AU with superpowers (although the Trio doesn't have it).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there), is a nice H/G romance written by the same author of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]], another sub favorite.

** I don't write AU but one of my previous stories got criticised for not having enough magic in. I guess I just love the characters and emotional drama more than big flashy duels. I am working on including more magic with my current one though.

I'm not sure why you would make a wholly Muggle AU though.

**** Well I imagine those are VERY character driven, and I think especially for people looking for a gay romance there is enough there to create a story without including magic. Remus in particular has been mentioned by Rowling to be a reflection of the way people treat people with Aids so I guess authors run with that.

***** Remus is a really shitty Aids analogy. He didn't get the curse through unprotected werewolf sex or shared needles, he got it from a guy who wanted to teach his father a lesson when he was six.

****** Seems pretty good to me:

- lifelong ailment
- treated poorly by society (not so much anymore, but early 90's, hoo-boy)
- not actually dangerous in day-to-day life and if proper precautions are taken during specific times, minimal danger
- no cure, only amelioration
- over a long time, has a wasting effect on health
- can get it through no fault of your own, or out of ignorance, or carelessness, or due to another person's malice

I mean, as far as AIDS allegories go, Remus is pretty on-point.

****** It's not meant to be that Remus literally has Aids, it's meant to be about people's responses to it - fear of contamination even though it's transferred under a certain set of circumstances, unfair associations with immoral behaviour, difficulty in managing the condition, likelihood of losing your job, etc. Obviously treatment of HIV people has got a lot better but Rowling worked for Amnesty International during the Aids crisis.

******* It is still a horrible analogy if the guy who represents a disease usually transmitted through carelessness or ignorance got it when he was violated as a child because his father angered a mobster.

The analogy also falls short since lycanthropy makes people mindless monsters whereas Aids does not have the same effect.

********* But the children with Aids have it because their parents didn't use protection.

Unless you are referring to those cases where groups of cavemen (and I know that this is insulting towards actual cavemen) rape little boys because they believe that this would cure Aids.

********** Honestly what is wrong with you? Plenty of people get HIV as a result of abuse, rape, cheating partners, medical accidents with blood transfusions, needles, deliberate misinformation by missionaries, etc. Don't call sufferers ignorant or careless, it's such a backwards, hateful attitude to have.

Besides, you're not exactly helping your point here - Remus could be an analogy of a child who contracted an illness as a result of abuse or from his parent.

Either way, it doesn't matter HOW Remus or anyone else got it, the point is the way people treat him is the same. If an analogy is word for word the same, its not exactly a metaphor is it

*********** Those who get it through crimes (rape, abuse) are a small minority.

The vast majority of aids children/orphans got it through their parents, the search you linked says exactly that.

People who get it as a result of a crime are treated very differently than those who get it through their own fault.

************ Just stop. I am telling you, stop. What you are saying is honestly so unpleasant.

Even if in your miracle world where everyone gets aids by deliberately choosing not to use condoms and never doing drugs, no one deserves it or should be discarded as ignorant or careless, and nor should they be treated any differently.

I'm not going to discuss this any further with you.
