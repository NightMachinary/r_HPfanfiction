Merlin figures into the HP backstory enough that ISTM that Camelot must have been connected to Wizarding Britain in Merlin's time. It could be that Arthur and the Knights were all muggles, but other wizards were around too (Morgana etc. at the very least). Are there any Potterverse stories that go into this? Could be time travel, could be prequel, just plain crossover, or whatever. Thanks.


** There is this (slash and femslash) fic which is a crossover with the Merlin tv show: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/238898]]

Merlin (Slytherin), Morgana (Ravenclaw), Gwen (Hufflepuff) and Arthur (Gryffindor) are the founders of hogwarts and there is a timeline switch half way through when they timetravel

*** Thanks and omg I didn't even realize there was a Merlin tv show. I guess I must have heard of it and forgotten about it though. That's an interesting take about the Camelot characters being the Hogwarts founders.

**** I'd recommend the tv show as well! it's fun, it's not super high budget but it has great acting and storylines.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
