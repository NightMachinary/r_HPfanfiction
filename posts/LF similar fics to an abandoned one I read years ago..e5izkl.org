The abandoned fic went like this. Basically Harry get's declared insane during his second year because he hears "voices" and put in St. Mungos. Then he turns dark and eventually escapes. Any fics that go in that direction?


** Psychosis by SnowWhiteOwl on FFN is really good. It has the voices aspect because of the horcrux, but he doesn't go dark later in the story. He's also not treated in St Mungos, but by muggle psychiatrists, which was a very different but interesting perspective. P.S. on mobile rn and can't figure out how to properly link the story with the bot

** Can you link the abandonded one? I'm really interested.

I think there was one like that by Quillbreaker, but it only had the insane asylum aspect of it, not anything else. Dumbledore was evil, but it isn't the cliche kind, he was even more evil than tom - It made me shudder.
