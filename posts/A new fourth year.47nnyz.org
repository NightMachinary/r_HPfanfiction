Hey yall. its that time of year again...Im looking for fourth year fics... give me your best recommendations. They have to be updated within the last year (or complete) and they must be over 80k words. Thanks!

A Cadmean Victory. It starts at the fourth year, but in later chapters it gets further in the years. It's not an incredible fanfiction, but it's a good one, and worth reading. It actually legitimately surprised me a few times, right when I thought something stereotypical was going to happen.

** I'll reccomend linkffn(4641394). One of the few fics that make me cry every reread. It's entirely 4th year based and takes an interesting plot twist early that shapes the rest of the fic and its conflict wonderfully. Not everyone's cup of tea, but worth reading.

The ending is fucking tragic though. A less depressing ending can actually be found in the author's WIP dump on their profile, so if the ending is unsatisfactory for you there's a happier one you can read instead. Both are well written and plausible ends.

****** True, but I really think its the tragic parts of this particular fic that make it as memorable as it is. Harry dealing with not only school and the tournament, but the tradgedy of who and what he is and trying to come to some sort of terms with how this will effect him is a wonderfully emotional experience to read about.

A happier version could also have a lot of potential to it, but I'm not entirely sure how you'd pull off this premise in any way that could be seen as 'this is okay and not upsetting to learn about at all'. Could you maybe conjecture some happier plot threads? It'd be interesting to see alternative versions of this idea.

******* Well, off-hand, I'd say a happy ending would already change the story from a tragedy. Though for a more in-depth change, I'd focus on dealing with the revelations thanks to a modern outlook. Hermione wold be key as one of the few sticking with her friend, no matter his origins or "nature". She would also have the background (modern values, probably having read SciFi stories that deal with this question as well) to help Harry accept that what matters is his mind, not his body. Ron staying his friend would work too. Basically, the trio versus the rest of the world, sticking together and winning in the end, and giving the finger to all notions about Blood and other prejudices.

******** True, that would change it quite a bit. I think that in the case of the trio vs. everyone pot thred, it would need to happen either 3rd year or 5th year instead of during the tournament in order to work. Ron is already ostracizing Harry during this period and he likely wouldn't come arond until far later if Harry's 'nature' is revealed during 4th year. He holds grdges too long and stubborns hiw way through things too much to get over it in time for 4th year trio dynamics to return.

Of course then something other than the goblet would need to ct asa catalyst to reveal what harry is then; perhaps the dementors in 3rd year or the mind games with voldemort and snape in 5th.

changing the year wuld also change how Harry would respond just based on his past experiences; 3rd year harry would likely deal with it better, since he's just dealt with the 'heir of Slytherin' debacle and is better adjusted to dealing with the shunning. 5th year harry would be coming off of cederic's death, and considering how poorly he handled that alone in canon, adding something like a complete shift in his undestanding of himself and who he is wouldn't end well. Ron might be more iclined to stick close though, having learnt not to be as jealous the year previous by the end of the tourney.

Herione would be instrumental though, in helping him handle the fallout. TBH this could make a really nice premise for a politicking fic given enough thought.

********* I generally write Ron as the kid that was ready to die for Harry twice (book 1 and 3), growing up. I don't really care about his portrayal in the later books, I feel his character was wrecked for cheap angst.

I'm a bit wary of politicking in school - kids simply don't have that much clout or experience.

Though a story where Harry becomes aware of being a decoy early on, and then fills in his friends might be possible as well. It would derail the canon train just as early though.

********** I agree that Ron gets shoved aside later on, but I try not to ignore any part of canon if I can help it. The books can be contradictory and even degrade the characters at times, but they still help characterize them and grow them. Book four illustrates is jealous streak, which is reasonable given his upbringing as the last son in a long line who got nothing but hand me downs his whole life.

I meant more that it would set them up to be interested in it earlier on, and then they could really get into it during the later books timelines and after. Set up for it while in school and then start up a political strom once they graduate with what they've built up during their school years.

It'd definitely derail canon a lot; there'd be totally different issue and challenges to face given this knowledge earlier on. Of course, earlier in the timeine, Dumbledore likely wouldn't know if Harry was still somehow the chosen one given he was mared, and would manevuer to keep him around. Justifying this to the ministry would be a nightmare though and it'd likely lead into some very interesting and drastic choices needing to be made.

************* I think the canon characters are ruined by having to serve as plot devices - especially Dumbledore. He is supposed to be wise, powerful, and benevolent, with decades of experience and a tragic past. A man willing to do what's right, not what's easy.

And in canon? He's a stupid plot device, rendered impotent so Harry can be both tortured and angsty in every damn book and save the day since the adults are useless. His actions and inactions in canon utterly ruin a great character, just because the plot demands it.

And most of the characters are treated that way in the later books. So, I try to stay true to how the characters are portrayed, not how they act in canon. And that means discarding much of the canon.

I'm currently writing two weekly stories, and have three more planned out, so I don't have the time for another story for several months.

** My story "Patron" starts in 4th year, though it's an AU (First two chapters set the stage by detailing some key differences in the past, chapter 3 onward deals with 4th year). It has a different tournament as well (different tasks, additional competitions for the other students). The part dealing with 4th year is over 80K, so that requirement is fulfilled.

Lots changed, much of what was planned was dropped or altered significantly as the characters developed (taking a sort of life of their own), but that scene didn't really Change fundamentally.

The story's in the last arc, a few more chapters I'd say, depends on how long it takes to wrap up a number of side plots. (Though originally I thought "30 chapters, 10 per school year" - that didn't pan out.)

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.
