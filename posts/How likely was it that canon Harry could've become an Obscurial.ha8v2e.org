I haven't seen Fantastic Beasts. So I'm not much sure myself.


** I find the argument that he cannot become an Obscurial because he doesn't reject his freakishness(he can't, really, since he lacks context) quite persuasive. The idea is that he doesn't actually reject the weird things that happen around him, he accepts that they have happened and moves on.

It would be different if, say, the Dursleys told him he was possessed by a demon, and made out exactly how terrible that is, or promised they would love him like a son if he would just stop being such a freak.

Since they don't, he doesn't repress his magic, and so is overall at negligible risk of becoming an obscurial.

** Personally I doubt that Harry was ever close to becoming an Obscurial.

(Terminology point: Obscurials are the host to a magical parasite. The parasite is the Obscurus.)

Remember, an Obscurial develops when a young witch or wizard /rejects or suppresses their own magic/. That rejection somehow creates a magical entity, the Obscurus, which is parasitical upon them. Obscurials are not created by abuse generally speaking, or unhappiness. You only become an Obscurial if you internalise the abuse - in Harry's case, if he had believed the Dursleys that magic was bad and being normal was good.

But canon Harry never adopts the Dursley world view. He never admires normalcy or desires to be "just Harry". That's something fanon created somehow. But canon is almost completely the opposite: the opening of PS explicitly notes that Harry's favourite thing about himself is his scar, specifically because it is different and not normal.

Further, I just don't think it's in Harry's canonical nature to internalise the Dursley's abuse.

Harry has many defining traits. Amongst them are loyalty, wit, curiosity, stubbornness, a cool head, and the ability make almost prescient leaps of insight. But probably his most prominent characteristics are his exceedingly resilient spirit and moral certainty.

Basically, Harry's spirit is just too defiant to ever just accept the Dursley's treatment of him. After 9 years of living under the Dursleys' roof, before he even knew about magic, he remained defiant.

#+begin_quote
  They stuff people's heads down the toilet first day at Stonewall,' he told Harry. ‘Want to come upstairs and practise?'

  ‘No thanks,' said Harry. ‘The poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it -- it might be sick.' Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he'd said.
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in grey water.

  ‘What's this?' he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.

  ‘Your new school uniform,' she said.

  Harry looked in the bowl again.

  ‘Oh,' he said. ‘I didn't realise it had to be so wet.'
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Get the post, Dudley,' said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.

  ‘Make Harry get it.'

  ‘Get the post, Harry.'

  ‘Make Dudley get it.'

  ‘Poke him with your Smeltings stick, Dudley.'
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smeltings stick.

  ‘I want to read that letter,' he said loudly.

  ‘I want to read it,' said Harry furiously, ‘as it's mine.'

  ‘Get out, both of you,' croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.

  Harry didn't move.

  ‘I WANT MY LETTER!' he shouted.
#+end_quote

In short: it's in Harry's nature to be a snarky little shit who backchats anyone who he disagrees with. His will is simply too strong for him to ever have become an Obscurial.

** Probably no chance.

1. The Dursleys are thankfully too cowardly to abuse Harry so much that he feared ever using magic.
2. Harry doesn't know magic to hold it back.
3. Once Harry knows about magic he's far too stubborn and rebellious to let the Dursleys make him feel bad about it. Any increased abuse to "beat the freak out of him" is just gonna make him more stubborn and rebellious about it.

In general Harry's lack of respect for the Dursleys' "normalcy" and desire to be special are too important to him to ever become an Obscurial.

** Lore wise? Probably not likely, he wasn't repressing his magic as far as i can tell. He barely knew it existed.

Plot wise. Well as has been said before no.

Fanfiction wise. Make him more aware of his magic at a young age and it is entirely possible.

** I think it very much depends on the character of person: I think you need right combination of submission and inability to fight. I guess some magical children are just beaten up, and some fight subconsciously with their accidental magic (e.g., linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel)). Only when you get the right combination of very brutal suppression of the magic in a child and very weak resistance, you get internalization of the hatred towards their own magic, and thus Obscurial.

Talking about Harry, we can see that even after many years with Dursleys he resisted to the abuse quite strongly (he still insisted on the flying motorcycle, even though he did have to know his uncle will hate it), so either he was much stronger personality or the abuse was not so bad. Pick your choice. Credence Barebone was obviously much more beaten down and went much further down the path of self-hatred.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

** Besides the Word of God (JKR) saying he is not, there is a fundamental element missing for him to become one: obscurials deliberately try to suppress their magic, until it turns inward and festers before escaping, usually in a bloody mess. Until he was 11, Harry didn't know that the "freakishness" his family hated was magic. After he found out, he was going to Hogwarts and suppressing it was the last thing he wanted.

ETA: That said, I recently read a lovely one-shot wherein young Harry learns about obscurials. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22964278][An Obscure Occupation]] by Triscribe. linkao3(22964278) plus the direct link because the bot has been lazy lately.

***** From the wiki:

#+begin_quote
  When a magical child is forced to repress their talent through physical or psychological abuse, they develop a parasitical magical force inside of them called Obscurus, resulting from their strong emotions of distress. An Obscurial may lose control when they reach their emotional and mental breaking point, releasing their Obscurus as an invisible (or nearly invisible) destructive wind. In extreme cases, they may physically transform into an Obscurus.
#+end_quote

Many people believe Ariana Dumbledore to have been an obscurial after being beat up by those muggles. It's an child that hates or fears their own magic so much that they suppress it, they lose control of their magic. This magic destroys everything when the kid loses emotional control. They don't often grow very old.

***** It's what happens when a child tries to "suppress" their magic(normally because people beat or persecute them due to it), it creates a parasitic entity that consumes the child's magic(often killing them) and then leaves.

It looks like a mass of darkness and seems to be extremely destructive.

In the Fantastic Beasts movie, you see one, but the child is so strong magically they survive it(and keep being powerful).

Newt has one in the suitcase, it was from a girl in Africa(who probably suffered due to religion)

****** I don't love that being part of canon. It comes across a bit like retrofitting midichlorians. I don't see how that can gel with accidental magic. Harry had no idea he was a wizard until /after/ the family had gone to an island in the middle of nowhere and a giant man bust down the door, but that didn't stop him from exhibiting the ability to teleport without actively willing to.

******* You misunderstand, these kids /knew/ they were magical and were mistreated heavily because of it(the movie implies physical abuse and abandonment, Newt says the girl was banished from her village and family for being a witch)

So they try to suppress their magic, desperately, until it's so bad it lashes out and starts destroying stuff.

In the movie the person who had it was constantly beaten and told how it was bad while they knew they were magical.

Harry is just too defiant to for this to happen, and as you said, he didn't know he was a wizard.

******** Oh, I see. Hmm. I still don't like it being the creation of a parasitic entity. Canon is pretty clear that magic is innate and creatures are innate. The idea of a person's magic creating a creature doesn't sit well with me as a canon-immigrating concept.

I agree that canon Harry is defiant. It's a defining trait especially considering that he is abused and has no natural allies until age 11.

********* I very much agree. If repressed magic essentially weakened their “magical immune system”, making them vulnerable to common, normally harmless, malicious spirits or something, that would be different. But the malicious entity literally being a creation of the child's repression doesn't sit well with me. It doesn't mesh with how I saw magic from the original canon, and it also feels a bit weirdly victim blaming, like it's the child's fault for the negative consequences of their abuse.

** It begs the question of if becoming an obscurial is also kind of like creating a separate personality? as the obscurial is seemingly a parasitic and highly destructive force it begs the question of if Harry could even develop one seeing as he already contains the horcrux which is essentially the same thing.

an interesting fic concept is if Harry were to form an obscurial it would be supplanted by Tom, or contained by the presence of the horcrux insuring its own survival.
