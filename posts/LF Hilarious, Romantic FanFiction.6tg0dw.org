Hello, As of late I've discovered a fascination to comedy in FF. Not slapstick, cheap comedy, but more subtle jokes that one has to look for. I was wondering if there were any Fics that combined this style of satire along with a good, well-thought out, adult/mature romance. A work that's able to heat it up while pointing out the hilarities of life at the same time. (sorry for the long post) Let me know if YOU know of any works like this!


** *Etc Etc --- and Life Goes On* - by *justonemorefic* linkffn(7217938) - this is romance/satire. It's one of the best written first-person POV fic I've read: the MC's narration is very colorful and witty, and often times hilarious.

  Extra! Extra! Clemence Fitzgerald here, reporting for Witchy Business. You're in for a treat, dear reader: Hogwarts bachelor ALBUS POTTER has acquired a girlfriend---identity unknown. Let the witch hunt begin. (an Albus/OC romance-satire set in a Hogwarts beleaguered by celebrity worship, shipping wars, and too many teen queens; Dobby Winner: Best OC, Dialogue, Description)

** Anything by waspbi is great for this. She primarily writes Draco, but her dialogue is funny and perfect. My favorite is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6239806][Stately Homes of Wiltshire]] linkao3(6239806)

  Malfoy Manor has mould, dry rot and an infestation of unusually historical poltergeists. Harry Potter is on the case.
