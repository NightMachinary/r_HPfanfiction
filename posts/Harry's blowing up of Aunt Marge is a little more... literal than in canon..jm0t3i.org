*** Lol. I mean, I really wish I could present a counterargument...\\
But it's not just Dumbledore, in fact let's assume he does the thing he does in every badly written bash: condemn allies and forgive enemies, and condemns Harry.

"And that, Minister, is why Harry Potter must go to Azkaban. It is of course regrettable, but we can't allow favoritism, no..." said Albus Dumbledore to the shock of those listening.

Given that the whole scene was happening in the bar room of Leaky Cauldron moments after the minister had arrived to assure Harry Potter that clean up was almost done and that he was not in trouble, of course, it caused quite a ruckus. Most of those speaking were not actually on Dumbledore's side. Minister himself saw this, if nothing else, he knew how to read the room.

"So you would punish a child for an episode of accidental magic?" he asked.

"Yes"

"Which occurs only for children that are either very, very young, or extremely distressed?"

"Yes, but.." Cornelius Fudge was having none of it. He continued:

"So the boy has found himself in a situation where his magic had to react in such a spectacular fashion to protect him and you want to condemn him!?" working the audience was also a skill Fudge cultivated, and it was serving him well here, he could almost feel the tide turning and Dumbledore's respect and influence melting away "After you vouched that he was safe!? After you assured us that he would be taken care of!? That we didn't need to involve ourselves!?"

"Cornelius..!"

"No, Dumbledore. This is too much. I will not have you condemn another wizarding child to that... that hell. When Lord Rosier introduced the Wizarding Child Protection Act, we thought it was too extreme, that it was not needed... Obviously , now I know better."

"But the muggles, will you truly take away their children?"

"If that's how they treat a child? Absolutely!" It was a resolute Fudge that strode out of a room, seeing an off duty Daily Prophet reporter slip away in the corner of his eye. He almost skipped as he made his way to the Ministry to put his words to action. The upcoming election would be the easiest one yet! The Protector Fudge, yes, he liked the sound of that.

Not to mention his utter incompetence at managing his nation, contributing to stalling progress in society, his actual nation-scale gaslighting for personal gain... Fudge is the Magical Trump minus the authoritarian streak, Daily Prophet is some crossover between a cheap tabloid, Breitbart and Stormfront, the Death Eaters are the Proud Boys and other far right fringes. And instead of climate change looming on the horizons, Wizards have to deal with Muggles becoming more and more powerful...

Fuck it, the entire Harry Potter series has way roo many prophetic elements.

(The only one I haven't found an equivalent for in contemporary times is a Voldemort... Trump is many things, but not /that/ cruel.)

The election is over, you won, you can stop the propaganda now. They "ran off" a truck that was driving like a dangerous lunatic, and when the cops came to investigate they found the biden truck was almost certainly at fault. Because he was driving like a fuck nut maniac before that conveniently edited video popped up.

***** Nope, but I once read a scene where Harry is angry that Fudge won the first election after Second Voldemort War in a landslide vote. He goes to a bar and loudly complains about Auror cuts, amongst other things and don't people remember him denying the Dark Lord's return until it was too late...? One of the other patrons retorts that they do remember. They also remember the aftermath of the first blood war, when Fudge was first elected and proved to be an extremely competent peace time administrator, almost singlehandedly bringing the shattered economy back up and running. Unfortunately, I do not remember which fic it was...

** I did this in a drabble I wrote. For context, it's Slytherin fem!Harry and Snape had a meeting after the Goblet of Fire spit out her name

#+begin_quote
  The Slytherin common room gapes at their Head of House. His usual method for any problem is to pour a potion on it. If a potion can't solve it, his impeccable wisdom is to “take care of it however you need to but do not, under any circumstances, get caught.”
#+end_quote

“Where's Potter,” he snaps.

“I think she's gone to bed, sir,” someone says.

Harry sighs, shoving the invisibility cloak off. “I'm here.”

Several people jump. A few cringe back in guilt. She'd decided to spy instead of giving into her exhaustion. The younger students are simply excited to have a Slytherin champion. Most of the older ones have decided to stay out of it except for the few fanatical Death Eater hellspawn. Surprisingly, Malfoy is not categorized as such. Harry might hate Lucius, but Narcissa is trying to get Draco and Harry together for the Black inheritance and quite frankly, Draco is a bit terrified of Harry. It's why she tolerates him.

“Up here, Potter.”

Harry obeys. She's always on her best behavior with Snape. She wants him to like her so desperately that sometimes she hates him for refusing.

“Harry Potter did not enter her name into the Goblet of Fire. There is no need for your childish speculation; I am personally investigating the matter. In the meantime, I expect you all to act like true Slytherins. What is the first thing I taught you cretins?”

“Slytherins stick together,” all seven years worth of Slytherins chant.

He nods, the most amount of praise he's willing to show. Probably the most amount of affection he's capable of. “Potter has agreed to compete to the best of her ability for the sake of our House. I will not tolerate disrespect to either of the Hogwarts champions. I will also remind you that it is forbidden for champions to seek outside help. Completely unrelated, I will inquire as to the second thing I ever taught you.”

“Do not get caught,” they recite.

“Very well. Any questions?”

“Did you really kill your aunt last summer?” A second year asks.

Snape glares. Harry morphs into her Lucius Malfoy persona: arrogant, innocent, and charming. “Aunt Marge was pieced back together and is living her dreadful life in relative discomfort. That was an unfortunate incident of accidental magic, as said by the Minister himself. I do not condone killing muggles, your fellow wizards, or any sentient being without due cause. You can owl my solicitor for any more questions.”

“Relative discomfort?” Cassius asks.

“Due cause?” A sixth year questions sardonically.

“Is Sirius Black really your godfather?” A firstie asks.

Snape tenses, but Harry smiles winningly. Sirius would absolutely love this.

“The Potter will does in fact specify Sirius Black as my godfather and in turn the Black will lists me as heir. I am unaware as to Black's location or goals. I will, however, point out that he never had a trial and spent his recent foray at Hogwarts breaking into Gryffindor Tower instead of our glorious dungeons. Infer what you will. Any further inquiries can be referred to his solicitor, who coincidentally is my solicitor. Any other questions?”

“Merlin, you're as bad as Malfoy Senior,” someone says.

“Thank you. It's the look I was going for.”

“Did you really kill a basilisk in your second year?” Another kid asks.

“Are you going into politics?” A seventh year wonders.

“I do not have any current plans or desire to go into politics. However, I've nearly had it with my life being determined by politicians like Voldemort and Dumbledore, so ask again in a few years. As for the first question...” she glances over at Snape, who is staring at her with dead black eyes. It's a promise of death reserved specifically for those bearing the Potter name. She gulps. “It was meant to be a surprise for Professor Snape, but I've been working with a few older students on cleaning up the Chamber of Secrets.”

The room erupts into a cacophony of teenagers. Snape blinks at her, then at a handful of smirking seventh years.

Shafiq raises her voice to be heard. She's been blessed with a voice made for battlefields. It's one of the reasons she was chosen as a prefect and then Head Girl.

“That plan has apparently been cut short,” she says with accusatory glare. “It's nowhere near clean, but it's safe enough for a tour.”

** Excerpt from [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25404631]] (Not mine)

The warmth of the dog licking his blood-crusted fingers brought him out of his stupor. He knelt next to it and let it lick him clean. Dog slobber was preferable to Marge's insides. When the dog was done, Harry expected him to leave, but instead the dog sat down next to him and whined a little. “Do you think the headmaster will understand if I tell him it was accidental magic?” he asked the dog. “Do you think he'll even care? Blowing up a Muggle in any circumstance can't just be ignored...” The dog stared at him for a moment, before his features shifted, and suddenly next to him sat a haggard looking man with dark matted hair and a face like he hadn't eaten anything in years. “Are you telling me the blood all over you was from a Muggle?” At this point, Harry didn't have it in him to be surprised at the dog really being a man, so he only nodded. The man sighed deeply. “Well,” he said, “I escaped Azkaban for supposedly blowing up twelve Muggles. It wasn't actually me, but we could run from the ministry together?” “Sure.
