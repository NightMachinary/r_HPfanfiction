So, I just finished A Cadmean Victory and now I feel empty. I had that and The Mind Arts on my list of fics to read for ages, and now that they're done, I need more. I want fics similar to one of these two or both. Fics where Harry starts off at Hogwarts (don't really care what year, though earlier would be nice and a bit different) and becomes powerful enough to legitimately oppose Voldemort. Like... match him in a duel kind of powerful. It's tough though, because I don't want a god Harry. I want him to face him challenges and not be completely unposed either.

The longer the better, I will take WIP's as long as they meet the requirements.

Please no Harry/Hermione or Harry/Luna if you can help it. No Dark Lord Harry either, a bit dark is fine, but no killing people for the sake of it and such.

Thank you in advance.


** Welp, after the title I came here with the sole purpose of recomending a cadmean victory, but seeing as youve already finished it, Ive got nothing. That said, look up "a taste of ismenian water" by darkness enthroned.

** I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), actually fits well:

- Harry can duel Voldemort, under special circumstances. Later, he shines even more.
- He gains significant power over the course of 2 years, under Dumbledore's direct training.
- Voldemort still defeated through a combined effort, and Dumbledore is the key.
- It's canon pairings.
- Definitely not a dark lord, but will kill when necessary.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345): Trained by Sirius and Remus, this indy!Harry fic does have plenty of tropes. Apart from his own significant abilities, Ginny has all Diary Riddle's powers.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434/1/Unspeakable-Things][Unspeakable Things]], linkffn(6473434): Gilderoy Lockhart is a capable Unspeakable agent, who began training Harry, Ginny, and Luna from Year 2 on.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** A Champion's New Hope is a pretty good Harry/Daphne story, does start in 4th year though, linkffn(5244813). You also may have read it before, because it's quite popular.
