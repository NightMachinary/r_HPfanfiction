Fics where his brother is the wblw


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] is probably my favorite WBWL story. But other good ones you could try are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23149174/chapters/55401934][The Forsaken's Ascension]] or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456][Antithesis]].

I'm doesn't totally count, but I'll include [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1588111][Red Hair and Grass Blades]] which switches the roles of Neville and Harry. It has a lot in common with many WBWL stories and is well worth a read.

Edit: removed Ink and Parchment | Blood and Bone as it is not a WBWL story.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up abused and alone and unlike his brother, he quickly had to learn to fend for himself. Abuse changes people on both a physical and psychological level, so when Harry Potter showed up at Hogwarts just a little bit different to how people may have expected, they really ought not to have been surprised. They should not have asked themselves what had happened, they should have asked themselves what would possibly happen next. WBWL, Slytherin Harry, Fem Voldemort, Grey Harry.

** Three Black Birds was one I quite enjoyed. It's got some really interesting bits that differ from the usual WBWL bit. The development of the relationship between him and his parents is hella fun, same with his brother.

The only other one I've really enjoyed all that much is Negligentia. Pretty short, but again did some things different to the norm of WBWL that I found really interesting. There's two sequels, Optare and Absque that continue on and fill in bits.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** Definitely not the same AoC has OC's that are main characters, a main relationship between Harry and Riddle that wasn't in PoS, and more of a focus on magic. Also has less going on than PoS did at this time. Still a lot of subplots but not to the same extent.

There are a lot of big differences.

It has the same sort of mind magic system and Lockhart is competent. Aside from that, all other similarities are just WBWL in general, not PoS

**** Not really, but it appears like it at first. The realationship between Harry and Voldemort is better than in POS. The OCs are really well written, though I hate Charlotte Weits for some reason. And there is not much bashing for characters like the OC brother and James, even Dumbledore is ashamed of sending Harry to the Dursleys. It's also less convoluted than POS, where the number of storylines happening at a time is enough to make one dizzy.

It's tighter and shorter than POS, but it's not really copy.
