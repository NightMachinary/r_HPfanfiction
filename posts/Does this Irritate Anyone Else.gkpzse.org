Recently I've received a review or two that doesn't really critique the story, but more so seems to ask if I could change an aspect of my story that I wrote with intention. I'm not talking about reviews that critique continuity or plot-points, but ones that seem to just be unhappy with the story itself and ask if I could change it. I don't know, I've always been irritated with reviews like that.


** I think it depends on the nature of the criticism. If it's just "please make this Harry/Hermione instead of Harry/Ginny" - the expression of a purely subjective preference - then yeah I think that's a pretty stupid review.

However, I don't think "I did that deliberately" is a universal defence from all literary criticism. Indeed, I think the most meaningful and substantive literary criticism does not relate to the /execution/ of an idea, but rather concerns the author's choices as to content. An author's /vision/ for their story is the most fertile ground for critical discussion.

Let's use the example of A Cadmean Victory - a convenient example, because the author would occasionally respond to reviews and would frequently miss this point. Whenever someone criticised the content decisions he made, his response was always to point to some part of his story where that story element was "explained".

That response fundamentally misunderstood the nature of the criticism.

The criticism was: "why would the author /choose/ to make that part of the story in the first place?". The criticism was not: "that doesn't make sense within the story world".

With respect to the latter, /any/ author can justify something within their world, because they have complete ability to arbitrarily determine characters' beliefs, knowledge, personalities, plus how magic works, etc. An in-universe explanation can /always/ be conjured up. But that doesn't make it good writing, because good writing is about a lot more than having in-universe explanations for things.

For example, right at the beginning of the story, Harry immediately gets a significant upgrade from his canon intelligence, bookishness, and magical skill. Yes, of course you can justify it in-universe by saying he was like that all along and this is an AU (as the author did). But that doesn't explain the out-of-universe question: "why you would /choose/ to /declare/ your character as more skilled than canon rather than show them /developing/ into someone who has more skill?".

Developing a character's traits in the story is simply better writing than declaring them to the reader ex cathedra. That way, the reader sees where those character traits have come from and thereby understands the character on a deeper level. Where those traits are going to resolve conflict, such as ability with magic, then showing their development also helps them feel earned and thus the resolution of the conflict more satisfying.

"I intended my characterisation to be shallow" is not a defence to having shallow characters.

One more example: let's examine the author's decision to make Hermione much less intelligent, reasonable, loyal and kind than in canon, completely reneging on her friendship with Harry because he is doing better than her in classes.

Sure, you can justify that in-universe with sufficient events and AU changes to her character. But again the question is: why would you want to? Why would you want to turn a reasonable, relatively 3D character into an antagonism machine that doesn't act like a human?

Again, having characters who act like real people is simply superior writing to having characters who act as plot devices. "I intended for her to be an antagonist" is not a defence to the fact that your character acts in ways the reader does not find believable.

*** See even the childish ones I feel sound really ungrateful. I'm by no means saying that my stories are all that, but I do put a decent amount of effort into writing them, so when someone comes along saying how I should change the story, I get a little irritated.

** There's something to be said of asking an author why they pick up or abandon story elements. I read a Harriet potter story by kerjack for a while until about third year where a werewolf character is introduced who is some "Lycan" strong man alpha old cultured individual.

When I asked what the deal with lupin would be if lycanthropy is literally not a problem at all, he said he didn't like how lycanthropy was a metaphor for aids and therefore wasn't going to include it.

And I expressed incredulity that lupins entire story arc was omitted because he wanted cool werewolf old guy as a barely present throway character while Remus was just not mentioned.

Was I not supposed to even ask in your view?

Because an author's internal logic for choices can be just as revealing as the choices themselves. Like how that answer showed I really didn't need to read the rest of that story.

*** There's a difference between asking and telling. I'm more talking about the reviews that demand an author change an aspect of the story for their own viewing pleasure that the author wrote with intentionality. I have no issue with questions, especially because they can reflect issues with a story without sounding demanding. And I totally agree. If an author doesn't answer to your satisfaction and the story doesn't get better, drop the story.

** Well there is a big difference between

1. I have been enjoying your story and I really hope it will include the xyz story line/trope.

2. I like your story but was surprised to see you using/not using the xyz story line/trope. Now besides the obvious that you wanted to explore using/not using that story line are you willing to provide more information for why you chose that path?

And

1. Hey i see you have a simple pairing but you really need to make this a Harem story and you need to make them all animagi and have them fool around in their animal forms. And you need to make your main character be super powered where he can do anything with just a look.

The first comment is just a basic request from the reader as to what he would like to see in the story. The second comment is actually a request for a discussion (if the author is willing) to understand why the author decided to write a particular story line.

The 3rd comment is really just a reader saying I don't like your story and you need to change it to make me happy.

Now the first two comments shouldn't be a problem for most authors (well unless in the discussion the commenter rips the choices the author makes). The last comment should be ignored (unless the commenter is somehow paying for the story which really isn't what fanfiction is about).

The problem is that too often the third type of commenter is the most vocal and can often be the reason why an author stops writing. I think a fact gets overlooked that most authors are writing for their own enjoyment and hoping that others also like their story. Being "harped" on is the quickest way for an author's "muse" to take a vacation.

It's the silent majority who reads and enjoys the stories that suffer (almost as much as the authors) when a talented budding writer gets chased away by the trolls and stops writing.

The authors should know we appreciate their efforts even if we don't always like/agree with the story line.

*** Yeah I definitely was referencing the third type of comment haha. It's definitely not going to chase me away from writing, but it is irritating.

** Oh heck yeah! If someone wants a specific story, they need to write it themselves. Nobody has the right to demand that an author write-to-order unless they are paying them to do so.

I was in the Buffy fanfic back in the days of yore, and there was one guy who became infamous for demanding that authors either write stories, or change stories that were in progress, so they to matched his kinks. There was even a LiveJournal created so people could share tales of his outrageous demands.

** I've seen other writers complain about this, but since most of my writing, back when I still wrote things, were original works, and short one-shots at that, I've never really received those kind of complaints.

** I recently got my own version of this, I was less annoyed because it felt like a right of passage - I expect the novalty will wear off very quickly. I've seen some war zone comment section on other fics I've read, and I hope I don't ever experience that.

It think boils down to the reader and their ability to critique. Often times, the bad critique is an inability of the reader to express themselves.

For example, "you should have done this instead" really means "I disagree with the actions of character X, because it doesn't align with their motivations and personality."

There are exceptions, some people have your story already written in their mind, and their get annoyed when you veer away from that. In that case, they should open up Microsoft Word and get cracking, because they'll never be happy.

** Oh, yeah. Some people really hate the idea of other people having different tastes, and think everyone should write according to their whims. And any story that doesn't follow their - often pureblood-fanboy - headcanon is bad.
