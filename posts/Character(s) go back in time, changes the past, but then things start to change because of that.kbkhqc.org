Maybe even to the point where the information the character(s) have, end up being useless, because other characters around them, change their original routes.

(As an example here): Let's say Harry goes back in time, starts destroying Horcruxes, Voldemort realizes what he's doing, and moves the rest of his Horcruxes. (Doesn't have to be that specifically, just using that as an example).

Anyone can be the main character/on any site/any length/old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc

Would rather NOT have any Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame/fortune, no Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc.


** One of my favorite time travel fics is about Hermione going in the past to study Frank and Alice Longbottom in hopes of using her fresh memories of their mannerisms for a new healing procedure. She doesn't intend for things to change, but her temporary presence alters things big and small. One of the best examples of the butterfly effect IMO, I quite enjoyed it

  Remus wants to find out more about the new Potions assistant. He is curious about her secrets as she seems to know all about his. Hermione just wants to do her job and get out. Their timing was never right. EWE. Marauders and an eventual build up to romance. Drabbles. Complete.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18707485/chapters/44368462]]) Harry exchanges letters with Tom Riddle from the past. Voldemort makes different decisions and because of them the reality around Harry and the memories of other people "update", Harry is the only one who remembers the original timeline.

  Harry returns to Hogwarts to finish his final year. Voldemort is dead and everyone is trying their best to move on, including Harry. He just never considered how boring it would be. Luckily he is pulled out of his normal routine by an anonymous letter along with a chance Harry had never expected to be given.

** Backwards with purpose part 2 by deadwoodpecker has this. There's a part 1 where Harry, Ron, and Ginny go back in time because living in the future was not worth it and during the course of their stay they meet a character nicknamed Merlin that's helping them. Backwards with purpose part 2 focuses on Merlin's journey and how he tries to fix one thing but ends up making it harder for Harry, Ron and Ginny to accomplish their goals. He ends up going back in time 7 times to fix it.
