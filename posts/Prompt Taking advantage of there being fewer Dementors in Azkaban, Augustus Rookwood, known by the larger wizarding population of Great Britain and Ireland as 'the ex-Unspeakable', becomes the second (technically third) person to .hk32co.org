I personally imagined him (in this prompt) escaping by making a wand from his own blood, hair and some finger bones and other things just powerful enough to break out from his cell (i.e. blasting the outside wall) and possibly protecting himself from the cold water so as to not die from hypothermia, but what are your thoughts?


** Didn't that happen in linkffn(Harry Crow) ?

*** Yeah, it did. I read it 1 year ago so my memory's a little fuzzy, but from what i remember, he pulled out his own teeth to have something to engrave runes into a anti-dementor medallion made from a chunk of stone in his cell that would make them think he was from the ministry and he let a rudimentary wand made from the straw and sheets of his bed soak into his blood for the several months it took him to create the medallion. It was so that the blood would act as a core and allow the wand to support a few low powered spells before it broke down.

Dude was hardcore

  What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.

** In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) Rookwood is being hyped as Voldemort's #2 and the most brilliant/powerful Mind Arts user in history. I highly recommend you give it a read, it's one of my fav fics of all time and is consistently updating.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
