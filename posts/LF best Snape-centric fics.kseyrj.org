Pretty much the title. I find Snape as a character really interesting and unfortunately, he's just one of those characters that's pretty hard to get right in fanfics so I'd really appreciate any recs.

Any pairing is fine. Slash, no slash, no pairing, whatever go nuts. I just want fics with a Snape that's well written and in character. I'd really appreciate fics of a wide range so both well known fics and lesser known ones (hidden gems if you will). Thank you!


** Seconding I Know Not and Penultimate Acts. They're both fantastic.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/147439/chapters/210857?view_adult=true)-]] 'Into The Fold'- A wonderful canon-compliant of Snape in the First Wizarding War. It doesn't whitewash him while keeping his tragedy in place.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/638325)-]] 'Romance of the Age'- This is focused on pretty much the entire Marauders' generation in the First Wizarding War. It pokes fun at Snape's tendency to romanticise himself. The writing style is amazing; it's a dry and contemptuous of everyone except Lily.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/868256/chapters/1666520)-]] Under Pressure- Post the first Wizarding War. Focused on Snape's early teaching years in the aftermath of Lily's death. Captures his depressed and hollow state very well.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/638566)-]] St Mungo's Grim Reaper- This is a story about Death Eater Snape. He's been assigned a mission by Voldemort. Snape is dark and depraved while still retaining traces of humanity.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11344206)-]] The Fields of Summer. It's a look at Snape in the afterlife. After giving his memories to Harry, he's unable to remember Lily. Very touching.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/536450/chapters/952621)-]] The Never-ending Road- This a fem!Harry story but Snape is marvellously done in this story. His voice is hilarious and cruel and perfect. The writing in this fic is amazing; the imagery, the world-building, and the laugh-out-loud humour is impeccable. It says Snape/Harry but this part is mostly gen.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13063056)-the]] wild-eyed boy from cokeworth - A lovely fic about Snape loving David Bowie.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13922226)-]] immortalists with points to prove- Interesting fic about Snape and Alastor Moody from his Death Eater trials to Dumbledore's death.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13284585/chapters/30399108)-]] That Awful Boy. Snape/Lupin. This is a great fic exploring what would have happened if Harry had to stay at Spinner's End post GBP. It's not a mentor fic, but more of a 'coming to an understanding' type of fic. Goes in-depth into Snape's trauma.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3082463)-]] To Dwell on Dreams- Fic where Snape gets addicted to drugs after hallucinating Lily. Sad and Haunting. Dumbledore's callousness is portrayed well here too.

If you're alright with Snarry, 'Help Wanted: God and Executioner' linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/192808)-]] is a great alternate post-HBP fic. The war is a lot worse in this AU, and Snape's weary determination to go on and see it finished is portrayed well.

Idk if I'm allowed to post it here but I'd also recommend 'The White Road' by perverse_idyll. It's a Snarry fic that tries to reconcile both the Snape/Lily relationship and the Snape/Harry relationship. It also works as an utterly gorgeous Snape character study. He's ugly and cruel and disgusting but still loveable at the same time. It's quite explicit and involves voyeurism, so you might need to be prepared for that if you do read it.

Enjoy!

  Albus Dumbledore rose to his feet, smiling at them in that way of his, like he knew something you didn't and he was proud of you for it. "Friends," he began.The door thudded open and the Marauders burst in, late and pink-cheeked with cold. The headmaster smiled at them, too, and Sirius gave a cheery little salute back.Severus sunk lower in his chair, staring witheringly over his butterbeer. "You told Potter about it, too?""He might as well put all that energy to good use," said Lily. "And, to be accurate, I told Remus.""But Potter, really?" said Severus."He and Black cooked up a jinx that gives you a boil every time you say a slur to a Muggleborn," said Lily. "It was either invite them to Alice's war club or bake them cookies, and I know where my skills lie."Severus sniffed. "Don't come crying to me if he tugs your pigtails.""Come crying to me if he pulls yours, and I'll deck him," said Lily.(Slight AU in which Severus apologizes, tries harder, and stays friends with Lily)
