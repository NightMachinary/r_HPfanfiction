#+TITLE: [Prompt] Harry Potter gets isekai’d by Truck-Kun when he travels outside. He wakes up to find his body is different [boy/girl]. This world is filled with magic like his old one. But somehow, he could still use spells from his old world, wandless and non-verbal too! What...?!

*** They're making some niche references. Isekai is a genre popular in anime/manga where an ordinary (?) person from Earth gets transported to a fantasy dimension, often one where things function like in a computer RPG or MMO. "Truck-Kun" is presumably a reference for the method of transport, i.e. Harry gets hit by a truck and wakes up as someone else in a fantasy universe, but still has access to the magic he was using in his previous life.
