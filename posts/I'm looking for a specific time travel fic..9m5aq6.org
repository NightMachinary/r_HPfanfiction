I obviously cant remember the name, but I do remember that at the beginning, Harry, for some reason, has sex with his "Personal Reaper." I think this continues throughout the fic, at least until the main pairing begins.

I wanna say it was a Reptilia28 Challenge fic, I do think the pairing was Harmony, so it's possible.


** there's one of the reptila's challenge. in this one, Harry does have sex with his reaper. I think it's incomplete.

I can't remember the fic.

*** At least I was right about it being Reptilia.

Now if only we knew the damn name, it's not even that it's particularly good, I just can't remember the fic name and it's bugging me to death.

** There's one called Another Lifetime by LoveLifeForever. He makes out with his grim reaper (who turns out to be his sister, at which point I stopped reading).

It was decent up until that bit too.
