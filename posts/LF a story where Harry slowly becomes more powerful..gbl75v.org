Whenever i read a powerful!harry story it is quite often the case that Harry is just all of a sudden the most powerful wizard in britain and it just kind of ruins the story for me. So i'm looking for stories where Harry slowly discovers his powers and for example starts experimenting in the RoR to see what he can do.


** The LoTR crossover linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) features very, very slow development of Harry's power.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

That's almost exactly what happens in The Merging. The RoR thing is kinda unique in this one, or atleast, as far as my fanfic reading goes. No ultra-powerful Harry after 3 chapters.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. Story contains more detailed magic, politics, and more. It is a story of growth and maturation.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long.

** Well, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) definitely has this, but fair warning, its complete with an abandoned sequel. I think the first fic tells a complete and satisfying story, but still, it's worth knowing, going in. There's also linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom), which is also abandoned and /doesn't/ end on a natural stopping point, but I think it's worth reading, regardless.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
