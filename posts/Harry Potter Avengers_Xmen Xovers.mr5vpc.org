#+begin_quote
  Being the Master of Death is not what it seems. In order to hide the Deathly Hallows, Hermione is forced to flee to the United States, bringing one along with her. She hopes to fly under the radar under orders to wait it out until it's safe to return home but as events unfold, her path becomes tangled with one Archer from SHIELD.

  Hermione strikes a deal with Death: she collects his Hallows for him and he puts her back with the living, where she belongs. If she'd known it meant a whole lot of time-travel, robbery, lies and fights with Grindelwald himself, she might have reconsidered his offer.

** linkffn(Wand and Shield by Morta's Priest) is pretty much the gold standard as far as HP/MCU crossovers are concerned in my opinion.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the World That Waits by Dellacouer) is the best HP/X-men crossover I've ever read. It's a crime that it's abandoned, but it's so good, it deserves a read anyway.

#+begin_quote
  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  Crazy idea. What if Harry was Tony's dad?Not in a million years would Harry thought that by letting Anthony be held for a moment by a woman whom just lost her baby, would let the press go wild. In under an hour, the whole city knew about his baby. And under a couple of hours so did the whole United States of America. And soon the whole world would know. The worst thing was that they thought Anthony was the Stark heir.This work is a slow burn. So basically it will cover Tony as a baby, kid, teen, young man 'till adult. And mostly i used Howard, Harry, and Tony's POVPs. This work is 70% marvel and 30% Harpot world. And neither marvel or harpot charactrs are mine, but most of the story ideas are mine. So hope u enjoy reading itCOMPLETED

  Thanos has come close to death more than once. He saw a being who fascinated him. Death is a man of great beauty with the most captivating green eyes. Thanos will try everything to see him again and especially to seduce him. He therefore thinks that destroying worlds will bring him the favors of the Master of Death. Harry is the intermediary between the world of the dead and Hellfeim where a goddess helps maintain peace and balance. The more Thanos kills, the more angry Harry gets. His limit is reached when he attacks the planet under his protection, the Earth. Thanos is going to drool. He doesn't know what will fall on him. Harry Potter is more than a God.All rights go to the amazing author - memepotter952504.

  Many years have passed since the great battle of Hogwarts, and Harry's life has only gotten worse. Of course, he had imagined that after the battle ended, everything would go back to normal; at least, as normal as possible. But it wasn't long until the Ministry was taken over by yet more evil, dark, corrupt wizards. Wizards who wanted Harry out of the picture. After a series of unfortunate events, Harry is left on the run. Running from both the ministry and himself, it seemed. He has nowhere to go, and year after year passes by. He doesn't want to live like this anymore. He wants something better for himself; he wants the life that he once had. Being compared to Voldemort takes it's toll though, and the wizarding world no longer looks upon the boy who lived with wonder. They look upon him with disgust, with suspicious eyes and wands at the ready. He is an outcast in the only place he could call home. Stories about him are riddled with evil and lies, being passed down from generation to generation. But it all changes when a storm above London, England, at 9:46 am on August 13th, brings an outsider to earth, a powerful sorcerer with shoulder length black hair and and charming yet somehow malicious smile.

  Harry turned his head back to his Starkpad and flipped to the next page. Quite happily, to himself he said, "Not my circus, not my monkeys." Whether it was a meteor or a piece of an airplane, it mattered nothing. "The Boy Who Lived is in retirement." He shifted in his hammock, moving to a more comfortable position, and looked up just in time to watch the object fall into his vegetable garden. Harry stifled a strangled sound as he surveyed the damage. What had once been the center of his vegetable garden was a crater more than a meter in diameter. The vegetables that he'd planted were gone. Left behind was a single hammer.

  Nothing happened. The stupidly bewildered look on his face wasn't bad, as far as last sights go, but Tony still wished he could have been looking at Morgan as he died. Of course, that meant his daughter would have to watch him basically burn himself to a crisp with the power of Creation itself, so this was probably better in the long run. He raised his right hand, making sure Thanos could see the Stones his nano-suit was even now incorporating into itself.Ah, gormless despair. Even better.It's time.“I am---”That was as far as he got before everything changed.“Accio Infinity Stones.”Or, the one where Thanos accidentally made a very powerful enemy and didn't find out about it until the last possible second.

#+begin_quote
  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

Warning- it's Tomarry but it's well written. Currently on a hiatus but the author said it will one day be finished still worth reading.

(Not fully X-men but it the hp universe remade into instead of magic, they are mutants in a world that wants to get rid of mutants. Dumbledore is Professor X)
