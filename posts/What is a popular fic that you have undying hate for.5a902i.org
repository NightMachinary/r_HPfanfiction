** HPMOR is the first that comes to mind. Although this one has more to do with its popularity. It gets recommended so much on other sites like it's some kind of fanfiction masterpiece, and I just don't get it. And something about HPMOR just grates on my nerves.

Harry Crow is another one I dislike, as well. I mean, I don't have an undying hatred for it, but I read it ages ago and I don't think I was impressed with the writing.

** Yeah no total hate from me but I think anything by Lomonaaeren is complete garbage and gives slash a bad rap.

Also I think a Black Comedy, An Unforgiving Minute and A Curse of Truth are totally overrated especially on this sub.

*** Nonjon also hasn't wrote anything in years. Most anything that old won't have stood the test of time. I also wouldn't compare something that is still pretty unique to a SI canon rehash with A Curse of Truth.

** A Cadmean Victory is terrible. I'm so sorry, but it was one of the most pretentious, most idiotic fanfics I have ever read. Harry was some intense ass edge-lord with Fleur as some deep character who hid her emotions. I got through maybe 10 chapters before skipping to the end and then I gave up.

*** Disclaimer: I'm someone who really likes A Cadmean Victory. You are right, it is tropy, gets pretentious at times, and is a bit ridiculous.

I do think that it gets some unjust hate. For all intents and purposes, it's an AU fic but from the hate I've seen and that I think you're alluding to, why is Harry and Fleur's personalities so bad when it seems most other near AU/AU personalities get a bit of a pass? Perhaps it's a bit of selection bias in what I've read, but I think Harry/Fleur and the entire "genre" that it entails get a bit of undo hate.

It's popcorn fanfiction for me. It's dumb but it's a great escape for me when I read. I know it isn't a brilliant masterpiece, but that isn't that I'm looking for always when I read fanfiction. I just want a story that can't help let my mind break free of reality and unwind after a long day.

I'm sorry if I've been oversensitive to what's as intended to be a light-hearted critique, but I do want to stick up for this who like the fic.

**** I don't know about that. I've read the "greats" of the HP fanfic world and gotten bored reading them. I don't think Cadmean is a masterpiece or even remotely close to one, but it's a really great popcorn read for those who like the genre. I think it has a lot to do about tastes and what people are looking for when they read.

I guess I don't understand why some people have such a massive hate boner for the fic, or people who enjoy popcorn reads like it.

** Undying hate might be too strong a word, but I just can't stand the Wastelands of Time. The overtly grandiose tone, the flowery descriptions, along with Joe going off on tangents about the meaning of time or the futility of existence every third paragraph... ugh.

Ironically, Unfound Door is similar enough, but I love that story. I guess Joe matured as a writer between writing the two.

Its so goddamn horrible, half the lines are stolen one toone from FMA. Its just ughh. And they dont even make sense in the context most times, and harry is just a copy of the character of Roy Mustang. It hate it.

The only reason i can think of why people like it is because none of them have ever seen or read fullmetal alchemist.

** There is only one fic that I can truly say that I hate, and it's more honestly a loathing kind of situation: I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For. The only good things I can say about it are the spelling and grammar is good. Literally /every/ single decision and interpretation the author takes is terrible.

** I wouldn't quite label my dislike as "undying", but I just can't get behind Philo's /The Apple Tree/, a popular Harry/Snape fic. I love this pair, but not this story. I've tried reading it twice and never get beyond six or seven chapters. Harry is really, really OOC -- too OOC for me to be like, "Haha, whatever," and Dumbledore is a complete moron. Also, there's so much dialog without contractions -- enough that I notice, and it really jars me out of the reading experience since it sounds so unnatural much of the time.

I'd like to enjoy this fic, because it's long and because it's hard to find good stories with this pair that I haven't read yet, but....alas.
