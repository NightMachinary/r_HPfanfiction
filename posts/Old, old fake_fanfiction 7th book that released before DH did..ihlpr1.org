:END:
Hi. So as the title says I'm looking for this story that I read probably somewhere in 2007 and which at the time assumed (whether that was just my silly assumption then or if it advertised itself as such I don't know ) it to be the leaked real book. I think I stopped halfway through or so when I perhaps realized the truth but bits of it stuck with me since and ... since I'm on a bit of HP ff roll, I'm trying to track it down again.

What I remember is ... not much but it had Harry going back to Hogwarts, probably in student capacity as well but certainly as the new Defence against DA teacher, Ginny becoming cat animagus in secret and spending some time with Harry in that way and, though this I'm not quite sure if I'm not taking it from some other fic; Bellatriks killing Gabrielle at the wedding.

I did check out the Seventh Horcrux story but it doesn't seem to be that. Any help is much appreciated.
