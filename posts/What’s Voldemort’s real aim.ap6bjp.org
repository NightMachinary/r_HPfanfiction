I always thought it was odd that Voldemort seemed to believe in pureblood supremacy when he's not pureblood (preparing myself for the hitler comparison). For all we know Dumbledore and Grindelwald might not be either, pointing towards a flaw in blood purity ideology. There are some interesting fics that paint a picture of him winning but what do you believe?

Did he really just try and take over a country based on some crazy ideals because he got wowed by some elitist assholes when he's 11?

Does he actually care about pureblood lives? As he seems to use them quite cheaply.

What he have really done if he won?

Would he be bored and just start plotting about taking over more countries?

Is he even a proper villain or just a semi insane terrorist that's upset about mummy and daddy's past?

Would the magical world flourish if he'd won? Or become even more of a stagnant cesspit of inbreeding?

Muggleborns integrated and taken care of? Or slaves?

Why didn't he publish a charter of some sort to tell everyone what he was fighting for and what he'd do if he won?

Edit: spelling


** The way I interpreted it, Voldemort is obsessed with two things; personal power and immortality. His aims are to become immortal and to become the most powerful being in the world. That kind of person won't be satisfied ever. Britain first, then the continent, then the world. Even then, as an immortal, he would probably look on ways to conquer /other worlds/. Voldemort's ambitions know no limits, and so I believe he would never truly stop.

#+end_quote

Not really? I feel like if he'd felt he had a shot at it, Riddle would still have tried to conquer England even before he heard the word "Slytherin". He just doesn't care one bit for everyone's feelings, and craves power.

#+begin_quote
  Does he actually care about pureblood lives? As he seems to use them quite cheaply.
#+end_quote

Voldemort definitely doesn't care about blood-purity --- it's very telling that one of his most trusted Death Eaters is Severus Snape, a half-blood. It is pretty much canonical that he doesn't believe in it himself, and merely pretends to manipulate the purebloods of the Wizarding World into doing his bidding. Presumably, once he'd won, he'd quietly stop talking about blood and delay giving the purebloods their "rightful privileges" until everyone who cared about them was dead.

Now, it's true that he despises Muggles; but you see, my understanding of Voldemort is that he despises /everybody/. A sociopath, a wizard /and/ a genius is a dangerous combination: not only does he feel nothing for other people, but he has every reason to find them utterly /beneath/ him. He can learn to respect others if they prove to have some power and cunning, but only in a dispassionate, "I'll still kill you without a second thought if it's convenient to me" kind of way; this is the way he likes Snape, Bellatrix, and, indeed, Nagini. Probably one of the reasons he finds Dumbledore so infuriating is that the old man is one of the few people in the world to whom he can't reasonably say he is superior, purely in terms of magical ability.

#+begin_quote
  What he have really done if he won? Would he be bored and just start plotting about taking over more countries?
#+end_quote

No one really knows. Perhaps he'd have been content to rule Wizarding Britain with an iron fist, forever. But more likely his ultimate goal is to rule the entire Wizarding World, and, in the long-term, to be done with the Statute of Secrecy and just rule /everyone/. Keep in mind that he (thinks he) is immortal; I could see him deciding he's going to take a few hundred years off just ruling Britain before he moves on to France or whatever.

#+begin_quote
  Would the magical world flourish if he'd won? Or become even more of a stagnant cesspit of inbreeding?
#+end_quote

There wouldn't necessarily be inbreeding. But there'd sure as heck not be much social change, nor indeed magical advancement (can't have anyone inventing new spells that could potentially make them threats to me). He'd probably keep a tight leash on Hogwarts to brainwash gifted youths into loyal servants from Day 1, and, if they prove resistant to manipulation, quietly have them done away with.

#+begin_quote
  Muggleborns integrated and taken care of? Or slaves?
#+end_quote

Probably, as I said earlier, he'd pay lip-service to blood-purism for a while longer after he'd won, but be more than happy to promote Muggle-borns if they prove to be efficient henchmen. After a few decades you'd scarcely know there was any racism involved in his regime, it'd just be the Dark Lord oppressing everyone but his cronies.

#+begin_quote
  Why didn't he publish a charter of some sort to tell everyone what he was fighting for and what he'd do if he won?
#+end_quote

Because what he was fighting for is plainly obvious: power. Being one of the most powerful warlocks on the planet, perhaps /the/ most powerful Dark Wizard of them all, he didn't /have/ to pretend to have noble motives to get power. He just went up to the world and said "Good evening. My name is Lord Voldemort. I really want to rule the Earth, and I have the will and the power to murder anyone who stands in my way. Alternatively, you could act as my sycophants, in which case you might perhaps be less horribly oppressed than everyone else once I win, which I inevitably will, because I'm as close to a god as they get."

** The thing that people miss about Voldemort and blood purity is that Voldemort's hypocrisy is not unusual for the movement.

There are two different meanings of "pure-blood".

There's the "technical" definition, which JKR has stated to be grandparents.

Then there's the definition associated with radical politics, i.e. the one used by Death Eaters and those like them, which is not having any Muggle ancestry at all. The latter is more an expression of political identity than actual ancestry, because in reality there would be no "pure-bloods" by this definition (except, perhaps, the Gaunts, who took inbreeding to the next level). So how do "pure-bloods" who follow this definition, but don't actually fulfil their own criteria, qualify as pure-blood? By gaining the acceptance of the group that uses this extreme definition, i.e. by aligning yourself with them politically and following their practices, which include obliterating any record of any familial connection to Muggles (see: the heavily redacted Black family tree). It's essentially a group delusion.

The latter is why it's no big deal that Voldemort is actually a half-blood. The whole political faction is premised upon erasing the actual past and making up a fake past for your family.

It's an important point, often missed in the fandom, that Dumbledore and the Order reject both these definitions, not just the latter one. Dumbledore's philosophy is not equality between "Pure-bloods" and "Muggleborns". His philosophy is to reject the entire classification system. He never refers to purity of blood without use of the phrase "so-called".

  Are all the pure-blood families going to die out? (We've lost the Blacks and the Crouches during the series)

  Don't forget that, as Sirius revealed in 'Order of the Phoenix', none of these families is really 'pure' -- in other words, they merely cross Muggles and Squibs off the family tree and pretend that they didn't exist. But yes, the number of families claiming to be pure is diminishing. By refusing to marry Muggles or Muggle-borns, they are finding it increasingly difficult to perpetuate themselves. This subject is touched upon in 'Half-Blood Prince'.

#+begin_quote
  Why are some people in the wizarding world (e.g., Harry) called 'half-blood' even though both their parents were magical?

  The expressions 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' have been coined by people to whom these distinctions matter, and express their originators' prejudices. As far as somebody like Lucius Malfoy is concerned, for instance, a Muggle-born is as 'bad' as a Muggle. Therefore Harry would be considered only 'half' wizard, because of his mother's grandparents.

  If you think this is far-fetched, look at some of the real charts the Nazis used to show what constituted 'Aryan' or 'Jewish' blood. I saw one in the Holocaust Museum in Washington when I had already devised the 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' definitions, and was chilled to see that the Nazis used precisely the same warped logic as the Death Eaters. A single Jewish grandparent 'polluted' the blood, according to their propaganda.

that's...many of the DEs.

voldemort definitely believes in pureblood supremacy, and resents and rejects the muggle parts of him. his belief in his inherent greatness comes in large part from his magic. one of the core elements of pureblood supremacy is that muggleness taints magicalness

i've always found the idea that he's only pretending to be a pureblood supremacist for wealth/power incoherent. for one, he's a bigot even in the diary, with no followers to perform for. two, he doesn't need wealth. this isn't a real war where you need supplies, rations, weapons etc. voldemort has magic. he's also charismatic enough to set up a cult on different principles- he chooses blood supremacy because that's what he wants. we see him gain control of the ministry with a well-placed imperius.

Everyone always assumes that Voldemort did this deliberately, as a spell, but I've never read it that way. Dumbledore says:

#+begin_quote
  “Was he after the Defence Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn't say...”

  “Oh, he definitely wanted the Defence Against the Dark Arts job,” said Dumbledore. “The aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we have never been able to keep a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort.”
#+end_quote

It sounds to me as if it was Dumbledore's act of refusal that created the curse; that the very act of refusing such a powerful dark force the position created the curse by association, by virtue of Voldemort's sheer malice and power, not through a specific spell.

It would not be the first time we see this kind of powerful magic arising out of a set of actions: Lily's sacrifice is another example of a person taking an action and this creating a powerful magical result.

People that claim he's power hungry and sadistic are missing the point. You can desire power while being sadistic, however, that's not a goal in and if itself. JKR never bothered to give Voldemort any motivation or goals besides cardboard cutout evil, and that's the problem.

It makes for a good children's story, as it's simple, but is very bad writing at the core of it.

Instead of giving the enemy reasons and arguments for why they're doing what they're doing, and having the protagonists grapple with reality and morality, JKR made the enemy evil for the sake of being evil, with the only mental struggles of the protagonist being the superficial similarities between him and the enemy.

** I think Voldemort REALLY couldn't care less about pureblood supremacy. I think he just used that as an easy way to get supporters.. and to get supporters of the "right" sort; the ones who were already rich and powerful and could provide vauable assets.

Pretty clear to me that power and immortality were the only things Voldemort cared about from the very start. He wanted to be the biggest, baddest bully in the sandbox, the one who could do EVERYTHING he wanted and didn't need anyone, the one who feared nothing but was feared by all. But "hey, support me so I can become the most powerful dude ever!" isn't really a good platform to work with if you want anyone to take you seriously.

However, if you notice that a significant number of the rich and powerful in the society you now belong to are a bunch of old pureblood families who have built up a lot of power and priviliege of the centuries, but who are now complaining that they're LOSING that power and privilege because laws are passed that gives more opportunities to Muggle-borns and as such slowly takes away the families' advantages over said Muggle-borns...

Well. Then it's not a bad strategy to go "Join me, I'll show those Mudbloods their place, return the power to where it belonges and make the wizarding world great again!" After all, people who have power and privilege but are afraid of LOSING that power and privilege are usually willing to do quite a lot.

So yeah... I think Voldemort was just pretending to be a pureblood supremacist. His followers, however, were the real deal.

** i think he really believed in a wizards superiority over muggles and mostly because he puts power above all else and lets face it, a wizard is obviously more powerful that an average muggle. but i think exactly because of this reason he could still view halfbloods and maybe even muggleborn (who knows?) as powerful assets when they are loyal to him. i also believe soem of his original reasons became warped when he made the horcruxes. as a child putting himself above muggles meant putting himself above the people in the orphanage that despised and hated him and as an adult it meant powerful supporters. i think there are many factors which play into that but most importantly his ultimate goal for immortality and power, as well as his need to feel superior and putting wizards above muggles alowed hin exactly that. but with less and less of his soul i think his reasons turned more towards power for himself while he forgot the reasoning behind his actions ( if he could ever admit his need to feel superior to himself)
