I'm looking for a fanfiction of Harry Potter where he goes back in time and uses his magic but also uses his political power and fame to get the wizard in world to help prepare and fight in the war. I would think that if Harry did few interviews and put out his story and was more personable if he could learn how important that is I would think that it would change so many people mind that they wouldn't be quick to dismiss him. And I don't mean he should go out and say hey Voldemort it is coming back but could be slighted by talking about the magical police. Gives interview in his feelings about how the government has one I think people would take notice if he does it intelligently. I'm sorry but the boy comes into the world having so much political power so many people willing to listen to him. I understand that in the beginning because of the way he was raised wouldn't be open and willing to put himself out there but maybe an older more mature version of himself would have. Propaganda can be a huge help to win a war.
