Currently writing fanfiction and i'm having problems writing a duel between two characters. How do i write a proper dueling scene without it coming out boring and dull? And what spells should the two characters mostly focus on?


** I don't write, but I find naming every single spell makes it rather boring, only name spells that have a significant effect. Try and make it flow

** What kind of duel is it a Duel between equals, a one-sided Smackdown, how old are the opponents and what spells can they use, is it a formal duel or a street fight and what are the stakes?

YouTube Sir Christopher Lee talking about sword fighting to see how to /not/ make it boring, and then you'll understand that the spells come to you during that two and a half minutes

** Movement is extremely important, one of my peeves is stories where it seems like they just stand opposite each other screaming spells.

Rule #1 of dueling- Dodge. If you aren't 100% sure of the spell you'd be blocking /dodge/ or summon something to be a physical shield.

A sign of progression can be the switch from summoning to conjuring shields or animating.

If this duel is between two kids then I'd do just have them shout spells at one anothet, and show their progression in later chapters.

If it's supervised by teachers, have teachers give feedback on their performance. I always love having Snape do this- makes it interesting.

Only for adolescents. Against someone who can cast nonverbally rapidly, it's like dodging a submachine gun with unlimited ammo.

**** I mean trying to block a spell without knowing if it will shred your shield seems like a bad idea lol. I did figure the question was for kids so I tried to answer from that angle, you make a good point with nonverbal spells, that would make it even harder to figure out what's being cast

***** Shields appear to be good at stopping or at least attenuating a very wide variety of curses, and Shield Charms is IIRC one of the first things nonverbal casting is taught for in Y6 DADA. Unfortunately, we only have one good data point for how a pitched battle between two highly skilled but not Dumbledore-level adults looks like, and it's between Molly and Bellatrix, who seem to stand their ground; and we never see what such a duel looks and feels like from the point of view of the duellist.

** I'm trash at writing, so don't put too much stock in this, but I found this video pretty insightful. At least it's food for thought:

** I'd say don't write much about formal duels where Wizard 1 curses Wizard 2 who blocks and back again. If you do try to use any spell that could make it more interesting, flashbangs, disillusionment etc.

The best duels are ambushes that end really fast and tell us something about the emotions flying high. Harry VS Bellatrix par example where he only hits her with a single crucio, or Draco v Harry which is some flashes then Crucio into Sectumsempra, are better than half of fanfic duels like say in Lady Archimedes.

If you absolutely want to have a fight that shows skill and mastery you most likely need a third dimension, like Dumbledore using the Fountain of MB or getting Fawkes to aid him. Or DA vs Death Eaters with the prophecy in play.

I'd say a good idea would be an Eragon like duel, where the duelists fight with their minds and spells both. We know Snape uses legilimency to duel better, if your story improves legilimency and occlumency that's a great way to put them to use.

** How old are these characters, and how good are they at magic?

Outside of ambushes or chaotic running battles where anyone could be attacked from any angle, we see three kinds of duelling:

1. *The adolescent style.* Spell arsenals are limited and have to be cast verbally, which severely limits the rate at which they can be cast. (They may also require wand movements to be preferred more precisely.) Most spells don't end a fight even if they connect. Putting up a shield takes up time and all of one's concentration. The resulting style is jumpy and involves a lot of dodging. All students in Harry's year, including Harry, never pass this level in the books (epilogue excepted).
2. *The highly skilled adult style.* The arsenal of both offensive and defensive magic grows, and there are many more spells that end the fight if they connect. Although nonverbal casting is introduced in Year 6, mastering it to the point where it can be used effectively in combat takes much longer. When it is mastered, it is a game changer, however, because the rate at which one can cast increases greatly. (There may also be a concomitant reduction in wand movements and generally in whatever mental effort is needed to cast the spell.) Shielding and counterspelling become far quicker as well. Because of this, dodging, and movement in general, fall out of use: it is more effective to stand one's ground in a rapid exchange of nonverbal spells. Unfortunately, the way the books went, we have only one good example of two skilled adult wizards or witches having a pitched duel, and that's Molly vs. Bellatrix.
3. *The Uberwizard style.* Basically, what Dumbledore vs. Voldemort at the Ministry: rapid teleportation, large-scale combat transfiguration, animating creatures to attack and defend on one's behalf.

** Duels can be very different to one another. It helps if you put the reader in the character's head and make him fear for the outcome.

** I've not had many duels in my fic, but I tend to focus more on movement, and people's reactions to what the other person's doing. Speed is important.

I also try not to get bogged down with incantations. I just find it too Anime-ish, when people are constantly shouting things.

** A duel should involve motion. Do not just have the combatants stand still and sling spells at each other. Have them jump out of the way of attacks. Have them use the environment around them to their advantage. I would suggest rereading Dumbledore and Voldemort's duel at the end of Order of the Phoenix. This is the best duel in the entire series in my opinion.

** Think about which part you want to make interesting. Do you want people to oooh at the magic, marvel at some aspect of the characters, and/or mull over what it means for your plot?

Once you have, you'll have an area to focus on and you can really use all the other excellent suggestions people have made in this post more targeted-ly. :)

** I'd have the shield sharm work against almost any spell but the killing curse.

With both opponents having access to what is essentially full plate armour in a duel between knights, most fights are ended swiftl a combination of inventiveness and ruthlessness.
