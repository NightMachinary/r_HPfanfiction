** Can you remember anything else about the fic?

Off the top of my head, Draco stays at Grimmauld Pl during the war in the [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1547708][It Started in the Shower Series]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4373594/chapters/9926705][Temptation on the Warfront]] and [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3386][Secrets]].

Also, the current WIP [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6255499/chapters/14333560][The White Pawn]] has Draco staying at Grimmauld the summer before 6th year.

  When eighteen-year-old Draco Malfoy finds himself back at Hogwarts on the eve of Voldemort's infamous return, he is confronted with the most difficult decision he's ever had to make: Relive the 6th year at school he's tried so hard to forget, or do the unthinkable and ally himself with Potter's lot...

  After the eventful Christmas in Harry Potter's fifth year at Hogwarts, his godfather gave him a badly wrapped package. Inside was something Harry could use it to get in contact should the need arise, Sirius said. Harry resolved never to use whatever it was -- he would not put Sirius in danger. When later that year Harry was shown Sirius in terrible danger, he did not think of using Sirius's last-minute gift. Hermione, however, did. This is the story of what happened after that.

  The portraits at number twelve, Grimmauld Place have seen many strange things over the years, but none as strange as Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy staying under the same roof while there's a war going on outside.

  If you had only died when you were meant to, I'd have grown up in a wizarding world already ruled by the Dark Lord. I wouldn't be screaming at you in a sixth floor bathroom. I wouldn't be raising my wand, Crucio on my lips.
