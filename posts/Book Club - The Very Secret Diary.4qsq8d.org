** The Very Secret Diary might be my single favorite piece of Harry Potter fanfiction. It may as well be canon to me at this point. It took what I always thought was an interesting plotline, gave it the treatment it deserved, and cast the second book in a new, somewhat horrific light.

The characterization of Tom is probably the greatest reason why the fic is so successful. You can clearly see how someone like Ginny would like and trust him so much in the beginning. He's articulate and attentive without ever really being kind, and his descent into predatory behavior is so realistic it's almost uncomfortable. I felt so, /so/ bad for Ginny in the second half of the fic. The sequence where he doesn't let her sleep for a week in particular is horrifying.

I so wish we could have seen a Ginny in the later books that reflected the trauma she went through. Even if she's resilient enough to walk away from this without PTSD -- which would be incredible, given her age and the extent of her torture -- I can't see her ever feeling totally safe in her own mind again. I know it would have been too dark for the early books to include that, but I think it would have been a compelling character detail all the same.

Seriously, though, bravo to Arabella. I wonder why she took it down. I'm so glad someone saved it, because I'd have been heartbroken if this amazing fic got lost for good.

** It was amazing. It really took the second book and explored how dark the concept really was. I found myself wondering how nobody else noticed. Fantastic writing and I loved seeing that strength and defiance in Ginny.

** Stunningly in-character and chilling. Left me slightly shaken. Here's the sequel that can also stand as a standalone: [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=1036&chapno=1]] Such an unsettling thing to have been done to a child.

** The characterization is really well done. Voldemort is super creepy and Ginny is fiery.

** It certainly gave me new perspective on Ginny's character, but it also made me a little sad that we don't see more of the effects of her experience in canon. It felt really slow at first, and I actually almost gave up on it at one point, but I'm glad I didn't. I really liked the style/tone of it as well. It's definitely made it into my headcanon for the series.
