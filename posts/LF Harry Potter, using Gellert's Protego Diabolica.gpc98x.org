Hi

I am looking for a fanfiction with Harry using the spell Protego Diabolica, that we have seen Gellert Grindewald use in the Lestrange Mausoleum in Paris. There is the Graveyard where it would be good to use to protect himself and cedric if he was quick enough before Pettigrew use the killing curse.

But I will take others occasion as well

Thank You


** He used it in chapter 97 of Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance to protect himself and another character from getting abducted.

*** I can only accept it as it is within the criteria, but I have two comments : Harry should know how to use it and I hate Hermione even Salazar reborn to have that important role. Is there not a Harry Potter in forth year that has come into his own himself without outside help like Tom did ? ( without Sirius help)
