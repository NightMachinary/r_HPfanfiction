So, Barty Crouch managed to get his son out of Azkaban by exchanging him for his dying wife, what if it was actually common-place?

That he managed to do it at all implies a lot about the security of the prison and the amount of effort they put on investigations about prisoner's deaths. It would then be relatively simple for a morally dubious family member of any random prisoner to just grab a random muggle, make him chug some polyjuice made with a random bit of hair taken from the prisoner's hat or something, transfigure the transformed muggle into a random bit of clothing, go /'visit'/ the family member on Azkaban, make the exchange while poisoning the muggle and get away with the newly-freed family member.

After that it shouldn't be particularly hard to escape prosecution since there would be no one looking, just find a random muggle house or farm, either kill or send away the owners, ward the land to prevent detection either muggle or magical (Hermione could do it at 17, smart as she is it shouldn't be so hard for an adult if she managed) and go on living their life -only occasionally using polyjuice, glamours or just plain make-over when venturing on magical places.

As a result of this many of the ‘muggleborns' on Hogwarts actually are either pure or half-bloods born from ‘dead' criminals.


** I dunno, I always thought that Barty being an Important Auror Person was what got him in. I highly doubt they'd let the regular crowd visit Azkaban inmates.

*** No way of knowing for sure I guess. I mean, Dumbledore got to visit Marvolo Gaunt, but then again it /was/ Dumbledore after the Voldemort-revel.

**** A very fair point. Wizards do seem to have the complete lack of common sense and logic that keeping family members out of the prison or keeping visitors attended while they're in the prison would necessitate, so it is possible they're that stupid.

Would have interesting enough implications to ignore the ill logic of the premise too, in my opinion. Purebloods having to masquerade as Muggleborns out of survival necessity would be a fascinating concept to play around with and examine.

***** Obviously the only reason Barty crouch could pull it off is cause he was the head of the department of magical law enforcement at the time. You don't get visits in Azkaban and only high profile individuals are let in.

****** I dunno, this is also a culture that actively utilises Dementors in their main prison that their government officials can visit, despite the fact that Dementors can only be contained by a single spell that nearly every member of the population and the government are unable to cast.

Logic and good decision-making is not their strong suit.

******* Well Azkaban is meant to break its prisoners hence the dementors people sent there aren't supposed to get out. Patronus doesn't contain them it merely beats them back. But they can be contained, logically Azkaban is the perfect way to contain dementors by providing them with people to suck the happiness from. Like you said only actual government officials so far it seems only high ranking officials can actually visit the place. So I wouldn't exactly say logic and decision making is a weakness of theirs.

******** I see your point, but I do still disagree. Feeding them so they don't wander off is direction and appeasement, not really containment. Containment is sticking them in a box where they can't get out or somehow preventing them from spreading/doing whatever they want. Giving them people doesn't stop them going to other places to find more people with more happiness to eat, it just keeps them interested until they find something better. It's like the old 'grabbing the tiger by the tail' idiom. Sure, things are okay now, but the moment any element of the system falters, you're gonna get eaten. It's still an immensely risky play with a lot of very delicate balances to maintain and very serious issues caused if that balance breaks.

There's a good reason 'Dementors leave Azkaban and attack towns indiscriminately' hasn't become cliche, despite being such a well-used trope.

And well, subjecting your leaders and high-powered officials to mental manipulation also seems somewhat of a bad decision. We know that long-term exposure to Dementors has extreme effects on the mind and memory and general awareness of life, so imagine what the Head of the Prison experiences, and imagine what tiny but important things a VIP might forget if they visit too often. Might not be an immediately terrible idea, but it's certainly not a good one.

********* Ok I'm going to be honest here dementors aren't free they can be contained. I mean seriously I highly doubt they would have brokered anything with dementors if they couldn't control them in some way. I also personally believe that the actual guards and staff of Azkaban work in cycles by that I mean spend some time at the prison then get switched out for awhile then go back when it's your time again. I just highly doubt they would risk their own people in such a matter. As for VIP's visiting once again I highly doubt it happens Fudge went there for an inspection more then likely. Crouch was literally the head of the aurors hand had authority to visit the place. Obviously what I'm saying and what your arguing against worked well for them cause dementors became so little of an issue that most people stopped learning how to cast the patronus charm.

********** We're arguing two different definitions here, so this argument isn't going to go anywhere. By my definition, Azkaban didn't contain them because they literally wandered off without effort to join Voldemort in the later books. By your definition, Azkaban did contain them because they didn't leave earlier. Same data point, different interpretations. So, let's please stop this here.

** The fact that so many Death Eaters stayed in Azkaban until Voldemort broke them out throws a major wrench in this theory. Why wouldn't Malfoy or any of the other Death Eaters who got off break out all of their friends and family members? Surely Narcissa would have wanted to free her sister.

*** Yep, until her sister decides to turn around and start to spread chaos, potentially getting the entire thing discovered and both her and Lucius thrown in Azkaban /along/ with her.

My understanding is that the DE that were connected enough and discreet enough to escape prison did so, either the way I proposed or the Malfoy way (perhaps some got out of the country for safety) with the only ones /staying/ in Azkaban being the ones that either didn't have the means to get out or who were too high-profile/obvious to let out without putting the entire family who got them out in danger.

Plus there is the fact that some may have liked the way things went without a Dark Lord throwing cruciais around like candy or some of their most unpleasant allies around bothering them while they still managed to keep a hold over their own resources and even improve on them.
