Straight or slash is fine as long as it's well written. By well written I mean both characters are mostly in character (any major character changes should have believable arks leading up to them), no overt bashing, any OCs are well done and not Mary/Gary Sues or SIs, the plot is well put together and engrossing, etc.

As always long and complete fics are preferred but when it comes down to it, I'll read anything!


** I quite like his character development arc in linkffn(The Peace Not Promised). It's not yet complete but is faithfully updating each month.

There are other "Snape goes back in time after his death" stories - Come Once Again and Love Me has excellent writing quality and some really interesting ideas - but I like the plot of this one best. It really gets inside his head and explores what makes him tick. He's harsh and bitter and short-tempered, as per canon, but he really is dedicated to Lily and prioritises her wellbeing above his own. And having her back in his life slooowly softens his sharp edges; with so much going right, his grudge against the world eventually runs out of steam.

For Lily, choosing him is a harder road than falling for James. Severus is much more emotionally stunted than James, thinks quite differently from her, and is poor. But she can see a spark of greatness in him, and the boy who was her first friend (in fact, she thinks the "new" Severus is more similar to her childhood friend than he has been for years).

***** When I read novels, the descriptions and dialogues combine to make a movie run in my head. I'll try it again, maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind, but when I read it first, the italicised descriptions broke the flow of the scenes. A few times is okay, to emphasise something, but the emphasis was used multiple times. It seemed very melodramatic and unnecessary. I think it's probably my state of mind, I'll try it again. I did like the story for the chapters I read.

****** The italics are basically Severus' inner monologue, so for me they blend in with the rest of the "movie". It's very much a story about getting inside his head (and Lily's), so having that view fits.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after.\\
  Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical.\\
  After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Three Broomsticks.\\
  Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

  The additional tags of: abortion, corporal punishment, domestic violence, dubious consent, rape/non-con elements - do not occur between Lily/Severus.

** My absolute favorite one is Beloved on This Earth, hosted on The Sugarquill, author is Chary.It's old, it's complete. He's totally in character. The OC is lovable and has a believable reason for being at Hogwarts and the characterization and character growth is just spot on for everyone. It's probably better than most published romance books I have tried to read. It was written when only half of the books were out so just consider it an AU where he wasn't super in love with Lily.

** I have found a surprisingly love of Severus/Remus fics, both during the Marauder's Era and post-war.

The Way of the World by McKay [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10958553/chapters/24392781]] is one post-war favorite off the top of my head. The author has plenty of other fics on that ship that I haven't gotten around to reading.

I also really enjoyed The Natural Order of Things by Calico [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/246166/chapters/379710]] for a Marauder's era take. My only complaint is that it was too short!

He's Seventeen when they find him, but they were in for a shock if they thought he'd do what they wanted. Turns out Harry has known Severus for years, he's a metamorphamagus.
