Sure, living as a wraith can't be fun, but at least you are not dead-dead.

I do wonder though, provided that the safety of his soul anchors is not in danger, could someone exist until the heat death of the universe?

Has that been explored before?


** I saw a slightly-creepy one-shot where Harry used some kind of super-stasis charm on Voldemort; when the charm finally failed, it was millions of years in the future of earth when humans were extinct.

It was also the one where Harry left Voldemort his wand, but encased it in some ultra-hard material?

...Ah, right, I think this is it: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4070610/33/Thrilling-Tales-of-the-Downright-Unusual]]

**** It makes me wonder; time travel is a thing in Harry Potter; would it be possible for Voldemort to use what little magic he has left to rebuild life on Earth (to raise the amount of magic available to him), redevelop magical theory, and time travel back to when there's something to rule?

** Even wizards were still humans and had been around for thousands of years, negligible in geological time.

Horcruxes had never been extensively tested though. One question you can ask is why that world hasn't been ruled by some immortal god wizards since ancient times (Herpo the Foul).

Even if it worked as theorized, there would still be no escape when the sun expanded into a red giant and obliterated the Earth completely. Fiendfyre might look impressive to puny earthlings, and was nothing compared to true cosmic forces!

I have contemplated the idea that if Voldemort hid one of his Horcruxes on an interstellar probe, such as Voyager in HPMOR, he might escape the destruction of the Earth and eventually explore the universe:

The fastest man-made object leaving the Solar System, [[https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status/][Voyager 1]], is currently traveling at 38 thousands MPH. The nearest star, Alpha Centauri, lies 4.367 light years or 25.67 trillion miles away. It would take Voyager 1 nearly 40000 years to reach it.

The fastest broom in HPverse had a top speed of 200 or 0.2 thousands MPH. Assuming his wraith could fly at that speed, it would take Voldemort 3040000 or 3.04 million years to reach the nearest star.

Voldemort could also try for [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellatrix][Bellatrix]], 244.6 light years from us. He should reach there in 170.3 million years.

Our Milky Way Galaxy is about 100000 light years across, and the nearest major galaxy, [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy][Andromeda]], is about 2.5 million light years away.

*** On the subject of HPMOR and magical vs natural forces, one of my favorite exchanges was when Harry asked Dumbledore what would happen to a Dementor if you threw it into the sun. Dumbledore replied that he doubted one Dementor would be enough to put out the sun, but best not to try it anyway. There's no reason to believe that magic is nothing compared to cosmic forces.

**** That's actually a good question for JKR, or the Word of God.

I further want to know whether magic can work in outer space, or it can only function surrounded by living beings, as some lores indicate.

***** Either magic is a force of Nature, meaning that it's universal; or it's unique to Earth, meaning that "we" are somehow special.

This got religious-ish...

***** I think Earth Orbit would be workable, like a wizard on the ISS or some such (though for Merlin's sake be careful with the equipment)... but anywhere beyond that? I dunno.

It all depends on how magic itself is powered, and that largely rests on what the given plot requires.

*** I wonder if it's already time to test how truly limitless apparition can be. (How /does/ that work anyway?)

Maybe a quick trip to a muggle martian colony?

Of course, we /could/ go full fanon and explore some magitek, but that's a different thing.

**** Apparition is limited in canon already, as Voldemort had to fly quite a while from Nurmengard to get into apparition range to Malfoy Manor. So maybe it lies around 1000 km? That distance is however enough to get Low Earth Orbit and back.

In fact, lots of sci-fi crossovers have wizards apparating back and forth from their spaceships to the planet below.
