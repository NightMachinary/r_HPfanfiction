For those of you who don't know, Notice-Me-Not is a non-canon spell that is used often in HP fanfiction. If you cast Notice-Me-Not on something then nobody will be able to notice it. You could cast Notice-Me-Not on yourself then dance naked in the Grand Hall, teabagging the Slytherins morning Punkin Juice, and nobody will even realize you're there.

Honestly, it's just too good. It's so good it breaks my immersion.

Why would anybody in the books ever bother with Disillusionment when Notice-Me-Not exists? Hell, it's even better than Harry's invisibility cloak! With NMN, you don't even have to worry about people noticing your sounds, smell or even touch. It's the ultimate stealth charm.

And just take a moment and think about how ridiculously OP it would be in a fight. You could cast NMN on yourself then just walk up to your opponent and stab them in the face. If you cast NMN on your knife then your opponent might not even notice that there's now a hunk of metal protruding from his forehead (not that it would matter at that point anyway).

And the spell can't be counted, because, by its very nature, nobody will even realize that you cast it in the first place. You can't use a counter curse against something you haven't noticed has been cast. Even if you know somebody is using NMN in your vicinity, you can't exactly aim your wand at them to hit them with the counter curse, can you?

Realistically, if this spell existed, then this is what all competent magical fights would look like:

1) Witch A casts NMN

2) Witch B casts NMN

3) ???

4) The witches get bored and go home

What else could happen?

Perhaps they'll fire spells randomly around the room and hope to randomly hit their opponent? Nope, that wont happen; whoever casts the first curse will reveal their (general) location, giving their opponent a huge advantage. The strategic move is to let your opponent make the first move. So, a duel between two halfway competent witches consists of them sitting around doing nothing.

*FUN!*

And NMN doesn't just ruin fights and make the Invisibility Cloak redundant, it is also so incredibly versatile that it's OP in most situations that an adventurer could expect to come across.

- Want to break in to the Ministry to steal a horcrux? Notice-Me-Not!

- Want to hide a magic mirror somewhere Voldemort can't get to it? Notice-Me-Not!

- Want to sneak into Hogwarts to kill a traitorous rat? Notice-Me-Not!

- Want to steal a golden egg from a dragon? Notice-Me-Not!

- Want to eavesdrop on Malfoy to see what he's up to? Notice-Me-Not!

- Want to sneak into Umbridges office and use her fireplace? Notice-Me-Not!

- Want to stop a basilisk from looking you in the eye? Notice-Me-Not!

- Want to punch Voldemort in the dick? You get the idea.

Seriously guys, whenever a fanfiction includes NMN I can't help but wonder why the characters aren't using it all the time. If /I/ had access to such a useful spell, you can be damn sure I'd exploit the shit out of it.

 

Now, I'm sure that upon reading this some smartass is going to spontaneously invent some drawbacks for NMN in a desperate attempt to nerf it, but it's too late. If you have to explain the limitations of your spell in a reddit comment then you've failed to fully explain it in your original fanfiction.

When we look at how the spell is normally presented, without any meta retroactive excuses, it is undeniably OP.

 

Also tempus is a waste of time. Just give your character a watch. Fuck.


** That is not how Notice-me-not is commonly portrayed however.

Notice-Me-not keeps people who aren't looking for you from noticing you. For example, if you are trying to sneak past someone who is just looking in general for intruders, you would be better off using a Disillusionment/Invisibility cloak. The Notice-me-not is a charm to keep people who are not looking for you, from noticing you. It wont stop curious eyes, it wont stop sounds, nor will it stop people who are actively searching.

Also Tempus makes sense if you make magic sentient like most who use JK's form of magic must by nature accept. It must be sentient if one is using JK's magic system because that is the only way Magic could be able to judge intent, which is the basis between killing someone with AK and shooting a green lazer with it.

***** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight][Here's the one I'm reading right now.]] I don't know if I'd recommend it though. The NMN spell pops up a while into the story, and it's what prompted me to make this thread.

I'm looking through my history, but I can't seem to find the other two stories featuring NMN that I read in the past.

One of them involved a serial killer who murdered the assistant at Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes. He killed her with a deadly potion that made her bones twist into dust or something. She died in the middle of a crowded street while he stood over her and watched, but nobody noticed because of the NMN spell.

The other was a time travel story where Harry went back to fight Grindwald. He used NMN basically like an invisibility cloak to escape whenever he wanted. That story was pretty shit.

Hopefully somebody else knows what I'm talking about link those other stories, because for the life of me I can't remember their names.

These are the only 3 times I've encountered NMN so far, and in each of them the spell was OP.

It's called A Stricken Lament. Mind you, he didn't use just the notice me not, he used it first, then used an invisibility cloak in addition I think.

****** I was just thinking of that fic when you started this topic. However while there are definitely other instances where it is this ridiculous, a lot of the time it isn't this OP. In most fics that pass the bar of readable (so ignoring the tons of fics that are completely terrible in tons of ways and thus would still be terrible without this spell) it only makes people less likely to notice you, doesn't make you impossible to notice.

**** Some people use anything they can in “far more extravagant ways”, because what they are concerned with is neither balance nor for any mechanics of their world to be internally consistent but rather having a tool that will oh-so-well fit their character of choice.

Admittedly, this does mean that such an overpowered and honestly also fairly shitty portrayal is quite common in stories in general, but likewise many people do not restrain themselves with other effects when writing things (overpowered Fidelius with no requirements for the effect to work? Sure, why not. Ridiculously overpowered levitation charm that allows the caster to move themselves at the speed of the sound? Seen that too) and the results are generally ... sad, really. If you only take stories the authors of which are actually trying to have everything make sense then the portrayal described by [[/u/Zerokun11][u/Zerokun11]] is quite accurate: the notice-me-not charm makes people not pay much attention to you for as long as they are not searching for you (so not effective for infiltration if they know you are somewhere here and are looking) and you are not pulling attention to yourself (so starting to dance in the middle of the room would immediately break the charm)

Mate, I've read a fic where a guy slowly murders somebody over the course of an entire hour and in the middle of a crowded street, yet nobody noticed. I'm currently reading a fic where somebody just dropped a bomb into a cauldron in a full classroom of students and nobody noticed. I've never read a fic where somebody was noticed against their will while using NMN, no matter what they were doing.

Out of curiosity, why is Petrificus Totalus OP?

You're at the mercy of your attacker, and he's free to do to you as they please. They can fucking bury you alive and you're powerless to stop them. It's scary, man.

**** That reminds me of Alicorn's [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][Luminosity]] (well, more of its sequel, Radiance).

There is one character, Allirea, whose special power is to fade from notice. Depending on your mental fortitude, you are liable to forget her existence when she's not actively working to suppress her power. This extends to what she's doing while she's in front of you, leading to the following passage:

#+begin_quote
  After a few minutes he started screaming, which was a bit odd.

  I peered at him. He looked like he was in pain, but I hadn't hurt him, he hadn't touched the door, I would have heard if he'd hit himself against the stone of the cell... I supposed he could have had a heart attack, but that didn't seem likely in someone his age. The drops of his blood perfuming the air didn't have any scent of disease on them. It was peculiar, really. The only thing that had happened to him since he'd started his description of Heidi was that the stranger in the cell had sunk her teeth into his neck and started sucking his blood.

  "What's wrong?" I finally thought to ask, but he seemed as confused as I and just gestured jerkily at his throat. A few seconds passed, and he stopped screaming. I touched his wrist and checked his pulse. He was definitely dead. Maybe he'd had a heart attack after all. It wasn't /impossible/ for teenagers, and he was under a lot of stress. That wouldn't have anything to do with his neck, though - as far as I know. I'm not a doctor.
#+end_quote

The author took pains to bury any mention of Allirea in the narration, so if you're not reading carefully, you might miss her even when she's mentioned. This is one of the more blatant mentions.

** Almost any spell can be overpowered if you want it to be. Homenum revilo or whichever spell it is that finds invisible people would likely work against this spell and if you have good awareness you might notice that you keep looking away from a certain place. If you want an under used spell you either want the memory charm or imperious curse. Either one could be exploited to unreasonable levels, heck the summoning charm should have made the Horcrux hunt easier with regards to food. Cannon or fannon doesn't matter, magic is inherently overpowered which is why we have people try and limit it in so many ways. I have some loose notes somewhere on my computer about a story about a morally questionable Harry who mainly uses compulsions, confundus, memory charms and the mind arts to work around everyone instead of having teenage angst fit in the great hall, all you need to do is spend enough time thinking about how to maximise almost any spell and it can become ridiculous.

*** I fully agree that memory charms and the Imperious curse are OP. However, they aren't as OP as NMN, and their lack of overuse don't break my immersion.

For example, abusing memory charms and the Imperious curse is morally ambiguous at the best of times, so I can suspend my disbelief when our heroes refuse to use them. They're also fallible and can have strong counters (you can block memory charms and overcome the Imperious). Notice-Me-Not, however, can be used without any ethical hangups, and heroes have no excuse not to use.

 

It's also less troublesome to pull of effectively, as you don't have to first defeat your opponent in a duel (like you might with a memory charm) or even be aiming at an opponent to use (like with the Imperious). Notice-Me-Not can be cast on yourself at any time, without any chance of missing the target. You don't cast Notice-Me-Not /at/ somebody, and so, unlike Unforgivable Curses, it can't be intercepted, dodged or otherwise prevented. In fact, the spell is best cast in advance, before even entering combat, effectively ending the fight before it begins.

 

On top of that, memory charms and the Imperious curse both have "hard counters," whereas Notice-Me-Not only has "soft counters." For example, a memory charm can be hard countered with a magical shield that it can't penetrate. An Imperious curse can be overcome by a strong enough will. These are reliable and definitive ways that a skilled wizard could use to defend themselves from those two spells. Notice-Me-Not seemingly doesn't have a hard counter.

Even if Homenum Revelio actually worked and revealed the general presence of a NMN spell, that is still not good enough to reliably counter it, because you need to know their exact location as you were firing your spell. You can't fire two spells at once.

Additionally, you would only be prompted cast Homenum Revelio if you notice something suspicious. You would only ever cast Homenum Revelio if you already noticed the presence of somebody using Notice-Me-Not. You see the problem? NMN stops anybody from noticing anything suspicious. You would only cast Homenum Revelio if you noticed something suspicious. NMN actually ends up countering Homenum Revelio just as much as Homenum Revelio "counters" NMN.

Of course, you could almost fix this by casting Homenum Revelio constantly, /especially/ when you /don't/ expect anything. However, the prospect of actually casting HR every few seconds for your entire life is totally unreasonable, if not outright impossible. That level of effort and paranoia just isn't in any way realistic.

Also, the idea that NMN can be counted by "noticing that you keep looking away from a certain place" wouldn't work. If it did, then somebody using NMN would just have to take a couple of steps to the left every so often to change their position, so that there's no specific place that their opponent consistently fails to notice.

Finally, if there was some hard counter to NMN, then why does nobody ever use it? I've never read a fic where NMN had an effective or reliable counter.

 

Notice-Me-Not is also far more frustrating because it actively makes canon magic redundant. Harrys Invisibility Cloak is a Deathly Hallow; a legendary artifact of great power. Notice-Me-Not, a common spell, is far superior. NMN makes one of the most memorable, whimsical and /fun/ magical artifacts completely redundant.

 

You also need to exploit the memory charms and the Imperious curse to make them OP. It takes a little creativity, skill and planning to pull off an "eternal Imperious chain," or whatever.

NMN, however, is OP in its default stage. NMN is OP just in its general use. Even if you use NMN without any forethought or cleverness, it's still really really OP.

 

NMN is also far more easy than memory charms and the Imperious curse.

For example, there are prerequisites to using the Imperious curse effectively. First, you need a victim. That victim then needs to be surprised, defenseless, or otherwise unable to stop you from bewitching them.

The victim also needs to be powerful enough to actually be of any use. This creates a of natural "risk vs reward" balance; the more useful a prospective victim is, the more competent and difficult to curse they must be.

Once you actually managed to bewitch a competent victim, you then have to hope they don't arouse suspicion or overpower the curse. See Barty Crouch as an example of how unreliable the Imperious curse is.

If that wasn't hard enough, let's not forget that the Imperious curse is illegal. If can't get caught casting it or else it's life in Azkaban.

In contrast, you can just cast NMN on yourself and then you're done. You win. You can now do whatever the fuck you want. It's that easy.

 

NMN is also just so versatile. Memory charms and the Imperious curse aren't useful in every situation. NMN basically is.

Think about it; how often throughout the books could the Trio have breezed past their obstacles if only they knew NMN?

 

And finally, I'd just like to reiterate that I am *not* saying that the Imperious cure and Memory charms aren't OP. They definitely are.

However, Notice-Me-Not is in a whole other ballpark. NMN is ridiculously OP. It can't be countered. It has no drawbacks or risks. It requires no effort or cleverness. Notice-Me-Not is just insanely good.

 

 

 

 

As a side note, I think it's funny that you mention Accio, because that charm is also ridiculously OP if used creatively. Perhaps it's even worse than NMN. Though that's a discussion for another day.

** Finding out that this spell was fanon was one of those moments that had me thinking if perhaps I wasn't much too invested in HP fan fiction.

Honestly, it made perfect sense to me because of the Leaky Cauldron. In PS Harry is surprised to the bar after Hagrid points it put to him and there's a line that goes something like "if Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there". It seemed perfectly logical that wizards who put so much stock in remaining hidden would have a spell to simply escape the notice of those who aren't necessarily looking for you. Notice-Me-Not, walk through a crowd of muggles, even bumping into them, but they don't notice because they're not expecting you to be there.

I also agree with everything in the top comment.
