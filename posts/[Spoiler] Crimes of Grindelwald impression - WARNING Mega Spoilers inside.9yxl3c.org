I think it's pretty good, and I like it better than the first one. Grindelwald is IMO a much better villain than Voldemort, as he makes some very compelling arguments. As a seer, he foresaw the coming WW2 atrocities and threat of nuclear weapons. He wants the wizards to rise up and stop all that from happening.

The various Wizarding governments were truly malicious and oppressive. Grindelwald was brutally tortured while in MACUSA's custody. British and French Aurors were throwing killing curses with wild abandon. The director of the British Magical Law Enforcement was taking a totally hardline approach against Grindelwald, which ended with Grindelwald killing most involved Aurors with his blue Fiendfyre.

Credence and Queenie joined Grindelwald, but Leta Lestrange refused and sacrificed herself to let others escape. Grindelwald was furious and let his Fiendfyre run loose. Flamel arrived in time and led others to contain the Fiendfyre.

The one major controversy happened at the end when it was revealed that Credence's true identity was one Aurelius Dumbledore. It's not confirmed if he's a brother of Albus or not. I highly doubt that's the case unless JKR completely rewrites the part about Dumbledore in DH.

The other minor controversy is the appearance of a Professor McGonagall. However, it's not confirmed she's indeed Minerva McGonagall. She could actually be an ancestor of Minerva. On the other hand, we've seen a McClaggen playing comic relief.

Nagini hasn't done much in the movie other than accompanying Credence. She didn't join Grindelwald.

Dumbledore and Grindelwald has created something like a blood pact that prevents them from going after each other. Newt manages to get it from Grindelwald through his Niffler. Grindelwald wants Credence to take the lead in destroying Dumbledore.

Leta Lestrange is the most sympathetic character in this movie for me. She might also be a survivor of the Titanic (since wizards crossed the Atlantic like the Muggles). At least the years and her age check out.

This movie feels more like a plot setup for the remaining three ones.

Finally, I'd like to point out that Grindelwald totally doesn't care about blood status. Magicals Uber Alles is indeed his motto. I think significant number of Muggleborns, who are discriminated in the Wizarding world by the Pureblood establishment and utterly disillusioned with the Muggle world, will join him enthusiastically.


** Honestly I dislike the fact there trying to connect Credence more. There's no physical way he's related to Albus.

Nagini was pretty useless. IMO

Leta did a great job and I loved her character arc.

I'm not too sold on the Blood Pact part yet. I mean it makes sense but kinda weird that it's revealed now.

I don't know the movie was decent, but I feel like you could have cut out a bit and focused more on Grindelwald or Flamel, and the story would have been much better.

*** I'm not too big on Leta either, I feel like this should have been another hour long, to introduce the characters fully. With Leta, you get that she has a thing for newt, has had one since school, but for some fudging reason, ended up with his 'by the book' brother. Then for some reason she decides to say Eff You to Grindelwald, after seeing MANY TRAINED AURORS just melt to the stuff. I needed her arc to be longer with some more depth, I feel like we just got the sparknotes version of this character.

​

I feel like they are still iffy on whether or not to just come out and say it 'Dumbledore is GAY, deal with it' for the shear fact if they do that, markets will be closed to them for the movie distribution. I REALLY hope they do, this is an established thing by the author and to back down for political reasons will just be awful.

​

Grindelwald>Voldemort(that we have met); All we have seen for Voldy is the crazy guy who's been existing as a spirit for over a decade and for that reason went crazy as a vengeful spirit. We were told he was suave and charismatic, but.... we never see it. Grindelwald just casually shows up in France, drapes the city in Black, and tells everyone, 'hey! muggles done some Effed up stuff, and gonna get worse, we need to so something, and we are peaceful! unless attacked' and then drops a blue fire vortex that atomizes people and turns it into three baelfire looking dragons and it takes an immortal alchemist with help to take them down. he's looking to be top shelf villain stuff.

​

And I feel like he doesn't care about blood status, I can't see him making that comment for JUST Queenie. He wants any 'rare soul' in which magic 'blooms'.

**** Kinda funny, that evryone is pointing out Nagini as pointless, when Flamel was even more of an unnecessary inclusion. He appears two times. Anyone could have been the host and there was literally nothing he contributed that could have been done by others.

Nagini at least interacts in ameaningful way with another character (Credence) and is integral in advancing his caracter. Ironically she might have been the thing he needed (a loved one), but not what he wanted. His origin is what he wanted, but also something that would not fill the needs he actually has. He could have experinced care and love and he knew it, but his obsession with being someone overruled it.

Flamel... he was a pure nostalgia trip.

******* It's really confusing to me how many people argue in favor of radical consequentalist philosophy.

The ends don't justify the means and I doubt anyone who says that truly believes it. Almost anyone has a line that they are unwilling to cross (raping babies, burning 100 puppies alive per day for 10 years, flaying an innocent person alive per day, enslaving a race). I have some grudging respect for someone who actually follows through and says "Yeah, i'd totally do that in return for a cancer cure or eternal world peace", but it's pretty rare.

Usually people who believe this actually mean "The ends justify the means, except when I find it icky/distasteful". So basically they operate entirely on intuition and "The ends justify the means" is just [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning][motivated reasoning]]. They like to believe that they have rationality on their side and are not just using their feelings.

******** The thing is, the end does justify the means - within reason. No one sane would argue that you cannot destroy property to save a life. Some values are superior to others. The personal freedom of someone clinically insane, for example, is worth less than the risk they pose to others. Locking someone up so they don't hurt themselves is also pretty much an accepted and legal measure. So is taking someone's kids away to protect them against abuse or worse.

That's not intuition - that's pretty much generally accepted law.

Where it gets murkier is when you reach stuff like "removing personal freedoms and rights to protect lives" and "killing people to save others". What means would be justified when they are needed to save 50 to 100M people?

Many characters will answer that differently.

Sounds like you actually don't have any reason to offer and are just relying on your intuition - just denying it and arguing that there's some reason involved without giving reason is kinda weak. Why do you think it is less reasonable to take away the personal freedoms of an innocent as opposed to someone criminally insane, when I posit a scenario where both would equally improve the greater good?

If you have problem with killing someone innocent or taking away their freedoms per se (meaning the action in itself makes it somehow more unreasonable) you are using deontological reasoning and are far removed from consequential ethics. You are just picking and choosing what suits you best in each situation. If you actually believed in "The ends justify the means" you wouldn't require such distinctions: You'd just say "Sure, go right ahead doing terribly abhorrent things, as long as there's a net positive in the end, because I believe in consequentalist ethics! All I care about is the cost/benefit outcome, these things aren't murky for me at all!" For example if you believed that overpopulation is a huge problem, forcibly sterilizing everyone suddenly is not only morally acceptable, it becomes a moral good, something that ought to be done (prescriptive).

I mean, this is good that you probably don't think like this, it shows that you aren't a sociopath.

Ah yeah, that's a typical sort of escape for a consequentalist. Usually this happens when they are unhappy with the possible results of a thought experiment like the Trolley-Problem, feel really uncomfortable about it and come up with ways to weasel out of the heart of the issue: "Well, what if tossing the fat guy of the bridge doesn't actually stop the train?! Huh?! What then! You need to incorporate all possible consequences!"

In our thought experiment I'm telling you that killing/raping the babies will definitely lead to a greater good. There are no unforeseen consequences or a decline in morals/law. Just imagine I'm god, which I have proven to you without a shadow of a doubt and I cannot lie. Are you going to rape and kill the babies, or no?

Just in case you are cool with the baby murdering: Lets imagine re-enslaving the blacks in America will lead to the absolute greater good for all. You definitely know this for a fact. Are you now in favor of slavery? Again, in this thought experiment there will be no negative effects for society by reintroducing slavery. It's just going to be shit for the slaves who are raped and worked to death, but it's all going to be made up for by a golden age for humanity and world peace in eternity. Human utopia!!! It just takes a bit of slavery to get it.

Most pretend-consequentalists cop out of these kinds of thought experiments, claiming they are too "artificial", even though they are usually totally fine with other artificial scenarios that make consequentalism look good (time traveling and killing Hitler).

Law is pretty irrelevant to ethics. There are plenty of laws that are immoral and there are plenty of immoral things that are legal. If I lived in 18-19th century America I certainly wouldn't want to look towards law for my moral guidance regarding slavery.

************ I think you still don't get it. This is not about counting and comparing lives as if they were numbers. This is about comparing values. How much do you value the right of the people to determine their own fate? How much do you value their lives? To what degree will you infringe on one to save the other? Are ten years of dictatorship justified if it means 50 million lives are saved?

"The ends justify the means" doesn't mean "whatever the cost" - it means that whatever you do needs to be justified by your goal. Destroying your neighbour's car because you're envious is wrong - but destroying it to get his baby out before it dies in the heat is right.

Those thought experiments are worthless since you make up conditions that do not exist or make sense.Of course reintroducing slavery will have negative consequences for society - people will be enslaved. Of course, raping and killing babies will have negative consequences - at the very least on the one who does it. And if you, by act of god, declares that this won't happen, you might as well make the utopia happen without such a condition, rendering the whole experiment void anyway.

The thing is, for every action that can hurt someone, the ends have to justify it. There's no absolute "That's OK, no matter what" condition without taking the results and consequences into account.

*** Agreed, it's a cheap shortcut. OTOH, this movie is in 1927, so we have 18 more years until Grindelwald is defeated, so it's kind of too much for Dumbledore to keep worrying about who killed Arianna.

Still, they could have saved the blood pact. Why don't make Dumbledore kind of sympathetic to Grindelwald, as long as Gellert avoids public (thus non deniable) violence? He may have cut ties with him due Arianna, but Grindelwald is still pushing the agenda they've built together. And if it takes a words in secret and the killing of a child to prove a character is a villain, maybe he can be crafted as a not-so-much of a villain instead.

In other words, Dumbledore could have sent Newt to retrieve Credence, while also keeping a wait and see approach to Grindelwald. Some sort of Chamberlain to Travers' Churchill.

***** To be fair, my analysis of wizards v. muggles up until now wasn't that muggles have nukes. I think it's cheap and unrealistic when muggles use nukes against wizards. My thinking was that muggles have such an /enormous/ numbers advantage that wizards /need/ the equivalent of nukes to level the playing field. Now, we see that wizards actually have that much power--and not just the blue fire. Dumbledore casually changing the weather for all of London, anyone? Or a couple dozen Aurors repairing half of New York in minutes, for that matter. That neatly solves the debate, but I still worry that it's story-breakingly OP.

** Okay, in terms of straight writing, I don't think it was as good as the first movie. JKR was trying to do too much at once, much like in Book 5 and parts of Book 7. The plot was cluttered, Nagini was pointless, the Yusuf subplot felt shoehorned in, even the Queenie subplot felt a bit clumsy, and the whole thing could have been a lot cleaner.

On the other hand, I agree with you that Grindelwald was a really great villain, and I was also pleasantly surprised by how well Johnny Depp played him. I feared there was a serious risk it would be "wizard Jack Sparrow," but it felt completely different. I don't necessarily think Voldemort was a bad villain, but he was definitely more cartoon-bad guy. Grindelwald is someone you can see a lot more than fringe thugs and bigots supporting, so much so that I thought it was out of place that the people at his rally were all described as purebloods.

McGonagall doesn't fit at all. It can't be an earlier McGonagall because her father was a muggle, and it can't be her mother because her father didn't know about magic under after she was born in 1935. (Also, if this movie were true, she'd be about 130 in Cursed Child, but let's not go there.)

As [[/u/ForumWarrior][u/ForumWarrior]] pointed out, the blue fire was not only /not/ Fiendfyre, but it's officially parsed as a /shield/ spell! Even though it's clearly portrayed as "Fiendfyre, except blue now". That just seems unnecessary.

Was anyone else weirded out that the Lestrange's nanny was "half-elf"? I mean, it's the Lestranges, so having an illegitimate child with the help is almost expected, but something seems wrong to me about humans and house elves being able to interbreed.

I thought the blood pact was a really clever plot device, but it does raise the problem of how the duel that killed Ariana happened in the first place if it existed. Not to mention how "Aurelius Dumbledore" can fit into the story. The phoenix appearing to Credence was clearly supposed to "prove" that truth, but I feel like we're missing critical information on both points.

Okay, timeline:

1897: Newt (and by extension Leta) is born, per Fantastic Beasts the book

1899: Kendra and Ariana Dumbledore die, per Deathly Hallows

1901: Credence (and by extension Corvus) is born, per the screenplay

1904: Credence is born, per his birth certificate

1906-ish: Credence is born, per both his and Leta's apparent ages. (In fact, I had the impression Credence was even younger in the first film. We have a serious problem here, but note that none of the possibilities fit the /Titanic/ sinking. Shipwrecks were common enough in those days.)

Grindelwald described "Aurelius Dumbledore" as Albus's brother. We don't know when Percival Dumbledore died, but he was supposed to have died in Azkaban. The easiest way to make this work is to retcon that part to say he got out sometime after 1899 and had another child, possibly unbeknownst to Albus. A wildcard possibility is that Credence is somehow a manifestation of Ariana's Obscurus, perhaps as a result of some dark experiment (note the "dark twin" description.) That sounds like a longshot, but I honestly wouldn't put it past JKR at this point.

Another possibility is that JKR is working off a completely independent book-canon and movie-canon, and none of the dates in the books are reliable. I think she's definitely doing this to some extent. Related to this is the fact that magic seems really overpowered now. It certainly resolves the wizards v. muggles debates for good, but a lot of it also feels story-breaking when held up against the books. When one wizard (admittedly one of the two most powerful in the world) can destroy an entire city without breaking a sweat, the Battle of Hogwarts should have gone very differently.

  Finally, I'd like to point out that Grindelwald totally doesn't care about blood status. Magicals Uber Alles is indeed his motto. I think significant number of Muggleborns, who are discriminated in the Wizarding world by the Pureblood establishment and utterly disillusioned with the Muggle world, will join him enthusiastically.
#+end_quote

Something that shows in Starfox5 fanfictions and which could complete the world building is Starfox5 ideas of Grindelwald welcoming muggleborns. After his defeat, this makes the victors repudiate and discriminate against muggleborns in general. So if we follow the world building, Drumstrang doesn't take muggleborns because they've suffered a lot during Grindelwald's war. Voldemort, who grew in London during the Blitz (huh, weren't children evacuated?) and suffered personally at the hands of the German Luftwaffe (and maybe Grindelwald) promotes an anti-muggle and anti-muggleborn agenda because he knows how far the muggles can go, and how much damage wizards and muggles working together can do, so in turn, he wants to wipe the muggles out of the face of the Earth. The initial Death Eaters, all survivors of Grindelwald's War, follow him because of that. And finally, that also explains why muggleborns haven't just gone abroad during the events of Deathly Hallows: They are just not welcome elsewhere.

** The titanic theory has been brought up several times but the timeline/age actually doesn't work

Leta was born around 1897, Titanic sank in 1912 so she would have been around 15 which doesn't fit, and I've seen a few people say that according to the screenplay the ship sank in 1901 so it couldn't have been the Titanic

Also, a few people have pointed out that in the movie the ship sank on a stormy night whereas the Titanic sank on a clear night

As for McGonagall, while it's not explicitly stated in the movie itself, in the credits she's listed as Minerva McGonagall, I think her grandmothers name was also Minerva though but some people don't think that works out either (forgot why), so who knows what's up with that

I agree on the plot set up comment, I think/hope after the series is finished we'll be able to look back and say “ohhh that's what that meant” lol

** I didn't like it at all, it made a lot of retcons and not just of canon but the first fantastic beasts movie as well.

Making Credence a Dumbledore was a pretty bad move imo, especially in in a post Last Jedi world. Came out of nowhere and was unearned.

Leta Lestrange essentially showed up, provided exposition and then died, which is a shame. both her and Nagini were underutilized. Flamel being underused is acceptable(arguably too powerful), but why introduce these characters and then drop them?

The blood pact ignores that that they already fought which ended with Ariana dead. I find it unlikely that they made the pact after.

Queenie's arc was disappointing, but an understandable regression. She's used to having things her way, and likely only saw what she wanted to see in Grindelwald's speech at the end, which would have been horrifying to Jacob.

Finally, I'm still mad about them not sticking with Colin Farrell, he did a much better job than Depp.

*** I feel like Nagini was just there to be mentioned in the trailer and then cross off the checkbox for "features an actor of some kind of asian ethnicity". Not to be mentioned she was basically put in clothes that not even prostitutes would wear during that time period. Such a shame.

Queenies arc was so lazy too. Just rushed and not fitting her core values. "I love my sister, she's the only one I have!" Continues to join the madman in the middle of the room who continues to want to destroy the entire city INCLUDING Tina and Jacob? What? Also in 3 Months, neither Jacob nor the sisters mailed Newt that Jacob remembers? I understand Tina wouldn't but the other two?

To much is left to the viewer to fill in or assume offscreen.

Every character excluding Newt is either so out of character in my opinion or I just didn't care about them, because they got no screen time/ died to early/ were introduced as gimmicks. And I liked Flamel. McGonagall tho felt like a cheap joke. I love Minerva and am offended by her portrayal.

I really want to love the movie, but I just can't.

** Have to say the argument that muggles and wizards are so different and can't live peacefully falls apart a bit when wizards even a century ago, when by HP canon the worlds were meant to be /even more/ divided and not progressively integrated, are perfectly happy to go around all day in even more muggle-style clothes than they wore (at least in the adults' case) in the 1990s.

Why is everyone in this movie white apart from some token casting? Considering where it's set could you not have got some extras?

Not sure these are working as films. 'Fantastic Beasts' and 'The Crimes of Grindelwald' were and are essentially at this point two separate - almost completely separate - plots going on in the same world. When you have a couple hours' narrative that really needs to be tighter and more cohesive if you don't want to wind up with the film coming off like a slice-of-life. That kind of plot splitting would be much less stark in a longform medium. If this is what the series is going to actually end up being about, titling it 'Fantastic Beasts' seems like a misstep from the off as they will need to keep shoehorning elements of that in alongside the main plot.

Finally, straightwashed Dumbledore I'm not really here for. You don't get to take bonus points, JK, for including a prominent LGBT character and then when it comes to adapting that and making a mark not only wussing out, but /also/ removing all eccentricity and subtle queercoding that could be done if you didn't want to be outright. /Especially/ considering that homosexual romance has been revealed to be a key part of that character's character arc. Sorry, but this grey suit-wearing, conservative small c looking fairly traditionally masculine guy does not square with the purple robe leather heeled boot wearing dapper older gent we got in HP1-7.

** Things I liked:

- Grindelwald. His charisma, use of magic, the many ways the film distinguished his philosophy from that of Voldemort.

- French Ministry and the cat protective spirits.

- Newt's forensic magic.

- Use of the Shield Charm by the unnamed Ministry wizard who found Credence and Nagini.

- The scale of the Fiendfyre, capable of destroying Paris if left unchecked (assuming it was in fact Fiendfyre*).

- The blood pact. Adds substance to Dumbledore's inability to confront Grindelwald.

- The creatures. They were pretty much all well-used.

- Skull vision thing of World War 2 (but see below).

- Depiction of Flamel.

- The humour. The "eyes like a Salamander" running gag was good, I thought, especially in its culmination where Tina basically drags it out of him.

- The fact that phoenixes come into existence under certain conditions rather than being born via biological reproduction.

- Newt's house.

Things I disliked:

- The Credence Dumbledore reveal. I don't have a problem with Credence being related to someone famous in principle. I don't even object on a fundamental level to him being a Dumbledore, though it's a bit "everyone important is a Skywalker" for my taste. It's the particular way in which he is related to Dumbledore which just doesn't make sense within the established Dumbledore family history.

- The Lestrange mystery. This was an answer without a question, I thought. JKR has historically been very good at developing mysteries, but she just didn't do the groundwork here. We were being asked to care about the mystery of a character's past very shortly after being introduced to that character for the first time. I just didn't care, and once all was revealed it turned out that it had zero connection to the main plot of Credence's past. I guess it was meant to be a red herring, but I don't think anyone ever really fell for it.

- None of the Aurors try an unblockable Killing Curse through the wall of fire, despite it being used liberally through the rest of the film. It wouldn't have worked, of course, but I would have preferred for the film to take a moment to establish that Grindelwald had an answer for that particular attack.

- Queenie joining Grindelwald. You saw it coming a mile off -- basically as soon as Grindelwald's ladyfollower (did we ever get her name?) took her in. But she seems to have had a complete character transplant in this film.

- Grindelwald's line about Muggles turning their weapons on wizards. It doesn't amount to much, as the power of magic as depicted in the film only emphasises the wizards' advantage, but it's still a frustrating line that will feed certain sections of the fandom.

- The lady next to me in the cinema who kept on shouting out her reactions.

Things I am ambivalent about which other people comment upon:

- McGonagall. Her age has gone back and forth a few times, so I have no problem with it being adjusted yet again. In fact I prefer her older, as it helps stress the slower rate of aging of wizards.

- Magic cuffs. So far as I can tell, they just monitor your magic use, they can't stop you from casting magic.

I'd give it maybe a 7/10. As predicted: good worldbuilding, okay characters, weak plot. As a fan of the franchise the worldbuilding is enough for me to enjoy it, but I can see how more casual fans would rate it lower.
