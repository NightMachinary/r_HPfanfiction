** I'm nearly finished with one as we speak!

[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/130946411][Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (The M. Clifford MOD)]]

I'm calling it a "MOD" because I sort of go down to the code and do a full fan edit. It has over 20k reads, 4 acts, and Harry is the main character. I fixed all of the canon issues we have with the play and made sure it better aligned with the label of "the 8th story". I've been working on it for over a year, and I'm about six scenes from being finished.

** I'm working on...... well, I call it a "shitpost" because that's kind of how it started. But I'm working on Bad Oracle and I'm having a good time with it! It's Snape-and-Harry focused and is out of OotP because time travel means never having to say you're sorry. Delphi dreams a little bigger this time, and her plan isn't so woefully stupid.

  If Harry Potter could alter the past, he isn't sure what he'd change, but he knows he'd change something.If Severus Snape could hold history in his hands, he knows exactly what shape he would mold it into.Albus Dumbledore might flatter himself enough to think he would walk away from such power.But Delphi Riddle isn't here to serve any of them.(Rating for some really prolific cursing and very little else.)
