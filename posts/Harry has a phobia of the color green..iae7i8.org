For as long as he could remember, Harry has had nightmares.

He'd hear a man downstairs, shouting for "Lily" to go, to keep Harry safe. He'd hear noises that ended with a green flash, then a strange faceless man walked up the stairs. A woman - a woman with fiery red hair and a kind face, the only things Harry could see clearly in the dream - begging to leave Harry alive, take her instead.

Another green flash and the woman simply dropped, an unnaturally anguished look on her face. Dead.

The faceless man walked up to Harry, who is watching from behind the bars of his crib. Helpless. Two words - shouted too loudly to make out clearly - and another green flash, brighter than ever, woke Harry up, near-screaming, in his cupboard.

Another nightmare. They were different now - blending together. His uncle shouting, blustering about the "ungrateful freak". His aunt, leveling a frying pan at him - a face too similar to the one the kind-looking woman had, but twisted into losing its kindness, looking at him like he's something unpleasant at the bottom of her shoe.\\
Still, the green flash remained - sometimes his uncle would be the faceless man in the original dream, sometimes instead of a frying pan his aunt would point some kind of stick at him, shout, and out came the green.

He refused to look in a mirror now, his own eyes reminding him of the green flash that somehow kept featuring in all his nightmares. His aunt had once tried to force him to wear a hideous sweater - a cast-off from Dudley, bought for Christmas and never worn again after - in that same green color.\\
It shriveled and turned pure black until it could have /maybe/ fit one of Dudley's action figures.

When he walked by the park on the way from school, he'd keep his head locked firmly in the other direction, or skyward, so he wouldn't have to see the vivid plant-life. Honestly, he'd be okay if he'd walked home an hour or two later, so the plants were less illuminated and thus a darker shade.

When Harry came to Hogwarts, his phobia of the color was plain for all to see. He'd flinched when he saw the green trim on the robes of about a quarter of the older students, and learned that those colors belonged to Slytherin - he begged the Hat not to put him there, so he wouldn't have to wear the color he abhorred.

The Hat had looked in his mind, seen the nightmares - and promptly decided that he needed to be with people who could show him how to be brave, how to not let an irrational fear ruin his life. "GRYFFINDOR!" it had shouted, and Harry had honestly never felt so relieved since the sweater incident.

--------------

I had a plotbunny. This is where that plotbunny ended and writer's block set in - if I'd gotten even through Harry's first year, I'd have considered posting it as my first actual fanfic. As it is, I'm just going to leave it here for the subreddit to do with as it pleases.


** He couldn't even look at the mirror as the emerald color of his own eyes gave him the heebie-jeebies the forbidden forest Was absolutely terrifying to him and every class they shared with the Slytherin was petrifying. Harry was positively in a state of perpetual panic at the sight of anything green until Hermione like the brilliant friend she was finally wrote her parents about the problem and her father the dentist called his old college roommate the optometrist for some custom light spectrum filtering glasses in Harry's prescription.

Now any time Harry saw anything that was green it had a blue tint to it which made most things appear more aquamarine then true green which put his Phobia to rest thankfully. Even during potions

****** Well I mean even with the tinted glasses, Avada Kedavra is most likely a different color, so he'd just have to learn to dodge aquamarine spells instead of green.

*** Of course Hermione's the one who figures it all out, I mean she's a fucking genius of a woman who can do absolutely no wrong and can see everything, like the omniscient goddess she is at 12 years old
