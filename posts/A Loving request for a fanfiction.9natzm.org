In Harry Potter, Lily suddenly and without explanation fell in love with James. It's really rather odd. The spoiled rich boy was constantly rejected until one day he suddenly wasn't? Would James Potter who was always given everything really be happy about not getting what he wanted?

Just what would happen? Would he be resentful? What if he decided that he deserved her? That it was for the best. She would certainly be happier with him.

What if he used a potion to /persuade/ her? A few drops in her drink during dinner. It would hardly be a challenge for the biggest prankster and his equally talented friend.

So, Harry Potter was born under the influence of a love potion. Now what could an author do with that in mind? I wonder if a potion master would have realized and was pushed to a certain side due to it.

An orphaned boy born due to a love potion. Cursed and hated his entire life because of his strange nature. The ability to talk to snakes.

I really want a fanfiction seeing this idea through. Does anyone know of one? The other details are mostly my mind going wild, but is there a fanfiction where Harry was born by means of a Love Potion? Dark Lord or Paragon of Good whichever although I admit some preference for the darker end of things.

***** As much as it pains me to point that out, the magical world does not see love potions as rape drugs but merely some harmless fun. Best example for that would be Molly Weasley, who has many fans around here despite admitting the use of them at least once (we don't know on whom). And Romilda Vane faced no criminal charges either.

Therefore James wouldn't disqualify as headboy if he used them.

Don't get me wrong, I don't agree with OP's hypothesis, but I see where they are coming from.

****** Not necessarily, it depends on their use, duration and effects. Slughorn openly states that Amortentia is incredibly dangerous in HBP, and doesn't play it up as something harmless or desirable. Also, I can't remember when or where it's said that Mrs. Weasley used a love potion. I would happily count myself as a Mrs. Weasley fan (I like all the Weasleys).

The point I raised with OPs proposal is that I just don't see James Potter doing anything like that to the person he is very much in love with, and dispute the suggestion that it is plausible according to canon.

************ You picked a good analogy; well argued.

Just for the sake of conjecture though, I could see a bunch of young witches bringing Amortentia as a party game at sleepovers. Not to feed to anyone, but instead in a similar application as a ouija board: smell the potion and determine something prophetic about your 'true love'.

************* Remember also that it's only Amortentia that has been classified a dangerous potion; there are many weaker, similar imitation potions, such as the ones sold in Fred and George's joke shop. It's never specified which potion Mrs Weasley brewed, and given that she did it as a young girl its likely that it was a simplified version of an imitation love potion. Still not ideal, but not as bad. Also, i agree with the previous commenter in their suggestion of the use of these potions. Its like a love calculator site. On that vein, imagine a divination equivalent.

According to a Rita Skeeter article in GoF, it's common knowledge that love potions are banned at Hogwarts.

  Love Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and no doubt Albus Dumbledore will want to investigate these claims.

The Head Boy would be required to abide by the same rules as the rest of the student body. But of course James got away with breaking plenty of rules while at Hogwarts, so there's no telling if he actually would have been punished.

** I don't think this is possible. If Lily suddenly fell in love with James, there would have been a similar scene as with Harry and Ron in HBP when Ron eats the love potion spiked chocolates. Everybody (which includes Lily's other friends) are aware of James's crush on Lily and it is not that difficult to understand that James might have given Lily a love potion. If it would have been that simple, Severus (the 'oh so great' potions genius would definitely have given it to her).

Lily is a muggleborn ==> Anne Frank

Snape is a blood purist ==> Nazi

The problem with Snape is -

1. Had Voldemort decided to go after Neville or had he not known about the prophecy, Snape would have still been a death eater. James would still have been in the Order of the Phoenix. The contrast is quite clear, isn't it?

2. Let us compare a bully in our modern life versus a mass murdering terrorist. You are sure you would support your friend if he/she decided to marry the terrorist or would you support him/her if he/she fell in love with that bully and decided to marry him knowing that the bully has changed his/her ways.

3. Snape did not 'love' Lily. He was obsessed with her. He had the same patronus as Lily, not its complement.

4. For those who hate James, we have seen one specific scene through the eyes of a person who hated him. Of course, it is going to be biased. Maybe Snape even planted the specific memory there so that Harry would come to doubt his father, hmm?

If you would remove that bias and view what James has actually done, you would appreciate him more - became an 'illegal' animagus to keep his ill friend company at great personal risk, took Sirius in when he ran away from his abusive home, became apart of the Order of the Phoenix even though he could have stayed away from the conflict as he was a pureblood and could have married some other pureblood witch instead of Lily.

Whereas Snape - appreciated the dark arts and called what his friends (Mulciber, Avery) done as fun, called his (best?) friend an extremely derogatory insult in front of the entire school when she had personally defended him and their friendship from her other friends, joined a terrorist organisation which was against the best friend whom he reportedly claimed to have loved and constantly abused Hermione, Neville and other children (Neville - constantly called him names, tried to kill his frog, Hermione - when the (enlarging?) spell hit her teeth - "I see no difference"). He probably might have killed many mudbloods in Voldemort's service happily going about his duty.

To conclude and for emphasis, had Voldemort decided that the prophecy was about Neville, Snape would still have been a death eater.

*** Snape was a very prideful man and despised people who were given things they didn't deserve. He would see using a love potion as a dishonourable thing and would never do it.

Snape isn't evil. He isn't good. He is all gray. Neither good nor bad. The triple agent who deceived both Dumbledore and Voldemort for himself.

1. Snape was a death eater because he had no real option otherwise. He enjoyed the dark arts and was very talented in them. He was a talented Slytherin who fell into the wrong crowd. In a world where everyone wants to kill you, he was all but forced to become a death eather simply because everyone believed him to be. When all his friends are doing something with the only muggles he ever knew, his father, being abusive to him, it would be very odd for a teenager not to join the wrong crowd. You are forgetting that Voldemort wasn't openly evil at first. He was just a rising figure that seemed like a paragon of the dark arts. Imagine following an Angel, being greatly impressed and indepted to him, and then the angel suddenly revealing to be an angel of death.

2. Snape has never been confirmed to have killed anyone. In fact, it was (deductively) *confirmed Snape never killed anyone* due to his soul not having been split as murder does in the HP universe. Excluding assisted suicide via Dumbledore.

3. People in love are usually obsessed as well. Would you argue that Tonks didn't love Lupin because she had a wolf patronus? No, you wouldn't because the patronus is your protector or a representation of a person very dear to you. We cannot know for sure why Snape's representation chose a Doe, but it could be because that was what represented her entire being which Snape witnessed.

4. We also haven't heard anything about him from someone who wasn't also extremely biased in favor of him. You are arguing that you like bias A more than bias B, so this bias A must be true. As for the planted memory, Snape was very upset and angry that he saw that memory. Snape would have had no way of preparing him to see said memory anyways. Also, didn't someone admit that said memory happened later? I'm not sure.

Snape called what his friends had done as "fun" because they were schoolboys who likely only made someone trip as a prank. Do you honestly believe that schoolchildren were going around murdering people and calling it "fun"?

I DON'T EVEN BLOODLY LIKE SNAPE. I just recognize that you are going out of your way to bash a character in a post that has little to nothing to do with him. All of your points reek of a strong biased viewpoint particularly in the way you take things out of context to the extreme in order to paint them in a poor light. Did Hitler's kindergarten teacher praise his murdering of millions of people when she called him "talented" or by telling him to go have "fun"? No, because she had no way of knowing what attrocities he would someday commit.

If you reply to this, I'm just going to block you without reading the reply. I see no reason to hear you rant and hijack a thread about a possible fanfiction idea that mentioned Snape offhand. You sound very much like a pureblood going on a rant about muggleborns when they have no idea what they're talking about AND the muggleborn reference was inside a history lesson on an offhand note about character.

**** Addressing your second point - perhaps I missed this part of cannon, probably because JKR put it on Pottermore years after writing the books, but to my knowledge killing someone doesn't split one's soul. Rather, one has to kill someone in order to split their soul (I'm under the impression that the magical backlash of ending a life is the only force strong enough to split a soul, but that's just speculation on my part).

Supporting this:

1. As you said, Snape killed Dumbledore and his soul did not split.
2. In GoF, Barty Crouch Jr as Mad-Eye Moody kills a spider in a demonstration of the Killing curse. Not a human life, which might be the difference, but we did not receive any indication that the act split Crouch's soul
3. Bellatrix and Fenrir Greyback, amongst other Death Eaters, have high body counts, especially in innocent lives in Fenrir's case. We receive no indication that these characters have had their souls split.
4. Voldemort himself: he has killed countless people, including James and Lily Potter, the old man he kills in the seventh (?) book, and several followers who displease him. However, he only has seven Horcruxes, seven splits of the soul.
5. Molly Weasley killed at least one person, Bellatrix (i say at least because we don't know her role in the first wizarding war. Given her nature and her obvious duelling abilities, I am certain she had an active role, but again we cannot know). We received no indication that this split her soul.

This leads me to conclude that it is not the act of killing that splits the soul, but rather the utilization of the magical backlash of ending a life. Perhaps what you mean to say is that the act of killing leaves a scar on soul? Of course, if dearest JKR has taken the time to contradict herself on this matter as well, please feel free to correct me.

So, second point (presumably) invalid.

Also, what prideful person decides that bullying children is an acceptable pastime? Actually, why would someone abhor love potions but then continue to take out a grudge he has against a dead man on children? Snape is far too childish to have such a rigid moral objection to love potions.

***** When Dumbledore and Snape are talking about Harry being a Horcrux, Dumbledore says he doesn't want Draco to kill anyone because it would damage his soul. Snape replies in a way that implies his soul would be damaged and that it has not yet been so. It's definitely not the most concrete of answers, but it's pretty substantial. I may have said it was Harry they were talking about, sorry.

  “If you don't mind dying,” said Snape roughly, “why not let Draco do it?” “That boy's soul is not yet so damaged,” said Dumbledore. “I would not have it ripped apart on my account.” “And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?”
