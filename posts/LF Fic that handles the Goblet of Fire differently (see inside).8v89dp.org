Hi *waves*

yesterday I nearly threw my reading tablet at the wall when I was reading a really well written fanfic about the Goblet of Fire incident, when suddenly Dumbledore was all out of character, acting as if he was the grinch himself. Neither acting sneaky nor smart, getting defeated by a second year girl.

Dunno. that kinda doesnt work for me.

People like to abuse the idea of "in loco parentis" in order to justify what Dumbledore has done - legally -.

But "in loco parentis" does not work as a one-way-street.

The schools headmaster that is acting in loco parentis has a duty to make sure the children he is taking care of, are well and safe from harm.

Therefore I am looking for a fanfiction in which Albus Dumbledore does what a responsible and - in loco puerum / Ethicorum autem debiti - person would do and assumes controle over the contract Harry is legally unable to uphold, and takes his place as the combatant for the Triwizard Tournament.

Sure, sounds bit far-fetched. But cmon. We are willing to accept Harry Potter getting raped by any character and then fall in love with them - a Dumbledore that takes responsibility is not that far off, is it?

**** I could- as entertainment for the crowd if nothing else- after all, the huge event would be a huge breadwinner for Hogwarts and the ministry if it didn't end in disaster- a more well known school is one more people are likely to go to, and who knows, maybe there's magical tourism beyond attending events- and if the people like their visit they'll come back and spend more money.

I could see him insisting on going last and be scored a 0 for the first two events though- and just waiting by the trophy after leisurely walking through the maze, none of the obstacles slowing him a down- to congratulate the proper winner, maybe even bumming a ride on the portkey

**** So in this fic Crouch gets Harry otherwise ? Or Dumbledore is victim to the trap set for Harrry?

I have always assumed that Dumbledore is using Harry as bait to see what move Voldy has planned.... that's basically the plot of GoF. So perhaps if you take that away, there is no point in the tournament ....

Are you asking for an entirely alternative year 4 or are you looking for a scenario where it's Dumbledore vs pre-revived Voldemort in the cemetery showdown'

***** I'm not the person who was looking for recommendations, but I imagine the tournament would go on, but would be entirely separated from the Voldemort plot. The Triwizard Tournament would be just what it is billed as - an opportunity for fostering international cooperation.

Maybe Voldy would have Crouch kidnap Harry earlier in the year since there wouldn't be any reason for him to wait for the final task.

***** Whatever, I wont argue semantics with you, since we are lacking confirmation from Rowling, but Muggles barely have any rights in the Wizard World. Harrys legal guardians are his muggle relatives. They dont have a say in magical matters. If Harry does not want to be part of the magical contract, then the person who is responsible for him while he is at school has to have a say in the matter. Thats basic logic.

It all comes back to the fact that Rowling doesnt make sense and most stuff is there for plot convenience so fuck it.

I am done with this topic.

** linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern) --- brilliantly written; explores the TWT with additional tasks, challenges and new opponents.

linkffn(Harry Potter And The Magic Of Life by Kate Carpenter) --- quite well written, and while this doesn't really deviate from the original cannon plot a lot, it improves on another aspect of the TWT --- building international relations, and finding new friends.

*** Read the fic by jbern, - I guess most have read it by now. It was nice but the Harry of that fic was an arrogant piece of shit. Sorry, not Sorry. Most stuff could have been prevented or would not have happened at all if that Harry wasnt so over-confident without being able to back it up 100%. Or maybe I am a little too harsh - it has been a few months since I read it. And the ending did leave us hanging quite a bit.

*** Just looked at The Magic of Life because it sounds good. There's a spelling mistake in the title of chapter one. Is that a one-off? Or am I going to be cringing every five minutes because something else is wrong. You said it was quite well written. I just hate reading stuff with spelling mistakes.

Edited to add: This annoys me more than most mistakes because they've spelt Surrey wrong. As a graduate of the University of Surrey, it's hard to read when they've missed the e.

***** Oh dear, I gave it a shot but there's a lot of mistakes. I was willing to overlook the spelling/wrong word issues because it's a non-english native writer but there are massive plot errors already too. I forgave a mention of Fleur working for Gringotts because they'd just introduced the idea of younger apprentices but they've also just made reference to Bill's attack by Fenrir Greyback. This is supposed to be set in the summer after 3rd year. That attack doesn't happen for another 3 years and it's being represented on an item given on his first cursebreaking mission? That's a pretty major mistake. I'm gonna go re-read Cursed Summer instead.

  End of 3rd year. While Sirius is on trial to prove his innocence, Harry is abandoned by the Dursleys who, after the Marge incident, have enough of him. Luckily Harry's picked up by Bill Weasley. And ends up joining Bill on a Cursbreaking expedition to Cambodia. He gets far more than he asking for! Disturbing news, promises, trouble and danger keep following Harry's every step.

** Well, I doubt it's a good idea to let Dumbledore competing against other 17 years olds. But should that happen, Voldemort and Barty Jr would certainly come up with some alternative plans.

However, Dumbledore could take actions to minimize the threat to Harry:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): Dumbledore and other adults, among them Sirius, worked out that Harry could just give minimum effort and survive the contest. But this Harry wanted to win. Also, they checked the Marauder's Map thoroughly and couldn't identify anything suspicious.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542): Someone kept trying to sabotage the event, and Dumbledore had all his hands tied up and couldn't divert his attention elsewhere.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea.
