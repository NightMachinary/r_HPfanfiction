:END:
I read three fics I can't find anywhere, please help:

1. It turns out Voldemort killed Snape using Nagini because he didn't think he'd be able to find it in his heart to cast the killing curse on his most loyal follower.

2. Voldemort is worried that Snape took the Unbreakable Vow to kill Dumbledore, because he is concerned Snape will not succeed in killing the most powerful wizard alive and thus will die either via Dumbledore or the vow. Snape is internally surprised Voldemort is concerned for him. Voldemort also thinks maybe Snape intends to sacrifice himself so that Dumbledore can live.

3. Snape returns to the Dark Lord after his return in GoF. This was a livejournal fic. Snape explains that he didn't kill Harry because he figured Voldemort might want to kill him himself/need him for some reason, which ended up being true because he needed Harry's blood for the resurrection.

None of these are slash fics. Just cool interactions between Snape and Voldemort. Please help? If I find them myself, I'll update this post.
