:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a Harry Potter fic I read a while ago but I can't remember the title of. The plot was more of less like this: Harry is being abused by the Dursley, but instead of regrowing his hair like canon-Harry does, he just becomes very plain-looking and this has something to do with him having his glasses on. Nobody notices him anymore and since he likes to stay in the background he doesn't even prevent Voldemort from getting the stone or killing Ginny. It might be a Harry/Voldemort fic.

  When he's little, Harry discovers something Very Special: he can make his wishes come true. Literally. Cue the chaos.In which a young boy discovers a way to slide under the radar and the profound consequences that follow. What happens when you've taught yourself to become untouchable?Tone changes from childish to mature as Harry ages. Rated M for a lack of moral conscience, the occasional murder, and a graphic dark theme here and there (because why not?). Happily Ever After, Voldemort style.
