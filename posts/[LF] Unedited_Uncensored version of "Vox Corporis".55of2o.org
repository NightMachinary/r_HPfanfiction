Apparently the version available on ff.net is edited/censored? Yet the original from portkey doesn't seem to be available anymore. Does anyone have a mirror/archive?


** IIRC, you're not missing much in the portkey version other than some awkward teen puberty issues that Hermione 'mentors' Harry through, which is weird enough...

** Can I ask what Vox Corpis is about? I'll filter search around to see if I can find one.

** I have uploaded here on Zippyshare. As far as I knew, it is nowhere on the internet anymore. I actually think this version is far better than the PG version. Chapter 20/21 displays some brilliantly well crafted adult content, completely holding the tone of the story.

*** Oh wow, thank you so much, didn't expect a response to this anymore.

There seems to be a problelm with Zippyshare though (at least for me; maybe they don't like html files? I've downloaded files from there before...). Can you upload it anywhere else?

***** Is there any way to get another link? This one is expired. I love this fanfic and have read it many times, including the unedited version. The unedited is so much better and I miss it.
