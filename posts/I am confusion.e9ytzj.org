** Firstly, I think the vast majority of the people in the world already don't read fanfiction, so by definition, it would be Not Sheeple to read it.

Secondly, Sorry to break this to you but in the world of literature, there are No New Ideas. Everything has a trope. The entire meaning of a trope is that it's a figurative/metaphorical use of words, phrases, etc. Everything that anyone has ever written has certain archetypes and tropes. That doesn't mean everything is the same, just like no two wands are exactly the same no two pieces of literature are the same even if they have the same components/tropes.

Thirdly, Why waste your time caring about what other people read? If you like a story and you think it deserves more recognition then share it with your friends, share it as much as you want. That's the only way to get more people to notice it, not by shitting on what other people like.

** Sometimes fics have just been around for a while that have caused that to happen, or that the author has a following already and they have favorited to keep it in their saved archive

** Fuck off with your "my opinion and likes are the only relevant ones" bullshit.

Let people enjoy whatever the fuck they want.

The sentence about everybody but you only reading "trope riddled trash" alone gives you a firm spot on my "fuck this guy" ignorelist. You sound like a goddamn 11 year old kid that has yet to realize that people are diverse in their likes and dislikes.

** Same reason action/romance/comedy movies collect more than other genre.

Nah, you're just pretentious. You're like *some* people who love prog rock or movies like 2001: A Space Odessey or Stalker and think that makes them better/ smarter than people who enjoy just rock or Star Wars. Even I was one of those people for a time. But now I can simply enjoy stuff without looking for some deeper meaning or life lessons. It's really great, you should try it. The fics with most favourites are *entertaining*. Not necessarily good or original, but *fun* to read.
