** Yes, it's canon and Harry even had settled on giving up his dream because Snape required an O. The classes required seem like good ideas. Though, I will say fan fiction authors seem to think potions and herbology are required so that aurors can be better at healing when in reality they're probably required more so to identify poisons, polyjuice, and dark plants.

*** Wrong, there is no specific class mentioned. It is more that Harry's classes for OWLS was: Charms, Transfiguration, Potions, Herbology, History of Magic, Divination, Astronomy, and Care of Magical Creatures.

  “You'd need top grades for that,” said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it. “They ask for a minimum of five N.E.W.T.s, and nothing under ‘Exceeds Expectations' grade, I see. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office. It's a difficult career path, Potter; they only take the best. In fact, I don't think anybody has been taken on in the last three years.”

  “You'll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose?” she went on, talking a little more loudly than before. “Yes,” said Harry. “Defense Against the Dark Arts, I suppose?”

  ...“I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work......Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,” she added, with the merest flicker of a smile. “Poisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors. ...."

Just to list the classes McGonagall advises: DADA, transfiguration, Charms, Potions. Now that is it, advised. As in, they are quite useful for Aurors to have, but no specific requirement, besides the before mentioned 5 NEWTS.

So for his NEWTS Harry slimmed it down to the 5 classes he'd take for his NEWTS to maximise the chance of getting the necessary grade level.

**** Eh, splitting hairs imo. I don't see the ministry hiring many Aurors that got NEWTS in Divination, Care of Magical Creatures, Astronomy, History and Muggle Studies. That's 5 NEWTS, but it's not what the Auror office is looking for.

Defense, Potions, Transfiguration and Charms are specifically mentioned during his counseling session. Herbology is the oddball, though probably useful for the same reasons as Potions.

But as per the canon: There is no specific requirement besides their grades. While getting NEWTS in those specific classes might be preferred, it is never mentioned that it is exclusively for those classes, in which case they do lack one.

**** It may not be technically required, but the odds of getting into the program without potions are probably slim to none, and the chances of getting through the program even if you were to be accepted are probably even less.

The Auror force is elite, you don't just hand in your school transcript and get automatically accepted if you have the right grades. If Harry had a reasonable chance to get into the auror program without potions, he wouldn't have taken it.

***** Who stated that you just handed in your transcripts and were accepted? Is there any job in which that'd be the case? And as my quote states, plenty of tests before you even get officially accepted.

Here's the thing, you hear advised, but you'd always read it as an unwritten requirement in real life. But this is fiction, so unless stated otherwise the canon still says 5 NEWTS of at least EE, with no specific class requirement. Which is what the OP asked: *"Is it canon that potions is needed to be an auror? If so why and what's your opinion on the different classes required for it."*.

Canonically, no, there is no requirement. Harry just went the path of least resistance with the classes which was advised to him and one random extra class which he thought was not horrible.

EDIT: I get downovted for pointing out that what Ash replied, was not an answer to the OP's question. Good god this sub must be salty about this thing. FANON =/= CANON and this was a question about the CANON.

Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened them again, and continued as though nothing had happened. “I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my N.E.W.T. classes unless they have achieved ‘Exceeds Expectations' or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level. I'd say you're averaging ‘Acceptable' at the moment, so you'll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing.

Here's that page worth of text. Nothing states that any of those classes are required, as MCGonegall put it with every class: She advises it. What anyone choose to extrapolate from that is up to them, but the only hard limit that canon puts out is 5 NEWTS.

Why Harry chose to drop CoMC could be anything.

The fact that poisons and antidotes is required knowledge of aurors, does not necessarily mean that it is required to know before you study to become one. I mean, it is not a pre-requirement to be stealthy before you join the force either. Nor is it a stated requirement to have a DADA or Charms NEWT either. So why exactly potions?

Why did Harry give up on being an Auror until he was allowed into his Potions NEWT? Why did McGonagall bother to tell him he was eligible for Potions, if it wasn't necessary? Why would McGonagall say "take this subject, it's essential" if it wasn't?

All I said was, there are plenty of things they learn between going into the aurors, and officially being an auror.

And, why would potions then, be the only requirement?

************ When you implied that learning about poisons wasn't a part of potions. I was responding by pointing out that poisons could only logically be part of potions.

Again: why would McGonagall bother finding Harry and telling him to get to Slughorn's class, if the only requirement is 5 NEWTs?

Harry was taking 5 NEWTs. Yet he did not believe he could possibly be an auror. Thus, there MUST be a requirement beyond having 5 NEWTs. And, given that the only subject McGonagall describes as "essential" that he isn't studying is Potions....well it doesn't take a genius to work that out.

And I never said Potions was the only requirement. Don't put words in my mouth. You're the one claiming that having NEWTs in Runes, CoMC, Divination, Charms and Arithmancy is enough to be an Auror.

***** ISTR in HBP, Harry is at first disheartened at getting an E in Potions for an OWL because it would block him from his Auror aspirations, but ofc Slughorn's presence saves the day there. :P

** Yes, Professor McGonagall told Harry in their meeting in 5th year with Umbridge, that he needed Potions to be an Auror.

I imagine its for similar reason cops need to have medical training. It most likely helps to know about different potions, and ingredients that people have come in contact with or that can help them do their jobs. Auror's probably make their own healing potions, poly juice, and veritaserum, along with knowing about poisons, and other potions that help with the job.

** Nope, [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Auror#Requirements][Auror Requirements]]. It is only suggested to be. All though as some on here says, it is if nothing else quite beneficial for most to have a good overview of the more advanced parts of potions so as to identify them more easily. And more knowing the more advanced aspects, mean that there is less chance of the same detail falling trough the cracks at a critical moment for everybody.

** McGonagall gives Watsonion justifications, but really, Rowling just wanted to keep focusing on the classes she'd spent the most time writing about, which, y'know, makes sense, but it's still a little disappointing that Harry's school life doesn't change much from year 1 to year 6.

** Canon is less clear about this than this thread would have you believe so far. McGonagall makes suggestions to Harry, but doesn't claim that anything is mandatory.

“Yes,” said Harry. “Defense Against the Dark Arts, I suppose?” “Naturally,” said Professor McGonagall crisply......" “I would also advise Transfiguration....." "Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and Potions...."

But then later, in book 6, Harry's reaction says something different: "This was the end of his ambition to become an Auror. He had not secured the required Potions grade."

So take your pick. Was McGonagall misspeaking when she implied potions was optional, or was Harry simply grasping the wrong end of the stick when he thought it was compulsory?

With that in mind, I physically don't understand how anyone could argue it's not a requirement.
