Doesn't have to be dark Harry just wanna see him hide that part of him and desperately learn his place in the wizarding world. But also have the kind of clinging attachment to his muggle-childhood, but hates it being referenced. I guess this also serves as a prompt. I could imagine an interpretation of this to be able to be fitted into canon.
