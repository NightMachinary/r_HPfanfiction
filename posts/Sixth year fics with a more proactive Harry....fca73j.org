Preferably withOUT H/G (or Hinny or whatever it's called these days), or slash. Not really a big fan of Snape/Malfoy glorifying, Dumbledore/Weasley bashing, or overly helpful Goblins/Elves.

Would rather not read about Harry's Lord-y shopping trip, 69 inheritances and one big happy family with a 420 member harem.
