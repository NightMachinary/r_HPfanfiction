Something that you wouldn't usually recommend because you know it's not actually good, but for some reason you still love to read it? I'm reading this fic right now that is basically wish fulfilment on steroids. Lord Harry Potter-Black-Gryffindor was being controlled by love potions and compulsion charms by Dumbledore and a few Weasleys, and when he finds out he's practically the richest most powerful man alive (from goblins that love him for remembering their names) he has a makeover and buys a new wardrobe.... It's almost like the author was checking the boxes lol. Fixed his eyes, check. Grew out his hair, check. Got taller, check. I know it's completely ridiculous, but every once in a while I like to read some brainless insanity.

Do you have any fics or tropes that you feel almost guilty about enjoying?


** Harry/Fleur is my guilty pleasure. It makes absoultely no sense, cause he's fourteen and she's seventeen, they barely have any interactions, and they have nothing in common, but whenever I see a Harry/Fleur fic I check it out.

50 caliber machine guns should be enough against acromantulas, trolls, and werewolves. Mounting them on broomsticks could work wonders!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is a great story in itself, and Trio's love and friendship is a central theme. However, there is no word about romance between them, other than that they live and sleep together.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/16/The-random-craziness-file][Chapter 16, The Damned]] of "The random craziness file", linkffn(8222091), could be a great romantic Trio fic if someone fully fleshed it out.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856625/1/The-Return-of-the-Marauders][The Return of the Marauders]] has Neville as the BWL, but he is completely OOC. The fic starts out good but can go off the rails at times.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5503587/1/Ghost-of-You][Ghost of You]] is one of my all-time favorites. It's an angsty post-War Harry/Ginny story where Neville is a good guy at first who is just really close to Ginny since they shared experiences at Hogwarts under the Carrows. Ginny is recovering from serious PTSD and Neville for most of the story is just a really good friend. But then we slowly (or not so slowly) realize he's in love with her, even though she is with Harry. Everyone sees it but Ginny, and then Neville finally comes on to her and sorta ruins everything. He becomes that awful "Nice guy" who can't accept they are just friends and suddenly is not such a nice guy anymore. The bash happens well into it so at first you don't see it as Neville bashing. But it is by the end. Also, I found the entire thing realistic and not too OOC for him, at least until the end.

One of the problems I think is that by casting Alan Rickman (not complaining about his casting, just his effect on this type of story), I see Snape as this 50-something year old professor in a much more mentor-y way than he really was. Canon, he's what, like 19-20 yrs older than Hermione?

** Oh man, this is basically my entirety of fanfiction. I love the shitty tropes.

I started by reading all the soul bond fics, I'm pretty sure that unless it is new I have read it. Or at least started, some of them were too bad for even me to read. I've read 3 that I liked, and 2 that I would recommend to people. This is out of probably a couple hundred.

Then I followed that up with wBWL fics. Generally more homogeneous in terms of structure and plot, but with a higher rate of acceptable.

Then the time travel "fix everything" OP Harry stuff.

/edit/ Oh I forgot the marriage contracts! Only read a bit of them in terms of how many exist, but more than enough.

Other than that...\\
linkffn(Keep Your Enemies Closer) Mentor!Voldemort (sorta... kidna...)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness) that one I'm hesitant, as the sequel has been abandonned and the person who took it up really does not have a style on par...

linkffn(Birth of a Nightmare Man) Incomplete and also very good. It's sequel (which have been written first) does not picture the slip, but already has a solid insane Harry linkffn(The Nightmare Man). The Nightmare man is completed however.

linkffn(Evil Be Thou My Good) A 40k one-shot which is an absolute delight. The "slip in insanity" is not so apparent, but it's there, definitely.

linkffn(Shadowed Malice) Mentor!Father-ish Voldemort Wrong-boy-who-lived, etc. You got it all. The writing is kind of... okay. A bit jarring on the sides and juvenile, but it lets itself be read.

linkffn(Stand Against The Moon)

linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute)

linkffn(To Define Treachery)

** "Bellatrix is actually controlled by a mixture of love-potion, Imperius and mental conditioning."

I don't really know why, but I always enjoyed reading of the talented and intelligent, but confused and disoriented, mentally-fragile girl forced and beaten into a loveless marriage, only to be then made into a marionette. Its seldom well written, but when it is, it makes for a great, tragic tale.

Bonus points if she remains off her rocker after being cleansed off the potions and controls, and just goes on a rampage in the opposite direction.
