** There's the Innocent series about Sirius and Harry, but it's only up to 4th year so far. It's pretty interesting though and most characters are fairly in character, except for McKinnon and the Malfoy brothers (Hydrus acts like Draco in canon, while Draco grows up very differently with a brother). It heavily features the Tonkses and Remus in the time before Harry goes to Hogwarts, and Harry and Sirius are fairly in character in the beginning although the different storyline causes them to diverge from canon more over time. I recommend it.

  AU Third Year: He spent twelve years in hell for a crime he did not commit. Sent there without the courtesy of a trial. Betrayed by his friends and allies. Now he has broken out. He will find and catch that rat and then, they will pay!

  Post-OotP --- Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. Rebuilding his life with a war brewing in their world isn't simple. It's a good thing he has a family to fall back on this time. What he didn't realize was that good things don't last too long. Not for him anyway. Harry & Sirius family fic. Semi canon-compliant.
