So, I've a hankering to read fics about a pairing of characters that regard themselves as 'partners' in that 'us two against the world, huh?' sort of way. It's pretty common in Harry-Hermione fics, I think, but I'm open to whatever pairing with no filter/requirements where that dynamic exists, if only so people besides myself can get something out of this thread. I'll even accept... a Robst recommendation! /shocked gasps/ I know! The scandal!

That kind of all-consuming, tangled-up-in-each-other reliance fascinates me on a psychological level. Not a personal desire, mind, that level of co-dependence would literally drive me mad - I'm introverted as fuck, myself - but as a dynamic for study, it's quite interesting to look at.

If you need an example of the tone, if not the specific phrasing of this request, then check out 'Adorable Violence' or 'Brilliant, but Scary'. It's not necessary for a relationship to be quite that Yandere (am I using that right? I'm not an anime person, myself), but it's a good example of that 'my partner is what's important, everyone else can burn' kind of tone I'm looking for.
