My first thought was Privet Drive, but ultimately I thought it best to leave it open, since it's a prompt, not a plot summary.

Also, to head off accusations of plagiarism, I'm sure I've seen the concept before in fanfics, I just can't remember where(I've read literally hundreds), so if anyone can name a fanfic with the concept that I've read before, I'll be sure to give proper credit.

** So here are some ideas for you

1. An alternative universe to defeat Voldemort (basically the most cliche one)

2. To the first Blood War when it looked like they were going to lose

3. The early rebel alliance (star wars)

4. When the Kira problem was getting too out of hand (death note)

** The war against Grindelwald.

Plot twist: Harry joins him and convince him to not trying to fight the muggles into submission but to help the wizarding world to advance and secure that changes are being made like:

Looking out for abused children, especially Muggleborns which parents are not that satisfied with having magical children

Teach wizarding raised about biology and destroy their "arguments" against muggleborns

Show them the benefits of some muggle inventions like pen and writing pad, medicine, cars, television and other stuff

Get Justice for Muggleborns and Squibs

Rewrite the laws of wizarding Britain
