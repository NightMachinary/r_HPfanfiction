I would like to point out that any story which features a daughter of James and Lily who fulfills the same story role as Harry, is nonetheless a different character. It was a different sperm cell that reached the egg after all, thus making Victoria Potter and her ilk essentially a sibling of Harry (sort of a lost twin . . . or is it Harry who's lost, since he technically doesn't exist?) rather than a different version of him. At least that's my take on the issue. Maybe it is different from the muggle world since souls conclusively exist.

But at any rate, I propose we label the fics of this archetype as "Girl Who Lived" instead. GWL for short. "fem!Harry" just sounds kind of silly, and detracts from the character of the GWL, by making us, consciously or subconsciously, compare her to the original Harry, and makes things feel kind of wrong. At least for me.

On the other hand, if there's a fic with a mtf transgender Harry, "fem-Harry" seems like an appropriate term. But from what I understand, most or all the so-called "fem-Harry" stories are along the lines of what I described above. Correct me if I'm wrong, though.

Thoughts? I conceived (no pun intended) this post while reading through the spectacular "Victoria Potter." I've loved the story and the only thing that's really nagged me is the "Fem-Harry" trappings.

/Alright, you guys have convinced me that I'm wrong./


** I think in HP fanfiction, 'Harry Potter' is more of a role than a person. Every fic has their own version of Harry--I don't think it makes sense to say that a female version of 'Harry' is more like a lost twin than any other fanfic version of Harry Potter. If the child of Lily and James lives through the events at Gordric's Hollow, regardless of their gender or other attributes, they're the 'Harry' of that story.

*** Although some fics really do a good job of keeping Harry true to his canon self, and I often gravitate to those. And others /try/ to achieve a canon compliant Harry, even if they don't do as good a job of capturing him. So Harry isn't always just a role.

** I don't think it works, because said fem!Harry might not actually be The-Girl-Who-Lived, just like Harry himself isn't always The-Boy-Who-Lived.

** Like someone else said harry isnt always the bwl so fem-harry is just the better term. Examples like if neville is the bwl or if voldemort never existed so there was no bwl in the first place

** I can only agree with [[/u/Vercalos]], GWL/BWL is a different thing from Harry, since quite some fics have other (or even multiple) characters who fulfill the GWL/BWL.

The only term I can think of would be OC, but that sits a bit strange with me: While fem!Harrys are typically an OC, most take the parameters of canon Harry's upbringing/background (often with a hearty amount of AU), which is better explained by the term fem!Harry than OC IMO. Personally, I view each story as its own work, and with the variety of fanfics and Harriets/Hadrians/Harrys/etc I've read about each one turns out to be their own character anyway.

** I don't think it's wrong, it's just another 'what if' scenario and Harry happens to be a girl, doesn't make it a lost sibling but yet another possibility. Besides, she doesn't have to be a GWL, or there could be fics tagged as GWL and female Harry and they'll turn out to be sibling sisters, where Harry is not a GWL... Fanfics are like that, anything is possible and describing the trope as female Harry is more correct and less confusing.

** What about when Harry suffers some form of magical accident or curse or treatment and is turned into a girl? That is fem!harry

*** Yeah, for this reason I'd like to take a page out of Teen Wolf tagging, they seem to be going with 'Always a Female INSERT NAME' and 'Temporarily Female INSERT NAME'.

I guess it's kind of long but definitely descriptive.

** This is a common trope across fandoms, though - search AO3 for "Female (Male Character's Name)" and you'll probably find some. In reality, sure, James and Lily's daughter wouldn't be exactly the same person as Harry, but it's fiction, and it's fun to play what-if while maintaining the character's fundamental personality and role in the story.

** There are lots of male Harrys out there that are completely different from canon Harry, to the point that you could call them a different character as well. Making Harry a girl doesn't seem like such a big stretch. Also, fem Harry contains both girls who are basically OCs and those who have general life story and personality very close to canon Harry.
