Harry's childhood resulted in him being a lonely teenager obsessed with science. After meeting Hagrid Harry is confince that magic is just an elaborate trick and won't rest unto he solves the magic tricks using logic and science.


** Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is a fic that fits this decently. I've come across some other fics that more or less fit this too though I can't recall their names right now.

**** Harry actually didn't believe in magic until he met Hagrid according to Rowling. It's the canon reason why he didn't become an Obscurial.

****** I wasn't saying that a fanfiction can't do whatever it wants, I was sharing a piece of information that I found interesting. If it's written well, I'll be the first to read a fic where Harry and Hagrid get in a two hour long argument over the existence of magic.
