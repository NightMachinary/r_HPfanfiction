:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So some time (years) ago I read a fic in which during the Final Battle at Hogwarts, Death comes for Voldemort. I can't really remember if it was with a 'romantic' stalker vibe or just a more general creepy vibe, but Death and Voldemort definitely knew each other, and Death definitely wanted something to do with Voldemort. Voldemort, of course, was reluctant.

I'm pretty sure it was a oneshot on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]], but for the life of me I can't remember enough to find it. (Which sucks, because for some reason my brain is insisting on finding and reading This One Fic from way back when I was still trying to figure out the whole 'fic' thing.)

Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance! (And sorry if this isn't enough to go on!)
