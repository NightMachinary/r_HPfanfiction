Ron is one of my favorite characters, but I'm not sure if Hermione is the right person for him and here's why.

Ron was a bit of an underachiever who wanted to be recognized for his skills instead of being overshadowed. With him being with Hermione, it's pretty much guaranteed that he will be overshadowed all his life and this doesn't seem to be something he wanted. Hermione seems like the dominant kind of woman who needed someone supportive. I don't think Ron is the one suited for this role.

I think Rowling mentioned somewhere than Ron and Hermione might need couples counceling. Perhaps this is the reason?

Edit: I think Hermione might have been better off with Harry. Despite sometimes assuming the leadership role, Harry is not very dominant and often seems like the supportive type. I don't think Harry would have a problem with being overshadowed. Ron should have have probably ended up with a girl who is more on the submissive/supportive side too.


** I don't really like Ron and Hermione as a couple based off the Canon epilogue, but I do see Ron basically helping his mother pick up the pieces after Fred died. I think that's one reason he goes into business with George. I think that Ron eventually accepts a role that's more family based than fame based. That's really the only way I can see them working out- Hermione as the go getter in Magical Law Enforcement and Ron as the family man who's always there for his mother and brother.

I think that Ron has to do a lot of growing to get to that point, but I think that the last book is that turning point. Ron sees the true pain and suffering born of fame, and part of me thinks that he realizes that it's not about seeking external validation but in valuing himself.

Honestly, Ron is a big sidekick. He doesn't really come up with many ideas on his own, but he is fiercely loyal and will follow someone he cares about to the ends of the earth.

I think that a lot of people feel they need to bash Ron and treat him like a dumb frat boy, when really, he's more complicated than that.

  Ron was a bit of an underachiever who wanted to be recognized for his skills instead of being overshadowed.
#+end_quote

For most of the series, this holds true. But Ron has arguably the greatest character moment of any character in the series in DH.

#+begin_quote
  /"Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter . . . Least loved, now, by the girl who prefers your friend . . . Second best, always, eternally overshadowed . . ."/
#+end_quote

Lord Voldemort twists facts to serve his purpose, and as with the greatest of lies, they always have a hint of truth in them.

#+begin_quote
  /"Who could look at you, who would ever look at you, beside Harry Potter? What have you ever done, compared with the Chosen One? What are you, compared with the Boy Who Lived?"/
#+end_quote

Ron's insecurities were born out of him being unsure of having a place in the world, a place along side his more superficially talented friends. Those insecurities got the better of Ron in a moment of weakness; later Ron faces those insecurities and comes out on top. It is very, very significant that Ron literally takes the sword to the horcrux and stabs through it, the horcrux which is a physical manifestation of all of Ron Weasley's greatest fears.

#+begin_quote
  "After you left," he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron's face was hidden, "she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn't want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other. With you gone..."
#+end_quote

After Ron destroys the horcrux, Harry tells Ron that both he and Hermione were miserable without him. It isn't the most glamorous acknowledgement or reassurance, but it is validation of Ron's place in the world, and it fits him perfectly.

#+begin_quote
  "Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it's supposed to be you."

  He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that the doe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. *Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts.*
#+end_quote

Incalculable power, indeed. It is one of the most important themes of the books, that the perfectly ordinary can turn out to be much more. Lily Potter's perfectly ordinary love overcomes all the skill and power of Lord Voldemort. More than Harry, Ron is the character who exemplifies this quality. Ron doesn't have extraordinary talent or skill or ambition or dedication, he doesn't have Lily's blood protection or a prophecy or a super-significant wand. Yet he is very much an integral part of the trio; he is the heart to Hermione's brain and Harry's hands. His character arc isn't about beating a Dark Lord, isn't about changing society; it is about making mistakes, growing up and facing his fears.

Ron Weasley might be completely ordinary, but perhaps that makes him the most extraordinary of them all.

(But, before I went on a tangent, I think Ron has overcome his fear of being overshadowed. I am not strongly pro- or anti- Ron/Hermione. I do find Hermione more enjoyable with Ron than anyone else, but that is due to me finding Ron more enjoyable than anyone else. I just don't think 'fear of being overshadowed' fits post-DH Ron as a character.)

That 'ship' didn't have any canon foundation other than Ginny's hopeless crush on the BWL for 5 books. It's only with the raging monster in Harry's chest that the ship had basis. And that was one of the worst moments of the series, not because of the ensuing relationship, because of how out of the blue it was. Harry had shown no inclination that he even noticed Ginny as a girl until that point. He didn't even THINK of her as a date for the Yule Ball.

I don't mind H/G, but JKR introduced the pairing in a terrible manner. It was one of the reasons I felt HBP was the weakest of the 7 books.

He was 14, she was 13. That's... not pedophilia if a 14 year old boy is attracted to a 13 year old girl. It's what's considered normal. Neville, at least, saw her as dating potential during that time. Harry barely thought of her for 5 books, let alone when thinking about girls to ask for the Yule Ball. Not even a twinge of jealousy when he saw that Neville had asked her out.

** Absolutely. I am certainly not the biggest Ron fan but I can sympathize with his situation. He would do much better with a more earthy and encouraging woman. Him falling for a woman that constantly frustrates him seems to me like it is pathological: punishing himself by, trying to prove to the world that he could handle someone like her.

Ron would be much happier with someone who strives for a simple life, not Hermione who would constantly seek out new challenges. It's not like she would suddenly drop that attitude after her education.

** I don't really have a problem with R/Hr anymore, but I think for a while I did because the terribleness of HBP and DH tarred it by association in my mind. As is, I firmly hold that JKR is a godawful romance writer, and she'd honestly write better if she didn't try to push canonical ships for her stories.

19 years later... why is everyone still hooked up with their first crushes? No, really, is Wizarding Europe so small and incestuous that everyone married a character already present in the series? Anyway, the increasingly poor writing quality, culminating in the 'smiles and rainbows but things are still terrible' epilogue, tends to rub off on the canon ships, which I think can be a strong factor in disliking them.

**** Eh, iirc, the thing with Luna was from a web interview with Rowling, so it's value is... questionable at best. If she didn't publish it, why should it carry any more weight than someone's fanfic of the same? If she told us that Harry and Hermione cheated with one another after the epilogue, would that then be canon? She wouldn't (probably - anything for money, after all), but still, I think Death of the Author applies, particularly to the constant stream of pronouncements JKR has made in interviews and other places. Pronouncements that are, quite often, not at all supported by what she actually wrote, because I suspect that she rarely, if ever, re-reads her own work.

Honestly, her last two books are her writing style, just exaggerated. Her style worked better for short, episodic pieces full of whimsy, but by the time OotP came out, she was trying for a coherent canon that stretched between doorstopper-sized books. Add to that the fact that Rowling wasn't exactly Shakespeare at the best of times, and you end up with these weird, padded, often contradictory tomes. Not that HP was ever very consistent in its plot points, but that didn't matter as much earlier on, because they weren't trying to be Young Adult fiction at the time.

TL;DR "yes, I may have soured on canon a little, why do you ask?"

** It's a plausible read of the pair. One way I've seen it brought up and addressed in fanfic is to have each of them succeeding in different spheres. Hermione pursues political office or research or something, while Ron starts taking on a leadership role at WWW, diversifies the business, and becomes a successful entrepreneur. The potential for synergy is there too, with Ron finding satisfaction in funding Hermione's work and getting to enjoy the security and largess he never had as a kid.

The sad thing is: He's not willing (or able?) to put in the work to show the world that there's more to him than just an oaf (sorry, but I don't like him much) who's friends with the boy-who-lifed and who can shovel food into his mouth faster than most other people!...as far as I remember he always feels like he's the runt of the litter (Charly was quidditch-captain, Bill was head-boy, Percy is a prefect, the twins have their pranks to boast about and Ginny is a girl and Molly's darling (in a way I pity Ron as he was nothing special in a family that while poor produced some outstanding people!)), so I agree that he'd need a supportive girlfriend/wife (not someone who'd belittle him or just tell him to “grow a pair” when he's feeling down because of his own insecurities or who'd fight with him over every little thing!) with a similar background as him (that's another thing why I think they aren't compatible: Their backgrounds and believes -- Ron thinks it's ok to use magic to get a driving license, he also doesn't have a problem with “slavery” (as Hermione puts it) of houselfs, while Hermione hates it and sometimes even seems to think that wizards are kind of backwards and barbaric (and IMHO she's not wrong -- except maybe the houselfs...they like serving and a whole race having Stockholm-Syndrome? I don't think so!))

There's more reasons, but I'll leave it at that and I agree that Harry and Hermione might make a better pair (if he wises up a little so that he doesn't become whipped as I agree that Hermione is quite dominant/independent and I think she needs a similar partner, one that can stand up to her and will not be lead around by her like a puppy on a leash!)... ows (he's not stupid, just LAZY!) that he'll never be quidditch-captain or head-boy as long as his friends outshine him (I mean come on he only became a prefect because Dumbledore being Dumbledore didn't want to "burden" Harry with the role and because the other male Gryffindors aren't in the picture that much - neither academically, nor in sports and neither did they play a part in Harry's adventures (even if he only played a minor role in most of Harry's adventures...except for that chess-game in first year!))

Then there's the fact that he and Hermione (who he even mocks for being academically inclined in first year which nearly leads to her being injured or killed by the damned troll!) constantly fight and his believes are completely different from her's (she sees the wizard world as backwards and even barbaric (slavery!), while it's ok for him as he grew up knowing about houselfs!)

That would also reduce the friction between them -- Hermione won't be upset at Ron for not meeting her standards when her standards don't apply to his work.

That's if Ron reasonably wants to feel like he can contribute to conversations about his core skillset. If he specifically wants to be superior to his spouse at their core skillset, well, that's pretty pathetic, and he's probably better off not marrying.

**** Sounds like you're basing your opinion off of a Ron during Hogwarts, that had plenty of growing up to do. Which comes off as unfair.

***** While I agree that it's not representative of how Ron would be later in life, it's also the only information we have to go on. Most characters will be completely different after a decade of being out of school and the end of a brutal civil war that involves child soldiers, but there's no newer information (other than the epilogue, which is sparse, and Pottermore/interviews, which not everyone considers canon) that we as readers or fanfiction writers can use to update them.

That's not to say that OP is right, just that the counterargument "people will grow over time and won't necessarily be the same in a decade, and we don't know a lot of specifics about how they'll change" is a fully general argument that could apply to almost any pairing set around the epilogue time.

** I'm also sceptical about Ron/Hermione pairing but for a slightly different reason. Ron, as a pureblood living in quite a traditional household, seems to have quite an isolated view of marriage. With a stay-at-home mum and a late working dad, I get the feeling that Ron has only experienced this very old-fashioned family structure. On the other hand, Hermione appears to personify the "independent" post-modern woman that defies traditional gender roles. I anticipate misunderstandings and friction from this pairing concerning their future

**** I'm not saying that they are a horrible pairing and should never be together, just that i expect their completely different backgrounds to cause some kind of misunderstandings. Even Rowling says that they would probably need some sort of counselling for everything to work out.
