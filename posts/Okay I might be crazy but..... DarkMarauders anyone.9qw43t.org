Okay, so I have been thinking about this idea for a while, but does anyone know of a fanfic where all of the marauders are dark and/or work for Voldemort? I have seen ones where James was secretly dark and ones where Sirius and Remus turn dark to protect Harry, but never any where the marauders are all dark. So anyone got anything? Boi is points if there is manipulative!dumbles hiding the truth from Harry and then he finds out or if Lily is also dark. Double bonus points if both of the above apply.


** There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder][Dark Marauder]]; where James survives Halloween, teams up with Sirius, Remus and forces Peter to take unbreakable vow to destroy all surviving Death Eaters.

What I've read was quite good. And did justice to Hagrid's premonitions.

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.

** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/there-is-nothing-to-fear-harry-potter-au-gryffindor-voldemort.667057/][There is nothing to fear]] features a Gryffindor Tom Riddle, who had a very different goal, different leadership style, different set of followers, but used very similar means. Marauders still formed and all became Death Eaters. Another prominent Death Eater was Flitwick.

** Atsurekino Kurome has some stories with a dark Sirius and Remus. I can't remember the titles, but there was once a series of one shots where James, Peter, Sirius, Lily, and Remus all worked for the Dark Lord but not out of any sort of pureblood ideology and looked down on others who were blood purists---they were just survivors and rather amoral and liked to use dark magic.
