I came across this story a few days ago, about Lavender's name being entered for the Triwizard Tournament, and I thought I'd give it a go to see how good it was. I imagined that it would just be a kind of joke fic about what would hypothetically happen if Lavender had to compete.

However, to my pleasant surprise, I found that it was a well written, remarkably well thought out (at least so far) story which kept me genuinely interested the whole time while I was reading it. It's currently only at 50k words, but it appears to be updating on Sundays, and I'm hoping there's an update tomorrow.

Anyway, I think this story deserves a lot more attention than it's currently getting, so please go check it out!

  No good deed goes unpunished. How does a fleeting act of compassion cause Lavender Brown's name to be drawn from the Goblet of Fire? And will she survive her unwanted journey into the world of warrior witches? Read on to find out. LavenderxRon Rated M for profanity in future chapters. Chapter Nine: What do you mean Potter doesn't trust me? Draco, probably.

  When Lavender Brown's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire as the fourth champion, no one quite knows what to make of it. Except for Harry, who firmly believes that it should have been his name coming out of the Goblet and thus vows to help her get through the tournament alive...at all costs. -- Cover Image credit to jenimal on Deviantart.
