So, I'm in the process of writing my first fic, but I've just got one problem: words per chapter. I found a post in this sub where people preffered to have at least 3.2k words for each chapter. I have also found myself enjoying fics where there are atleast 5k word per fic. However, when I try to write, the chapters seem cramped, or unnatural. Any advise on how to overcome this?


** I would caution you on trying to stretch out a chapter. Like you say, it often doesn't work well. There are some professional writers who write long chapters and some that write short ones. As long as the chapter covers what you feel it needs to cover, then it doesn't really matter how long it is.

Sometimes it'll make sense to combine two chapters if they're thematically close, but definitely don't feel beholden to a certain chapter length or try to overwork a chapter. Taking a step back from a chapter for a couple of days can help, too. You might come up with a new idea or a scene that would work great. Bottom line is making sure that the chapter serves the plot and moves it forward rather than being a bunch of filler because J Random Reviewer complained that the last one was only 1500 words.

All of that above is true. But I particularly want to talk about why word length can be an issue. Please note that I have no idea if I am right or guano loco.

1. Sometimes, it makes everything feel very rushed. Though, I often find this to be a case where there is basically all dialogue and no narrative. As long as the reader doesn't feel like things are moving far, far too fast, you're probably good. Pacing/flow should be prioritized over word count.

2. I think this is probably the big one. Fanfictions are updated serially, not all at once. This means that a short chapter doesn't give us much to dig into to, especially after what can be very long waits between chapters. If you find that shorter chapters are your thing, maybe thing about writing far ahead before publishing, so you can keep a frequent-ish update rate?

**** I agree with both of those points, especially the one about the serial nature of fanfic. I've definitely been disappointed when a story I've been waiting on updates with a short chapter. I'm there at the table with my napkin tied around my neck and all I'm served is an appetizer. Sad face. But sometimes that's what happens.

All things taken into account, I think I'd rather have a shorter, higher-quality chapter than a longer, aimless one. One thing that didn't occur to me earlier is if the chapters are that short, perhaps the story is better-suited to a one-shot? There can still be dividing sections, and perhaps OP won't feel so obligated to achieve a certain chapter length and can focus on storytelling.

** What I like to do is make a outline of every chapter. I'll come up with a name for the chapter (Some people just use numbers and others titles) and then I'll put the ideas/situations/things that need to happen in this chapter in bullet points in chronological order so like this:

Chapter 1 The Phoenix's Rise

-Main Char meets Dumbledore, job interview. Shares memories

-Memories (Under this bullet point I'd have a brief description of each memory I want to go through in order)

-Meets the staff, and goes through the castle to her classroom

-Begins drawing up lesson plans

-teaches her first class (More bullet points on what you're going to teach, class interaction etc)

You get the point, That way you know what need to be in the chapter specifically. It's easier if you have an outline or at least an idea of how your fic is going to end, and how you're going to get there. The less canon-like it is the longer it'll take to get there, if you want to make it realistic/plausible etc. Then you'll know what steps it'll take to get there and each chapter will kind of form itself of what will need to happen in that chapter to advance to the next step. I like to think of it as working towards the end in the most plausible/realistic way.

*** That's a good idea. I never used to do this until I started using an app called Scrivener. It has a sidebar for a synopsis and notes and I find it very handy for jotting down my action goals for the chapter and other little things as they occur to me. It also has a place where you can put research. I'm working on a story where Ginny helps the ghost of a British Revolutionary War soldier and I've got different images of redcoat soldiers, modern and war-era maps of Boston and tons of links to webpages about haunted spots, history and all sorts of stuff. I used to just have a million tabs open in my browser, but now I don't have to. It's very powerful and I'm only scratching the surface of what it can do.

** If you feel comfortable, I'm happy to take a look at your writing so far and see where the issues are? It may be a number of things like flow, lack of description, pacing and planning, not taking the time to build characters, etc.

** I dunno, my rule of thumb is 1k+ per chapter
