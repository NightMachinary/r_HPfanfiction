:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
All I remember of this fic is this scene where Ron bitches at Harry in the Gryffindor common room and points out something about how Harry is a fucked up freak who doesn't like to be hugged (or something to that effect) and Harry gets angry and kicks him in the ribs while yelling about how he "was abused, you bastard!" and locked in a cupboard. The twins pull Harry off Ron right about then. I'm fairly sure it was a tournament-era fic, but I could be wrong on that. McGonagall gets on him later for it and punishes him despite her mild sympathy.

Edit: Found it. It's chapter 13 of Son of Potter, Daughter of Black. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11653847/13/Son-of-Potter-Daughter-of-Black]]

"I know who you are. You're a boy who cries out at night for his mummy. A boy who hates small spaces and..." is the line that kicks off the, um, kicking.

*** Probably not, but it'll irritate me until I can find the title. My brain is kind of a bitch for that sort of thing.

I don't really remember if it's a bash fic though. I suspect it is, but I don't know for certain.
