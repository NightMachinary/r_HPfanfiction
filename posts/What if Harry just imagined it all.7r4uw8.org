What if Harry Potter wasn't a wizard at all and magic never was real? Harry was just a lonely kid who one day snapped and created a whole fantasy world from his little room under the stairs? Hermione and Ron and Neville and all the other kids were just kids who lived on his street or people that went to the same school as him who he never even knew.

Ron Weasley is a boy from the poor family in the neighborhood whom social services drops in on from to time. Hermione is the perfect straight-A student at school with no friends. Neville is a kid in a wheelchair because he was pushed out a window by his abusive grandmother when he was a baby...

What if the whole time Harry was running trough the brick wall at platform nine and three quarters he was really just knocking himself unconscious and dreaming about Hogwarts? He thinks he's the “boy who lived” because his parents died in a car crash when he was a year old, or maybe the car crash was never real and the Dursleys are his real parents but Harry couldn't cope with that because of the way his family treat him?

** How about this for a mindfucky story.

After having his first Voldemort-vision, Harry wakes up in a mental institution with the orderlies restraining him and the doctor telling him he's had a relapse. Harry starts screaming about having to save Mr. Weasley, and the doctor explains with practiced patience that Voldemort isn't real, that Harry is sick, and that Mr. Wesley the janitor is perfectly fine and Harry can see him tomorrow if he calms down and takes his meds. The institution's other patients are eerily similar to Hogwarts students, and one of the orderlies looks like Vernon Dursley. Harry pretends to go along with the doctor's orders then ends up escaping through an open window.

He wakes up in the Hospital Wing, where Pomfrey tells him he'd been in a coma for two weeks following a mental attack from Voldemort. Ministry plot happens, Harry and his friends get attacked by Death Eaters.

Harry wakes up in the institution again, he's all bandaged up and the doctor tells him he injured himself in his escape attempt and the fall knocked him out. Harry yells about having to help Sirius, but the doctor just shakes his head sadly and says they're going to keep him locked up and restrained until he gets better.

The story would alternate between the two worlds, and the reader wouldn't know which one's real until the end (and perhaps not even then). Not an original plot, but it could be fun.

*** You're right this would be a great story but I'm so Disney-fied I'd only like it with a happy ending.

Star Trek Voyager sorta did this with the Doctor saying he was a real person trapped in a holodeck program.

Buffy the Vampire Slayer did this with Buffy being told she was in an institution for burning down her high school gym.

Can you think of any others who did this kind of story?

  Harry Potter may not be The Boy Who Lived, but the world isn't going to save itself, and it sure as hell could use all the help it needs, especially if Voldemort gets his hands on an ancient weapon from the Department of Mysteries that would guarantee his victory if he is allowed to return. Only this time, Harry may need help of his own - from some rather unorthodox allies.

** I remember before the Deathly Hallows was released, online communities were going haywire into deducting how the series would end. There were a number of people who fantasized that Harry was dreaming up the whole thing and that the magical community and its ilk didn't exist. Of course, those theories drew angry responses but those were some good times.

I mused on the possibility of Harry the not-wizard writing stories about himself as a wizard, with the various stereotypical characters and creatures (Hermione is smart and does homework, dementors are depressing) to represent his own feelings and what-to-dos.
