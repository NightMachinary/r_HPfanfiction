I do not know why but it bothers me when people complain about characters not being pretty much exactly like they are in the books. Maybe its just me not liking the books as much as fanfics but I like it when characters act differently well not too different .

****** e e cummings was an accomplished poet and knew exactly what he was doing. Most fans who mess up punctuation wouldn't know great poetry if it bit them on the nose. They simply can't be bothered to punctuate properly or check their grammar. So yeah, for the most part, lack of punctuation is a sign of sloppy, indifferent writing.

** the thing is. if the characters are only Harry/Hermione/Draco in name. i'd just read another book. you know?

if you're gonna write Hermione fall for Draco, it doesn't have to make sense. it just has to "feel" right. most of the time it doesn't. most of the time it doesn't feel right for Fleur to suddenly have the hots for Harry. most of the time it doesn't feel right for Harry to just outright murder Petunia without remorse. most of the time it doesn't feel right for Snape to suddenly become Harry's father figure.

i mean the point of fanfiction is either something that the characters should've done. or something the characters you hope to do. if you're gonna make them do something they will never do in the books, you have to sell it to me, okay?

*** I actually completely agree! The right "different" background for a character... the right lead up... it makes some of those relationships and changes understandable. Without a character's history being interestingly altered, a lot of times authors fail to make certain things believable.

I suppose this fails into my love of "change one thing and see how everything else changes" though. If this one character had less empathy, what would be different? And so on.

**** This is exactly what my problem is with a lot of fanfiction. There is not a believable argument for why a character does something. People write a suddenly "X" character without a real reason behind it. If I am told that for no particular reason Harry is in a harem I'm generally skeptical about how well it would work. I'm not hating on polygamous relationships, but generally there is a mind set going in. Few authors ever write about the interaction between the sister wives and how they got into evening. This is why does build stories tend to be my favorite. Rorschach's Blot is a decent example of an author who writes characterization which is built quickly enough to keep the story going, but slow enough that one don't have to take for granted that something is just true. Now admittedly he stories are borderline crack fics for the most part, but that doesn't mean people can't take a page out of his book.

Not that those stories are bad I just like it when different interpretations. (Or versions I honestly don't know which word would fit.) Are explored forcing the characters to stay as they are in canon feels like the exact opposite purpose for fan fiction.
