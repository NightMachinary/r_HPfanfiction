:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Been trying to find this fic for a long time now. It takes place during 6th year, Harry burns all of his belongings in the Great Hall, there's a guy named Forge who watches the mortal world through a well, and there's a secret Dark Lord named Maul.

Can't remember much else. It was posted to fanfiction. net, not sure if anywhere else
