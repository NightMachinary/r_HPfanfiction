  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

**** Huh.

What do you call to one where the main is Female/Female?

What do you call to one where not the main relation, but a relation of imprtance is male/male // Female/female?

Is it still a slash if the relation is canon? I.E. if I write a fic about...(Holy crap, I cannot for the life of me remember a book or a TV show or anything with a gay couple, how weird is that. Just pretend I wrote on here, okay?) is it a slash?

***** Femslash.

In general if the relationship is depicted graphically then it would be slash or femslash else it would be het (hetrosexual) if the main relationship is male/female or gen if there is no main relationship.

Yes.

  When Rose resurrects her brother, she pushes the world to the brink of another war. Meanwhile Albus, cold and brilliant, may just be the second coming of Tom Riddle. Forced to work together to unravel their parents' suspicious deaths, they must solve the past if they want to survive the future. And answer the question: Just why does history keep repeating itself?

** I am currently reading the linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation) series, and it's really very good. Original, and the author has planned out the whole series so there are things in the first book that impact all the rest. It has great original characters, too. The first book is a bit slow but they get comparatively better. The author is on the seventh and final book and will be finished it this summer so there's a ton to read.

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.

** linkffn(The Good Son by Nightmare Prince) linkffn(Call Me Home by Nightmare Prince) linkffn(The Ghost Prince by Nightmare Prince)

The first two stories in the series are completed, and the third is a WIP. None of the main pairings are slash. I think Louis Weasley might be gay, but I may be confusing this series with another of Nightmare Prince's stories.
