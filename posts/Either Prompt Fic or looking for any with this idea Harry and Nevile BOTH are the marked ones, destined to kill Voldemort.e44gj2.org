Harry's mark is of couse his scar, while Neville's mark is more emotional with his mark of his parents being insane. Doesn't have to be Neville's marked because of his parents being insane, but just something.

While the canon books had Harry kill Voldemort and Neville kill the snake, I thought it'd be fitting if both of them were able to kill Voldemort.

Doesn't have to be exactly it, just as long as it's Harry and Neville taking down Voldemort together somehow.

Are there any stories with this kind of idea? If not, would anyone be willing to write one?


** It isn't clear cut as this, because they aren't exactly marked, but both are 'The Ones' to be destined to defeat him in someway, in linkffn(The Life he Leads; The Art of Self-fashioning)

Both AU with BWL Neville.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

This is a story about something completely different, but toward the end this comes up as an easter egg.
