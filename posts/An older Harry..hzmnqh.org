Any fic were Harry is just ass old ass Cedric or Fred and Gorge. It could just be him or Draco or any other, but those that I have come across just have Draco older. It could be like a brother of the boy who lived or something else don't really care.

No harmione or hinny.


** linkffn(Three Black Birds by Excited-Insomniac) has him a year younger, I believe, but he's friends with all three that you mentioned.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.

  Only two people know what happened the night John Potter became the Boy-Who-Lived: Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter. And neither of them are talking.
