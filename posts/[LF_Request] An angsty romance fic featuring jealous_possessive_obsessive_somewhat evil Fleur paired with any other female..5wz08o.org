** Fleur becomes evil at the end of linkffn(the silent world of Cassandra Evans) and seduces Tonks afterwards. Not a high quality fic but interesting.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.
