...what are your thoughts on:

**** 1) it being only Merlin who goes to Hogwarts (while waiting for Arthur to come back, not being able to die, whatever) - meaning it's not strictly Merlin cast going to Hogwarts AU

     :END:
**** 2) Merlin being a "transfer" student, being sorted into eg. third year (while HP is in his first - or just starting the fic from later point, don't know yet)

     :END:
**** 3) limited interactions with the Golden Trio at first (I thought about erasing HP existence but they can just be doing their things, mostly as in canon, with divergence from Horcrux hunting or something)

**** 4) Cedric not being the Hogwarts champion in the Tournament.

**** Are there any clichés connected to this kind of crossovers, things you'd like to see, things that put you off?
