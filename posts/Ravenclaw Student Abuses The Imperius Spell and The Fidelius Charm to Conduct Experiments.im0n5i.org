Do they need to hear an audible command in order to heed what I am commanding them? Let's try this from the far end of the hallway!

If I Imperio him, can I order him to Imperio me to follow a command that I told him to command me before erasing my memory of the procedure, and then tell him to inform me of the result? Would that work? Could I commit a crime via this roundabout method?

What would happen if Misters Potter, Black, Lupin, and Pettigrew all dosed the remaining three members of their clique with a single drop of Amortentia mixed into their beverage?

Could I use and maintain the Imperius spell on the Merfolk or a Centaur?

"Raul Gibson is neither a student of Ravenclaw House named ___ ___, nor is he an inconspicuous Hogwarts staff member, nor is he a first-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, fifth-year, sixth-year, or seventh-year student of Ravenclaw House, Gryffindor House, Hufflepuff House, or Slytherin House." Now, theoretically, I should be able to traipse around just about anywhere with my fake persona. ...Right?
