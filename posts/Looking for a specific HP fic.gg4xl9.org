I can not for the life of me remember what this fic is called or whether it's on AO3 or FFN. But it starts with a little girl who basically tells Dudley that he is the freak for the way his family treats Harry. I think Petunia writes to Snape. Also, Vernon, in a fit of rage, shoots Petunia and the boys who had a go bag ready run to Snape. Also, Dumbledore blocked Dudley's magic, and they hide out on a dragon preserve.

It's a good fic despite it's incomplete status and I would dearly love to read it again, so any help would be fantastic.

Thank you!
