These objects could be the cloth life size ragdolls used in plays with some glamour charms on it


** "Glamour Charms" aren't canon and anyway, what you describe sounds more like permanent enchantments /Ã  la/ Portraits or Sorting Hat than "glamour" spells. I mean, it's not just a change in /appearance/ you're suggesting, but creating an artificial mind and granting it to an object as well as the ability to express itself.

All this being said, /this is an amazing idea/. "Magical AIs" like the Sorting Hat, Portraits and Goblet of Fire are almost never used in fanfiction --- even the canon ones are used sparingly and I do not recall any example of a story that actually /created/ one. The closest I can think of is Harry accidentally creating "living potions" (with simple, animal minds) in linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) but that's obviously rather different.

Point is, I second this request wholeheartedly! I'd write it, but I'm already behind on my ongoing stories, so not for now, sorry.

**** Well, I don't care about tweaks to the magic system in a story /per se/, I just felt like OP's off-handed mention of Glamours may have been driven by the general misconception that it's canon (like with Wards and Runes) as opposed to an actual /decision/ to add something new.

***** It's fanfiction. Most requests here talk about things that aren't canon.

Sorry, it's just a pet peeve of mine.

****** May I reiterate that it's not people asking for non-canon things /as such/ that annoys be, but the misconception that some of these non-canon things are canon. I suppose it's my own pet peeve. Of which we have a few aroundhere. [[/r/HPPetPeeves]]

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

If this doesn't have a single Emperor's New Groove reference in it, I will be supremely unhappy.

As a matter of fact, the Author's Note for that chapter do point to the last scenes of the movie as both a source of inspiration, and something to picture in the back of your mind when reading the scenes. All this being said, there's no /in-story/ reference to the movie (as it would, after all, be anachronistic).
