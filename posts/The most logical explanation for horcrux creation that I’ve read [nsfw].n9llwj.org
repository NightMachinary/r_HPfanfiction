It's disturbing, but it's realistic and makes sense. I found a quora email in my spam folder while I was bored at work. I'll summarize it for you, but [[https://qr.ae/pGnuWq][the original]] has photos uploaded to explain their point.

The author begins by providing textual evidence from GoF to prove that cannibalism (a popular fan theory & something I've seen a lot in fics) is unlikely. All of the Riddle bodies appeared to be in good health, besides ya know being dead and all. This idea is supported by the fact that we have an “on screen” canniblistic character - Fenrir Greyback- and yet Rowling said she didn't feel comfortable revealing how horcurxes were made.

The answer: sex.

The most spice Rowling has in the Harry Potter series is Cho's wet snog and Harry's awakening inner goddess in HBP. Which makes sense because it isn't supposed to be geared towards an older audience. And sex with murder is a super dark theme even for older audiences.

Now, the author doesn't think Voldemort when full on necrophilia, because they believe Voldemort thought he wasn't human and therefore was too good for sex, but,

#+begin_quote
  I believe the process of creating a Horcrux requires the caster to /revel/ in the memory of the murder. To take maximum pleasure in the commission of it. And we can see what that looks like in many real world serial killers' behavior after a murder. Many of them use the memory of their murders to fuel their masturbation.
#+end_quote

In short, their theory is that when Voldemort made horcruxes, at least in the beginning, his climax and /ejaculation/ to the thought of the murder is what triggered the ripped piece of his soul from tearing off and storing itself in a container.

The author expands on this theory, stating that he did it ASAP Rocky and prepared the items beforehand.

They also explain the criticisms they've had: that women don't ejaculate quite like men do, so they wouldn't be able to make horcruxes and that Voldemort didn't have a corporeal body for Nagini, but they argue that /”just as a woman would need to find a different way of creating a horcrux, that Voldemort, in his stunted interim form, may have been able to innovate a novel way of achieving the sadistic ecstacy required”/.

I really like the idea. Well maybe not really like because it's super fucked up, but I think it makes a lot of sense. And as soon as the post mentioned sex my stomach dropped because oh man what the fuck that's awful, but that's kind of the point of a horcrux. It's supposed to be the darkest magic.

Anyway, I'd really like to discuss this and hear your thoughts on it.

** A very interesting take on it. Especially the "reveling" part since I think it makes a lot of sense.

I think that different people might have to take a different approach but that masturbation/sex in relation to the murder as the ultimate act of creating a horcrux is maybe the go-to way to do it. Personally I don't feel like you would have to ejaculate onto the chosen object but that the act itself would be enough (but only a part of the whole ritual)

Thus I disagree with the notion that women wouldn't be able to make a horcrux through masturbation.

I like the idea of sex/masturbation in creating a horcrux as it reminds me of the things people accused "witches" of in the middle ages (Orgies, sex with the devil etc) but in that case it could also be a ritualistic part since perhaps asexual people wouldn't be able to revel in the kill through sex.

So if we consider the latter and Voldemort's creepy baby body, one could argue that only an act of /reveling/ would be needed in order to create a horcrux and that there would be different ways to achieve that sense of ecstasy apart from masturbation.

Although I believe that there would be some kind of incantation needed or at least I don't believe that reveling in the kill would be enough to create a horcrux. (There are a lot of sick ppl out there and thus there would be maybe more than one horcrux floating around) Perhaps though, /intention/ is that missing part.

Since intent often shows up in the HP universe and its spells. For example intent is closely tied to the unforgivables which are one of the darkest magics we know of

Actually, asexual people can and often do masturbate. However, they don't feel the need for sex. For example, to non asexual people, sexual relief is like food, while to asexual people it's like a specific food that they don't really think much of, but they are physically capable of eating. It's not that asexual people aren't capable of arousal.

**** I know that asexuality doesn't equal a lack of experiencing arousal or lack of masturbating.

I'm not an asexual person myself so I could be wrong but I've heard that some even find the idea of it repellent.

That aside I'm aware that it's a spectrum and something that's closely tied to the individual in how much they enjoy sex/sexual acts and how they feel about it.

That being said, in my "headcanon" it's not the masturbating itself but the ecstasy and the reveling in the murder that is the final puzzle piece. If someone for example would see the masturbating as a task could it be really enough to split one's soul (if it's not a ritualistic act)?

If we follow that train of thought, cannibalism could actually come back into the picture. While Voldemort hasn't followed that aspect to revel in the kill, someone else might have. For example if hypothetically a wizard with a mindset of Hannibal Lecter would want to make a horcrux, I think that the act of eating a body part of the victim would be more powerful than masturbating to the thought of the kill

** I mean he literally is a serial killer, so it sounds realistic. Probs going to try not to think of this ever again but it's certainly a valid theory and I find the idea that Old Maude actually thinks he's a god to be interesting.

PS// but also, bruh, I hate to break it to you and mess up your theory but...some women have dicks and sperm. That is a fact.

There is certainly a historical precedence of certain magic and spell craft tradition being gendered, and for certain rituals to be done differently by different practices and cultures. We know Voldie travelled a lot to collect information, and maybe he searched until he found a ritual where he could put his smog on something. but if you're ruling out an entire gender because you need to cum on an object, that ain't it. It's like that story that said only relationships that had a penis in them could soul bond, so sorry lesbians, your out. it's stupid as hell, lazy as shit, and/or just shows that someone doesn't want to think about vulvas if they aren't for masculine pleasure

I think there are certainly some women that are just that fucked up, and I'm sure they'd be able to figure out how to make a horcruxes happen that way if they set their mind to it. Magic is a crazy thing.

*** Me too, and I don't to read much about it (as I don't want to read about satanism IRL), but I prefer when the Dark Magic is really dark and disgusting. One of my pet-peeves is how everybody seems to romanticize Darkness to be less dark and Light to be less light in the style of typical teenagers/adolescents (yes, most authors and readers of fanfiction are exactly that; see my [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/review-of-escape-and-mr-and-mrs-percy-weasley.html][blogpost on moral inversion]]). See also [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/augurey-or-loosing-of-sanity.html][my comments on Augurey]]:

  Of course, the premise of the story is based on the idea that Tom Riddle could father a baby in the first place. Yes, I don't believe this story (and the Cursed Child, one of many disasters of that fanfiction story), that he would be capable of falling in love with anybody, and I have deep suspicion even about his ability to commit the deed. After all, he truly doesn't have the human body, what he has is the alchemist construct, created by two sexually rather inept most likely still virgins; I wonder whether his body truly has all bits in the right places. Much more appealing (or much disgusting, that's the same thing) would be if Delphini was either just by-product of some dark magic ritual (which would nicely lead to her being neglected and abandoned) or even intended object (produced by artificial insemination or its magical equivalent) of some ritual. What about the ultimate Horcrux created by sacrificing your own child? It would be an opportunity to create truly disgusting dark magic, which would eliminate all those jabbers about grey magic and acceptability of the Dark Magic.

**** Lol. Interesting post. Have you looked at moral inversion in the meta context of Star Wars 789? Anyway... I have similar views but I think it is self-defeating in a way if Dark magic is physically disgusting. Rather, I believe it should be emphasised both how /morally/ disgusting it is, and how /tempting/ it is to use it. The wrong path is always the easiest to take. So Dark magic should in a way be attractive; easy and fast to perform.

I think JKR did understand this principle. What makes the Unforgivables different is that they require malicious intent. What reverses a Horcrux is remorse, similarly characters view the ripping of a soul itself to be terrifyingly evil. JKR implies that what makes Horcrux magic so wrong is not just the murder, but the spiritual disfigurement that is made on the creator's soul. Representing the moral disfigurement, I believe. I like that theme.
