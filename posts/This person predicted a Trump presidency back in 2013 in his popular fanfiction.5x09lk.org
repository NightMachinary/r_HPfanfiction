It's in "Rise of the Wizards" by Teufel1987, chapter 44: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/44/Rise-of-the-Wizards]]

You can see the specific in-story reference towards the end of the chapter, and then what i take as confirmation from the writer in the A/N.

I'm re-reading this fic, and I completely missed this the first time through. With Trump actually being POTUS it took my completely by surprise!

No. No!

Not my, *me*! Say it!

Me! Me! Stop screwing it up! You're a disgrace!

** So . . . completely unrelated question here.

If I were to go and edit my 3 year old story to add in a couple of details about Trump being President and Brexit, do you think I'll get more traffic and reviews?

Keep in mind, this question is completely unrelated.

There is nothing going on here.

Nothing at all.

Not one thing.

Nada.

Nil.

Nippleclamps.

*** The story was last updated in 2014. There's no way he changed it without change in date. And lastly that chapter is even older considering the story have 51 chapters.

**** Chapters can be edited by the writer. All you have to do is change the document and use the Update Chapter button in the Story Properties. Although I'm pretty sure that isn't the case with the fic OP is talking about.
