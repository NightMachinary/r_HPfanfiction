  CRACK FIC. Everyone knows you don't eat stuff you find lying on the floor, especially in an alleyway in the street. Except for young Harry Potter, apparently. Those six shiny colourful hard candies did look delicious...

** ever heard of HPMoR?(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality)

It's great and damn intelligent but that doesn't exactly translate to talent...

*** HPMoR represents at least one of the things I most despise in a fanfic. It's over half a million words and covers first year. 11 YEAR OLDS ARE NOT THAT INTERESTING.

**** I don't think it's because the author thinks they're interesting, it may just be hard to keep the story short (or the lack of trying to shorten it)

But you do make a point that HPMoR failed in one spot. Making it interesting and it reads like a super intelligent 11 year olds diary
