  Do you want your little ones to read books; and they want to read the Harry Potter Books; but you do not want them to turn into witches? Well-this is the story for you! This story has all the adventure of JKR's books; but will not lead your children astray. For concerned mommies everywhere! Blessings! Grace Ann

** linkffn(10847788) - Been a while since I read it, but it focuses on Judaism, and it definitely has a lot of active religion in it. (As well as some conflict between magic and religion) There's some Hebrew in it, but not too much, and I think some of it is translated.

** I feel like linkffn(6780275), Muggledad's "The Last Casualties" has aspects of religion in it, although it got too long and convoluted for me to continue reading, so I have no idea if it keeps it up.

At one point, in the apocalyptic post-Voldemort-has-taken-over Britain, Harry is injured and Hermione's freaking out, wondering if he'll die or not, and ends up at a nearby Catholic church and is heavily involved in prayer and blessings. There is some issue of her being raised Catholic + witch from her parents' side, too.

** linkffn(1844462) has Catholicism and Hermione is the main character.

linkffn(8769990) and its WIP sequel also feature Catholicism as an important part of the plot.

Though my experience with reading fics that feature religion is limited, I have noticed that there are a lot where Hermione is Catholic for some reason.
