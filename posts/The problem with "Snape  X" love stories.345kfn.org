To those of you who can't stand seeing Snape love or be loved by anyone, and are tired of seeing the hundreds of thousands of fics, I have a theory...

When describing Snape, most authors writing those stories conveniently forget that Snape isn't the nicest person to be around, both physically and mentally.

Let's start physically, since it's easiest. Canon Snape has long, /greasy/, black hair, pale and pallid skin, a hooked nose and /yellowing teeth/, and since he's a potions master, he most likely smells of ammonia and potion ingredients. He is *not* Orlando Bloom with black hair, a longer nose and "coal black eyes"!

Personality wise Snape is a bully, plain and simple. He takes pleasure in belittling others, he's also rude and abrasive. Not someone you would want in a relationship.

All of these factors point towards an antisocial misanthrope who would rather drown himself in shampoo than "express his feelings". Besides, with Lily gone, what heart he had went with her.

Conclusion? Canon Snape is most likely incapable of falling in love with anyone ever again.

**** Short version:

- Alan Rickman's voice has the weirding way

- Snape's Dark & Mysterious with more depth than 99.9% of other characters in the books

- S&M vibe: teacher/authority+harshness=the special tickle

- Girls like jerks because they're confident; they like them more if the girls can fool themselves into thinking they can redeem them

- Evidence suggests that the redeeming thing has some traction, since he pines for lost love and had a bad early life

Favorite part of article: 'Under these circumstances, having Snape say lines like “I shall attempt to penetrate your mind and you shall attempt to resist me” is almost too much to deal with.'

Alan Rickman. The person they are thinking of is Alan Rickman, not Orlando Bloom.

**** All the grown-ups, except for Dumbledore, Moody, McGonagall, Flitwick and a few others are wrong, age wise. But still, I can't think of anyone better to play Lupin, Black or Snape.

*Edit*: Natalia Tena (Tonks) seems to be pretty close to the character

** I just want to point out, while I appreciate your opinion, we saw only very brief snippets of Snape. We saw him surrounded by students who were pretty much constantly in danger or causing trouble; there is the possibility there is more to his character than presented visibly in canon. I'm not claiming he would be a pleasant person, but I also think it is wrong to entirely damn him of any good qualities. The greatest affirmation of this is his friendship with Lily. Do you really think she would be close friends with someone entirely vile, even out of kindness?

Also, a note on his appearance, just because a person is not attractive to you does not mean they may not be to another. Many of these fanfictions are written in the perspective of the main character; therefore the person smitten may have a biased perspective of their beloved's appearance.

I like Snape as a character, however would like to point out that we know next to nothing about Lily. Only descriptions of her come from extremely biased sources. She and her then-boyfriend were popular in school. Which means nothing considering how frequently "popular" teens turn out to be not-so-nice people.

For all we know, Harry's parents could have been one vindictive asshole married to a vicious bitch, and not at all proper character references by association.

** No, he isn't nice or conventionally handsome but so what? A lot of his character flaws are not necessarily overlooked in romantic fics. He often warns his loved one that he is 'not a nice man,' and his bitterness comes through from time to time.

However, I believe that he has a tremendous capacity to love, if only he would allow someone back in. He opened himself up to love that one person who showed him kindness and was tremendously crushed by it in the end. I believe, as well as many authors believe that Snape could love again (hence the Snape & X fanfiction). He would be fiercely loyal and dedicated and possibly quite protective of his love interest. A relationship with Snape would not always go smoothly as he has a ton of emotional baggage, but I certainly don't think it's impossible.

The only character who is incapable of falling in love, canon speaking, is Tom Riddle/Voldemort himself and you see fics a plenty with him in different pairings. So why not Snape?

*** I dunno, perhaps. But the way he comes across in the books is hardly attractive in any way. I can imagine him giving more abuse than love to a person...

** The books are written from Harry's perspective. Because of that, Snape is being described through the lens of a little boy who doesn't like him, and that he's depicted in most of the series as all but a villain. I'm not saying that he's a secret hottie, but I don't think it's outside of the realm of possibility that someone might find him attractive.

** During a recent re-read I had an epiphany: Snape's description is best represented in the movies by [[http://www.hotflick.net/flicks/2005_Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire/tn640/fhd005PAG_Predrag_Bjelac_002.jpg][Igor Karkaroff]].

  There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze, stood Severus Snape. He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked nose and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he was smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep trouble. - Chamber of Secrets, Chapter 5 'the Whomping Willow'

** While i don't like fictions with snape as a main character i don't see why it couldn't be done. I mean character development is the basis for a good fiction ; the problem for his character is the starting point , as it has arleadly been said the books caracterization is hard to redeem so many authors skip the problem giving him the movie's one.

My only criticism is about the unlikelyness of it happening , i seriously despise when he's paried with hermione adn not for the reason you might think of _ i see it from his point of view as a fall back into his obsession , she's the smarter muggleborn of her generation sounds familiar? And even if she might be decent for him the vice-versa isn't . Ron is orders of magnitudde more pleasant than him. I see it as a "fail" in the char development , it is an "easy" (even if implausible) one so fan writers jump on it.

I guess a good romance written with snape as a protagonist would need a lot of mental contorsionism . I can't see him with any canon witch , the main reason i think is because there aren't a lot of canon characters of his age. ( i don't know about OC pairings but i normally just ignore them)

** A lot of stories dont get the fact that Snapes life since Lily died was helping to defeat Voldemort to make up for it, they just have him meet a new love, become nicer etc, completely missing the fact he WOULDNT change for Lily, so why would he change for someone else?

** I don't get why anyone would want to fall in love with snape. Not cause of what he looks like or his personality but because who wants to play second fiddle to lily evans. When you love someone you want be number one in their heart.
