It's been a while since I've read the books so I decided a reread was in order. I also read fanfic pretty regularly and I think there's something I'm missing about how Dumbledore is portrayed in fanfic versus how he is in canon. In canon, he's a war hero and a politician (who is on just the right side of shady for people to respect him) who runs a school (questionably so) and the choices he makes come back to haunt him and he reacts in the way he's found to be reliable and that aligns with his (dubious) moral code.

In fanfic, it seems like the only thing that's shown of him is his "everything has happened this way for the greater good" that happens towards the end of the series when his secrets and the choices he made come to light and are obviously not the best thing for everyone. But it seems like everyone who writes him in fanfic thinks that he's evil and would want to stick to how canon played out regardless of the changes made by the fanfic, more often than not having him throw a fit and rant about "the greater good."

If Harry had other family that were considered his blood, why wouldn't he go with them? If Albus found out about the abuse he endured at the Dursleys, why does everyone think Dumbledore would send him back repeatedly? If Voldemort was found to have Horcruxes before the series started or even if people just cottoned onto him being a raging hypocrite and he remained powerless, why would he set the events of canon in motion when he doesn't have to? And why would not playing out canon events or even the school staff figuring some stuff out and acting accordingly make him want to stop it? Did he seriously put so much stock in the prophecy that he was willing to obstruct other efforts to take down the actual villains that have been causing him grief? A lot of fanfic thinks so and I want to know why. Is it just a trope or does everyone think he'd be so crazy that he'd hate any effort to take Voldemort (or whoever) that wasn't his? Like seriously, what am I missing here?

*** Are you saying my mistake was to say that Dumbledore believed in the prophecy or other authors'? I'm wondering why people portray him as evil. I know all his traits from canon. Dumbledore doesn't even need to have all the information. He can and has made mistakes. I want to know why the fanfics I've come across are content to cast him as a major antagonist up there with Voldemort when he's the equivalent of a boarding school principal with more on his plate than he should technically have and fucking up a lot as a result. He's not actively malicious but a lot of fics paint him with that brush..

**** Well, my running theory is that people can't read.

** There is no point in only condemning him, nor in utterly excusing him.

So as for the first, it's entirely out-of-character for him to e.g. /force/ Harry to return to the Dursleys (instead, if Harry really didn't want to go -- a point which he never raises with Dumbledore, by the way --, he'd try to use incentives to convince him), but on the other hand, he /did/ dump baby Harry in a basket on the doorstep (that thing was old when Moses was young).

And like that, it's with most other issues. The /reason/ you see this often is actually why Dumbledore is a very well-written character; namely, the outcome of judging his actions is a matter of perspective, and many of the authors in question are of the age when Harry explodes in the office in OotP, and their FF is the equivalent of his rage -- a story about a male teen, by a male teen, using the perspective of a male teen.

So it's, in a certain way, very authentic, but of course Dumbledore as a character suffers for it, because the way he works isn't captured by /only/ that perspective.
