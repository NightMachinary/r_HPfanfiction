Example: In post-DH H/Hr fanfiction, one recurring idea is that Ron suddenly realizes that Harry and Hermione were always supposed to happen, and after a brief period (half a chapter) he is no longer interested in Hermione.


** On the same note: Ron and Ginny are using love potions to ensnare Hermione and Harry. Dumbledore wants to pair off Harry with Ginny so he would be easier to control, or because he's secretly a blood purist.

***** Absolutely! It's a Harry/Draco classic that was written after GoF came out and is my second favorite fic of all time. Draco thought he was making an invisibility potion but made a love potion by accident, and then in walked Harry.

  Under the influence of a love potion, Draco learns that poison doesn't always bring death -- there are other ways to suffer and live. Chemical emotion runs feverish as Harry and Draco discover the intoxication of love.

**** One could argue that this makes it more believable. The only reason she all of a sudden becomes visible is because of potions. Molly says (in book 4?) she used a love potion on Arthur. So the idea has been planted in the girl's mind. Also, consider Romilda Vane. She barely enters the story except when she uses a love potion.

I agree that the amortentia plot-line is overdone, but the thing with is, it is believable.

***** Beginning of PoA, but I get what you mean. I also thought it was really weird that Hermione would giggle at the thought of Molly trying to brew a mind-controlling substance when she was so adamantly opposed to house elf slavery. [She's also strangely silent on Harry's treatment at the hands of the Dursleys, but I rationalize this by thinking she must not have known or Ron hid it from her as it would only fuel her Helping Harry Syndrome.]

I agree with your assessment. Ginny's invisibility makes her extremely pliable for /any number/ of different plot lines as she's an unknown quantity for 95% of the series. I've always felt that the reason why H/Hr fans (like myself) feel like she /could have/ potioned Harry is because of the extremely weird Chest Monster thing. But unfortunately, that was just *really awful* writing. Couple that with the fact that Harry inexplicably never notices Hermione and it starts to make a strange sort of sense. I've read several variations on the amortentia theme where a jealousy potion is used instead, but that's only slightly more tolerable to read after the first few examples.

** For Harry/Tonks- the conceit where Tonks says, 'No one has ever asked to see the real me; they always wanted me to have bigger boobs or look like someone famous'. You gotta be kidding me. The wizarding world isn't big on celebrity mags and honestly she acts like she wants someone to really challenge her capabilities, not treat her like a delicate flower. The woman's a klutz but still became an Auror- the most challenging career in the wizarding world aside from Curse-breakers or conquerors.

** mine are kind of related:

First - over protectiveness over kids.

It's politically correct now for everyone to throw a collective fit if there is child abuse. Bullying by teachers is seen as completely unacceptable. There are crusades across most of north america to prevent bullying schools...

Almost all fanfiction takes it as a basic premise that HP magic world is centuries behind muggle world in values... except for this one part.

Half a century ago beating the shit out of your kids was unremarkable - "strict parenting" it was called.

Some punishments that were routine in my grandparent's childhoods:

-making a misbehaving kid kneel on salt for a few hours while facing the corner.

-making a kid stand with one leg raised for several hours without moving.

-making them hold up weight like pails of water for a long time

And these were considered modern and soft because they didn't involve actually striking the kids - strapping was still routine.

Besides socially acceptable methods of discipline there is bullying.

Bullying only actually became an prominent issue over the last 20 years. Before that it was just taken as fact of life in schools around the world and really the only time it was expected to be stopped by teachers or school officials was when said bullying interfered with school discipline. It's really telling how radically the education systems around the world have shifted over the last several decades that Snape's behavior toward students is even referred to as "bullying".

Yet all these fanfictions I read often make a big deal out of Dursley's and Snape's "abuse" of Harry and other students, government officials rushing to save poor abused kids... bullshit. If your fic accepts aristocracy and blood relations as being meaningful and using social standards as old as a century ego, than why is this one thing being consistently missed as being totally a part of that social structure?

Just to clarify - I get that these are serious issues, it's the disassociation with cultural time period that gets me. It's sort of like writing a fiction that is based on greek era and choosing to lambast characters who are evil because they "objectify women". Or writing sci-fi about societies that wield robot armies yet use slaves for manual labor.

Second biggest cliche for me, usually stemming from the above, is that Snape is pure evil.

Rowling gave us many underdeveloped characters. Pretty much entire cast. She made an effort to at least make this guy somewhat rounded - why the need to constantly downgrade the original material?

*** And relating to the original theme of this thread, there is a great tongue and cheek parody someone wrote called [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=4107][The Not-So-Comprehensive Guide to Hermione/Severus Clichés in Fanfiction.]] You might need an account to read this, I'm not sure (as I already have one for the site).

**** I agree! It's one thing for it to develop into a true love story, but I hate it when it's instant. I also hate it when he makes public declarations of love or whatever. Whatever they do in private is fine, but it just isn't Snape when there's PDA involved IMO.

***** It doesn't seem like either of them would be into PDA or really being public at all.

****** Totally. Instant turn off when stories include that, especially if Hermione is still a Hogwarts student.

******** I don't mind stories where hermione is a student, but it takes a certain suspension of reality. Once you go this route, you need to be extra careful with the characters. I can handle then being a bit OC, but damn, keep it together a bit.

********* I ment because of drastic OC not because she's a student which they usually fix her age via the time turner. I just don't think either one would ever do anything romantic in the middle of the great hall in front of the whole school.

** Any soul bond fic is that they (usually harry and hermione) love each other forever but they can't be in love because they're too young, but super mature and powerful.

** OP, I understand what you mean although your example is slightly diminished in light of JKR revealing that she got romance wrong. Better late than never, right?

People often use Luna to 'foreshadow' what's going to happen in their fic with some out-of-left-field psychic ability. It just prevents meaningful conflict from developing.

I've seen several 4th and 5th year fics where one of the characters (Neville, Sirius, etc) is suddenly a vast compendium of some really convoluted new pureblood etiquette and teaches Hermione how to be a proper Lady. It's really tiresome to read about Lord and Lady Potter ad infinitum.

The Weasley twins accepting bets on when my pair would get together. They made one (strangely accurate) bet in GoF. That does not make them the Las Vegas of the magical world. Also, I don't need any characters to validate my ship. *I* do that by reading it. I don't care if my ship make sense to anyone else, even the minor characters in that universe.

Edit: wanted to add another example
