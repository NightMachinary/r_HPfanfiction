I'm trying to find a fic I read a while ago. It takes place in an alternate dimension where Tom Riddle is the Minister for Magic, and a very powerful wizard. Harry is less powerful, but he makes up for it with his enchanting skills. [[/blah][Mouseover for spoilers]].

I don't remember the name, or whether it was ever finished though. Any ideas?
