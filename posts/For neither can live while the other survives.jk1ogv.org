The prophecy was interpreted differently, Voldemort recognizes living and surviving are two different things. Harry is just surviving his years just like Voldemort is surviving and not living a life. In order for one to live a life the other must die. However, what if Voldemort just left Harry alone? Or anyone born in July? “Alright fuckers! I'm torturing you all! Except for you Harry, would you like a queen or a king?”


** Voldemort never found out the whole prophecy
