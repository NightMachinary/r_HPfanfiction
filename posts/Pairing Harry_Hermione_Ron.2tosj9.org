** Hmm. Not my thing but I've run into this various times. I'll go find some for you.

thequidditchpitch.com has this in different categories:

- Set during the Hogwarts Years. [[http://www.thequidditchpitch.org/browse.php?type=categories&catid=2][Golden Trio]] category.

- Set after Hogwarts. [[http://www.thequidditchpitch.org/browse.php?type=categories&catid=3][Three of Hearts]] category.

- Different time periods but contains explicit material. [[http://www.thequidditchpitch.org/browse.php?type=categories&catid=5][Ménage a Trio]] category.

And here is an archiveofourown link containing trio stuff. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Brelationship_ids%5D%5B%5D=5536&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=1&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=0&commit=Sort+and+Filter&tag_id=Harry+Potter+-+J*d*+K*d*+Rowling][CLICK HERE]]

There's probably some on other websites but...too much work.

*** Seconding thequidditchpitch, especially [[http://www.thequidditchpitch.org/viewuser.php?uid=3][Simons Flower]]. I was heartbroken when I heard she died. Trisha was one of the nicest people I'd ever met and she is still the best author of ménage a trio, even though it's been over five and a half years.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/137248][And On The Third Day]] is the only one I know of. The quality is definitely there - this is the same author as two of my favorite non-HP fics, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/35939][like gold to ayery thinnesse beate]], which is a post-series /His Dark Materials/ fic, and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/209645][The Apocalypse According to C (with a little help from H and R)]], a Calvin and Hobbes fic.

** In addition to the sites urukubarr posted, the [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Harry/Ron/Hermione][fanlore wiki page]] isa good point of reference.

** Granger Enchanted has a number of H/H/R fics. The search function will help you locate them. A few are actually very beautiful, IMO.

** Darklooshkin has a one-shot chapter [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/16][The Damned]], that features the trio taking a darker path to surviving Hogwarts, with Harry as a consummate killer, Hermione as a drug dealer, and Ron as a master thief. It features a long-term three-way relationship among them, though it's Harry/Hermione and Ron/Hermione, without Harry/Ron (that we see).
