Just read a Harry Potter/Star Wars cross over where Harry goes beyond the veil and instead of dying comes back a sith.

Curious if there are others?


** There's a terrible one where he returns as harry stu. I think it's a robst story. And a couple others I can't remember offhand.

  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.
