Hey! I think I've read every next generation go to the past fic imaginable, so instead of that I am looking for a fic where only Lily Luna time travels. Lily would be my favorite next gen kid if you had asked, so has anyone read a fic where Lily Luna travels to either the Harry Potter time, or to the Marauders era? If so, I would like for it to be in Harry's younger years, (years 1-4,) or any school year for the Marauders. Also, it could also be Lily and another kid. (Hugo, Rose, etc.) Just not all of them. I would like for the fic to be completed, but that's not the worst of my problems. Another thing is Lily would be in the trios year, or the year behind them to be in the same year as Ginny. This is pretty specific so it's fine if know-ones read something like this. Thanks!
