I JUST WANT TO SEE A REALLY SAD REMUS! I WANT ANGST! THE MORE ANGST, THE BETTER!

(Also I would like the fic to be completed and I don't mind any pairing, unless it is absolutely taboo, such as Dudley/Dumbledore.)


** I would read Dudley/Dumbledore.

** This has a Snape/Lupin pairing and is quite good.
