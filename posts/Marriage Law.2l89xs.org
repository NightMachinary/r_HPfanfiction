** The ultimate IMO is Care of Magical Creatures. I'm on mobile right now, but I'll link it tonight. You can find it on Ashwinder.

** Care of Magical Creatures is the classic Snamione Marriage Law Fic.

My personal favorite is [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=17863][Second Life]] by Lariope. It's not strictly Marriage Law but is inspired by that trope.

Some other ones I can think of are [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=14050][Bride of the Potions Professor]] (good but very angsty)

and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4161096/1/Polyandry-and-Other-Problems][Polyandry and Other Problems]]. That one has Lucius Malfoy involved as well but it's mostly a SS/HG fic.

** Never forget The Marriage Stone by Josephine D'arcy. One of my favorites and very long. It is Snape/Harry and unfortunately unfinished, but other authors have attempted to finish it. Very well written, imho.
