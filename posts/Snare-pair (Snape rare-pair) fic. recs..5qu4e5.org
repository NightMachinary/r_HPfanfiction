** /throws self into the room/ I LOVE rare pairs with Snape, and Delphi does several interesting ones - my favourites are their Snape/Filch ones, but they've also done Hagrid ones which are surprisingly compelling, and some Snape/Kettleburn as well which isn't something I'd have ever considered, honestly. I know they've done a lot of Albus/Snape fics, too, and I think they've even done Snape/Aberforth, though I've not read those.

My favourite of the Snape/Filch ones is Needs Must (linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2480741)]]), and it's truly wonderful when it comes to Snape's characterisation. I'm so picky about Snape simply because so many authors either soften his hard edges too much or forget the reason for them - Snape isn't the way he is because he truly is aristocratic, but because he comes from this Muggle, Northern, working-class background.

This fic really shows Snape's awkward angles and explores the relationship between he and Filch in a way that is aware of both their similarities and differences at once, and I really like the way Delphi portrays Filch as a three-dimensional character. The dialogue is spot-the-fuck-on.

  *"But it's Potions equipment," Severus protested, feeling the need to defend the fact that he had just spent four hours looking for the bloody things.

  "Yes, sir," Filch said, taking down the box for him.

  "Should it not be in the dungeons, where the Potions classroom is?"

  "Yes, sir."

  "I wasn't even given a key to this cupboard," he pointed out.

  "Well now, sir," Filch muttered, and sniffed. "It'll be a long wait if you hold your breath for any fucking common sense around here."*

But yeah, Delphi is a positive treasure trove of rarepairs in this regard.

** If you haven't read Nygmatech's Snape/James fics, you are missing out. linkao3(detail of the woods by Nygmatech) and linkao3(strike me down by Nygmatech) are both amazing, with some incredibly vivid imagery.

Oh, and of course linkao3(Apocrypha by xylodemon), which is /the/ Snape/James fic.

Also, if you count Snape/Regulus as rare... [[http://kinda-lush.livejournal.com/15005.html][In Through the Out Door]] by fleshdress and themostpotente is fantastic. From Regulus's perspective, it's a (onesided) Regulus/Snape fic (with background Snape/Lucius) in which Regulus is hopelessly, obsessively in love with Snape. [[http://anneline.livejournal.com/43966.html][This Masterpiece of Nature]] by anneline is also fairly good, but it's mostly gen, with some Regulus/Snape.

And linkao3(In Thy Orisions Be by Mad_Maudlin) and its remix linkao3(323899). They're Regulus/Snape disguised as Ron/Snape.

I remember linkao3(60377) was all right. It's Ron/Snape, and AU.

Oh, and finally, some Kingsley/Snape. linkao3(91731; 90396; 515219)
