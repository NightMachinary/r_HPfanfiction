**** Yeah, of course. But there are tons of Slytherin Harry fics that are canon rehashes/stories that don't stray much from canon. Mine parts from a major divergence that for now remains mostly unexplained, even though it's easy to have an idea of what changed. And the plot greatly diverges, even though that are points of intersection with canon.

Such deviations might put people off.

  A decade ago James and Lily Potter made an extreme choice to protect their son. Now, Harry Potter enters the magical world and tries to make sense of his past to understand his future. Maybe he can avoid a cycle of mistakes. And out of sight, unbeknownst to most, looms a prophecy with strange ways to be fulfilled. (Dark Harry, no bashing, no children politicians) [6/33]

  Harry Potter grew up at Number Four Privet Drive. Harry Potter has never known his parents. Harry Potter is a wizard.Harry Potter is not the Boy Who Lived.--The Thrown Pebble is Book One of a whole-canon reimagining wherein Neville Longbottom, not Harry Potter, was the one targeted by Voldemort. This changes many things, and other things not at all.(TTP is complete; the series is a WIP. Tags will be updated as chapters are posted. See series notes for more details.)
