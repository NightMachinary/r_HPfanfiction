*** Probably not, or at least not past book 1. Joe developed his "epic-over-the-top" writing voice as he did this series and if that isn't something that works for you, you'll probably not enjoy books 2 and 3 (which involve, respectively, dimension travel and time travel, each with highly-plussed-up Harry and enemies).

** This really is a brilliant set of fics, granted it get's a bit... Obnoxious right around the 2nd half of part 2 of the Trilogy but even so...

This and the Sunrise/sunset Over Britain are easily my two favourite BIG HP Fanfic series.
