Not looking for very short cameos where all the gods do is give Harry power.


** I'm not sure how well it's aged (feels near a decade since I've read it), but if you don't mind a bit of smut, there's a good deal of legitimately scholarly work put into the mythology in Harry Potter and the Midnight Sun by Vanir over on Ficwad.

... As though the author's name didn't give it away...

Edit: Corrected Title of fic.

*** Well thanks for the recommendation, I don't mind a bit of smut as long as the story is fine.

**** Well, again, it's been a rather long enough that I can't exactly vouch for my positive memories of the story. That said, the take on the mythology was the most fascinating part for me. Well, that and reading about Harry getting it on with a Huldr.
