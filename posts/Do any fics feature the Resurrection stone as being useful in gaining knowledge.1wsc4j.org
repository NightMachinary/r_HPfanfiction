Out of all the fics I've read, I'm astounded I haven't come across any where Harry gets the stone early somehow and uses the hell out of it.

It's shown to be the worst of the deathly hallows, because keeping someone on the living plane when they don't want to be for reasons of love is a bad and unsatisfactory thing. (Though any parents willing to die to protect their child, then see him routinely abused would almost certainly be willing to at least visit once in a while despite the discomfort, and Harry's strong enough not to commit suicide to join them, even in canon)

But what if he talked to diseased wizarding prodigies? Dumbledore, the Flamels, the founders, Merlin, etc... He could learn new spells, learn how to become an animagous, learn powers long thought lost who knows, create a new stone to fund the war effort (assuming the Flamels stupidly gave dumbledore the only stone and forgot how to make a new one and died, over six hundred years and that stupid? People must have been after that stone for ages, it'd be safer under a fidelous - a proven bit of magic, one of them could be the secret keeper (dumbles was the orders and he was at the order HQ all the time so there's no problem there, no, they're alive in canon, Dumbles was lying or mistaken, that or they just wanted to die), and so on. Not to mention if the three brothers created the items, instead of the mythical figure of death giving them for crossing a river (really, how silly that would be if that's how it actually happened in canon), one could easily learn how to create the other two again, and who knows what else three geniuses that created the hallows would know? Not to mention it'd save time in finding the locket at least, after all, R.A.B is dead and not a ghost.

As I see it, there are at least three possible times to introduce the stone and change the whole series; Christmas first year (Dumbles could easily find the cloak in the gaunt shack, wish to put it on to test it, and have another dark curse on it.), the summer before sixth year or beginning of sixth year, or right after the minister leaves in book seven.

Having him get it only at the end of book 7 is a rip off, a complete waste of the powers of the stone, it's true power is knowledge, not just seeing loved ones again, or protection from dementors, or creating zombies.

TLTR: His parents loved harry enough to suffer the stones draw for him, he could get dead tutors to make him the greatest wizard of the era, it makes no sense to me why the stone was only used once and ineffectually in canon, it was the greatest of the hallows, the silly story of the three brothers be damned.

I'm fairly certain you meant deceased.

The resurrection stone is unusual in that the other two hallows are just near-perfect versions of something that already existed- wands and invisibility cloaks. Unlike them, the stone seems to call spirits back from 'beyond the veil'. This flies in the face of everything stated before about the absolute line between life and death. Ghosts haven't seen the other side of the veil and there is no magic anywhere to bring someone back once they're gone.

...except /this thing/.

Sounds suspicious. Maybe it doesn't retrieve the dead to speak to the living. Maybe it just calls up a vision of that person as the summoner remembers them. Or perhaps the vision is an amalgam of all those who remember the person. It's not like the spirits told Harry anything new or provably outside Harry's knowledge and within theirs.

I see the value of the stone, or of magic portraits to act as mentors for Harry for a fix-it fic, but... The closer to canon you'd want to keep the story, the more likely the stone just makes a powerful Illusion. The visions are a reflection of the owner's desires, operating much like the Mirror of Erised, Voldemort's drinking fountain of despair, Amortentia, Dementors and Boggarts. This is why the Resurrection Stone can never fill the hole of a person's loss.
