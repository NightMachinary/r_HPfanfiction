:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi looking for this fic, I read this fanfic ages ago and just thought of it today and wanted to reread it. Not sure if complete but I know it is a slash fic.

I can't remember alot but this is what I can: â€¢ its a slow burn â€¢ Draco says they cant be together bc Draco is the last Malfoy and has to have an heir â€¢ Harry is upset has a fling with Pansy â€¢ Draco goes in Horcrux hunt with golden trio â€¢ Draco and Harry are best friends cant remenber why â€¢They infiltrate Malfoy manor by using Draco's memories to know the layout â€¢ can't remember if Harry is in Slytherin...I think so â€¢ Harry is still friends with Ron and Hermonie but because of the Order, mostly closet to Draco â€¢ Hermonie doesnt trust how close Draco and Harry are- thinks it blinds Harry to things â€¢ Um at the end, Harry defeats Voldermort but everyone thinks he is dead expect Draco...draco stops them burrying harry...think he is crazy

So that is it. Anything is useful thank you ðŸ™‚
