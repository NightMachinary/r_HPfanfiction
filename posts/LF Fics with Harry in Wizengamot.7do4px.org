Looking for fics where Harry has a seat in Wizengamot. I don't care if the fic has Harry manipulating everyone to get power or not, just want to read one.


** linkffn(A Black Comedy) has both Sirius and Harry as Lord Black. I think there's only two or three scenes where they're inthe Wizengamot however.

linkffn(Strange Reflections) has Harry becoming the Chief Warlock. This has serious Potter family bashing, except for Iris.

**** If you say so. Outside of the bashing, I enjoyed it enough. It dealt with Harry having PTSD, which isn't something I see often.

** My fic, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) has a bicameral (two chamber) Wizengamot with a House of Lords and a House of Commons. Harry has a seat on the House of Lords, although he can't officially partake in politics until he's 17. There's still a bit of political screentime, though, because the fic has multiple points of view.
