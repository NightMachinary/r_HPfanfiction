Buckle in, this is going to get deep - I'm a chronic over-thinker.

I'm planning/writing a fic, and I have a question about what, if any, inter-relationship there may be between the Hogwarts subjects of Astromony and Potions. Any conformaiton that there is mention of such in the books would be great, and citation would be ideal.

The reason I ask is because it occurred to me that, if there /are/ more examples to support the proposition that "The stars have a measureable, magical effect on things living on Earth" then a possible explanation for the existence of magic is that it is generated naturally by stars.

My problem is that I'm fairly certain that I'm conflating memories of the books with things that other people have added to their own fics to flesh their own worlds out a little.

I know, for example, that:

- Mandrakes apparently mature around the end of May, at least in the Northern Hemisphere, but I don't know to what extent that has to do with the planets and constellations as opposed to just . . . the time of year.
- Polyjuice Potion requires the inclusion of fluxweed, that must have been plucked "on a full moon".

We already know that the moon has a magical effect in the case of lycanthropy, so I don't know that the second item I listed actually has anything to do with the stars, /per/ /se/.

I know that, as the author of my own fic, my word on my own creation is essentially law, but I have a definite preference for writing things that have a basis in the canon. At least for this fic. I also wanted to present the theory to you fine people, and see what thoughts, opinions and advice I might be able to gather here.


** I generally assume that Astronomy has an effect of magic, but it's usually so minimal, no one bothers with it, with the exceptions of magic that's tied to moon phases or such. Like "if Mars is bright, it'll be 0.1 % easier to cast a Colouring Charm in the red spectrum".

*** Yea I think it would affect potions mainly, such as the moon affecting the wolfsbane potion.

*** Ok, but if the magic emited by stars billions of miles away has /any/ measurable effect on magic performed on Earth, no matter how miniscule, they have to be pumping out truly astonishing quantities of it.

After all, the visible - and otherwise - quantities of the EM spectrum from other stars which actually reaches Earth and can be measured is in the fractions of a percent of what they actually produce. Hence; the Sun being a reasonable source of magic for Earth.

The only mention of Mars having any kind of effect on life on Earth is from the centaurs, who say during PoA that Mars is bright tonight, which I think is really more to do with the coming events - the rise of Voldemort and the second civil war. Which - to me - implies that the planets have more influence over the more ephemeral magics govorning us, like fate.

**** I don't think the stars emit magic energy. It's more like that magic works better under certain constellations.

***** What other reason could there be for certain magics working better under certain constellations besides sympathetic magic? Human belief having magical power?

I mean, belief holding actual power is an interesting possibility, but it's such a deep rabbit hole that I don't really feel like trying to plumb it. :P

******* I'm not saying it does - in fact I prefer fanfic where the magic is mystical and ineffable, rather than quantifiable and with concrete rules - but physical laws are all I have to draw comparisons with.
