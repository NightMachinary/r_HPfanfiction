After leaving pretty much all fandom for a year, I just came back marathoning a few dark-fic, including the infamous DAYD (among others, mainly over at NGE), so I'm looking for something to cool off and stop me from wangsting about it for the next week. Cheers


** All these are completed stories, incomplete stories being particularly annoying to those new to the fandom:

- nonjon's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the World is Harry Potter]] and two sequels. It's very lighthearted and funny. Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] by the same author (a Harry Potter/Firefly crossover).

- Blu Taiger's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2760303/1/The-Best-Seven-Years][The Best Seven Years]] is a Calvin and Hobbes/Harry Potter crossover that's very lighthearted. My son read it when he was eight (and totally into Calvin and Hobbes) and adored it.

- Respitechristopher's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6619152/1/Harry-and-the-Hobgoblins][Harry and the Hobgoblins]] is fluffy Harry/Luna.

- BajaB's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][Harry the Hufflepuff]] and sequel are light comedy and fun reads.

- Sarah1281's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]] is a lighthearted read.

- Paimpont's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of Sally Anne Perks]] is a great little mystery that doesn't go to dark places.

- The Caitliff's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3022004/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freak-Parade][Harry Potter and the Freak Parade]]. Not for everyone, perhaps, but not particularly dark or dismal.

- Rorschach Blot's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]] (comedy, only getting a bit dark toward the end).

- Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5116751/1/The-Life-of-Brian-A-Super-Harry-Parody][The Life of Brian: A Super-Harry Parody]]. Short but good.

*** I skipped over the crossovers (Since I don't like Sci-Fi that much, and I have no idea what Calvin and Hobbes is), but the rest is pretty good.

**** This is just my opinion, but I didn't really think the Calvin crossover was that good- it turned into a wish fulfillment story for the author, not really in the same spirit as the actual Calvin and Hobbes strips where Calvin is forever a hyperactive six-year-old. That said, Calvin and Hobbes is a fantastic comic strip, probably the best of its time, and I encourage you to pick up one of the books sometime and check it out.

***** That's fair. I found it a bit 'meh' myself and unpolished, but a pretty lighthearted thing nevertheless. (Definitely not in the same league as DAYD.)

I've probably only come across four, maybe five decent Calvin and Hobbes fanfictions, so the bar is rather low in that fandom. It's about as sparse as How To Train Your Dragon or other obscure fandoms.

****** True.

Also I don't really know anything about How To Train Your Dragon or other recent kids movies but apparently it is a thing to do fanart/fanfic where the main characters all go to Hogwarts? Made me laugh, what will people think of next? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Rise-of-the-Brave-Tangled-Dragons/105872/][no seriously it's real]]
