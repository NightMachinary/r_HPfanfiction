I personally don't, there are /many/ holes in FB and I don't like how it is write-by-committee.

Cursed Child, of course, I consider canon. /s

Seriously though, now that every subsequent "canon" non-JKR addition to the "wizarding world" (hate that) has been proven to be just inferior, are you even excited or looking forward to anything new?


** Unpopular opinions:

I don't consider fantastic beasts canon. I'm still eagerly awaiting the next film. Sure, there are some things I don't like. But it's still HP magic on a screen, I'm excited.

Cursed child was written by a playwriter with daddy issues and then given the canon label by JKR. I don't think it was written by her and thus we can consider it non-canon, despite JKR's claims. Fantastic beasts falls under the same thing.

I think that pottermore content is canon, whether people like it or not. Yes, people make a big deal about wizards shitting on the floor but if you have cleaning spells and vanishing spells, it's not so entirely out of left field. It's written by JKR, and it /is/ canon.

Main books are obviously canon.

For discussion purposes, if someone cites something written by JKR that does not directly contradict the 7 books, I consider that canon and worthy evidence.

I am afraid the Fantastic Beasts are truly by Ms Rowling. Yes, that cursed Cursed Child is probably just poor piece of fanfiction signed by JKR to get more money (and yes, I know, that she is not greedy for herself, but for the Lumos foundation), but FB is I am afraid all her (and the main piece of evidence, why she should be never allowed to write anything else than novels, yes, somebody else could adapt it for films afterwards, but she herself should be kept sitting on her behind until she really spends time and effort to thought through a novel). Whether you consider it to be part of the HP Universe and canon there is another question, but I am afraid we cannot get out of it so easy as with CC. And yes, in terms of the universe development (and using spells and stuff) it is horribly sloppily written.

There is not much from FB1 which is worthy of salvaging (FB2 should be just mercifully forgotten and never mentioned again and I don't think I will bother to go to watch FB3), but there is something: I like generally the main characters (I would *love* to read the story of Modesty Barebone post-film ... something in the lines of linkffn(12278819), a cross-over between HP-universe and Oliver Twist, a poor beggar witchlette living on the streets of New York in 1920s'), Obscurials are not a bad idea (and the explanation of Ariana Dumbledore), the existence of MACUSA and Ilvermorny (not THE American school, but AN American school). And that's basically it.

**** I have a hard time believing FB is all Rowling.

FB introduces so much new magic that it just kind of negates the mystery of Harry Potter. For example, the "blow golden dust out of your wand" thing. If this was /really/ a thing then Riddle would have been caught opening the chamber of secrets and would would be used by Aurors /all the time/. Then there's the "obscurus" thing that Dumbledore does when he's standing on the rooftop. That's reaching extreme power creep. I even disliked how the movies showed random death eaters being able to fly. It's supposed to be advanced dark magic.

And the entire premise of a muggle being able to participate in and see everything makes /no/ sense. I expected that guy to be booted in like ten minutes but he's in every movie!

Edit:

Also that "we killed the family but here's the baby, we need to kill him too" part in FB2 just made me roll my eyes.

And "No-Maj"? Come on.

** I just consider anything from Rowling canon but quietly ignore the bits I don't like. If there are two conflicting pieces of canon (which sometimes occurs even when you consider solely the books canon), I just pick the version I like better. Considering I only write canon compliant stuff, I actually don't worry about it too much.

** I mean, personally, I don't really care. What canon is only really matters if stuff being canon compliant or not matters to you - and that doesn't matter to me in the slightest.

At the end of the day, canon is either what the creator says it is or it's what's in the original work. Those're the definitions of the word, in the literary sense. You can have layers of canon, technically, so you can have 'movie canon', 'book canon', 'social media canon', etc without them necessarily having to combine.

But really, fanon matters more to me than canon. Part of the appeal of Harry Potter to me is the creativity of the fandom community, fanon and headcanon and all, and all the stuff you can create in the playground sandpit that is Rowling's original works. Rowling, whatever you can say about her works, created a really great playground for us all to build our own little sandcastles and play our own little games in and that's far more interesting and important to me than what colour she says the climbing frame is.

Which is basically a really rambly way of saying "I agree with Starfox." :D

** Look at it this way:

- Primary Canon (NOT *cannon*. Please. The firearms jokes are getting boring): The books.

- Secondary Canon: Movies, extra books (Cursed Child). Can be considered canon if it doesn't contradict primary. If it does, primary has preference.

- Tertiary canon: JK's Twitter. Games (?). Others: Can be considered canon if it doesn't contradict primary nor secondary.

** Well personally i think of anything in the seven main books to be irrefutably canon.

The 8 movies i consider a very close AU and tbh is most of the visual style i think of when imagining things. Like having more conventional school uniforms underneath robes or how the characters generally look.

Moat Everything else i ignore

** I consider mostly the seven books and Pottermore/Wizarding World as canon.

However, some of Rowling's Pottermore writings do conflict with the books (primary canon), such as the whole Polyjuice can last ten minutes to twelve hours per dose, depending on the quality of the brewing.

In book 4, Dumbledore says that Crouch Jr forgot to take his potion by the hour, every hour. Overall, there's no indication that Polyjuice can ever have a change in effect-time.

You'd think that someone as talented as Crouch Jr, and who pilfered ingredients from Snape's stores (likely high quality), would've ended up nearing or reaching that twelve-hour mark each time.

** FloreatCastellum has written a lot of canon compliant one-shots and a fanfic about Harry as an auror. They are extremely well written and even though I don't quite consider them canon, it is as close as it get for me. (I don't think it's cursed child compliant though)

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially not one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

** I don't even consider the epilogue canon :D

FB is more canon than cursed child. but to me only the HP books(!) are canon. even stuff they changed for the movies in not canon. like Hermione in pink dress instead of blue... etc. (or the infamous raven and white for ravenclaw) I just don't like the movies, the only ones that didn't bother me were third and sixth. I can't stand watching the others.

I actually liked the first FB movie much better than HP movies. the second one just completely ruined it. it completely trashed the whole series, the rest would have to be brilliant to save it and that probably won't happen. we just can't have nice things. :(

cursed child, definitely not canon to me.

Agreed, I've never even sat down for the full Potter movies, so I only see snippets and the most controversial moments. I hope that FB3 can be saved what with the delay and all, the first one was good and /magical/ but the second one seemed convoluted plot-wise.

** It's all canon, but some of it is canon I ignore and don't mind when fanfiction authors ignore, and some of it is set in stone canon. I consider the books to be the primary source of canon. The Fantastic Beasts films are sort of ... I consider that the events probably happened in some shape or form but maybe not exactly as shown. Pottermore is supplementary canon imo, I don't mind if authors ignore it but I use lots of it myself.

I pretend Cursed Child doesn't exist but tbh I don't mind some details (I'm indifferent to Delphini, I don't mind that Harry has a strained-ish relationship with one of his children).
