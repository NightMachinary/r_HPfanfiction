LF a wrong boy who lived fanfiction either it is Neville or a sibling to Harry


** linkffn(12048619) No scarcrux, Lily took Harry and ran while James blew the house, and the remaining Marauders fled to America, while Dumbledore made it seem like Neville was the BWL. Harry competes in the Triwizard Tournament in place of Viktor.

linkffn(2709487) Harry forms a Marauders-type group in Slytherin, consisting of himself, Blaise, Roger Appleby, and Spencer Westwood. His brother Micheal is thought to be the BWL, and Dumbledore thinks Harry is going to become another Voldemort, due to his similarities to Riddle.

linkffn(8541055) Neville is BWL, Harrty starts with literally nothing, becomes something. His Parseltongue is replaced by being a "Listener", allowing him to understand and communicate with all Magical Creatures.

linkao3(285498) boy with a scar series by dirgewithoutmusic. Alternate BWL include Neville, Ron, and Hermione. (Warning: Feels)

linkffn(The Prince of Slytherin) Obligatory WBWL.

  Spinoff to 'HP: The Lone Traveller'. The story of Harry James Potter, the brother of the supposed BoyWhoLived, and his friends... My take on the old 'Harry the brother of the BWL' & 'Harry the Slytherin' plotline.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
