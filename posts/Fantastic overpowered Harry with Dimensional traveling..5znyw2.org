** +Its alright+. It has potential, but is an unedited mess right now. Very sparse on the descriptive side. There are spots in it where I only wonder /where/ something plays. There are unexplained changes of scenery. I don't know who is in a scene until they open their mouths, ecetera ecetera. James and Sirius go investigating, suddenly they're back at St.Mungos and it goes on like that. I keep shaking my head at it.

Its also /really/ fast. Theres so much thrown into the few scenes we have, I barely wrapped my head around something when I get confronted with another thing. OCs are just thrown in there as if we are supposed to know who they are. Much is hinted at, nothing explained... The more I read it, the more i'm frustrated with it.

Also, linebreaks are a thing. Not using them is just asking for your readers to be confused.

*** Basically Harry comes from post apocalyptic world. He hasn't gone to Hogwarts but knows some of the people. He gets sent to a dimension where his family is alive but the war is still going along.

Worth a read, he isn't stronger then everyone but stronger than most

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  Already has my vote for fic of the year.
#+end_quote

So different are tastes, I guess. I haven't even finished it - I grew that frustrated with it. It lacks some very basic things, especially at the beginning. Staging is almost completely absent.

As I said, it has potential. But like this, it is not suspense or a constant question of what character will do that requires my patience. I need my patience for the absence of simple formatting and the very basics of "How to tell a story". If I don't know Where, When and Who then there is no scene. And this fic does this /a lot/.

Also... I'm not sure why I need to read an entire report about *every single scar* Harry wears on his body.

***** Its the potential of it that frustrates me most. If it would be just shit, I'd click away the tab in my browser and be done with it. But its not shit. Its just a really raw gem, waiting for some grinding.
