** It's a tough one... I think Cedric would be held back by his 'fair play', and without Harry in the picture, might not have had any warning about the dragons... Karkaroff, without the worry over his Dark Mark coming back, might have been more focussed on the tasks and helping Viktor more. Viktor is a Quidditch player and is quite daring so without Crouch Jr interfering might have done better in the maze... Fleur had Maxime's backing and did well with the dragon, but failed the lake task (but that wasn't anything to do with Voldy's plan) but, again, might have done well at the maze if Crouch Jr hadn't got her out of the way... but overall my gut feeling is Krum, partly due to his general daring attitude and his magical skill, but moreover , Karkaroff would not have played by the rules and would have done everything in his power to promote his chances. I think he was only held back in canon by worry over his Mark, and Crouch-Moody scaring him!

*** Also, even though Harry came back last in the second task, he was awarded more points for bringing Gabrielle back as well. This pushed Viktor to 3rd place when he would have been first if you factor in that Cedric wouldn't know about the dragons. This would mean that Viktor would enter the maze first too. I can't see any other scenario than Viktor winning to be honest.

I wonder weather Harry might learn about it anyway, Hagrid being eager to show off dangerous beasties to his friend/favourite student. That said, it was a really specific situation that led Harry to deduce that he, Fleur and Krum were informed and Cedric was the only one ignorant, so there's no guarantee he'd share the info.

** The problem with the Triwizard Tournament (well, one of the problems) is that the first two tasks really didn't matter. Maybe Cedric would have been killed or seriously injured without a warning about the dragons, but if we trust that there really were safety measures in place like they said, he probably would have come out fine. And other than that, the first two tasks only determine the order the contestants enter the maze, which is certainly an advantage, but not a huge one. Making one wrong turn could easily set someone back enough to erase whatever advantage they had from going first.

So who would do best in the maze? My gut says Krum. Most of the obstacles in the maze seem like they were meant to be defeated by force (the boggart, acromantula, and skrewt, plus Barty said that he "cursed many obstacles out of of [Harry's] way," which weren't necessarily guaranteed to be more creatures, but it seems likely), and Krum, coming from the school known for teaching dark magic, would probably have the easiest time with them.

But it would really all come down to luck in the maze.

** I honestly think Fleur is an excellent contender. She did not perform well in the second task canon, and was attacked in the third, but in the first task she displayed an excellent grasp of magic and had by far the most elegant solution in charming her dragon into an enchamted sleep. Krum is likely the best combatant, but the tasks seem to rely more on finesse than fighting, do I would say Fleur is a good pick. Far from guaranteed, but she has a good shot.

So, since I'd say navigating a maze on land would be easier than trying to navigate in dark, cold, murky water, I think she'd do better in the 3rd than the 2nd.

Would probably depend on what exactly Moody-Crouch moved in the maze, since without Voldemort's plan, they'd all be still around the route Harry took in the maze. If he'd diverted them into Fleur's path, for example, and they were thus no longer there blocking her since he never did anything in your hypothetical, she'd have an easier time of things.

Because while the dragon did trample some of it's eggs with Krum he still succeeded in getting the egg, and he succeeded with getting his charge as well, whereas Fleur succeeded with the dragon without eggs pulling her down but failed the second task entirely.

It would all come down to whether Cedric would be intelligent/smart and quick thinking enough to overcome the dragon without knowing about it, although he did get help from false Moody to figure out the egg as well, so that would require he was fast enough to figure out that task too as well as knowing the bubblehead spell before the task.

****** I meant balance out in the sense of them all entering the maze at very similar times. Literally, that's the only difference the first two tasks made - so long as they didn't die and did vaguely okay, they'd still have a chance of winning because they just have to get to the centre of the maze.

Literally, that's the only thing that matters when discussing who would win - who would get to the centre of the maze first. As I recall, there didn't seem to be any indication that points total influenced who won, just who got the cup first.

You have a point that it would come down to Cedric's intelligence though. I'm pretty sure it'd be a competition between him and Fleur in the Maze, since I'm not sure Krum would be creative and smart enough to make it through without just blasting everything in sight. Hitting a dragon with a blinding curse and then not thinking of the fact that it'd stumble about and crush all the eggs indicates some level of 'not thinking ahead'.

If the dragon handlers didn't use this method, it's gotta be way out of the reach of ordinary people. If it was some veela technique, the reserves would have hired and brought veela to subdue the dragons. Fleur pulls out magic above the professional's standard. If the reserve had an expert capable of it, they might have wanted to send it to the event where they allow hundreds of children to surround an incredibly dangerous animal. Compare that to Krum, whose entire strategy was "poke it REALLY HARD". Or Diggory, who demonstrated animate transfiguration. Impressive, but both are typical school concepts.

I've read where a lot of people give her a lot of flack for the grindylowa, but Veela are flying people who fling fireballs. Air/fire elements. I could easily see a water element being troublesome if the French school didn't encorporate them in the curriculum.

In case of altercation between him and Cedric, he should have more skill in DADA/Dark arts and better reflexes (being the better Seeker), so he should prevail in combat.

Though it is possible that Cedric gets lucky in the maze and simply outpaces Krum without ever meeting him.

Fleur hasn't got shit on either of them in terms of ability for 1v1, and she struggled with the second task putting her ability in question - i don't think she'd do better than either of them in the maze.

** I'm gonna make a case for each one.

*/Cedric./*

Yea, he was a Hufflepuff, but that probably wouldn't stop him. We know that he was incredibly magically adept; it's mentioned that he was brilliant at defense, and that's mainly what the Tournament would focus on.

Without Harry, he might not have had any warning about the dragons, but I doubt that would stop him, exactly. He was pretty good at magic(didn't he use transfiguration for the dragons?)

I don't remember if what happened with Fleur during Task #2 had anything to do with Voldemort, but Cedric would definitely help the little sister; being a good person is always a great help in one way or another.

He was also a skilled Seeker as I remember, that definitely would give him some agility and muscles, which would be a great help during Task #3. Call back to my opening, he was brilliant at Defense which he basically what Task #3 was testing them on.

And he would've has Cho's help, who was a Ravenclaw, yes? And quite good at magic, too.

​

side note: why the hell is her name Cho? That's not a first name, not at all. It's a surname.

*/Viktor./*

He's strong, magically adept, famous, and literally takes a class on the Dark Arts, it makes sense that he'd be a good candidate for winning. Karkaroff would've helped him, and he'd also have his experience from being a Death Eater to help. I can see Viktor taking many risks, which would both help and hinder him.

You know what? Read the other two comments advocating Viktor as the winner; I wouldn't say much different.

*/Fleur./*

Maxime was /friendly/ with Hagrid, Fleur would've known about the dragons. Fleur was most probably underestimated by her teammates. Wasn't she half Veela? That would help. Although, personally, I don't think the things that held her back had much to do with Voldemort.

Honestly, I lost my momentum about halfway through, but you can see what I meant.

edit: yea, I remember that the Triwizard Tournament pays just as much attention to finesse as to sheer magical power and knowledge. Again why I think Cedric might've won. Look at it this way

Cedric

Cedric has, after Krum, the most magically adeptness, I think. Sure, Moody told him how to open the egg, but I don't doubt that he would've found a way quickly enough. Being a Seeker and a great flier, he has the capacity for the elegance I was referring to earlier.

Viktor

Viktor had an impressive amount of magical ability and knowledge(and muscle), likely coming from the school he went to. It's just that, well, he doesn't seem like the type to be partially elegant, does he? I might just be being a bit prejudiced, but he seems more the type for bruteforce.

Fleur

Fleur literally sung the dragon to sleep which gives her the elegance and finesse I was talking about in abounty. Unfortunately, she didn't quite make the other ones.

In conclusion, I think Cedric would win. He has high points in both finesse and magical ability. While on their own both Fleur and Viktor have quite high points in both magical ability and finesse, Cedric is the only one of the three whom which has both in aplenty(or at least enough so that he's a bit ahead of them).

** Without Voldemort's indirect presence, I wonder if the /tasks/ would even be the same. If I remember it right, all the tasks were made to play to Harry's strengths and effectively give him - and him alone - an "out" to ensure he's the one who gets whisked away at the end.

Without Crouch Junior there to influence things, they might not even use dragons for the first task (because /holy crap/ the safety concerns), and they'd probably sweep the Black Lake more thoroughly before sending anyone in there, if they did that at all.

And then, even if they did use the same tasks, the outcome would be different.

Let's assume Cedric doesn't get told about the dragons because Harry doesn't get told either. He's the only Champion to go in under-prepared, so he's going to get the lowest score there - and that's assuming he even /lives/ (let's say they have people on standby to subdue the dragon, so he does survive - but he gets a Did Not Finish). Everything else goes roughly as-per-canon - Fleur puts the dragon to sleep, Krum blinds it and causes it to crush its own eggs. Of the three, Fleur would come in first.

Then, second task. I find it somewhat unlikely that BCJ engineered the Grindylow attack on Fleur, but it's also unlikely that it'd happen under uncompromised-safety-precautions circumstances - so it's more of a toss-up. I'd like to think she'd still come in last here on account of her seeming inexperience with water-borne creatures (Grindylow are third-year creatures at Hogwarts), making the points totals somewhat close at the end - Krum with two second-places, Cedric with a Did Not Finish and a first-place, and Fleur with a first and a third-place.

Then, the maze. Canonically, Cedric goes in first - but here, he doesn't. A DNF is the heaviest hit on points, so he goes in last of the three - Fleur and Krum going in within a few minutes of each other.

As for who wins in the end, that is therefore a toss-up between Fleur and Krum - I think it might /actually/ come down to who goes in first, which is difficult to predict based on precise scores.
