I really want fics, either in the canon universe or in au where Harry is a death eater and actually has a dark mark. Like Death of Today.

Any recommendations?

**** I know what you mean about Death of today. I do think "what we are" and "what we may be" are close to death of today in quality. Harry's not really a death eater in that and Voldemort goes a slightly different route as "Lord Slytherin" but I really enjoy the politics in that one and the interactions between Harry and his parents. So many fics where Harry sides with Tom involve Potter!Bashing if James and Lily and still alive and those fics are more realistic. "Again and Again" is very good too though Harry's not a death eater in that either.

Thanks for your suggestions. I've read a world gone astray. I've not read rebuilt though. Added to my list.

  [AU!] After society as we know it collapsed, humanity struggled for survival. Slowly a new society begins to establish. Groups led by lords battle for territory. Young Harry Potter has no interest in joining local politics, but when a new lord with unconventional ideas sees the potential in his unique talents, can Harry remain neutral? (LV/HP, post-apocalyptic, Inventor!Harry)

  HPLV. An "ordinary" Death Eater, Harry hides his true self to survive in this world ruled by the murderer of his parents. On his way to revenge, he schemes, kills, uses unwitting people, plays games with his superiors. He doesn't have anything to lose, and the path he is walking looks clear and uncomplicated. Until the Dark Lord himself takes an interest in him. Dark!Harry

*** This was actually one of the first death eater Harry fics I read. I also love Harry getting revenge on the Dursleys. Do you think you'll ever do a sequel?

**** Oh shit, I must've missed your response in the weird log-in/log-out shuffle Reddit keeps making me do! Glad you enjoyed it :)

I'm not sure that I'll ever do a /sequel/. A multi-chapter Death Eater fic /is/ something I want to do, and I've got like 3-4 incomplete drafts tackling the idea from different directions, but none of them directly follow Initiation and I don't think any will. I'm content leaving that particular fic a oneshot, if only because I have no plans for a plot extending beyond what's there and done.
