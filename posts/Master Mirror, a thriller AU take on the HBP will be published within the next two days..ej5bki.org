What if the Mirror of Erised was more than a cursed artifact? What if it contained an evil of unmatched power, sealed by one of the very founders of Hogwarts itself? Harry's duel with the possessed Quirinus Quirrell leaves more in its wake than anyone first imagined. With the Mirror destroyed, an ancient nemesis is freed from its prison without anyone even knowing. Years later, dealing with Sirius' death plunges Harry in the lowest point of his life. When he is offered a Faustian Pact that seemingly offers to fix all his problems he does not even think twice before taking it. But will he realize the costs of his actions before it's too late? Voldemort, Death Eater plots, and a wizard whose death is imminent. Will Harry and Dumbledore manage fix everything before the time is up? Will they still find the trail left for them by ancient wizards, or will Master Mirror win once more? A story where Harry learns exactly why one ought to read the fine print before signing a contract.

So, this is the basic plot. I hope I didn't give too many details. I'll be posting the prologue within two days, and have weekly updates, though if time allows, I will update faster than that. Usually I would postpone posting until I have a few more chapters ready, but as a huge procrastinator, I see no better motivator than already having the story in the open and have other people waiting to read it. Hope you guys will like it. Thoughts? Tips? Warnings? I'm all open for them!


** Intriguing! AO3 or FF.net? Is your pen name the same as your Reddit one? I want to set up an alert so I know when it drops.

** The first paragraph makes for an effective ad, but the questions are pretty grating, especially the "What if" questions. There's also a lot of exposition about the story that doesn't need to be there.
