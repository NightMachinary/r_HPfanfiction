  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** linkffn(Backward with Purpose) was the very first fic after HPMOR I read, and the one that made me go and look for more HP fics. It's not perfect, but a good fic overall IMO.

My typical preferences are Snape-centric. If you do not mind this, I could link some of those as well (mostly, but not exclusively, LESS).

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody---' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

  Sirius read: “Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes Permanent Hair Color, Flame Red. Colors ALL hair. Lasts until antidote is taken.” The meaning sunk in. “I'm not living the rest of my life as a ginger!”“You have something against gingers?” asked Fred menacingly. “He's just intimidated,” said George before Sirius could reply. “Let us assure you, Mr. Padfoot, that you are worthy of this, the most noble of hair colors, Gryffindor red. We based this color on our own hair, so you know we endorse it.”“It's more carrot orange, really,” observed Sirius. “Close enough.”“And the freckles...” Sirius said. “Don't worry, we have a potion to provide those too.” George tossed him a second vial. “Oh...good,” said Sirius hopelessly, catching it. It was pink with orangish-brown speckles. “You'll look very different without the trademark Black hair and alabaster complexion,” said Fred. “Trust us, changing your coloring is the least annoying way to change your appearance. Polyjuice is such a hassle,” said George.“Have you ever tried to pick your nose when it's not the shape you're used to? Difficult, very difficult.”

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.
