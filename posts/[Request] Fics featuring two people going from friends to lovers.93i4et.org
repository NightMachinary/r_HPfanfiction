In most romance fics I've seen, the pair is obviously destined for each other. They constantly think about how attractive the other person is and are either in denial about being in love or have secretly been pining for ages. Are there any fics out there where people go from regular, platonic friends (who are uninterested in romance with each other) to lovers?


** It feels weird recommending my own work on here, but that's the theme for the story I wrote. :) It's a Harry/Hermione AU fic where they both went to Ravenclaw and work together to explore the secrets of magic.

I suppose they are kinda interested in each other from the beginning, but it's a really slow build that focuses on their friendship first.

** This isn't 100% what you're asking for, but if you're okay with a Ron/Hermione focused fic, I just finished Australia by MsBinns and it was a good portrayal of the progression of a relationship between two inexperienced young people.

Grow young with me by Taliesen19 may fit a bit better, but you may have read it since it's so often recommended.

In general though, it's hard to think of a romance-focused fic that starts out with two characters completely uninterested in each other because romance just usually isn't written that way? Not to say that it doesn't exist or is wrong, just that it may be hard to find. Perhaps others may have better recommendations for you.

A vast amount, mostly H/Hr. Of course, most H/Hr is shit by virtue of Sturgeon's Law and being babby's first non canon pairing (still top two for me tho), but that still leaves many great works.

This one is widely appreciated: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6574535/1/Unlike-a-Sister]]

The issue with recs here is that short of only linking you stuff where they outright admit not to feel attracted just for it to change through the story, it's hard to know where to put the bar.

For example, this is one (which I liked a lot): [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9649736/1/Thresholds]] is essentially what you want, but it only deals with the acknowledgement of their change of heart.

This one [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12627473/1/The-Half-Blood-Romantic]] is basically what you ask from my point of view, but it depends on how strict you are on defining the previous friendship and its platonicity.

** There was a story on HPFF.com titled Breaking the Quidditch Code that fits the bill. It was a next gen fic that took place in Hogwarts, featuring James and an OC. I believe there was an additional sequal that took place after Hogwarts. I remember it being a fairly entertaining read, but it's been years and it's possible my standards were more lax at the time.
