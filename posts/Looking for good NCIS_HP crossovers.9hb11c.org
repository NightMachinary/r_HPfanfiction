I've been reading fanfic for a while, and besides The Lilac Elf of Lothlorien, and a really good story called Khaveyrim by In Defilade, I can't find many well written and explored NCIS/HP crossovers. Anybody have any others that they have read and liked?

** I've gotten into this crossover recently as well after watching NCIS again. Here's a good murder mystery at Hogwarts with the team, I just finished.

*** Another good one that takes place with Hawaii Five-O, Bones, NCIS LA and DC, and a few others.

** I honestly cannot think of a reason why you'd want to crossover the two series or how a crossover would be interesting. Why do you want one?

*** If you had read some of the stories Lilac Elf has done (both the HP/NCIS ones and their general HP ones) with the disability trope they are fairly good IMO, and if you took the time to read Khaveyrim (sadly it is unfinished but still quite good) the amount of detail is insane and incredible.

Im not going to look down on anyone else for wanting a crossover of any fandom I don't like with HP or others I do like, so why should you look down on me?

**** I'm not looking down on you, I honestly don't understand how crossing them would be interesting at all. I truly don't see how NCIS and Harry Potter could in any way benefit from being put together.

I haven't read any of the stories you mention and I'm willing to take your word on it that they're good, but I'm sure there are a lot of good, odd crossovers, but a few outlier cases doesn't make the entire genre interesting.

***** Ncis is character driven, not plot driven. The plots there are often nonsensical, but because that's not the point, it's alright. If you are looking for a stoey about people, rather than events, ncis has some very interesting people to read about in it.

***** A post war story, where Harry is an auror and has to cooperate with the muggle NCIS to find a missing muggleborn sailor? The plot is fairly basic but the character interactions would be very interesting to see
