You find a promising fic. You're so /so/ excited! It has all your favourite tropes, your most squeal worthy slash and gen ships. You open the fic, shivering with anticipation...

... And it turns out you've already read it before, as made obvious by the deja vu you're getting a few chapters in. You reread it anyway, of /course/ but it doesn't have that feel to it anymore.

Sad times.


** Or when you find a similar fic you haven't read and it's 100k+, but you forget to check if it's finished or not, so you get to the soul-crushing non-ending and everything is the worst.

****** Or when it's good length and their updating regularly so you read the entire backlog, spend months catching each new chapter with nervous anticipation as you traverse the cliffhangers, just to one day see the updates stop, and then suddenly it's been over a year and one of your favorite fics has been abandoned after all that emotional investment....I'm not crying, you're crying.

******* yes, exactly!

i just finished the one i was reading and, as predicted, it's not finished. i thought it was bc of the length & the summary didn't mention it being abandoned (i reread the summary rn). it was last updated 10/2018, so chances if it being completed are slim. it's not even close to wrapping things up either. but man it was a good read though

******** Those are so bittersweet, because the journey is so wonderful, but without an ending it just leaves a gaping hole. The worst part is that it's super difficult to try and have a different person finish it, because inevitably it becomes a totally different story since it's rare for two authors to carry a similar enough tone and style to make it feel seemless.

*** When you find an amazing work that's been abandoned but it's so good, so every time you go to re read it you feel bittersweet. You know it will be so good, but you will always be left yearning for that epic conclusion.

** Ooh, yeah. Haven't had that happen since I know most of the time or am not into the type of fic that it's categorized in anymore. But it's sad to look back and you just don't feel the excitement. Like you kind of just feel like you wanna skip through parts or something.

** I started keeping a spreadsheet of fanfic that I've read after the umpteenth time I started a promising story and realized that, not only had I read it before, but I didn't like it.

I started with title, author, and a link to the last chapter I read. Currently, it has title, author, status (complete, unfinished, removed), first post and last update dates, number of chapters, number of chapters I've read, number of chapters unread, averaged days between chapter updates, days since last update, genre (HP, Ranma, etc.), major cross (if any), my rating (excellent, very good, good, meh, and bad), and a comment field for describing the story.

I haven't yet caught up all entries to include everything yet, and I've already decided I need a few more fields - probably the number of times I've read the story, the date I last read it, and better comments, because I keep asking myself things I find I can't answer, like, "What was the story in which Ron was captured by DEs, asked for a chess board to keep himself occupied, and died when the DEs all died without freeing him?"

I also use it as a list of to-be-read stories; I just have 0 or a blank field for the "number of chapters read" field. The nice thing about using a spreadsheet is that I can sort it on any field or combination of fields, which is good if I want to group HP/Avengers crosses, or figure out which unread stories have the most chapters for me to read. Sorting on days/update and days since last update gives me an idea of whether an unfinished story is still active.

I've been considering writing a scraper that will go through the list and update the chapter count and last-update-date automatically.
