I think it would be cool to have some fanfiction about Harry or some other wizard going to another school in say Asia or Africa or North America. Any suggestions?


** I have a story where Harry teaches at a school in the US. It's 39 chapters and complete.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Jade Dragon) has Harry and Hermione going to the school in Japan to finish their schooling after book 7.

Edit: I should warn you that it's a very slow pacing. It takes like 75 chapters for H&H to go to Japan, even though only 2 months have elapsed in the story. Lots of excellent world building though.

** Brave New World by Bellerophon30 was based on Harry escaping to America after the end of year 5. It's gone from ffnet but can be found [[http://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/ofc/bnw/a/0/The+Brave+New+World/bellerophon30/40][here]].

linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle by Inverarity) is the first of four excellent fics about a witch attending an American school called Charmbridge. None of the Potter characters show up but the world is meant to be the same, using similar spells and such.

linkffn(HP and the Boy Who Lived by the Santi) is a well-regarded story where Harry attends Durmstrang.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
