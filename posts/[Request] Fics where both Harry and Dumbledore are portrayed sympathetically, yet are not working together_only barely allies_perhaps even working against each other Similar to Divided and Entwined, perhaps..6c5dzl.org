Preferably no bashing. Basically, Good Dumbledore and Harry, but they're not working together, or only very barely allies. Divided and Entwined is close, but too Hermione-centric; I would enjoy more Harry-focused. I /guess/ Dodging Witches would count, but Dumbledore isn't portrayed that sympathetically.

*** I love this fic for it's amazing ability to completely mess with your sense of who is good or bad or evil and making you root for immoral characters while keeping everyone in character and not resorting to bashing. This is definitely a good example of how a competent Dumbledore who is on the good side can work as an antagonist to Harry who is not dark.

** Why do you think Dumbledore didn't work closely with Harry in "Divided and Entwined"? IIRC, Dumbledore personally taught Harry legilimency and occlumency, personally went with Harry on Horcrux hunt, and finally gave him a reasonable plan (far more realistic than in Canon) to defeat Voldemort. Furthermore, he worked very hard behind scenes to turn the Ministry fully against Voldemort. This level of cooperation far exceeded that one in Canon, IMHO.

Now if you want a good Dumbledore who really worked separately from Harry, try [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855). Dumbledore was kind competent in this story, but Harry mostly stayed away from him in the first half. Later it was generally Bellatrix who had some loose cooperations with him and the Order. Only in the last 15% did they finally work close together.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

Harry works with Dumbledore but barely trusts him/forgives him for his role in placing him with thr Dursleys.

He trusts Snape a lot more (who protects his secrets from dumbledore). Dumbledore (as of right now) is not evil, but he isn't perfect either.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
