Hey guys.\\
Today i would like for you to send me your best fics where Harry is litteraly a Demigod (O even a god that is't aware of his powers, i want something where he learns about his godlike powers and he can be OP when he manages to control it)\\
You can send me crossovers, but i would very much preffer something just in HP universe.\\
No Slash\\
No FemHarry\\
I don't like Bashing with Dumbledore or Sirius, but im okay with any other character.\\
If there's pairings i really don't want Ginny to be his partner, i also would't like to be Hermione, but she is at least acceptable, every other girl im okay.

Yes i've already read the fic "Hell Eyes" and is one of the best that i have ever readed.

That's it !


** Man I was not expecting hell eyes to be so much the imagination of that author is incredible

  A strange child has become interested in an even stranger lady. She comes and goes as she pleases, but his fondness for her always stays the same. He may be scrawny, but he would get her attention.

  What is a God? A singular omnipotent being that can do anything, be anything, and who rules over all; But can a God really do anything? Be anything? Can a God be created? Can a God be stopped?
