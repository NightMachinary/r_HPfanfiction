I decided to write a fanfic in which Harry and Voldemort are forced to team up in order to survive. Here is the summary:

Harry had fought against Voldemort at least half a dozen times by now. Never, during those times, did he think he would have to one day fight along side him. Of course he wasn't alone, Dumbledore was there to help too. Harry was still uncertain if the three of them would be enough to fight what was coming. Lucky, they had help on the way.

The link to the FanFic is below. If you like the idea of it please give it a read and if you do, I would appreciate a review so much!
