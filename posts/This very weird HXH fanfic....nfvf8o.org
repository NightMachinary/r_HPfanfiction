:END:
I remember I read this weird fanfic on Seelvor, and it was very, very weird.

â€‹

The story is pretty simple, Harry felt ignore and his friends missed his birthday, then he left Hogwarts, moved to Florida, chilled with Voldemort, play mortal combat with him, destroyed Horcuruxes, have sex with Hermione, and Remus becomes an alcoholic at the end of the story, it's very weird.

It had Weasleys bashing, and Harry likes Hermione's mom a bit too much, and everyone eats his food, Molly yells at Harry, Hermione wanking Ron off, and they throw him a pity party. I forgot it was called, but I hope this group could find it.


** This fic has made me reconsider my choice of fandom, based on the description
