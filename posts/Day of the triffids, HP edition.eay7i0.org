In the Day of the Triffids, almost the entire world population goes blind after an object or objects orbiting the Earth spontaneously fill the sky with bright spectacular colours, which are broadcast live, and visible from nearly every point on the globe. Society collapses overnight, leaving the MC, who was recovering from eye surgery, the only person for miles able to see (he was still bandaged up during the event).

At the same time, huge mobile carnivorous plants called triffids take advantage of the breakdown, and go rampaging, picking off the blind and even herding them like cattle at one point.

Imagine the blindness inflicted by the sky fireworks is resistant to magic? Maybe it was caused by a satellite exploding which had been jinxed by a dark wizard before launch, maybe there was a magical artefact on board which blew up; anyway, wizards who watched the shw that night are now permanently blind, maybe even Voldemort regardless of having a body or not. Now imagine the triffids are in some way highly resistant to magic. Maybe they feed off it, and thus you can't repel them shields or any traditional wizard blocking methods.

Just an idea that dropped on me. Has anybody dabbled in this already, by any chance?
