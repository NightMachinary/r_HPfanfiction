After reading “Through the Veil”, where it's alluded to I really want to read a fic where instead of Aurors Harry and Ron join the DOM and do various badass missions. Any pairing except Drarry. Preferably similar to canon, at least till after Voldemort's defeat of course.

If you're interested in “Through the Veil” which is a Harry and Ron time travel fic here it is
