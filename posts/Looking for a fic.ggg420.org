Lo all, I'm looking for a fic I read years ago. It's a fic where Harry has black wings and can open portals. He ends up on another world which turns out to be where James Potter came from. He bonds? To another member of his species who has white wings who can heal? Any help would be very much appreciated. Thanks all.

  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.
