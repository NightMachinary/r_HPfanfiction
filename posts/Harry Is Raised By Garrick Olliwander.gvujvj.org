Harrys primary school teacher takes them to a school trip to Kingley Vale trail. during the trip harry accidentally triggers a ward protecting a magical yew tree that is the property of Ollivander family.

Thinking thieves are after his prized wandwoods, Ollivander apparates to the vale, with a curse on the tip of his wand, only to discover what he thinks is a mugleborn boy. He adopts harry after learning that he lives in a cupboard, and teaches him all about wandlore. Harry becomes a summertime assistant at Ollivanders shop.


** This is kind of bothering me: it's Ollivander not Olliwander.

** Fair warning: this story /is/ dead (last update was 3.5 years ago), /but/ it's still really good, and I totally recommend you check it out, all the same.

  When Harry was left on the Dursley's doorstep, Petunia quickly realised he couldn't stay. Where else to leave him but with the very person who'd first lured her sister into the magical world all those years ago? With a very different upbringing on Diagon Alley, it's not exactly the same Harry that arrives at Hogwarts ten years later.

  Char. Ooc, AU/AR, still within JK's world - Harry is apprenticed to a Diagon Alley businessman at the tender age of seven. From there the story changes... very mild bashing of some regulars.
