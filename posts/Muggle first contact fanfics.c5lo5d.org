Anybody know of any stories like that? like first contact, but instead of aliens, its with muggles. maybe the statue of secrecy finally gets a hole punched in it that is too big to plug, and the magical world is forced to talk or negotiate with the muggle world. or there is a new enemy that they must fight together?

‚Äã

Maybe its post first contact, and the wizards and muggles are trying to figure out how to integrate magic and technology in new and innovative ways.

‚Äã

first time in this sub, so I'm still trying to find my way around.


** There's an idea I've had for a while but haven't gotten around to writing it...

A smart!Harry with a passion for rocket science goes to Hogwarts, messes around with adding rockets to his broom, etc. Eventually he realizes that the status quo isn't sustainable since muggles make much faster progress (1000√ó higher population = much more researchers and investors) and eventually the statute will fail and it won't go well, so he creates a plan to peacefully unite the worlds.

A few years after defeating Voldemort and graduating Hogwarts he starts experimenting with getting enchanted rockets to space, exploring the solar system, developing FTL from space-warping magic and extracting gold from asteroids. Later he'll build an armada of spaceships running on magic disguised as alien technology and fakes an alien invasion of earth.

After it turns out that muggle weapons don't work against alien shields, aliens aren't affected by muggle repelling charms and can attack magical locations and while spells can destroy the UFOs wizards can't fight effectively since they are way faster than brooms or spells, Harry demonstrates that an enchanted fighter jet works (in a staged attack) and starts a movement to get both worlds to work together to fight the aliens.

After the alien spaceships are all defeated, hints are found that while the attack on the main mothership immediately destroyed the alien's (fake) FTL drive and communications, they were able to send a radio signal to their home planet requesting help from a much larger fleet that will arrive 50 years later (once the signal reaches the home planet), forcing humanity to quickly develop their own fleet to defend earth, using magic and technology combined.

After a few decades they are surprised that the big alien invasion never arrives, but by then humanity already has conquered most of the stellar neighborhood and magic and technology are intertwined into one thing, and thanks to latest genetic engineering efforts every newborn has magic.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

**** Weird enough that I haven't finished it, so I cannot explain you what happened later. I think some super-spiritual and god-like creatures happen or something. However, perhaps I was unjust.

** I remember reading a story on LiveJournal where someone (DE's?) sends nukes towards the UK and wizards stop it, leading to lots of people knowing about the wizarding world. I sadly cannot remember the author, I have been trying to find that story again myself for some time.

*** I'd have to respectfully disagree. Though individually, wizards are stronger than muggles, the muggles have much more numbers, so they can always just overwhelmed the wizards with numbers. zergrush is a valid military strategy lol.

Most technology might not work within a magical place, but im guessing that simple enough devices still work, such as cross bows and even guns. If not, they can still be bombarded from miles away by hundreds or even thousands of artillery units at a time.

Now, the wizards are still powerful, and we don't know what they'll pull out of their collective asses, so the right might be a little closer than most think

**** I don't think it would be like extinction. But wizards could collapse muggle governments without too much difficulty by imperious and assassination of leaders. If power went out a huge portion of a countries population would die. As well as how are wizards going to be found? If they stay behind wards muggles couldn't find them and what are they gonna do bomb EVERYWHERE in hopes of hitting a wizard?
