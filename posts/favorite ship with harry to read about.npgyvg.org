  Harry is doing quite alright after the war. He's not going back to Hogwarts, but it's not like anyone can blame him for not going back to where he died, and he's still getting his NEWTs remotely. He's fine, he's busy renovating his house and getting rid of all the unsavory bits of magic scattered all over the place, and he doesn't really need anyone's help. Except, Narcissa Malfoy is suddenly there, week after week to make sure he doesn't destroy her family's legacy, and then she keeps coming back even after Harry's done with the place. Somehow they become friends? Harry has no idea how that happened, but he decides he likes it very much. Likes her maybe a bit more than that, too.

** Time Travel Harry/Bella is probably my favourite but there are extremely few fics with it. Because of that, I'm okay with most girls.

BUT:

- I'd rather avoid H/Hr. I don't hate Hermione, it's only that those fics are usually boooring.

- no harem. I won't read harem under any circumstances at all

- no Ginny, no Lavender, neither of the Patil girls, no Parkinson and no OC. OC is usually a SI and I'd rather watch grass grow than read a SI fic.

** I'm not into slash at all, so the pairings like Harry/Malfoy are a no-go for me.

The more unusual the girl he's with, the more I'm interested. Unfortunately, a lot of the more under-used girls are merely used as props in shitty harem stories. :(

I'm put off by Harry/Hermione due to how repetitive it can be (especially since it's a staple of Indie-Harry cliche-fests), but I'd be happy to read a fic that has him with Hermione or Ginny if it's well-written and unusual -- L, L, & LL's earlier chapters/premise of her and Harry being thieves and just stealing people's shit and acting like a cute married couple, for example.

I *love* Harry/Katie. Unfortunately, she's typically used just as one of three props in a shitty harem story (with Angelina and Alicia).

I like Daphne Greengrass too, but... sigh, the Ice Queen thing has become her de facto character for people. She's a cookie-cutter character now, instead of being a blank slate with a few canonical/extrapolated details people can use to write their "own" Daphne Greengrass (it's why I love subversion like where she's a ditz, or just a regular girl, as thick as two short planks, can talk to turtles, or is a chatterbox). Originality, people! Come on!

Harry/Gabrielle is another pairing I'm becoming more interested in -- no, not when she's eight and Harry's fourteen (unless the author "up-ages" her, but then again that's just an OC with her name/face by then, or only if it's a sibling-like thing they develop and not a pairing), but when they're both older -- there's a recent fic where an underachieving, nineteen year old Gabrielle hates being in Fleur's shadow post-War, and she's set her eyes on Harry. It's a fascinating story that gives her depth. I forgot the name, though: Something Sororicide?

Harry/Lavender when she's not some Mary Sue "seer" or when she has more depth than a frying pan. Yes, I know that includes canon Lavender, haha.

Harry/Luna, when she's not some "seer" or other bullshit.

  I like Daphne Greengrass too, but... sigh, the Ice Queen thing has become her de facto character for people. She's a cookie-cutter character now, instead of being a blank slate with a few canonical/extrapolated details people can use to write their "own" Daphne Greengrass (it's why I love subversion like where she's a ditz, or just a regular girl, as thick as two short planks, can talk to turtles, or is a chatterbox). Originality, people! Come on!
#+end_quote

I avoid romance like the plague nowadays, but I find that the former, when written well, combines the best parts of Cho and Ginny as characters.

I kinda agree with Daphne as written in fanfiction. It's refreshing to read a not super intelligent love interest.

**** There have been a few great portrayals of her: I can't remember names, but there was one where she was just a regular girl trying to win over Harry's (suspicious) friends due to the stigma of being a Slytherin (it had Hermione feeling jealous after she realized she was in love with Harry) in their Sixth:

One where she was sort of "not there" in the head and was obsessed with ice-cream -- Astoria helped set her and Harry up in that little sister way:

Another where the Greengrass family curse hits her another way -- basically, she's not dying like Astoria, but she can only be perceived by one or two people in her life, and one of those rare people just happens to be Harry. Other people just sort of forget she's there/her identity, like she's under the perception filter from Doctor Who.

That's the sort of originality I like to see, personally; not just a "lulz super intelligent political lady at thirteen/fourteen/fifteen/sixteen".

** Basically, anything different.

Hermione, Ginny/-ew,/ Fleur, and even Daphne are getting too basic nowadays for me.

I love Tonks, Astoria, and Luna. Unfortunately those are few and far between, or are harem fics, which are usually garbage.

Bellatrix can be interesting, but it's usually a harem for those stories too.

I also like muggle pairings- when it's not obviously a self insert.

And something I would love to see is a throuple with the Weasley twins. Either a fem!Harry or Fem!Twins because I honestly don't see Harry being into dudes. Not dissing it, it just doesn't fit my characterization of Harry.

The twins though, I could honestly believe they're bi. Speaking of which, I want a fic where the twins get up to some bi antics. It'd be hilarious.

** There's so much potential for Harry and Ginny that's never realized, it pains me. But at the same time, if I see a Harry/Ginny pairing, I skip over it because their relationship is so...underdeveloped and boring in canon.

I don't read a ton of romantic works, but I love adversarial relationships in Harry's life. They are typically much more interesting and well characterized than romantic subplots- Harry and Draco being constantly at odds yet forced to work together, is a trope I will never tire of. And conflicts between Tom Riddle and Harry can become fascinating internal dramas.

I love romances with teeth for long stories, and fluff for short oneshots.

** Harry/harem, because single pairing stories tend to get boring and samey for me when they're in the hundreds of thousands of words, which is about all I read.

Besides, someone who has had as terrible a childhood as Harry has deserves all the love he can get as far as I'm concerned. Likewise, Harry tends to be humble, selfless, kind, charismatic, wealthy, has a propensity for saving girls, and at least in the stories I like to read, powerful, so it frankly makes no sense to me that only one girl would be attracted to him in a "real" way, so the most realistic way to have a single pairing story would be for multiple women to be attracted to him and fighting over him, with him having to choose one and hurt all the others. Most writers aren't capable of handling that level of drama, and most readers aren't really interested in reading it.

Particular harem members - or single ships in rare cases - I'm fond of would be: Bellatrix Narcissa Tonks Fleur Cho Astoria

I don't really have a problem with any of them, but Hermione, Ginny, and to a lesser extent Daphne and Luna have been done to death, so as a single pairing I'm just not interested in those. I'll read single pairing stories with the Black Sisters, Fleur, Tonks, and Astoria, as most of those are barely ever used so I feel like there's some uniqueness to them.

I'll admit Goblet of Fire is my favorite book in the series, and the one I feel has the most "fanfiction potential," so that's probably why I'm so willing to read Harry / Fleur.
