  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

It's ultimately an H/G fanfic but the Harry/Tracey relationship in this is my favorite H/T in fanfiction.

** Not trying to be rude, but what's the difference between a Harry/Tracey fic and a Harry/Daphne fic? They are both Slytherin girls and other than their names are essentially OCs right?

*** True, though each Slytherin girl, while essentially a blank slate, has had a somewhat general character built up around them. This is especially true for Daphne, because a lot of Harry/Daphne fics, especially older ones, have Daphne filling an "Ice Queen" archetype, though there are a fair number of fics that portray Slytherin girls completely differently. The other blank slate Slytherins, Astoria and Tracey, have some common faan personalities, but not as many as "Ice Queen" Daphne, so people sometimes request Harry with a different Slytherin girl in hopes of getting something other than the more common Daphne characterizations. A somewhat common personality I've seen is for Tracey to be a more bubbly, outgoing character in comparison to Daphne.
