Hi everyone! This is my first post here, I hope I'm doing this right. But I'm a bit desperate -- I've just reread, for the fifth time or something, "The Never-Ending Road" and the unfinished sequel, as well as the slightly AU oneshots the author has up. Now I'm at a loss what to do with myself.

Does anyone know of any stories that are comparable to this one?

In case you don't know TNER, it's basically a very very long (epic!) female!Harry fic, where she will end up with Snape at some point but it's so slow-burn that it's basically gen most of the time. I think in total, counting the sequel, there are at least 600k words to the story. I'm not necessarily looking for something as long, but I'd love something that isn't overly sexualized, slow-burn, romance, ideally Hogwarts-Era or Wartime-Era, and I'd be especially happy if Snape was featured. It doesn't have to have the genderbend aspect at all, and I'm open to all kinds of pairings and characters, I'm just looking for this drawn out romance with feelings that have ample time to grow and lots of interesting, fun, emotional interactions (like Pet Project by Caeria, for example, from the general vibe, but I've unfortunately also read that one also multiple times).

Does someone have an idea what else I could try?\\
(if you don't know the story and don't have any ideas, please take this in part as a rec post. The Never-Ending Road is really really good, and incredibly well written at all times. It's hilarious and emotional and just all-around perfect)

  Severus Snape survived the war and Nagini's bite. He's seriously pissed off about it and lying low at Spinner's End, fearing retribution and the dragging-out-into-the-open of his private life. Until, one day, there is a knock on the door ...

** You should read linkffn(11247748). It's going through the Hogwarts years with Astoria Greengrass as the MC. It's close to 600k words and I don't think fifth year has started yet in the story. The romance is handled differently but I liked reading it. Astoria's character is very interesting because it doesn't really follow fanon depictions. The story follows stages of canon, kinda like TNER, but the overall plot focus is on Slytherin politics and drama. It expands upon the magical world really well. I think you'd enjoy it!

  Astoria Greengrass's war was never black and white. Sometimes you can make them love you, but you can't ever make them fear you. Political drama and Slytherin hijinks abound. Draco/Astoria.
