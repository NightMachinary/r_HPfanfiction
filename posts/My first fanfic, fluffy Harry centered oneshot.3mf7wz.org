** OK, I'll give you a much more detailed criticism than I give myself.

First sentence:

- "woefully uncomfortable moving box" works, but I feel is a bit clunky; "woefully" isn't really a clear descriptor, while "moving box" isn't quite clean nor visual - is it floating, dragging on the ground, going somewhere?
- "surrounded by many more" is, due to the comma, a part of the second part of the sentence. It doesn't quite fit naturally there.
- "as he had just moved" doesn't give the correct timeline - he /was moving/, otherwise, by the time he was sitting on the box it was already done.
- In general, first sentences should be short and punchy. This feels a bit heavy, perhaps it should be split into two.

Example solution:

"Sitting on the first in a line of floating (and extremely uncomfortable looking) crates, Harry was moving to live on his own."

This is a bit simplistic and loses some of the rich vocabulary, but is a cleaner version. "His own flat" is now implied, as it is obvious. The description of the lack of comfort is now less formal, which is a stylistic choice I feel fits better with humor, while the visual cues are a bit more defined.

Second sentence:

- The shift between POV characters isn't quite natural; it works if there is a ping-pong style (one sentence Harry, the next Hermione, then back, and so on). The sentence should either be moved into a paragraph of it's own, or a part that focuses on Hermione's perspective, but it feels out of place here. It is the only Hermione POV sentence in the chapter - it would be better to shift it to Harry's POV.

- The sentence is also the only one that refers to events in the past.

- "Hermione regarded herself as a proud parent at this moment" seems to feel a bit forced, as "at this moment" feels unnecessarily tacked on. A bit of reordering would make it a more integral part of the statement.

- "for she had finally convinced" could do without the "finally".

- The entire second part of the sentence could be implied.

Example solution:

"He noticed Hermione beaming with pride when he spoke of his decision to move out of the Burrow. Actually, she /did/ convince him. And probably thought she was being subtle, but bless her heart, that isn't her at all."

I'd also think that if Hermione will be a main character, perhaps developing this into a short (3-5 sentence) paragraph would be better, and again, keeping it as something from Harry's perspective. It's already nicely hinted that she will (with Harry going for the orange cat first), and this way it would feel more natural when it does.

Third sentence:

- "But of course, no one would tell that." No one would tell what? Why "of course"? Tell whom? Tell what?

- The sentence is an obvious prelude to the next one, and the division into it's own statement adds punch, but it is not clarified properly.

Actually, the entirety of:

"But of course, no one would tell that. Especially Harry, because even though risking your life year after pubescent year seems to the general public like you may or may not have a death wish, Harry really did enjoy living! For the most part of course."

is actually one statement.

While you did split it up, the bulk of it remains in the middle. This is a comedic goldmine; everyone thinking Harry has a death wish because of his adventures. Perhaps you should start with this, and develop the idea into one hilarious paragraph. The idea is great, but again, it is not fully developed and feels out of place.

--------------

"Touche brain. Touche."

"Are you talking to yourself there, mate?"

"..."

"That's what I bloody thought. Get yourself a cat or something, at least make the craziness into a tangible warning sign."

"Although I could do without the sass, that's a bloody brilliant idea! Huh. I never noticed how Ron-like my train of thought seems to be. Well, up and at'em!"

This back and forth contains an implied conversation... but is it out loud, or is Harry thinking to himself? Is there a second person? Why does it start with "Touche", when the previous paragraph does not describe Harry's thoughts but rather outside circumstance?

--------------

Third part, first sentence:

- "stretched" and "lengthening" create a redundancy; both point to the same action, and do it in different tenses. It just adds some confusion and complexity where it isn't needed.

- 6'1" is an American measurement. 1.85 is the European equivalent. Either way, specifying his height creates a redundancy with "lanky". I'd remove this and just keep the "lanky", as this is a very descriptive word that adds a lot of character.

- "quite lanky" makes "quite" a bad choice. "not quite lanky" (in case you meant nearly lanky) or "modestly lanky" (in case you meant he was actually lanky but not overly so), or just "lanky" would be better.

Harry patted his muggle jeans, searching for his wand and found it stuck in his back pocket. He could practically hear Moody now, from beyond the grave. Second/third sentences:

- "muggle jeans" is redundant, unless there is such a thing as "magical jeans" (which sounds kind of awesome).

- the comma is misplaced, or creates a illogical division. Searching for the wand is of the first part, but it is set in the second - making the first part feel unnecessary.

- "practically hear" is is overly complicated. Just "hear" would be better.

- "from beyond the grave" does not need to be divided from the earlier part of the sentence.

- Also, the second sentence is a nice place for a bit more direct comedy.

Example solution:

"Concluding a short search for his wand (well, less "search" and more "awkward patting of jeans"), Harry found it in his back pocket. He could nearly hear Alastor Moody rolling in his grave."

--------------

Oh my, this is already longer than what you wrote by quite a bit, and I'm kind of running out of time. I might continue later, but you get the point; it gets kind of repetitive. Perhaps it is more towards my taste (a more stereotypical male narrative style), but I feel the points are valid. Hope I've been of some help.

** Not going into writing here, but I just want you to give me a bit more context I guess. Why is the cat important enough to tell a story about it? Does it connect Harry to something? Even one-shots can be important and ask questions about the fandom.

Anywho I'm drunk and it's 6 am so this probably made no sense, but I want to know more about the cat. Not just pet, purr, I own a cat.
