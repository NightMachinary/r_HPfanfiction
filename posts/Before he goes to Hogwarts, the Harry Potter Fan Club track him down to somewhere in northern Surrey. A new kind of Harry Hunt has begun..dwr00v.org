** This old music video is all I can think of for this prompt. Thus old UK jam is from 'Studio B' called "I see Girls". Warning: it contains a multitude of bikini clad ladies "hunting" for the gentleman. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UCupN4wSoc]]

** Interesting idea, though i feel like the fan club is something that really got started after second year at the earliest since that is after he save one of his biggest fans. lol

Before Hogwarts Harry was just really a story that people told their kids (though I guess if you really tried you might able to do something with that), If anything i'd expect people finding out where he lives and spilling the beans, since it /is/ cannon that at least one wizard comes across him when he is out with his aunt, that wizard is also one of the people at greats Harry in the Leaky Cauldron as well.

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
