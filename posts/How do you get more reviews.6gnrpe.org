****** It rather shouldn't be necessary to include the information about ratings in the summary. If you must, to the author's notes it goes, but it's not really necessary unless it's specifically to assure your readers that none of the other possible things that could cause it to have that rating are there. Also, if you are writing a story with dark Harry it's not too difficult to do other things that the M rating is for, so that particular piece of information may stop being true as you continue writing unless you really know what you are doing.

On a random note, I congratulate you for the proper usage of an ellipsis; a great many people include a space after it but not before it, whereas the standards are either no spaces at all (what you have) or a space both before and after. And no, I am not being sarcastic here, it's quite refreshing to see the thing used properly actually.

And on another random note, when I scrolled up and read that the previous attempt at the summary had “HP/DG” in it, my first thought was “hmm, Harry Potter and ... Draco ... Granger?”, which shows that I need sleep but which you may also find funny

******** With a dark Harry story, it is very easy to forget that you aimed for a lower rating and, getting lost in the heat of the moment, make a scene a bit too graphic. Any scenes of violence that are ... well, really, any kind of graphic at all, are already a reason to put the story into the M rating cupboard. While that isn't bad in itself, because there are a lot of delightful stories with the rating and as such only people new to it and those who just don't want to see graphic bits will avoid it so there isn't much of a reason to avoid it, when you want to aim for a lower rating---or, as it is in your case, for a situation where it is supposed to only be given that rating for a single other reason---it can potentially be a nightmare.

** Step one is to realise that people only really review for two reasons:

1. If there's something they're itching to say.

2. To ask you to update.

A long list of "update please!" is boring so let's say you're asking about how to increase substantive reviews.

The main reason for someone to have something to say is if they want to share their opinion. So, what kinds of opinions do people want to share in reviews?

- Advocacy for a pairing.

- Disagreement with your interpretation of canon.

- Disagreement over something a character has done or said.

- Disagreement with something you wrote in an author's note.

So, if you want to maximise reviews:

- Make the pairing of your story ambiguous and tease multiple possible pairings.

- Use your story to elaborate upon canon in specific ways e.g. by including some magical theory.

- Include interesting and controversial themes in your story for the characters to discuss/act upon e.g. moral dilemmas, political disagreements, issues of discrimination and justice, etc.

- Write controversial author's notes.

All of this is subject to a relatively obvious caveat: people can only review these things if they have read your fic to begin with. So either write well or write popular tropes.

** Insofar as I've noted, these things have the greatest effects upon reviews:

1. Fandom. Fandoms that have more stories tend to get more reviews, as a general rule of thumb. I've found stories worthy of professional publication in obscure fandoms, but with only a handful of reviews. Conversely, many of the very popular fics (especially in anime fandoms) are trash.

2. Shipping/Pairing. Stories that have romance (and sex) in them tend to get a greater number of views/reviews. In particular, pairings that are rarely written but disproportionately popular (pairings such as Harry/Fleur, Harry/Daphne, Harry/Bellatrix) tend to get more reviews than a fic that is otherwise identical. People like to whine about or praise them in the comments.

3. Length. Longer fics tend to garner more reviews. Many people filter fics by length beginning at 40k+ words.

4. AGE. I CANNOT emphasize this one enough. Some of the fics you are comparing yours to may well be as much as ten years old, or older. In that time, they will have garnered an obscene number of reviews, if they are worth reading at all. It should also be noted that I've found people tend to be more stingy with reviews nowadays, probably because of the mobile app.

5. Start your fic out as a T fic, and then shift it up to M a good ways in, in order to maximize readerbase.

6. Over-powered Main Character. For reasons incomprehensible to me, this attracts more people than actually writing a fic well. Lord Potter ones are especially popular, though they are sneered at by any self-respecting reader.

Those are the main things that reliably influence reviews. Some stories have lots of reviews but low follows/favs because they have serial followers who review every single chapter.

IMHO, blurbs do not work well as a method of getting reviews. Authors who do so come across (to me, at least) as desperate, or as holding the fic ransom for reviews. There's nothing more likely to make me close the window and never look at the fic or author again.

Some authors do 'review polls', asking people what pairing or fights or characters they would like to see. That seems to work fairly well, but I am of the opinion that it infringes on Fanfiction.net's terms of publication for stories.

**** I feel that there is a big potential to writing as you go in the form of overgrown quests. Of course, that requires much bigger commitment and thought that shipping poll.

The Matou Shinji series that I recommend here often is like that, and the unpredictability it brings is one of the main hooks for me. After all, if readers screw up Shinji may die, Harry may die, Voldemort may win. Nobody is safe, nothing is predetermined. Unfortunately, I don't know anything else like that.

***** In the form of a quest it works, indeed. You can't really write it otherwise anyway (I mean, except if you're willing to plan out every possibility, which seems a colossal work, and you don't give the readers the opportunity to propose their own options).

The thing is, something you plan out well will always be better, you can notice and correct mistakes that otherwise would become apparent only chapters later, for instance. In the case of a quest, you sacrifice that for interactivity. It's not necessarily bad, it's just a different beast.

You can find quests on spacebattles.com or sufficientvelocity.com if you care to register. I couldn't recommend any though, I'm not reading that stuff at the moment, and it's time sensitive if you want to participate.

On SV, The First Law is a PMMM crossover with Sally-Anne Perks becoming a Puella Magi after a Dementor tries to kiss her Squib mother. /Highly/ recommended.

Also on SV, Tale of a Shattered Soul follows Riddle's horcrux starting from when Ginny writes in the Diary.

The Next Great Adventure follows an Artificer Harry that becomes a "solver of problems of various sorts" after Ginny dies during the final battle.

Peeking into SB, there's a new "Anti-Quest" that advertises itself as being about putting obstacles in the protagonist's path, On the Path to Greatness, but I've not read it yet.

Actually, it is a good idea, people like to talk about the stories they like.

But if you want to make you story interactive, you should write a quest from the start. Hybrids don't work so well in my experience as a reader.

If you just want the review count of the story to go up regardless of the quality of the reviews (or lack of it, as it is wont to be) then just posting the link everywhere that kids and teenagers congregate will work. Pardon me for potentially being rude, though, but that's kind of a ... hmm, sad thing, really; if you are writing good stuff then you should learn how to be proud of what you wrote regardless of how many kids shout “hurray” (though I do acknowledge that learning that can be difficult).

**** Going to the critic circles it is, then. While I cannot vouch for them in any capacity as I am not a part of it and some people from it rub me in the wrong way, “Dark Lord Potter” (a forum) is one such circle or at least was one such circle so for a lack of other options you can go there. Just be aware that some of their people are outright brutal with criticism, sometimes to the point where outsiders think that they go too far, so if you do go there be aware not to take what they write personally. Another place is here, just promote your story once you have it up and ask for actual reviews and you should get some, I've seen it happen a few times so it's something that happens.
