  The slash circlejerk
#+end_quote

To be fair, it's really hard to have a circlejerk that isn't slash. If Harry, Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus are sitting around their dorm room tugging their meat, it's gonna come off at least a little slashy. Even if everyone keeps their hands to themselves.

** Hyperbole much? There are around 228 thousand HP fics on ao3. When excluding m/m, f/f and multi, you're left with about 104,000. Of those that remain, about 7,000 are Dramione.

  That being said can we stop with the woe is me slash community is being sidelined blah blah blah, you guys have a far larger presence in FF community than non slash readers.
#+end_quote

Nope. It's almost exactly half: 52% is tagged m/m or f/f. I'm not a huge fan of explicit slash, but honestly? There's well over a hundred thousand fics left after removing slash and harems: I do just fine finding things to read.

To everyone else? You do you. Nobody has the right to judge you for what you wanna read, and those that do can fuck right off.

** I don't understand why this has to be made to a problem, as long as everyone has something they enjoy to read. For some reason, I personally find het smut awkward to read. So I don't read it. I also tend to stay away from Harry and Draco together. So I don't read it unless the plot looks very promising. I won't even touch a story with Harry and Voldemort on it in any erotic way.

I understand that a lot people enjoy reading and writing the kind of stories that I don't like. I am happy for them and read what I like without judging other people. After all, why would their enjoyment bother mine?

Isn't it wonderful that there's a big community that produces great works to read?

** I get you on this and I actually enjoy reading slash. Just not all the time. I like to read different things depending on my moods and finding a slash that isn't Drarry or a no slash fic is incredibly difficult. Especially once you factor in what sort of theme and plot you're looking for along with the pairing. So finding a good, non-slash fic with the theme and genre I want is very difficult. So is finding a good slash fic that isn't drarry (I don't really read drarry unless it has fairly au)

** If anyone thinks that it's not really true - try praising heterosexual harem stories on some discussion thread, and then try the same with some regular slash, see which one will work out better for you.

I mean, whatever floats your boat and somesuch, but really, of all the places and communities you can find on the internet fanfic community is the last where you'd find homophobia in general, and one where you definitely won't find systemic discrimination - so, you know, the one that actaully matters more than someone calling you gay or giving a downvote

** The thing about FF is that it's an opportunity for people who find themselves misrepresented to remedy that. Like let's face it the original Harry Potter books had very little good representation. Jkr basically relies on the fact that the story is set in a general location "Hogwarts is an entire school there are obviously xyz students"- like thanks as if that made me feel better; I still didn't get to see myself as a powerful character like everyone else. So I think acknowlding that is important when criticizing the amount of slash fics. Also why do you have a problem reading fics that involve slash? I would understand not wanting a romantic slash fic since that's not your vibe, but a well put together story that happens to have slash as the main pairing? Why is that boring/tired/a problem?

Its wonderful to see so much representation but sometimes it is poorly executed that it becomes offensive.

I cannot read a black Harry or Hermione because it not who they are.

I can read a gay Harry or Hermione as there has to be circumstances as to why they are different o cannon. Not out of the blue.

Most representation such as Indian Harry is poor and offends people as it is just trying to appease the audience, that's why Balck Hermione I think is stupid.

** I want people to be able to read and write whatever they want. The only thing that irks me is the high-and-mighty attitude of some readers who claim avoiding slash is homophobic.

In most slash, the plot only exists as a vehicle for the ultimate goal of two attractive guys hooking up, because that's what the author - usually a young woman - finds hot. *And that's totally fine!* Only, let's not pretend it is something it is not. Slash-only readers read slash because it tickles their fancy, just like harem readers read harems because it tickles theirs - not because they're serious about exploring LGBTQ relationships or polyamory, respectively.

** 1. There are about as many slash fics as gen/het fics.

2. Though some slash has Harry paired with Death Eaters or is poorly written, a lot of slash fics are well written and has a pairing with a “good” or “neutral” character (though I do not mind a well-written “redeemed” character pairing).

3. I read slash because, as an LGBTQ+ person, I like feeling represented in a story and being able to relate more to the characters. That is one of the main reasons I read fanfiction --- there is not that type of representation in most books.

** lmao I was literally thinking about writing a post like this last night but got lazy. Totally agreed. The number of Harry/Draco fics is more than the amount of Harry/Hermione and Harry/Ginny fics COMBINED. If I go to ffnet and search for fics, and filter out Harry/Draco and Harry/Snape, the majority of fics will still be Harry/Voldemort, and you can't filter out three pairings. It's become impossible to find a good fic to read because of it, the only options are recs or scryer. But you come on this subreddit and every week there's someone complaining about how they feel like a second class citizen because they have the audacity to like slash and someone downvoted them.

Like yeah, people have resorted to putting NO SLASH in their summaries because of the overwhelming amount of slash fics you have to sift through to find het fics. Somehow this is now also a bad thing because how dare they.

** I don't have anything against homosexuals who are trying to resolve/analyze/think about their situation in a fanfic story. However, I have two pet peeves.

a) There are roughly 4% (more or less, exact number is not important for my point) of homosexuals etc. in the population. Why then there are stories where like everybody is in some kind of weird non-heterosexual (or at least it must be ménage à trois or even more complicated polyamory situation) relationship? I don't have problem if among approx. thousand students at Hogwarts (or whatever is the number) were forty or so gays, lesbians, etc. Not everybody or almost everybody.

b) I suspect that most slash fanfic stories are actually smut written by heterosexual guys for their own titillation (which is I am afraid even more true about most femslash or fem!Harry). Again nothing much against that, if somebody wants to read, his problem, I don't care, but then they shouldn't pretend it is an honest testimony of the oppressed minority etc. It is just a different type of porn.
