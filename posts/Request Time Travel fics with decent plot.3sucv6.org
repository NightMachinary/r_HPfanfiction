I already read linkffn(2636963) (shame it's so rarely updated) and linkffn(4101650) and it's sequels and I liked both, in different ways. I know that there are a LOT of clich√©-based time travel fics out there that don't add anything meaningful to read, so anything out of ordinary is good in my book, as long as it's well written. Looking primarily for Harry/Ron/Hermione/Ginny time travels in any combination.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

***** I really enjoy the portrayal of slytherin!harry and the descriptions of slytherin politics. It's been a little while since I read the first two, but it's a fun read. It might not be "great" by most people's standards but I'm not very critical. It's not an award winning piece of literature, but it does some interesting things with time travel and the inner workings of slytherin house. I'd recommend reading it, but it might not be your cup of tea, personally, I enjoyed it quite a bit and I'm looking forward to the next chapter.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** *A Second Chance*, linkffn(5251301), sends Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Neville, and Luna back to their first year. The heroes are a little overpowered, but there is a twist later.

*Ginny Returns*, linkffn(4740107), only sends Ginny back after everything was lost. She got rid of Voldemort in a very efficient and non overpowered way.

*Here and There*, linkffn(7525570), Hermione/Ginny femme slash, time turner travel; the story is actually quite good apart from an illogically overpowered Fenrir Greyback at the end

** A time-travel fic that doesn't really fit your last criterion, but is fantastically written nonetheless, is linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty). The pairing is a very convincing Bellamione.

  Are Murderers born? Or are they made? When Hermione is sent to the past she is forced to become acquainted with someone she knew she'd hate for the rest of her life. Rated M for later chapters.
