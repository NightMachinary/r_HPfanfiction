  In which James Potter isn't as dead as everyone thought and Harry has a strong mistrust of all adults.Reconnecting with his son isn't going to be easy, not just because Harry's in Slytherin.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.
