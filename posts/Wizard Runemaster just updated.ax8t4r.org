For those who are not familiar with this story, this is a crossover of Harry Potter and the Warcraft universe. This is a great story for those who played vanilla WoW and like the night elves, draenei and the forsaken(especially Sylvanas).

  A Weapon. A Hero. But now... a loose end. Harry Potter resolves to destroy the enemies who betrayed him on his terms, only to find all his plans torn asunder when he's summoned to a new world plagued with the same enemies as his own.

*** It explains quite a lot in the story so you shouldn't have a problem following along, for a more enjoyable experience you can type in the big names in google to have a visual representation to aid you picturing the characters in your mind.
