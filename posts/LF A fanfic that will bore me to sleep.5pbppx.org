Lately I have been having trouble sleeping due to getting caught up in fics (to finish Traveler I stayed awake for 27 hours). For eg. atm it is 4:26am and I'm really regretting having a reread of Too Young to Die.

To stop this, I've now decided to find fics that are good enough to be readable and worth continuing, but dreary and lackluster to force me to sleep.

Please help!

Fics mentioned: linkffn(Traveler) an absolute behemoth of a Pokemon fic, but so worth the read. linkffn(Too Young to Die) One of the best Dark!Harry stories, where his brother being the BWL actually works well with the writing.

PS: No HPMOR or Robst, I asked for fics to help me sleep, not torture methods.


** Boy, have I got the perfect fic for you.

*** A lot of Harry/Fleur seem to have that problem. Either it's 150k words of build up and then 50k words of first dates and slowly dancing around each other followed by 10k words of resolution or they are shagging in chapter 3.

Harry/Tonks is usually better paced although I cannot figure out why.

** Linkffn(a new kind of normal by Brilliantlady) is focused on long character interactions between age-appropriate 11year olds and very little action. It requires continuous energy to stay engaged in the story.

*i actually like the series but if you're sleepy it will definitely help with that.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
