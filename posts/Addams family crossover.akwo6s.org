Are there any good ones? Like a Wednesday meets Draco or Harry? Maybe one where the Addams are wizards?

  He's done it. He's just five years old, but he's finally done it. The Dursleys are gone. And now he's with a new family who seems just as twisted as he is. How strange.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

  “Oh, Gomez,” Morticia said as she folded her hands under her chin “to be as free as a child, to be able to rage so well” Her eyes clouded over with fond memories of deathly pranks and sunny sisters. Gomez crawled on his knees, glass shards and wood chips tearing at his suit and skin. He wrapped his arms around his beloved's legs and kissed her exposed thigh.“Such rage, such passion,” he agreed breathlessly as the baby's cries got louder and louder. “We must take it with us.” Morticia decided, swathed in black rags and moonlight, “he reeks of death, and darkness. He will be an Addams.” It was time to go home.

***** I have started doing that. And I use Archive of Our Own bookmarks to do that. You can bookmark external links (like FF.net) to those, as well as download files from the archive.

I think I'll ask the author via AO3 for that story. There are still stories there by the author.

** Tenhawk wrote a fic that still updated on occasion called Alexander and the Shadow Council. It has Xander Harris at 11 getting into Hogwarts due to his family history along the way he meets Wednesday Adams who is going to Hogwarts also. It is in the summer of year 5 its a long read but pretty entertaining. He used to have a site but its no longer available but you can still get it off his yahoo group at TH_Presents. It is a VERY long read though. But pretty good overall. The fic features Xander, Wednesday Adams, Padma Patil and Harry Potter as the primary protagonists.
