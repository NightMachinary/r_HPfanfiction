So after coming across the request: What if: Pettigrew didn't betray the Potters by banterminator, I thought further with the question.

What if Pettigrew wasn't a spy? Or what if Severus never heard of the prophecy? Or what if Voldemort didn't believe in the prophecy? Or what if the Prophecy was never even made? Say Voldemort or a Death Eater killed Trelawney before the prophecy was made.

So many things would have changed. Neville or Harry wouldn't have been marked. The Potter's and the Longbottoms would have survived. Sirius and Remus along with his parents would have been in Harry's life.

Harry would have been pretty much the normal boy that he had always wanted to be in canon.

Voldemort made his mistake by listening to the prophecy, in my opinion he made a self-fulfilling prophecy. So what if he either didn't hear about it or didn't believe in it?

I would love to see what changes would happen if Harry or Neville was never made into his equal.

I would love to see James and Lily, Frank and Alice, Sirius and Remus being in the kids respective lives.

If anyone could write it I'd appreciate it. (Note please no Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione just because they've been done to death).


** Or Lord Voldemort continues on a reign of terror and kills off all the aforementioned characters in battle and then decides to off the war orphans too, because they'll just grow up resentful under his rule and try to revolt which is really too much of a hassle.

He would then complete his horcrux based transformation into the Galactic Emperor Lord Frieza and head off to find the Dragon Balls on Namek to come up with an easier, more guaranteed immortality.

*** Well that's what fanfiction is for, to creating interesting AU's. I don't expect the new world that Harry and co would live in if the prophecy was never heard of/or believed in to be perfect after all.

**** Except that's exactly how you phrased it. You took arbitrary events from the stories and essentially say 'if X doesn't happen Harry has a happy family with his parents and their friends' which there is literally no way of knowing.

In fact, if, say, Pettigrew isn't a spy. Then it's unlikely the Potter's go into hiding because they went into Hiding purely because Dumbledore thought someone was spying on them. Dumbledore doesn't likely get that suspicion if no one actually is spying on them.

If the Potter's don't go into hiding then there's still a war going on and from what we know of James and Sirius they likely want to fight. They're opposing a Dark Wizard that was so frightening a decade after his believed death people still won't say his name. We know that Voldemort handily beat James in, arguably, a battlefield of James's choosing.

Likely James and Sirius, and possibly even Remus and Lily, encounter Voldemort in a place where they're at even less likely to be successful.

The 'Likely Scenario' if Voldemort doesn't hear the prophecy is that the good guys lose. We're presented with a world where they are not only losing, but losing badly and have no idea how to fight. And then they only win on a miracle. Voldemort is the Detroit Lions in 2015 and Baby Harry Potter is Aaron Rodgers standing on his own 40 yard line with no time left on the clock.

Yet your scenario you immediately go into is immediately a big happy family. Harry likely only gets any semblance of a family precisely because Voldemort tries to kill him as a baby. If he doesn't, there's a very good chance that everyone you mention would be killed violently in the coming months and years.

The idea that if you change one event everything else goes to the better often ignores the context of the other events around it. And there's always a chance, and a chance that I'd argue is far greater, that the events that change would be worse.

A far more interesting idea is to (and I'm going to vomit in my mouth here because time travel as a premise is stupid) see how much better the world is precisely because only James and Lily died and having Harry contemplate if he would rather live in a world where he had parents, or a world where the Weasley's and Hermione still exist precisely because his parents died for him, playing off Great and Terrible things.

You immediately go on to say 'have all these people who are fighting a losing war in their lives' but do not present a 'what if' scenario that would logically lead to those people actually surviving said war.

And we can go even further down the rabbit hole? What happens if Snape doesn't hear the prophecy? Well Snape at twenty seems to be a coward. Even Dumbledore points out that he isn't concerned about James or Harry Potter and only with Lily. In his own screwed up psyche he sees James as the thing that's keeping Lily from him. So he likely still tries to find a way to get Voldemort to kill James so he can have a chance at Lily. Because the text literally presents his only qualm about Voldemort's actions that he will not be able to be with Lily. He literally says this to Dumbledore in fewer words. He knowingly sent Voldemort to kill James and Harry precisely because he thought Lily would survive. Through all of that he still thought he'd have a chance at Lily. And that's, well, sad and pathetic.

***** Apologies, I didn't mean to make it sound as though I expected a happy family, that was not my intention at all.

I just meant that Harry's family life would likely be better then it was at the Dursley's. I still expect James, Lily, Frank, Alice and even Sirius and Remus to fight the war, possibly even getting hurt or maybe even killed in the process.

That could actually be a interesting thing to consider. Say Lily is killed protecting some people, how would it affect the family? That is what's so great about fanfiction, you have a number of different ways it could go. Say Lily is killed but not until Harry is old enough say eleven/twelve or whatever, what kind of dynamics you could go through with Harry and James would be interesting.

Or say Sirius died protecting the Potters or just James, or Remus. The guilt that it could have on them, would be interesting to explore.

Again a lot of different things that could happen. It wouldn't be a utopia, it would still be war. But it would be interesting to see the damage it could have once say Harry is older.

But that's just my thoughts on it, I think way too much on possible scenerios, apologies if it didn't seem like I was thinking things logically or made it seem like it was a utopia because that not my intention. I just didn't want to post a long as heck paragraph on my thoughts; which I figured would be too boring to read. (As I'm doing the long as heck paragraph now).

*** That is IMO the more likely outcome, since Dumbledore was badly outmatched in the War despite tremendous personal power.

Perhaps Dumbledore would grow desperate and reactivate Grindelwald? There was also the possibility of Dumbledore evacuating Britain with what remained of the Order after Voldemort took over the Ministry.

As for Pettigrew, I don't see him fighting till the end for a losing cause. He would either defect or escape. Maybe in this AU, he simply chose to run away.

** I have to agree with TE7. Any that would have oppose him at that point would have died. Besides Dumbledore of course. /elder wand/. And if Dumbledore did manage to defeat him shorty after Harry was born. I still think the story would be mostly the same. If Harry created a group of friends like James did when he went to school. He would still be the mostly admire like Cedric. And people would look at him as a leader.

On a different note, if Dumbledore failed, there would probably be another magical war.

** Linkffn (Hallowed). There is no Chosen One. I'm not actually sure there's even a prophecy. Harry's parents are still around. Voldemort is still interested in the Potters, but for a different reason. Really, really good.

** Copy pasting my comment from a thread earlier today:

#+begin_quote
  War would have gone on and on. Since it was prophesied that only Harry had power to kill him nobody else could have stopped him.

  Dumbledore, even with Elder wand, barely kept Voldemort at bay.

  There would have been lots and lots of deaths.

Except... we don't know how prophecies work. It might be that the only reason Harry was the one to kill him was /because everyone thought he was the only person who could kill him/.

We have no idea how prophecies work, so it's really down to the individual fic author to decide.

We know from HBP that prophecies aren't proactive, prescriptive or deterministic and that many prophecies are never fulfilled.

*** I agree with, and dare I say magnify, what bewaryoffolly said. Dumbledore's explanation of Prophecies does rather make it sound like the Prophecy only came true because one of the people mentioned in it (Voldemort) /heard/ it.

*** @[--]Sulmil003

Since it was prophesied that only Harry had power to kill him nobody else could have stopped him.

Which is why I'm stating an interesting idea if what if Voldemort never heard the prophecy or what if it was never made. Say Severus never heard it, or a Death Eater killed Trelawney before it was made or he didn't believe in it.

Dumbledore, even with Elder wand, barely kept Voldemort at bay

Are you sure? From my memory of it Dumbledore and Voldemort were pretty even when it came to fighting, heck Dumbledore was the only one that Voldemort truly feared.

There would have been lots and lots of deaths.

And that's where fanfiction comes in, I don't expect the AU to be an Utopia for Harry and co. I still expect Voldemort and the Death Eaters to kill and hurt people who are against them, but with the bonus of James, Lily, Frank, Alice, Sirius and Remus still around it could be interesting to see the differences.
