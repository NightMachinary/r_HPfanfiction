I've read a few stories in which they both are Slytherins, or Harry is one, but don't think I've ever seen one like the title of my request. Does anyone have any recommendations? It would be nice if it was finished or updating regularly, but I'll take what I can get.


** I know of a number of fics like this but only one that I would recommend. (The set of decent fics with Slytherin!Hermione is tiny in the first place.)

linkffn(Labyrinth by Kroontjespen) is decent, but it hasn't been updated in over four years.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle
