Just curious.


** could be fun. I'd like to see "indy" (read idiot) Harry story where Harry accuses him of all sorts of things and manipulations and Dumbledore responds with "you know, Mr. Potter, have it your way. From here on, you are entirely on your own." and just sits back and watches Harry flounder about.

*** Canon! He put a dumb cryptic symbol in a book with no explanation. He also didn't even give a hint about where the sword of gryffindor was, or why he even wanted to give it to them. Also he put it in a frozen lake bottom and just let Harry be a moron and go in to get it. :( Dumbledore really liked watching Harry flounder about in canon. He could have saved years of time by just sitting down and telling him exactly what he needed to do, what he expected him to do at least.

**** I'm not sure if you are sarcastic or if you forgot about canon (kinda hard to tell in writing), so I'll say it just in case, but Dumbledore didn't gave Harry any hint about where the sword of Gryffindor was because . . . he didn't know?

In Canon, Snape kept the sword hidden into the Director office, and brought it to Harry when he was finally able to locate him (thanks to Phineas portrait). He used his Doe patronus to attract Harry outside of his protected campsite, and then guided him to the Sword. I doubt Gryffindor sword spent more than 1 hour in the water but the true question is "Why did Snape put the Sword into a frozen pond (outside of the obvious similarity with the Arthurian legend) ?"

***** From what I am able to Derive from the books, I think even though Snape swore to save Lily's child's life, he never forgot Harry was also James' child and wanted to make his life hellish and take revenge.

***** My best guess for this, and it still seems kind of stupid: we know that Snape didn't want them to figure out what was really going on before time, due to moderate risk of Voldemort legilimizing them.

We also know that Snape, despite ultimately being on the right side, is a prejudiced asscrack who thinks gryffindors are all attention seeking idiots. And that he believes they won't think too hard about something that looks like a quest.

So If he had just dropped it outside their tent, they might think it was a trick or trap or something. But if they see it at the bottom of the frozen lake, it's (to their tiny gryffindor brains,) obviously been moved by some magical being and is part of some great rest.

#+end_quote

because:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúGood. Very good!‚Äù cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the headmaster's chair. ‚ÄúNow, Severus, the sword! Do not forget that *it must be taken under conditions of need and valor* --- and he must not know that you give it! If Voldemort should read Harry's mind and see you acting for him ---‚Äù
#+end_quote

The sword needs to symbolically be taken under conditions of need and valor for the magic to work

#+begin_quote
  He pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured, ‚ÄúAccio Sword.‚Äù

  It did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that easy, the sword would have lain on the ground for him to pick up, not in the depths of a frozen pool. He set off around the circle of ice, thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him. He had been in terrible danger then, and had asked for help.

  Help,‚Äù he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool bottom, indifferent, motionless.

  What was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumbledore had told him the last time he had retrieved the sword? *Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat*. And what were the qualities that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice inside Harry's head answered him: Their daring, nerve, and chivalry set Gryffindors apart.

  Harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air. He knew what he had to do. If he was honest with himself, he had thought it might come to this from the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice.

  He glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced now that nobody was going to attack him. They had had their chance as he walked alone through the forest, had had plenty of opportunity as he examined the pool. The only reason to delay at this point was because the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting.

  With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers of clothing. Where ‚Äúchivalry‚Äù entered into this, he thought ruefully, he was not entirely sure, unless it counted as chivalrous that he was not calling for Hermione to do it in his stead.
