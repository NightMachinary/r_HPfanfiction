** Writing a Star Wars crossover has gotten me deep down the rabbit hole of the use of the pouches on the Jedi utility belt.

I found answers, but man, that is a lot of videos and weird searches later.

** I'm reading some fics where the authors seem to think that the further buried a word is in a thesaurus, the better the word is. My search history (if I didn't use incognito) is filled with archaic words that haven't been used in the UK since the 1600s, never mind the US where I live.
