Hi, I was wondering if anyone had some recommendations for fics with really thought out pureblood society? I'm looking for lots of rules and etiquette and traditions. I'm not looking for any specific characters, but I have read a lot of Harry in Slytherin that's like this and want to branch out a little bit.


** "The Marriage Stone" is a great one (though it's incomplete it's still well-worth the read). The author delves rather deeply into pureblood culture and etiquette. It's Harry/Snape, but I'd definitely recommend reading it even if you aren't a fan of the pairing. It's that good.

Lomonaaeren also wrote a fic called, "There's a Pure-Blood Custom For That," though I've yet to actually read it so can't vouch for it's quality. Her writing is usually pretty solid, though. It's Harry/Draco. She's written several other fics that touch on this to varying extents, as well, such as "Bloody But Unbowed," (H/D) which I remember enjoying immensely. It has a sister fic, which is set from Draco's POV, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4545573/1/For-Their-Unconquerable-Souls][located here]].

I suppose Murkybluematter's (glorious) "Ambiguous Artifice" series also fits the bill. It's gen and features fem!HP. And did I mention that it's glorious?

Oh, and there's Ell Roche/ExcentrykeMuse's *[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=28720]["Of Power and Prestige"]]*, which is some sort of magical Regency AU? Its featured pairing is TMR/fem!HP. It's been pulled from the 'Net but you can still download it.

  Harriet Potter's third year masquerading as a pureblood boy promises to be even more complicated than the last two. All she wants is to get through her studies unimpeded, but with pureblood politics, ancient artifacts, and adolescent hormones getting in the way... well, at least she's up to the challenge. Alanna the Lioness take on HP, book three.
