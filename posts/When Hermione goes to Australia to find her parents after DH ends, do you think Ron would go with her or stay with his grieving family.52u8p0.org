** My personal fanon is that he goes with her /after/ Fred's funeral, not unlike MsBinn's /Australia/. I think, given what we know of Ron, I can't imagine he'd have a great time doing nothing, and being able to help Hermione would, in some capacity, take his mind off of everything going on around him.

** Considering Australia is one of my favorite fics, I like to believe Ron went with Hermione, after Freds funeral. Ron is not one to know how to handle his emotions and I think he would like to get away from his mourning family. Harry wouldn't follow them, since they're a couple now and he would problably want to stay with Ginny. Cause I see no way of Mrs. Wesley letting her go to Australia! She problably didn't want Ron to go either but she didn't have much choice with that.

*** I think Molly would not mind Ron going with Hermione to Australia since she'd consider that makes the trip safer than letting Hermione travel by herself. Being protective goes both ways, after all.

**** That's a good point, especially since I think Hermione has seen just as much of the Weasleys as her own parents over the years.

** Ron would go with Hermione, even if they weren't dating. Staying at the Burrow would only leave him with nothing to do, whereas helping Hermione actively by traveling around the world would be exactly the break he'd need.

*** Devils advocate. Ron is family oriented, and a British pure blood wizard. Leaving to another country, traveling muggle, would be alien. His mother would want him to stay at home with the rest of the family and leaving Britain when he has a brother to bury and mourn would be odd. Ron has always been a 'do what's simple and/ or right' type, and it would be far from his comfort zone.

***** Id say it's a coin toss for hermione. If she can reverse what she did, she might want to do it as soon as possible, these are her parents. And she stole their entire lives away from them. Otherwise she might lollygag and procrastinate the incoming arguments and betrayal (although that seems rather unlike her) plus ' wuv, twue wuv' might hinder her search.

Plus they would likely wait until after the funeral, but the mourning might continue afterwords. Plus Molly is scary and bonkers.

****** Oh, I agree that she wouldn't necessarily wait until they've finished mourning (because you never really finish it, do you?) but like I said, I'd find it odd that she wouldn't stay for the funeral at least.

**** Man, and this is my delimna. Would he stay or would he go? I leaned towards stay at first, because of the things you mentioned here, but then he and Hermione have finally gotten together and maybe he wouldn't want her to go alone? I can't decide!

***** I always imagined it to be a journey she undertook alone. Harry would probably be exhausted/swamped trying to fend off Ministry advances, and between Ron's grief over his brother and the fact that he isn't Muggle, it would be too much to expect he'd blend in without constant hand-holding. Plus, I could see Hermione thinking something along the lines of "I created this, it's my job alone to get them out of it".

** First the funeral, then Australia.

Grangers had been there for a year, a few more days wouldn't hurt.

Saying goodbye to Fred was important for Hermione too.

Plus, buying international plane tickets generally needs 2-3 weeks advance booking, or else they would be hideously expensive.

** The Grangers are in no danger in Australia, so I would imagine that Hermione stayed at Hogwarts to wrap things up before going to get them. The Ministry has to verify that all Death Eaters are dead/imprisoned, and it would be irresponsible of Hermione to go to Australia before the Wizarding World was safe enough for her parents to return to Britain. Just because Voldemort's dead doesn't mean the combatants have stopped fighting- see: the Longbottoms in the first war. And Hermione's family would naturally be a huge target to any surviving Voldemort supporters. She's famously Muggleborn.

I picture Hermione going to get them after a month of cleanup or so. After Hogwarts has rebuilt the most critical sections of the castle, after the Most Wanted list has been up for a few weeks and the Aurors have searched most of the Wizarding world for surviving DEs, after all of the funerals, after she has given depositions about actions of the supporters of Voldemort that she came in contact with during the war, after the emergency appointment or election of a new Minister of Magic, and long enough for Ron to have gone a little stir crazy and want to accompany her to take a break from his family asking him what he's going to do next year.

I also can't see Hermione wanting to go get her parents before the Ministry's Muggleborn laws have been officially repealed, so that means waiting until the government has recovered enough to hold a vote and repeal them instead of an emergency Minister just suspending them. When you're telling your parents that you/your secret magical society has messed up, its best to be able to tell them at the same time how the problems are being fixed.

Whether Harry comes with her, I have no opinion.

*** Harry has much more on his plate than Ron has after the battle though. I mean, he's more likely to be brooding - and blame himself for every single death -, the minister would probably not leave him alone, and he has Ginny to deal with as well. Running off to Australia in the middle of this would just make matters worse...

Ron would be free to go after having attended the funerals of Fred and the Lupins, and he - unlike Harry - would probably appreciate the distraction, as well as spending some quality time with Hermione.

** I love Australia fics because there are so many possibilities and they all seem equally plausible. My headcanon is that Ron and Hermione go after Fred's funeral, but I think it's just as likely that Harry would go to, or that Ron would stay home since he had no contact with his family for much of the past year.

** I always thought he'd stay. Not because of his own wishes, but because he couldn't do that to his own parents and family as a whole. Molly Weasley is as clingy as you can get and I figured that in such a time, she would throw a fit if one of her own was to go to the other side of the world.

My headcanon was that Harry and Hermione went (and that this would provoke the /huge/ row Hermione and Ron would have that lays down some ground rules for their relationship). I always imagined Hermione and Ron to have some real problems in the early stages of their relationship, simply because of their natures. I also have in my head that Harry and Ginny did not find together instantly after the Battle, but that they would chance a fresh start after they both had their healing phase.
