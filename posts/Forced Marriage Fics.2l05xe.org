I'm hoping for recs for fics that involve a marriage law being put into effect. I'd like the main pairing to be Hermione/Draco, Hermione/Harry, Hermione/Remus and Hermione/Sirius. I'm okay with any of the Weasley brothers, other than Ron. The only pairings that I really dislike are Hermione/Death Eater, Hermione/Lucius and Hermione/Snape (that one is the worst). Thanks for your help.

*** Alternate universes. Lots of things could happen after the Department of Mysteries battle. Just go AU 1996 and he's not a death eater. I'm sure there's gotta be some that were even started before HBP came out.

*** Hermione/Draco before he's a Death Eater? I don't know, I haven't read a wide variety of ships, so I've only read like one that includes that pairing.

** Sorry, I didn't mean to be so vague. Draco before, during or after being a Death Eater is fine.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3217498/1/]] A Higher Law. Hermione/Remus. Law affecting werewolves instead of the usual Muggleborn or pureblood laws.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3924523/1/]] Innocence. Hermione/Sirius. " What happens when two people with lives manipulated by the ministry and harmed by pureblood mania decide to fight back? Begins with a marriage law and follows them through their struggles with the wizarding world." (I personally love this one, but characterization is a little off)

** Also, if you go on Fanfiction.net and use the search function, you can narrow by character (choose hermione) and for parameters put marriage law. Some will pop up. Same for archive of our own in the tags =D

** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6776/1][This]] one is way the fuck out of left field, so I could understand why you wouldn't like it. That said, I enjoy the hell out of it. It's a Harry/Hermione story set in the 1800s~, with all the mannerisms you'd expect from a Victorian time period. It's a short, sweet read that I rather enjoyed.
