I've read a lot of these but I need more!

Must be complete, over 100k words, no time travellers please. Can be a marauder fic that heavily includes them though!

Thank you!

  Mr. and Mrs. Evans are killed when Lily's only a girl, and she's supposed to go to a home with her sister. Instead, a relative they didn't know they had comes to collect them, and introduces Lily to manners, magic, and a life that's just the slightest bit different from the life she was supposed to live.Or, an AU in which Minerva McGonagall raises Lily.

** I assume you've read linkffn(The Life and Times) - abandoned, but still 100% worth it, one of my fave L/J fics for the great character development (although it was abandoned before full relationshipping).

Other than that, I find that most of the fics I really enjoy are under 100k, but will throw a few out there anyway in case you're looking for a shorter read. I strongly second [[/u/nashe_airaz]]'s rec for monroeslittle, and adding her other two L/J stories - would especially recommend And The Wolves All Cry. linkffn(8809533; 9506432). They're a bit shorter than you asked for, but so well written that they're worth the read anyway.

A few other <100k but still worth it: linkffn(5823177; 8615508).
