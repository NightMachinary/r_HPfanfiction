:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi I'm looking for a fic that I read about a year ago and I can't for life of me remember the name. I remember that Harry was in Diagon Alley and he is handed a baby by a woman and he has to raise the baby. I also remember that there was fae involved with it. I think it was a creature inheritance fic. I was wondering anybody has read it and could link it to me because I would love to read it again.

**** Just be aware that not only is the sequel abandoned, but the initial story ends very, very abruptly and nothing is really resolved. The completed tag is a lie :(

**** No problem, just a heads up there was a sequel being made for it but unfortunately it seems to be abandoned now.

** There's a fic where Harrry makes a deal with Winter Fae that results in him having a kid and getting screwed over royally later on. It's called "The Denarian Trilogy" by author Shezza. Three of the best fics I've ever read, and structurally superior to most fanfictions.
