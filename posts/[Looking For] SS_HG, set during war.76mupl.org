Looking for something with a similar-ish vibe to linkffn(Sin & Vice by mak5258). Time travel is not a requirement, anything set during the war with an SS/HG pairing would be great!

Thanks!


** OKAY you asked for it. This is my favourite kind of SSHG, so I've got quite a list for you. I see someone else has already given you Second Life, which is fantastic, so I'm not going to repeat that. I notice Camerado is also linked, which is great also. Most of these fics follow the events of HBP and DH quite closely, but some veer way off, which is nice.

The Lioness Prophecies by AMR - is not on a usual archive, but a pdf copy can be found here: [[https://sshgreview.wordpress.com/2017/05/01/the-lioness-prophecies-by-amr/]] or you can PM me for a mobi copy (the formatting on the sshgreview version annoyed the hell out of me). It has a number of Classic Era features (like Pureblood Snape) but was written after HBP, I believe. It's really magnificent and I'd rec it to absolutely anyone.

linkffn(Phoenix Song or, Hermione Granger and the HB P) is a fantastic HBP retelling from Hermione's POV. The story continues in HG and the DH and HG and the Elder Wand. The characterization is truly exquisite and there is an OC that I /love so much/. Plus the trilogy is really super long, so there's that.

linkffn(Angels to Fly by Slytherpouf) I read this yesterday, and it's /fantastic/. Smutty as hell though, so if you're not a fan, maybe this isn't for you...

linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Half-Blood Prince by Story Please) takes place during HBP as well. It has some...complicated consent at the start of the story, which might be problematic for some.

linkao3(Unforced Error by mswitch) is a pretty cool story that's currently being posted. Takes place during the Horcrux hunt, and is fantastic - and will be finished because it's already written.

If you'd like to give me more guidelines, I can be more specific in my recs - do you want stories that parallel canon, or go AU after a certain point, or...Personally I love fics that start in sixth year and parallel canon, because I kind of feel like I'm reading the secret canon, you know?

  Forced to give Hermione Granger private lessons, Snape soon finds himself desiring something he cannot have, and it begins to consume him. He looks to escape, but the endgame has been Seen and there is nothing that Severus can do to change his fate. Is there? Bit of drama, a bit of angst, a little twisted romance and of course some sexy. *NOW COMPLETE*

  Draco has a mission. It's too bad that Snape pisses him off. A comedy of errors begins to unfold, with plenty of sexual tension, longing and...other types of fun behind closed doors. This story is the proof that you really shouldn't mix different potions together without knowing what you're doing. And sometimes you find what you were looking for after thinking it lost forever.

Strangely linked to this incident is Severus Snape, who died in the Shrieking Shack. Or did he? When Hermione Granger is pulled into the investigation, she discovers the unimaginably dangerous truth.

**** Ummm, I don't think I've read one of those, actually. I mean there is one where they're both faffing about in time, which is this one:

linkffn(The Consequences of Meddling with Time by Beaweasley2)

It's quite good actually - the premise is that Hermione messed up a jump in third year, got attacked, came back, and died - and ruined /everything/. So Snape goes back to tell his past self to hide her so that she doesn't die, and things sort of snowball from there.

I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I'm not sure whether it's what you're looking for.

Beaweasley2 also wrote linkffn(The Plight-Trothed Bride by Beaweasley2) which was...I mean, it was good, but the Snape was /such an utter titweasel/ you wouldn't /believe/ it. I mean, aaaargh, I can't even explain it properly - suffice to say that while Hermione thinks he loves her by the end, and he never says otherwise in his POV chapters, I'm not sure if he actually does love her, or is just pretending to because she refused to be treated like a call girl any longer. He improves, but for quite a while there he reminded me of a Ms_Figg Snape.

Oh, and linkffn(The Young Adventurers Club) has them both time travelling. The plot is quite complicated and I don't want to spoil anything, but it's really quite good despite the fact that the Hermione is heading a little bit for Mary Sue territory.
