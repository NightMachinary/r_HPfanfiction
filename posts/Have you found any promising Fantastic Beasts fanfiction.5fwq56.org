What have you found?


** I found one written in 2003 that's actually quite good- a little off with Tina, but pretty true to character for being written before the story was even a thought. linkffn(A Day in the Life of Newt Scamander)

******* Definitely not pedophilia. Credence was like 17 or 18. Not saying that it's not inappropriate or an abuse of power, just it's not even close to the definition of pedophilia.

********* That still isn't pedophilia. Culturally, we view teenagers as children, but they have the anatomy of adults. [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia][A child must be prepubescent for it to be pedophilia]]. 100 years ago (about the setting of this movie) there was nothing wrong with marrying a 15 year old.

Again, I'm not defending this creepy abuse of power, just it's not a mental disorder where adults are sexually attracted to children.

********** I've heard this rhetoric before, from someone in high school who 5 years later got arrested in a kiddie porn ring.

It is a mixture of not understanding the times and not having an understanding of anatomy. What was acceptable 100 years ago and is not acceptable now is just that: not acceptable. Also the idea that there is the same anatomy as adults is a falsehood for justification purposes.

Teen bodies are still growing at 15. Their brains are not completely developed until the early 20s, especially the parts that process morally challenging decisions, recognizing safety, and good judgement. Teens are in a near adulthood stage where they stuck in between their old lives and their new.

With newer information and understanding, the paradigm shifted to make such things social unacceptable.

*********** Paedophilia is actually a precise disorder.

According to Wikipedia: "Pedophilia or paedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children.[1][2] Although girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11, and boys at age 11 or 12,[3] criteria for pedophilia extend the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13.[1] A person who is diagnosed with pedophilia must be at least 16 years old, but adolescents must be at least five years older than the prepubescent child for the attraction to be diagnosed as pedophilia."

Being attracted by 15 years old when you're, say, 35, isn't proper. It isn't sane either and it is illegal, but it's not pedophilia.

  Newt is seven when he decides he likes animals more than people. (Well, he's seven when he cements that decision in stone, anyway.)He's seventeen when the Hogwarts Express leaves without him on it and his brother yanks him up by the shirt front and takes him to work at the Ministry with him. (Seventeen when the world goes to hell around him and everyone collectively stops what they're doing to fight and die in mud and dragon fire and mustard gas.)He's twenty-seven when Albus Dumbledore meets him in Paris (auburn hair starting to grey, looking far more exhausted Newt has ever met) and entrusts him with a task he's sure he'll never accomplish.
