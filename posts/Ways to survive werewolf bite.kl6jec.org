When getting bit by a werewolf is it transferred by bite or saliva? Could a werewolf were a magical teeth cap and not transfer the bite?


** I always saw it as a virus that needs to get into the blood stream so normal virus vectors would work (eg blood, saliva, etc. A werewolf's bite is just the easiest way of getting the virus into the victim's bloodstream.

** If someone's quick enough, maybe just chopping off the limb altogether before the venom can travel to the closest artery?

** I always saw hp wherewolvs as magical creatures first and foremost so at least somewhat magic and physical damage resistance when transformed, inflict magical wounds that either A don't heal well or B don't heal at all, and transmission via magical, not exactly physical means. So if it bites someone even with something like tooth caps on it would still be enough for the curse to pass on and if it bit for example a pinky toe and you immediately amputate your leg you'd still be a werewolf but now you'd also be a criple.

*** Is it established in HP canon that werewolves have a healing factor? In most versions of werewolves that I've come across in popular media, they are pretty good at regrowing limbs and such.

** Now I'm imagining the dentist who specializes in werewolves. I mean, if you want teeth capped, you'd have to do it on the full moon so they'd fit the wolf's fangs.

** Could you cure someone of being a Werewolf by replacing all of his blood with a switching spell or put the body in stasis and draining all of the blood and then refill it?

*** I imagine that it's more of a mutagenic factor. The “virus” infects every cell. Meaning you would have to replace every cell in the body with a healthy cell.

** If you can hold a werewold still long enough to put him some teeth cap, you can probably put him in a cage and wait for the sunrise.

Though I often wondered about the feasibility of some last ditch effort against a werewold, such as transfiguring someone's limb into metal right before the werewolf's bite. Would it stop his infection or not.

*** What I wonder is are animagues immune to werewolf bites because they have an animal form or because they can become animals and just turn and let the bite run its course would that vaccinate you assuming the human form isn't immune only the animal form are the animal forms changing the body or strinking the human and stuffing them into the animal and giving them control of the animal and then changing back does the same or?
