I'm just getting bored of the same stories repeated over and over, so I'm trying to make my own unique. I've done this so far:

1) Highlighted Snape's selfishness. He worked for Dumbledore for his own redemption, not because he cared about Harry. Also he's still a DE since Lily is still alive.

2) None of the Potters are idiots, and Harry isn't actively trying to ruin them (Lily dug her own pit, I plan on him reconciling with his brother, and James is actually the good guy).

3) Unfortunately Harry is a Slytherin and that's not changing, so don't bother warning against it.

Any other recommendations?

Okay, for clarification, this is the story: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12807093/1/Rewritten-The-Edge-of-Black]])


** The problem with so many of these stories is that the Potters neglect or abuse Harry while spoiling Harry's twin. This is extremely out of character.

They almost always make the twin incompetent while Harry is really powerful and no one notices and have this stupid part at the beginning where Dumbledore announces the twin as the Boy-who-lived due to some flimsy evidence. They never address the fact that Harry survived because Lily sacrificed herself. Basically nothing makes any sense!

Key thing to avoid: bashing. Don't bash the Potters, Dumbledore or the Weasleys or the Wizarding world in general. If that's possible.

** I think WBWL is a stupid trope to begin with. Regardless how you spin it, you can't avoid bashing Dumbledore and Potters. I believe it was first invented to give Harry's parents back, but still to have him growing up in Durzkaban.

And you still need to explain how Harry survived Voldemort's attack without his mother's sacrifice.

**** So they still abandoned him to be abused (I presume under Dumbledore's direction) - if that's not bashing, then I don't know what bashing means.

It's so OOC compared to everything we know about canon James and Lily that this trope absolutely makes no sense to me.

If James and Lily survived the attack by Voldemort and Harry was not a BWL to begin with, why the hell couldn't they raise Harry in a normal family?

***** Eh I think if they were somehow incapacitated beyond their control... like they accidently go forward in time or are forced into a magical sleep until the story starts or fall through the veil and are sent to another dimension then they don't have to be bashed but can "come back". Does anyone ever do that?

  Also he's still a DE since Lily is still alive.
#+end_quote

He became a spy before Lily died so just because Lily is alive doesn't mean that he has to be a death eater. If the plot divergence happended after the prophecy was overheard and after Lily's life was endangered then there is a good chance he would continue to spy. I don't think Dumbledore would let him stop at that point, he would also owe him for protecting Lily and he would still likely want to spy to make sure Lily would continue to not be in danger. I do agree that he would still be a DE if the divergence was before that point though.

** I think I need more info. If its not actually wbwl but that's the closest explanation what is the premise for the story? What's the summary?

And I'd argue that Snape never worked for Dumbledore for his redemption. He was always a death eater, he couldn't have been a spy if he wasn't.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
