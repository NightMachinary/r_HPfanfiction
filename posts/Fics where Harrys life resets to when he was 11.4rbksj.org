** This one doesnt go back to when he was eleven it goes even further back. Be warned its not a serious fic at all its actually pretty cracky.

** I assume you mean time travel fics? Or are you speaking more of dimensional travel or some other option? And does it have to be a hard 11, or can it be younger or older then that? And then of course theres the whole slash/no slash, pairings/no pairings, power/no power, and so on. More specifics would help. There are quite a lot of time travel ones, but without knowing what style you are looking for....
