1: James, Sirius and Remus weren't Aurors.

2: Severus was not Draco's Godfather

3: Golden Trio was never mentioned in the books.

4: Head Boy and Head Girl quarters aren't a thing, Magical Cores aren't a thing and as far as we know, the only Purebloods who call themselves ancient house of... is the Black family. (Which was likely something that they came up with themselves)

5: As far as we know, there is no glamour charms. There's also no soulmate bonds and the like.

6: Mione is not a nickname that Harry, Ron and co call Hermione constantly. I don't see it as often, compared to back then, but too many stories had Hermione's name shortened to stuff like Mione, or Mia or something like that. While I have no problems with nicknames, I don't see Hermione being okay with one, considering she never had one in canon. And it was more something that Ron called Hermione, when his mouth was full of food

7: Harry was a very sarcastic person. Too often I tend to see angst-y Harry or Saving people Complex Harry, people tend to forget that he was sarcastic as heck to people.

8: Sirius never saw Harry as James, he was not some kind of man child, or womanizer; but too many have him written as such.

How about you? Are there anything that aren't canon, but are often written as such? Rather you also believe in them or not, is up to you to say.

Note I'm not saying that any of the fanon stuff is bad necessarily, there's been plenty of great stories I've read that turn canon stuff and twist them around for fanon related stuff, that I really ended up liking.

*** And they certainly weren't at Hogwarts together at any point of their life! I've seen far too many Marauder era fics (and I don't even read much of those) where James, Sirius or Lily fondly remember Arthur and Molly who are supposed to be a couple years older than them and recently graduated, and all I can think about is how hard it must have been for Molly to finish her schooling while having at least two kids already. I distinctly remember one fic where Molly and Arthur were only two years Marauders' senior, and by that logic they must have had Bill at... what, twelve?

** Magical cores are a big sticking point of mine, to the point where it's almost /more/ excusable to use them as a cheap AU way to power up Harry, than to stick them in an otherwise-reasonable setting where they don't belong. Because it's so clearly a misreading of the kind of magic system Rowling was trying to build.

The metaphor I like to use is: "magical cores" suggests that a first-year can't cast complex spells for the same reason they can't bench 300 lbs. But /everything in canon/ suggests that a first-year can't cast complex spells for the same reason they can't do multivariate calculus. They don't have the /knowledge/ required to understand what's involved. This just seems so clear in canon that it's frustrating when an otherwise perfectly good fic goes the "mana bar" or "magic is a muscle" approach.

Why not both? My headcanon is magic need knowledge, intuition, experience, and internal growth to use it. First year can't cast complex spells because they don't have the knowledge and their body just isn't used to casting spells.

Personally, I don't have a problem with "magic is a muscle". My real problem is when Harry somehow has a very big magical core without doing anything. I mean, you're not born with big muscle nor you suddenly get a big muscle than anyone else after a specific incident; unless you're Steve Roger ofc.

******** I mean honestly I totally agree with you. But when I wrote my OC as quite emotional and tearful it was shocking how often I got accused of writing a weak character, even though she continued to show resilience. I feel quite strongly that it's healthy to cry and that rather than saying women are being over sensitive sometimes people just shouldn't be complete twats. I don't want to see women become emotionless robots in order to be considered well written or strong. But...

If we are honest with ourselves about what people mean when they say "both Lily and Ginny are strong characters", what they actually mean is that they are both fiesty. But Lily is a maternal angel type with little agency in canon (and I do often criticise Rowling for writing her this way). The cutesy names, the tears, the fact that her biggest act of bravery is something any loving mother would do (i.e, inherently tying it to her portrayal as a maternal angel) - none of that is what people mean when they compare her to Ginny, that's all forgotten. They are swept up in fanon. The fanon portrayal of Lily as a firecracker just isn't backed up in canon.

I think there's a happy medium and 99% of women fall within that median. Unfortunately that is not how fanfic writers always see it.

Rather than using the word strong I should have just emphasised that their personalities don't seem that similar either, but obviously will leave it up for transparency.

It's true that when people say they are strong characters, they mean that those two are fiery. and someone like Cho is considered weak. When they talk about how cool Molly is, it's all about how she killed Bellatrix, and not about how she managed to raise 7 children or how she had to recover after losing her brothers. It seems to me that people believe crying=weak. I've been listening to a podcast where one of the hosts said she didn't understand why Hermione was so emotional after she learned Buckbeak will be killed. I was honestly confused by this. Like, you need a serious reason which would give you a right to cry? Then they went on to say that Hermione lost her faith in the justice system, so apparently it's alright to cry because of that.

** - lily was never stated to be a prefect (i think this one is interesting, because i kind of think jkr either forgot about or soft-retconned that lily and james were head boy and head girl, because it isn't mentioned by any official source, as far as i know, *anywhere*, in or out of canon, apart from hagrid's lone statement in PS. no mention of lily being prefects with lupin when it was revealed he was one in 5th year, no mention of james being head boy either, only that sirius and james would have never made prefect. no mention by slug. no mention when harry was looking up old prefect and head records in CoS)

- remus was never described with facial scars

- lucius isn't described with a cane or long hair (if we're going by draco in the epilogue, he's more likely to have /less/ hair than usual. also- several pureblood men are described as bald or balding. i don't think this is a minor point either, really. conservative and traditional wizard grooming still has men with short hair, which is why molly pesters bill to cut his. a lot of the men described with long hair are 'rebels' or eccentrics in some way e.g. bill, sirius, the dumbledores, severus, xeno. lucius and draco are described with slicked back hair and that's how he portrays himself- as a clean-cut, conservative rich guy)

- sirius doesn't know DEs have the dark mark on their forearms in GoF. whether or not fudge knew, or if it was widely known, is unknown

DEs cast it when they kill. fudge can have an instinctive response to the mark, without knowing that it was branded onto the DEs with its own specific functions. 'the dark mark' refers both to the brand and the symbol cast in the sky by 'Morsmordre'

this isn't like people not knowing what a swastika is. this is like if hitler ordered all nazis to tattoo the swastika onto their left calves and /that/ was a secret. you'd have a response to symbol anyway

***** Well the SS -did- all have bloodgroup tattoos on the inside of their left arms, and it was considered good evidence of membership in the SS postwar, for judicial reprisal, with some having gotten away due to missing marks. And there was literature distributed in the military on how to identify vandalized marks on those who tried to remove their Blutgruppentätowierung. I imagine Rowling took the idea from the Nazis to apply to the DEs, with less practicality and more transparent symbology.

This wasn't perhaps very common knowledge among the general public though, especially not until after the war when people with the knowledge had time to spread it into public knowledge. Sirius, having gone to jail before many of the DE trials, might not have been aware of the immediate implication.

that's true, but i don't think that's enough to say he won't recognise the mark at different scales.

also, the mark being cast as a large projection in the sky doesn't mean that that's the only way fudge has seen it. people could have taken pictures or transcribed the image due its infamous association with the DEs, so fudge could have become acquainted with a miniaturised version of it through other means

some people mistrust her because she's best friends with and defends a literal dark wizard. no such complaints after she and severus stop being friends

mary mcdonald was the prefect. she caught mulciber fucking around, tried to reprimand him, he did something to her, then he got in trouble. he kept on hounding her, her grades slipped/her behaviour changed, lily was then made head girl in 7th year

It's ridiculous to think a school with an established student hierarchy would ignore it to that extent. TWO non-Prefect students from the SAME HOUSE get Head Boy and Head Girl?! Edit2: it was unusual enough for James, is my point. Also people are gonna write her as a prefect and it's not tantrum level ridiculous to do that.

Which strongly suggests that, while the rational part of Sirius is obviously clear that Harry is not James, there is a part of Sirius which misses James and is hoping to relive some glory days through Harry.

It's not uncommon for parents to project their hopes and dreams onto their children, so why not this variation of a godfather projecting something onto their godson? It makes sense.

Even if you don't interpret it this way, I do think it is a very valid interpretation of the text that's there. With that in mind, I feel like this part of movie script is reasonable. It portrays the same underlying dynamics between Sirius and Harry, just in a slightly adapted way.

Parents often can't even get the names of their own children straight (calling a child by a different name before immediately correcting themselves), so it's quite natural for Sirius to mix up the names of two people who are very closely associated in his mind. Heck, I could realistically see Sirius mixing up the names in the heat of battle even if he *didn't* have an unhealthy obsession with reliving the past, though obviously such an accident wouldn't make it into a screenplay.

I'd maybe even buy the argument that for Sirius it wasn't about protecting Harry so much as it was about not wanting to let James down again. Where it fails for me is that the movies don't really develop this idea before his death, so that one line then needs to shoehorn in all these complicated emotions---and it's too literal and too blunt to do it well. In the end, it comes across as though he's just plain mixed them up. That would be the sort of oops/slip moment you describe for any other character, but for the one you're already suspecting has gone a bit mental after his ordeal. So, it just comes across as Sirius having lost touch with reality---and it's the final thing he says to Harry.

It's like the movies ignoring the reason Hermione kissed Ron in the first place. Sure, she had romantic feelings for him. But it was his worrying about the house elves that made her do so.

I don't know. Spellcrafting and wards are rather niche activities so the average wizard might not be interested in them.

Like, if you enter the data of things that have happened, arithmancy can tell you what the outcomes would have been with different actions. Also what actually did happen from the results. Arithmancers in the US (in my fic) are often used as expert witnesses in trials, because arithmancy can determine every possible course of action that could lead to x result, with the likelihood of it actually happening . If that makes sense.

In my version its useful for potions and spellcrafting as well, since you can use it for theorycrafting - you can set up an equation that states that you added these ingredients, and arithmancy will be able to show you what the result would have been.

** I have one... it's not a huge thing, but it's a small thing that irks me a bit when people take it for granted that is in canon: Fred and George never actually call themselves "Gred and Forge."

George said it, ONCE, as a joke responding to Molly having put letters on their Christmas jumpers but not on Ron's. "You haven't got a letter on yours. I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid, we know our names are Gred and Forge."

It was ONE joke, a humorous commentary where he pretended to have forgotten his and Fred's names. It doesn't mean they were constantly going around calling each other "Gred" and "Forge." It doesn't really fit their characters to have done so, either... say what you will about the twins' sense of humour, but at least it was VERY rare for them to tell the same joke twice. They usually thought of new ones.

Sirius being a womanizer for sure (he literally just had a couple of posters on his wall to piss off his mother)

“The noble and most ancient house of potter” stuff

When people just assume Harry's name is actually Henry/Harold etc

Tonks being able to change into literally anything at will (she can change her appearance) she's not a human version of polyjuice potion or an animagus

It's like her soul purpose in fan fiction is so the author can write in some sexual scenes. There's always long descriptions of exactly what she's wearing “tight jeans, short skirts/shorts, tank tops etc” which she never had in the books and none of the other female characters get described this way. She's either only used for sex or sexual descriptions in canon or in other fics to break up with Harry so that Harry can get with a girl who's less “slutty” like hermione or Luna.

***** I wouldn't call it a war between two teams. What I would call it was a campaign of relentless four-on-one bullying that included sexual assault and attempted murder. (relentless bullying, by the way, is JKR's own description of how the Maurauders treated Snape at school)

And Lily is not the arbiter of all that is Good and Right in the world - after all, she did marry someone who 'earnestly' threatened to hex (ie. Attack) her if she didn't stop trying to interfere as he was assaulting her friend. She did also take James' side against Snape after the werewolf incident. Admittedly, she didn't have all the facts, but a true friend would have made an attempt to find out the facts, rather than assume that their 'best friend' (her words) is lying and taking the side of an 'arrogant toerag' (her words again) over him. Lily might have been a nice person, but she certainly wasn't perfect.

As for what Sirius and Remus have to say - I mean, I guess you can believe it? I mean it's not like Sirius had a vested interest in getting Harry on his side and maybe had the thought that admitting to Harry that he and his friends attacked another student and he, Sirius, personally set up an attempt to murder said student using another student (his friend!) as the murder weapon. Obviously Harry would be just fine with that, right? And it's not like Remus is shown throughout the series to withhold information or outright lie when it makes his life easier (as a totally random example, what exactly is his excuse for not bringing Sirius' animagus form to Dumbledore's attention? I mean, for most of the book he thought Sirius was evil and wanted Harry dead, and he didn't think it was a good idea to at some point during the year go 'um, Albus? Did you know Sirius can turn into a dog?'). I mean, those are totally trustworthy sources with no motive whatsoever to lie, right?)

If the one incident that we are shown in Snape's Worst Memory is indicative of how the Maurauders usually treated Snape, then yes, it was exactly as bad as fandom makes it out to be. SWM is one of the most disgusting portrayals of bullying I have ever read. At least the people who bullied me never graduated to sexual assault.

****** I personally wouldn't call it that but that's just my opinion. I don't think lily is a symbol of purity or anything she can obviously make bad decisions but I also think the fandom victimize Snape way too much. Just because you got bullied at school doesn't mean you can turn around and bully kids. He joined the death eaters and showed absolutely no signs of remorse. The only reason he stopped being a death eater was because the woman he had an obsession with was killed by them. He never acknowledges that voldemort was a pure blood elitist who wanted to kill muggleborns. We know that Dumbledore, and the rest of the order and wizardjng world have tremendous respect for James and Lily. The series is told from third person and even at that the only persons head we get remotely close to being in is Harry's so it's hard to tell who's telling the truth and who's not. Personally I prefer to believe the characters who are known as being reliable and have Harry's best interests at heart than the characters who actively make his life hell for no reason. We know from Slughorns memories that memories can be manipulated, I'm not saying that Snape wasn't bullied and that it didn't like affect his character massively but I just find the fics where Snape is like this poor little misunderstood victim is sooo out of character. The thing Neville is most scared of is Snape for god sake, how could you make your students so scared of you you're their boggart!? I just feel like some writers like to hype up the victim thing a bit much and forget that Snape is morally grey and has done some awful things, and the marauders are also grey, they've done awful things to Snape but literally gave their lives to fight for the light

** An interesting one that I saw once in a Harry Potter quiz (and not one for people who are likely to deep dive in things like Pottermore, etc.). The question was: "What is James Potter's Patronus?" Their answer was "a Stag". However in canon James' patronus is never mentioned in the books, we don't even know if he ever even cast one. I think this goes for a lot of Patroni, most we never see in canon. Some Patroni are later confirmed via Pottermore to be a certain animal, so that's how we know it's a stag. But it's not actually in the books.

Another common one is the thought that Durmstrang is an all male school and Beauxbatons an all female school.

I never understood what people found so exciting about it. So men apparently have to be violent after all. I don't see why his condition has to have such an effect on him. Also, it's not a canon fact or anything, but in nearly every fic I've read, Tonks is portrayed as sex-positive. I'm not saying it's bad thing, it's just that she seems unable to control her desires and her being sex-positive is shown to be such an important part of her character. Even people who seem to love her don't focus much on her other traits. And instead of making me admire her, they make me wonder if she is really an adult and not a teenager. And it's sort of sad when this becomes a prominent part of her character, when things like being friendly or kind are far more admirable.

“I'm perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,” said Sirius coldly.

Sirius always wanted Harry to keep himself safe in GoF. He's always telling Harry to be cautious and keep his head down. So for him to make a complete turn in OotP is indicative of his mental state - which is being quite reckless since he's holed up in a place he detests. We're meant to feel some sort of closure this way - that Sirius was suffering being alive and death was kinder. I think that's what JK intended.

Previously Sirius has been presented in an almost uniformly positive way, and his relationship with Harry has been shown as a good and healthy thing.

It's like Dumbledore being a cruel Machiavellian consequentialist- you have the evidence for it in the books if you look at his actions.

When they break into Gringotts, Hermione manages to disguise Ron with some spell/combination of spells, like so:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath as she transformed various aspects of Ron's appearance. He was to be given a completely fake identity, and they were trusting to the malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile Harry and Griphook were to be concealed under the Invisibility Cloak.

  "There," said Hermione, "how does he look, Harry?"

  It was just not possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only, Harry thought because he knew him so well. Ron's hair was now long and wavy; he had a thick brown beard and mustache, no freckles, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows.

They're not, but the way the system works in canon is that a wizard theoretically has an infinite mana pool - if he wants to, he can keep casting spells all he wants and never get tired/want to take a break, ever.

Duels don't end when the duelists are /magically/ exhausted, they end when one person is /mentally/ exhausted and drops their guard or lets themselves get distracted. This lends a whole new dimension to dueling- smoke, harmless flashbang spells, and casting rate can all be used to mentally trip up an opponent and create an opening.

That's what made Beatrix so dangerous- not her raw power, but the brutality of her spell repitoir and her ability to use her taunts to break the focus of her enemies at crucial moments- which is exactly what she did to Sirius.

Ugh...I cannot believe I have to keep repeating myself.

Suppose I use the wand-lighting charm, Lumos.

Then suppose I decide I value my life a lot less and go hunting for dementors, werewolves, vampires and other creatures and proceed to fight them all using magic.

Using that one wand-lighting charm will have the same effect on me as using Fiendfyre to kill a hundred werewolves and vampires. As long as I have the cursed fire under control, there is no drain on me from using it at all. It takes the same effort as casting a lumos charm.

Ergo, I will not be drained at all. The only effect it will have on me is the very situation I'd find myself in, of fighting for my life - which has nothing to do with the magic I use, but rather the scenario I find myself in.

The need for food or water and mental stress - all of that is secondary. Assuming I'm a superb occlumens (so that those potential issues are nullified), my magic is unimpeded.

Or I can develop one spell that will turn the earth into planetary dust, and fire it from outer space - and it would not cost me any more than using a Lumos charm.

But this is not a problem? The cost of magic lies not in a singular execution of it but in acquiring the ability to cast it proficiently and reliably. This is not an RPG where you have to balance various classes. Werewolves aren't some mobs to exp upon, and they aren't actual enemies from the narrative perspective, transformed werewolves are just bigger wolves after all.

No, the main potential enemies for wizards in Potterverse are other wizards. And there is no problem here - "the other side has magic too", they are subject to the same rules.

Look at it this way: Casting lumos is like doing basic arithmetic. But controlling fiendfyre (which is not as easy as you're making it out to be) is like doing advanced algebraic geometry.

**** It makes sense for magic to be exhausting on its own. Maybe it is the same as mental exhaustion, maybe it's something slightly different. Maybe you can be either magically exhausted (due to the sheer power and/or duration of spells) /or/ mentally exhausted (due to the complexity of, say, an elaborate transfiguration), or both. That would be even more interesting.

The real problems I see with most appearances of "magical cores" are that:

1. They're often handled in a way that feels like importing an RPG magic system into a piece of literature, and that just doesn't mesh well.

2. They are a divergence from canon that basically never adds to the story and is therefore entirely unnecessary. If you need to limit what your characters can do, just say that they were exhausted! Magical cores are basically technobabble, and a form of technobabble that just doesn't exist in canon. That's what makes them so grating.

The best use magical cores I've read is in the linkffn(Princess of the Blacks) series, where the protagonist has a unique difference to how her magical core works, which leads to a risk of her secret being detected. And even there, I felt like there should have been a better way to tell the story, without the technobabble.

In terms of magical prowess Harry never really shows much at all.

In the climax of the first two books he doesn't use any magic at all.

In book 3 he casts the patronus which is supposed to be very difficult but he's been practicing it for several months by that point. Also how often does anyone even try to teach it to teenagers. It might be easier than people realise but nobody ever bothers because it's not necessary to know.

In book 4 he is struggling in class with the summoning charm and he and Hermione have to spend hours practising it before the first task. This suggests that his magical ability is about on par with the rest of his age group.

He's a decent teacher, but he's not some defence genius. The only thing he really has over everyone else in the group is that he has some experience in real life or death situations due to his end of year adventures rather than just in the classroom like everyone else.

He was forced to sleep in a cupboard under the stairs, when they at least had one extra bedroom to use.

He was forced to cook, and do other chores while Dudley wasn't. Petunia threw a frying pot at his head; at least once, Vernon talked about stamping out his magic, or trying to; which sort of implies that he had at least hit him at least once before. Later on bars were on his window, his door was locked, and a cat flap was installed.

He was starved as well

#+begin_quote
  Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, "Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals," before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.
#+end_quote

No meals. Fun.

He was regularly given much smaller portions/helpings for meals. While the Dursleys ate full dinners, he had to make do with a couple of slices of bread and butter/cheese.

#+begin_quote
  As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished.
#+end_quote

The above scene happens in the morning, because it's clearly mentioned that Harry's eating toast for his meal.

#+begin_quote
  It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him.

  "Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!"

  Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight's pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.

  "Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!" snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.

  Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate. "Upstairs! Hurry!"
#+end_quote

So, he works from 9 or 10 in the morning, to 7:30 at night. Without food. Lovely. (I can easily go days without food if I'm lazing about, but even I need sustenance when I'm working).

Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished.

  While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry knew he shouldn't have risen to Dudley's bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself... maybe he didn't have any friends at Hogwarts...

  Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now , he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face.

Again, not exactly abuse. It is neglect and a serious strict on your ability to parent, but not abuse. He had a bed in there, some toys, and a blanket. There was not dried blood on the mattress or on the walls and there was a vent on the door that allowed fresh air into the little bedroom.

That is not abuse, either. Being forced to cook, while slightly unorthodox for a child, is a valuable life skill. Also, there is no evidence that he was cooking five-star courses or anything above eggs and bacon. At ten, cooking eggs and bacon /is/ reasonable.

Making assumptions is the worst thing you can do. Saying something does not mean that the person do it. If Harry was described as limping with a broken arm and a black eye, I could believe it.

Also, I cannot imagine being pathetic enough to be an apologist for characters that do not exist. My goal was to clear up some misconceptions and stop people from taking one-liners from the book and twisting it into a mockery of itself.

We go from being locked in his bedroom to being allowed out. We go from being starved to given bread and cheese. There is no indication in canon that Harry Potter was abused. He was neglected, yes, emotionally and mentally, but that is all. However, this generation is wack and if you sneeze near someone, they scream abuse. Why am I surprised people are misusing the words?

At the end of the day, if you desire to poke fun at child abuse, then be my guest. I guess we can put it into the ‘troll' category for the internet, alongside autism, depression, and OCD.

If he was truly starved, he would not have shared his food. People would have noticed that he was starved. Baggy clothes or robes do not hide it like you think they would.

**** The frying pan thing is often brought up, and I agree that Petunia took it too far... but I think people forget the context here. This is Harry's first summer back with the Dursleys after starting Hogwarts, and it's the only time in the series when:

1: Harry knows he is a wizard and can do magic, but 2: The Dursleys DON'T know that he isn't allowed to turn them into frogs or something, which means that 3: Harry has quite a bit of fun scaring Dudley by threatening to do magic.

Things are REALLY tense in the Dursley household during this time, with the Dursleys pretty much treating Harry like a time bomb ready to go off... and Harry, being twelve, is stupid enough, and frustrated enough, and thankful enough to have some form of power over them, that he begins threatening Dudley by pretending to cast a spell on him. And Dudley is the Dursley who has already BEEN magicked before, when Hagrid gave him a pig's tail; he FREAKS.

And THAT'S why Petunia swings at Harry with a frying pan... the only time she so much as lifts a hand to him. And keep in mind, she didn't go to pick up the frying pan to take a swing at him; she was already holding it in her hand because she was doing the dishes and likely just struck out in a moment's fit of rage with whatever she was holding at the time. Which happened to be the frying pan.

'Course, this is a pretty bad thing, and if child services saw this happening Petunia would be in a lot of trouble, but I don't think you can take that scene as evidence that Harry got regular betings. I think Vernon and Petunia were more likely to THREATEN to beat Harry than to actually DO it.

We don't have to agree with what they say and do, of course. We can and should admit that their actions were bad, and that there wasn't any excuse for treating a child the way they did.

The point is that one example of Petunia swinging a frying pan is not an excuse to notch it up to fifty and have it occur every day. Sometimes, and I mean this as best as I can, people forget they are holding something and go to swat someone. I hit my nephew in the back of the head with a TV remote because he was being mouthy and it was simply meant to be a light swat to the back of the head.

** I believe, as far as this is correct in pointing out how uncanon all of this is, fanfiction in entitled of changing things to create different concepts. If not, it would just repeat canon, and no one would pay attention to it. Yes, fanfiction devices are not supposed to be canon and some stuff (Ron's character, lily/Ginny similarities) are weird but in some occasions people might have a different point of view or try to invent which is totally okay, it's their story. For example for me there's nothing wrong with fanfiction creating names for Hermione's parents, changing secondary characters plots and other stuff. Like putting a half-blood slytherin as one of harry students we've met; they're only named and it brings something new to the story.

** Well, I recently found a fanfiction net profile for a person who hates most of the Harry Potter characters and believes that their opinion of them is canon: "romances and marriages don't last long.

​

WEASLEYS: I loathe Ron, plain and simple. He's a leech on Harry, is extremely jealous and lazy and treats Hermione horribly, which is another reason they shouldn't be together let alone marry. He's also a bully, opinionated, stubborn and believes he is always right on a subject - especially when he is not, such as "ALL Slytherins are evil". Also there are so many things he could tell Harry about his new world, especially Harry's position, but he never does whether from jealousy or "on orders" and it is evident in the books that he wants Harry all to himself and be the ONLY best mate, which is why he belittles Hermione and everybody else.

​

MOLLY: I don't like her because she is controlling, bigoted, opinionated and a bitch. In the entire 7 years of knowing Harry, she only had personal contact with him for less than 3-4 months. Yet very early on she was boasting that she considered him her 7th son. It was also obvious that she was a Dumbles plant at King's Cross with the Weasleys all apparently just hanging around outside the barrier, wasting time and asking what was the name of the platform and saying it loud enough for Harry (& Muggles) to hear. I've known people like Molly. Her contribution to society and her life is bound up with her children, but she treats them like possessions. Just because you have child(ren) doesn't mean you know how to raise them properly but Molly's attitude is that she is the world's best mother and all should heed her advice even if they are as old as Dumbles. Molly rules the roost and Arthur is mostly ignored by his own children & flees to his shed when things get to be too much. Molly will not let go of her kids, wants them to do what she wants them to do, such as choosing their careers, wanting them to still live at home and if her treatment of Fleur was any indication of how she treated other potential girlfriends, I can see why her sons aren't bringing home girls to meet Mummy

​

GINNY: I loathe her also. She is a fan girl and only sees Harry as the Boy-Who-Lived. Why JK matched them together I don't know but they are WRONG FOR EACH OTHER. I won't read any stories where she and Harry hookup no matter how interesting it looks.

​

FRED/GEORGE: I like them but at times I don't as they are too into pranks and think nothing of physically or emotionally hurting people if it makes them laugh. When they prank other Houses, such as Slytherin, the innocent Slytherins suffer the same humiliation and discomfort as the baddies, such as Malfoy and his lot. They are bullies and are mean to Percy, Ron & Ginny at times, and some of the things they do are cruel. Think about it: would you like to be the subject of a Weasley prank especially if it lasts a long time? Plus their "product testing" is done haphazardly not knowing (or caring) if a victim is allergic to an ingredient or mentally or emotionally "on the edge" and the embarrassment might push them over.

​

ARTHUR/BILL/CHARLIE: I like Arthur as a person but he is too wishy-washy and henpecked for my taste. Bill is okay except when he allows his mother and Ginny to insult, belittle and disrespect Fleur. Fleur deserves better treatment and if her fiance/husband lets his mother and sister insult his wife before the wedding, it won't stop after it. He should be ashamed of himself. Charlie isn't used much but it seems he got as far away from his mother as he could and would rather face dragons than play Quidditch in England and be near his mother.

​

JAMES/SIRIUS: According to the Urban Dictionary the definition of a "player" is a male who is skilled at manipulating ("playing") others, and especially at seducing women by pretending to care about them, when in reality they are only interested in sex. Possibly derived from the phrases "play him for a fool", or "play him like a violin". Wikipedia describes it as: Player (dating) - a man or woman who has romantic affairs or sexual relations or both with other women or men but will not marry or commit to any one relationship. James and Sirius are "players" in every sense of the word. No doubt due to their families and standing in their world, they have been spoiled although it is said that Sirius fled from the tyranny of his evil parents...well he always was a rebel but was it because he wanted to do things "his way" and didn't want the responsibilities that come with the perks of his birth. The same with James and since he was the precious only child and last heir he was spoiled more than a Malfoy and knew he could get away with anything by "his charm" or his family defending him. The Weasley Twins are much like the Marauders but due to their proverty have limits BUT Dumbles' protection. I just don't like James & Sirius for these and other reasons I state in my stories.

​

Did James really love Lily or did he want her because he couldn't have her? Did he date and eventually marry her because he could consider it the best "prank" against Snape and totally crush his spirit? Wouldn't any father whose family is in danger have at least sent his wife and son out of the country to a place of safety? Wouldn't it have been logical to make Dumbles or LILY (who was in hiding and couldn't be captured unless she left the house) the secret keeper? James did so many stupid things that no wonder people suspects Dumbles of manipulations. But what I loathe the most about J&S is that they singled out Snape at the very beginning and made his life a living hell simply because they could and Dumbles let them. Sirius exposing Snape to a fully changed werewolf was unforgiveable and I bet he wasn't even punished. And most of all, they never apologized to those they had wrong. Life seemed to be a big joke to them and they never grew up. Sirius is still torturing Snape, taunting, embarrassing him and, it seems, almost getting praised for doing it.

​

REMUS/PETER: Since he was so desperate for friends and acceptance, Remus turned a blind eye at James & Sirius' actions despite being a Prefect. Peter...I feel sorry for him. He was noticed because he was friends with the Marauders but after graduation, he ended up in a dead end job and was probably forced into joining the Order. He probably got a few "leavings" of James & Sirius, but no doubt he knew he could die and they wouldn't care. Perhaps, like Snape, he joined Voldie for power and respect and to get revenge. If Voldie hadn't died on the 31st, Peter might have prospered, or not, but he would have had his revenge. I never understood why Remus didn't go to another werewolf-friendlier country, especially after the 31st.

​

LILY: Lily was supposed to be so very intelligent yet she didn't bother to acquaint herself with the ways things worked at Hogwarts and the Magical World. She kept telling Snape not to associate with his housemates but what was he supposed to do? Considering the politics of Slytherin, he risked a lot having a Muggleborn as a friend and when she abandoned him to his fate because of one word, he only had Slytherins for a support system. Just one word said in the heat of embarrassment and she wouldn't even listen to his apology. Some friend, huh! It is easy (at least to me and apparently others) to believe she was spelled, given Amorenstia, etc. to ignore Snape and to fall for James. I think she was a bigot and believed her way was right and didn't even try to understand the position Snape was in. She was also known for her fiery temper but did she ever really defend Sev against the Marauders or report their behavior to McG? I wonder how things would have turned out if she and Snape were sorted into Ravenclaw.

​

McGONAGALL: She is a terrible Head of House!!! Doesn't she notice the condition Harry is in, both physically and emotionally? She got him a good broom (but did she pay for it or take the money from Harry's vault) so he could play Quidditch & win for Gryffindor, but assigns him and others a detention in the Forbidden Forest AT NIGHT & with Hagrid. She ignores him in first year; second year doesn't care he is being called the Heir of Slytherin; fourth year doesn't do anything about those Potter stinks buttons or the abuse he is receiving even in his own House; fifth year does she agree to help him be an Auror just to spite Umbridge and/or because James & Sirius were Aurors? Does she see him as a (disappointing in her view) clone of James like Sirius, Remus & Snape? She just seems not to care about Harry or even other members of her House like Neville. It does make people wonder if she is under orders from Dumbles to ignore Harry & the abuse he receives."
