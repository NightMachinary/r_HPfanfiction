I'm a whumper and am looking for fics where one of the kids loose control of their magic, whether a one time thing due to emotions or because they have trouble in general. I guess my ideal fic would involve Harry struggling, Sirius being there, someone getting hurt/comfort, and little or no Harry and Snape interactions (those interactions aren't believable for me). Also I know it's uncommon but I'm only a Canon shipper. Thanks to all who reply.


** Just read this yesterday and think this may fit the bill of what you're looking for. It's a bit of a long story but Harry takes forever to gain control of his emotion/magic (similar to how he was in OOTP), some good Snape/Harry moments and everyone trying to ready themselves for battle with hurt/comfort throughout.

  PostOOTP, Snape blows his cover as a spy to save Harry from Voldemort. To win the war, even those who loathe each other must unite, and many lessons are learned in the process. COMPLETE!
