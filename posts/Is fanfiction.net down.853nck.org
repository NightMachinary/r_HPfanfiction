****** /Saner/ than the wackiness that is Like A Redheaded Stepchild. It is still completely off the wall, with Hermione exhibiting /Hagrid/-levels of "X are people too". Hermione supports rights for snakes, boggarts, portraits, owls, and even Rita Skeeter's Quick-Quotes Quill. Hermione also gets along much better with Luna, and drives Snape to a breakdown in second year.

Also, Ron learns to prank from Peter, who initially claims to be a rat who can take human form rather than an Animagus.
