In the fic Harry comes back and does whatever he does, I read so many time travel fics they all blend together at some point. This one though Hermione ends up going to muggle university after Hogwarts. Harry is still friends with her and I think Luna. They hang out like best friends, go to dinner, watch movies that kind of shit. Then Hermione starts to think she maybe likes Harry and she makes a pros/cons list about it. Then she meets up with him for take away or dinner somewhere and they discuss it. Either she knows about the time travel or this is when Harry reveals it and they talk about why a relationship is/isn't a good idea. Any help is appreciated, thanks!

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

** Your description of the story (especially the "Hermione in University" part) sounds very similar to a story I read, recently, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11033616/1/You-re-my-Density][You're my Density]].

** I'm like 90% sure I read that at some point but the name just won't come, and neither will any details.. let me thinks and write down my thoughts, perhaps they will provide a clue...

So in the beginning I'm fairly certain Harry is very smart and I know the whole fic is centered around what they change slowly in the world... I know the author very specifically mentions that there won't be romance because Harry is actually much older than everyone else... argh, it's there, it's sitting there dancing out of conscious thought. If no one else figures it out, I'll be back. Though, I don't actually think I did anything to help >_>

Edit: Is this it? Probably not...

Pretty sure that's not it actually. On second thought >_>

Also Edit: This one has potential, but it's not what your looking for <_>
