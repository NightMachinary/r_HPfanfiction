Belated Happy New Year to everyone.


** I have a bit (perhaps 1/3) of the next chapter of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4815342/1/Escape-to-Darkness][Escape to Darkness]] written.

Also started something new that I like. Not sure if I'll continue it or roll the ideas into something existing, but it's fun.

Basically, Harry's school years were mostly without Voldemort - Year 2 happened mostly as in canon, and Year 3 happened with a few changes. It's a few years after that now, and Harry's come back at age 25 to teach at Hogwarts to teach Muggle Studies, since Quirrell is the new Defense Professor and Burbage quit after getting an offer to write a textbook.

tl;dr - Year 1 doesn't happen until Harry's a Professor, graduate, former Auror, and former quasi-amateur dueling champion.

** I'm plotting out an episodic series set after the Battle of Hogwarts.

This all came from my inability to find the post-battle fic I really wanted. Typically: Within a few days, Kingsley is in control of the Ministry, the Weasleys are going back home, and Harry/Ginny are back together. Within a few months, the wizarding world is functioning fine again. Harry enters a well-staffed Ministry. The biggest problem becomes challenging old ideas. It's too easy. There's great romantic and family fics, but I really want one that focuses on this world in shambles.

All the ideas I have for this are too big and branch out too much to fit comfortably in one fic. So, I'm taking it piece by piece. It'll start out with Order/DA and others taking refuge at Hogwarts because the Wizarding World isn't secure yet. The remaining Death Eater supporters/sympathizers are still controlling the Ministry and the news of Voldemort's death is being kept quiet. They have to take back the Ministry, release the innocent in Azkaban, and deal with the muggle government in the first "episodes." Then it moves on to trying to find people still missing, helping the homeless and jobless, investigating everyone who played along with the death eaters, and dealing with the violence breaking out (persecuted vs those who kept their head down + wizards vs magical creatures). The A Plots will usually be about the functioning of the wizarding world (and later go into casefic territory) while the B and C plots will be their personal stories.

The plotting involved is a pain in the mikta. (What I've explained is an incredibly small bit of what's being included.) It is fun though, and the format means I'll be able to fully explore all this plus personal stuff like Hermione's parents, Colin's death, and a growing Kingsley/Harry friendship. But ooohhh, the headaches this will give me.

  [Argentorum's] personal theory on Midichlorians is that they're actually parasites that feed on excess/waste force energy after it's been channeled through a person.

  As such, while they have nothing to do with force sensitivity itself they're a good indicator as to how force sensitive someone is.

  The reason why no one ever talks about them is because... Well it's kinda like reminding everyone in the room that they have tape worms.

** I'm approaching the end of my DH from Ginny's POV fic and I'm so nervous about finishing it. I'm nearly at 100k words, I think it will probably end up around 120k, but I keep looking back at earlier chapters and want to edit/add to them. I think I've just really enjoyed writing it and don't want it to end.

I'm having major writers block about my other WIP because it's more challenging to write, so although I'm not going to abandon it I'm looking to wrap it up as quickly as possible. I want to get started on a Rolf/Luna adventure series or a Auror!Harry crime series.

"The Bloodmoon Rises" is pretty mapped out, but for the other two I'm just seeing where it goes. Especially "Salem Settlement", the HP x Fallout crossover could end in a huge clusterfuck with all those factions.

I'd be willing to beta. Would be a good work on the side. I'm pretty weak when it comes to grammar (since its not my native language), but I know my storytelling, character design and all that. PM me if thats what you're looking for.

** I believe another thread came out with a similar topic recently, so I'll more or less paraphrase what I said there:

About 1/4 of the way through my short novella-fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11671474/1/Morning-in-the-Land-of-Nod][Morning in the Land of Nod]], which is a post-apocalyptic AU, heavily inspired by the Gibson-era Mad Max movies, centring around a Max Rockatansky-esque Harry finding humanity while taking care of an orphaned Rose in the wasteland. It's pitifully under-reviewed at the moment, so take a moment to read it and jot your thoughts down, even if all you have to say is that I'm a really shit George Miller plagiarist.

As always, I'm working on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9121877/1/Midnight-Blues][Midnight Blues]], which lies somewhere between James Bond and The Big Lebowski on the similarity scale, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11443239/1/So-Spoke-the-Idol-God][So Spoke The Idol God]], an AU that features the trio never having become friends at Hogwarts and having to work together to defeat Voldemort as adults.

I'm currently working on an HP/Witcher crossover, based on a [[/r/writingprompts]] thread I saw a few months ago.

And last, but not least, I've written about 500 words of a James-centric AU that takes place in 1984, assuming he and Harry survived the attack on Godric's Hollow, but Lily didn't. It's supposed to be spy thriller, heavily influenced by Cold War-era novels and movies.

** I was writing a fanfic with a load of cool ideas:

- difficult love triangle between Harry and two girls. One is shielded by the war, the other one isn't, affecting everyone involved.

- Another secret society like the OotP, only it has different goals. So you've got Voldemort, OotP, another secret society and the ministry and Harry's in the middle of it, like a very complicated cat-and-mouse game.

- Harry has to run away and is never in one place for a very long time throughout the story.

- Voldemort possessing Harry would play a very big role (Voldemort talking to Ginny through Harry's body, anyone?).

This was way too ambitious and seeing as I'm a heavy H/G shipper, I can't really get into the characters and it would be completely obvious who Harry will end up with from the start. So I'm stripping away the story, only leaving some of the most important plot parts and scenes in, but making up different characters. It's not a HP fanfic anymore, but it's got a sort of teenage novel feel to it, kind of like "Tomorrow, When the War Began," which I love.

I've got to say, though. Even though loads of HP fanfics are terrible and a lot of it is just fantasies of teenage girls, it's a great place to start writing. You've got a whole world already chewed up for you, so it's easy to mold it to your own liking and create your own story. I wouldn't have started properly writing like I am now if it weren't for HP fanfiction, and I don't think I'm the only one in that.

** Currently mapping out the plot to my first real shot at fanfic, and the general premise goes a little bit like this:

The death eaters are relentless in their pursuit of Harry because there is no way Voldemort didn't brag to his inner circle about immortality.

Due to this Dumbledore gets Moody to raise Harry on the run from ridiculously well funded assassins.

Flash foreward to king cross... Harry is an eleven year old kid looking about as bad as moody minus the prosthetics, struggling with alcoholism, paranoia, and the meddling fools that are his housemates in Hufflepuff. Another major arc is going to be Moody's past, centering on the use of a ritual based version of Felix Felics that ignores the use limitations by making itself self containing like a time turner (the more work it has to do, the greater the sacrifice fate extracts in return). Explains how moody was so successful but lost basically everything he ever cared about.

I'm probabley going to start writing in the next week or so, then flesh out some oneshots and run them by some people before moving forward with the story.

**** It could easily be done with way. If it's crack I would focus on the oppression in the vein that most crack fics deal with serious after azkaban, then use the drunk!harry with paranoid!harry as the basis for his personality and basically you have a drunk kid latching onto people that he, in his delirium, decides ae his parental figures.

As a legitimate work, the focus would be less on hillarious drunk hijinks, and more on portraying Harry as a kid that is absolutely terrified of everything and him trying to fit into society with what basically amounts to ptsd, alcoholism, and some degree of depression. Over time it would show a long road to recovery, hindered by all the crazy shit that happens at Hogwarts.

So really either way could work, although I would personally write the more somber version. If you just go by the premise, most fics could be turned into basically any style you want it's really up to how the author writes it.

** I'm going back through and editing "The Power of Love" - mostly little changes in grammar, spelling, and the like. The sequel will start being published later in the month. I'm undecided about calling it "Heart and Soul" or simply "The Power of Love, Part 2".

Just finished writing a crossover between Harry Potter and Batman - specifically, the 1966 Batman TV show. I've tried to retain the campy humor of the show while also injecting enough seriousness to make the story interesting as well. I think the balance is probably decent.

The current description reads: "Amy (don't call me Amaryllis) Potter never went to Hogwarts, but the Goblet of Fire makes her a compelled competitor in the Triwizard Tournament. Will three years of tutelage by the Dynamic Duo see her through the treacherous tasks? Will being Batgirl help her beat the villainous Voldemort? And what's with that bewitching yet bothersome, bushy-haired bookworm? Tune in to find out!"

Yes, it's a FemHarry. Yes, the pairing is with Hermione (though it's a rocky road, since she hasn't had Harry's or Ron's moderating influences) Raised by Bruce Wayne and alongside Dick Grayson, at some point Amy found out their secret and demanded to be let in, which they reluctantly did. Now she's Batgirl, with no knowledge of magic and expected to compete. Absolutely no one is prepared for her, though Dumbledore seems to know more than he's letting on.

I've written it in first person, which I've never done before, and it's short at only around 50k words. Between the two, it was difficult to get much character development in (outside the main character, of course). I doubt I'll end up doing a sequel, but I'm ending it in a way that leaves sequels open.
