Maybe they're not and it's just a matter of perception but from what i've seen there seem to be a /lot/ of Dark!Harry fics and they tend to have high amounts of likes/faves/kudos ect. Why is the idea of a dark Harry so popular?


** Readers are understandably frustrated with a lot of the angsty, overly-moralized rationalizations Harry had for his actions. A lot of Harry's problems could be solved by just not being such a doormat,

- "Let's just never tell anyone how abusive and terrible the Dursleys are because that would be embarrassing and I don't value my own safety or happiness."
- "Ron's kind of a jerk, but I'm too desperate for friendship to ever call him out on it."
- "Sure, Ron! Of course I'll duel Malfoy at midnight even though I have no idea how to do that and am clearly uncomfortable with the idea."
- "Why sure Hagrid, of course I'll help you cover up the fact that you've smuggled a dragon into the castle!"
- "Of course I'll go to your death day party instead of being allowed to mourn the day my parents died."
- "Sure, Dumbledore! Of course I'll go on a dangerous mission through time to rescue this prisoner whom you could totally save yourself if you weren't pathologically afraid of political power."
- "I'll just let this teacher literally torture me for hours every night, because I'm gonna prove how tough I am!"
- "Fine, sigh, I guess I can let this teacher who hates me for petty, childish reasons mind rape me for a semester because Dumbledore's always right. (except for letting a dark lord into the castle twice, leaving Sirius in prison, allowing me to be forced into a deadly competition, and letting a woman who's torturing students into the school, etc)."
- "Oh, woe is me! My father was an asshole when he was a kid! I guess that means Snape is totally justified in being a petty vindictive dick to his child for half a decade."
- "Wow, Snape was my mom's violent, racist, and obsessive stalker!? And he 'cared for me' by being a spiteful petulant manchild and actively making my life worse whenever he could!? What a saint!!! I'll name my children after him."
- "Welp. Looks like I've got to walk to my death! And the moral of the story, kids, is to sacrifice your own health and happiness for others because that's what love is! (and totally not how abusive relationships perpetuate)"

So... yeah, you can see why there would be a strong (equally angsty and moralizing) push in the opposite direction where Harry is 'bold' and 'driven' and never afraid to call people out (i.e. be a self-righteous dick for the flimsiest of reasons) and 'down with authority!' which the fandom has labeled as "dark" because it's counter to the fannon interpretation of Dumbledore's overly passive "light".

*** I would just like to point out for the death day one, i'm pretty sure Harry had zero idea at the time that his parents died on Halloween. Didn't he find that out in later books? Even if he didn't, we've clearly seen Harry doesn't spend Halloween day mourning in other books so the death day one is kinda unfair as that ones not so much being a doormat as it is just being friendly, even if Nicholas was a tad manipulative in trying to get Harry to go.

​

And as for Sirius, although this is conjecture, it might actually be for the best Harry and Hermione did it instead of him. Hermione already knew the rules to keep Harry in check and importantly, Fudge believes the two of them to be under a confundus curse. If they were caught, they could escape punishment simply by using that excuse.

​

Dumbledore however is likely a bit more noticeable then two teenagers, and might have been at a worse risk of being spotted. Even if he were not, perhaps Dumbledore alreaady knew what Harry saw across the lake? If he worked that out , then he'd immediately work out he had to send Harry back.

​

The rest I agree with, just those two I feel have more legitimate potential reasons for occurring.

It's likely I'm mixing up fanon and canon there.

​

#+begin_quote
  And as for Sirius...
#+end_quote

I could see that being the case. Though (and I admit there's no way for Harry to be aware of this at the time) Dumbledore was canonically afraid to take up the position of Minister and the fact that he never had the political power to oppose the deatheaters is entirely a problem of his own making.

​

Neither of these are really valid criticisms of canon Harry. Honestly, none of them are: he's an 11 year old kid who was abused/neglected so it's unreasonable to expect him to have great self esteem. But we're talking about why fans would get frustrated, so the general fanon interpretation is more relevant I think.

** [[/u/vg65][u/vg65]] already wrote an excellent essay about this topic, so I merely want add one more point:

Many readers hate the fact that canon good guys only won through a large amount of Deus Ex Machina, author fiats, plot armors, and luck. Bad guys had to be dumbed down into oblivion at key moments, so the good guys could pull off a pathetic Pyrrhic victory at the end.

Throughout the series, good adult guys are incompetent, negligent, reactive, and useless. Even the much loved McGonagall hasn't done much for Harry until almost the very end. And the "Flight of 7 Potters" is such an epitome of stupidity that the canon orthodoxy center [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] railed hard against it last night.

Lastly the Trio, although JKR wanted them to get all accolades, she didn't want to write them as very competent either. They must not have political acumen, strategic brilliance, and tactical competence. They will rush into dangerous situations mindlessly and generally let luck (or the author) sort things out.

There's no wonder that thousands canon plot haters exist.

****** No, there are several options to avoid that:

- Make Harry and co face off Voldemort *after* Hogwarts
- Make Dumbledore and adult good guys useful, since Voldemort is pretty much a loner tyrant, contrast that with good guys' much better teamwork. If you (JKR) want to emphasize friendship, then make friends useful and contribute in a meaningful way!
- Make the Scarcrux give Harry a major power boost, maybe give Ginny a similar one from the Diary

You will be surprised how just a little boost in good adult guys' competence can change the plot, please read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]] to get an idea.

I'm gonna walk back my earlier statement a little, ridiculous power progression isn't the /only/ way for three kids to beat the thrice-their-age genious, it's merely the easiest way to change it so that the victory isn't a pyrrhic one.

** There was and still is a dedicated forum/website that is partial to these stories: [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/]]

A lot of the older authors whose stories have become 'classics' (think jbern, rorschach's blot, etc.) were part of this group. From what I could gather, this site started because back then there were a lot of fluffy, cute-sy Harry Potter fanfics that weren't well written. So a club of sorts was formed where authors would write the 'serious stuff' a.k.a. stories with darker themes. They would hang out and get criticisms for their stories before publishing them on FFN. This is why sometimes you see authors notes thanking people on the DLP for the critiques. Memorable Dark!Harry stories with good grammar came into being because their writers had an incredible support group. And people liked that. Years later, the elements of dark!Potter stories became a cliches that just kept on perpetuating.

*** Interestingly enough, I think the long, serious fantasy AU stuff now (not necessarily Dark Harry) has more popularity (at least on this sub) than the fluffy stuff and shipfics. HPMOR probably had a lot of influence on that; even if it isn't a serious fantasy AU whatsoever, it went fairly mainstream and brought a lot of more general fantasy/sci-fi readers into the HP fandom. From what I understand, Prince of Slytherin and the like would have had a hard time gaining traction back in the early fandom the way those kinds of fics are popular now.

It's hard to make a blanket statement, though, because a lot of the traditional old-school fanfic has moved over to AO3 and this sub is very FFN-heavy. Every idea "against the books" has also pretty much run out; a lot of great fics these days are also reactions to earlier tropes, and wouldn't exist without previous trends.

Money also plays a really big role in this.

You can practically be a murderer (Lucius Malfoy, Bellatrix Lestrange) or at least a petty rascist - you will be redeemed in this fanfics as long as you have money.\\
Poorer characters like the Weasleys (because let's be honest: they aren't really poor, they own a house, and their father is a ministry employee; they are lower middle class) are most likely always evil and gold diggers (never mind that it is canon that Harry has to trick Ron to take a present from him, but who cares).

Explaining: I like Harry as an Antihero, but I hate it when he becomes Death Eater and all that crap, because of course, Voldemort destroyed his life and killed his parents, but then he chooses to become a slave to the man...

The funny thing is that you want to write an Independent!Harry where he voluntarily becomes a marked slave of Voldemort. Have you ever seen anything so contradictory?

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
