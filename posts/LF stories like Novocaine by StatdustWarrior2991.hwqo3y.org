I.e. Harry working towards societal and cultural progress of the Wizarding World through business and/or politics. Possibly through Peverell, Potter, or Black inheritances. No Dark Lord Potter or Evil Harry please.

Any story that deal with Peverell heritage would also be interesting if anyone's got something to recommend.

Thanks!!


** There's something similar in linkffn(The Accidental Animagus).

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** The Right of Conquest - linkffn(12525734) - This is the only story I know that is similar to Novocaine. A little bit of a darker/realistic take but it certainly is a good story.

  A few weeks after the Battle of Hogwarts Harry gets a letter from Gringotts about his accounts. It turns out that he just inherited a lot from Voldemort! Who knew that the Right of Conquest was still a thing? Now, Harry doesn't just have property and money but ownership of lives as well. Will they accept his offer of redemption? Will they ever heal from the horrors of war?
