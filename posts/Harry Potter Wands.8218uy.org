I read a lot of story's where harry has a different character but still get the same wand as canon harry, it just don't make sense do writer just forget to change or do they find it unimportant ?


** Well, if those Harrys still have the bit of Voldy soul inside them, I'm fine with it. It's enough for me.

** One theory is that the piece of Voldemort's soul in Harry slightly affected what wand Harry would get; Harry's wand was the twin to Voldemort, so it isn't unreasonable to say that the Phoenix wand choosing Harry was partly because of the Voldemort soul shard. That being said, it's possible/likely that the Phoenix wand would have chosen Harry /anyway./

This theory isn't actually confirmed, just a theory. If we assume that it's true, though, it helps explain why Harry's with different personalities still get the same wand.

Another possibility is that writers still want Priori Incantatem shenanigans to ensue, in which case Harry getting a different wand is a bad idea.

Or it's just laziness/forgetfulness.

** In one of my stories, Harry has the Horcrux removed (without either party knowing what exactly it was) and then his old wand isn't working for him properly. He then is taken to another wand shop since Olivander's whole "Terrible but great" speech creeped him out and unknowingly ends up with a Gregorowich remake of Lily's wand (due to her protection still being active).

** I personally see the same wand thing as Fate interfering with the choice, Harry is the only one destined to defeat Tom, yes Neville was close but coming in second still makes you the first loser. Harry and Tom are two sides of the same coin but are still the same coin. Their magics resonate on a far higher plane than just they share a Phoenix tail core. This is why the feathers dropped at the same moment, it's why not everyone who has a Fawkes Phoenix core wand can preform Priori Incantum with Tom or Harry. Fawkes became a different after that moment in time like you aren't the same being you were two days ago, the feelings you experienced between then and now changed things about you, how you deal with anger or happiness or frustration. Fawkes changed since then but in that one second two perfectly twinned Feather fell.

*** Actually, this makes me think of something. Neville never got the chance to try what would become Harry's wand. Like Ron, he had a secondhand wand - his father's.

That would make an interesting canon divergence point. Neville could have beaten Harry to the Priori Incantum wand if he had gotten the opportunity to get a wand of his own. He would have had a better suited wand and would likely have been a more confident wizard because his magic was better controlled and more responsive.

**** I think not, because Neville isn't the chosen one, no matter how close he was that just reinforces that he ISN'T. I don't think The Holly Wand would even respond to Neville like the Blackthorn Wand didn't work for Harry.

***** I think I will agree to disagree with this. Neville could have been the Chosen One. Unless the premise goes with the idea that everything prophesied must be set in stone with no wiggle room or alternate interpretation, that it was always going to be Harry versus Voldemort no matter what, then Neville would have been just as valid.

Harry was chosen by Voldemort because he was a halfblood. It was the Rule of Cool that made that decision, unless I'm forgetting another motivation.

Neville was instrumental in fighting Voldemort and his forces. He killed Nagini. He helped lead the DA at Hogwarts in the Trio's absence. He was every bit as valuable as Harry was while living in enemy territory, keeping children safe, and helping the students learn to fight. His tragic family upbringing was also a great alternative version of the 'tragic hero orphan' trope.

I have long felt that if Harry had failed, if he had actually died, then Neville would have been the one to take Voldemort down if the prophecy truly needed to be fulfilled.

***** There is no chosen one. The whole point of the prophecy is that it's complete bunk. It only has as much power as the parties involved choose to give it.

** This isn't pertaining to Harry's wand, but as a writer, when I decided to give Snape a different wand for brewing, my editor and I discussed and researched it EXTENSIVELY. All my OCs have wands matched to their personality, preferences and main uses of magic too.
