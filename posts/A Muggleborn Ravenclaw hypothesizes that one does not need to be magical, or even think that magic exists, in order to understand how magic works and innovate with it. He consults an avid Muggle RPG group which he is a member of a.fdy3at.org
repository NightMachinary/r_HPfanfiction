He divvies out which members of the group learn what and poses all of the lessons he is sharing with them as a fun 'Worldbuilding' game in order to test his theory. He explains the rules and limitations of this pretend magical world; its laws of science; its constabulatory laws; its political scene; and so forth. He poses everything as a dream world of his own imagining into which he plugs his frustrations of how he is being treated at this new, foreign boarding school of his. He sends literary references and anecdotes of present or past events in Magical Britain or in the school and plays them off as fun story ideas, or Omake in the main plotline, or as examples of magical theories applied. His Muggle friends fall in love with this pretend world and study it and debate it with passionate fascination.

The Ravenclaw publishes some of his friends' written work in certain areas of magical theory or 'pretend' politics. Their 'professional and insightful input' causes waves. Some of their more controversial works get published in the Quibbler. And their innovations (for which Mr. Ravenclaw gets patents for them) make them very, very rich (even if they don't know it).

The RPG group is basically a group of fanfic authors who do not know that they are writing for and about a real, /actually real/ universe. A universe within which their Pen Names and inventions are becoming quite famous.


** Somehow I envisioned this muggle kid chatting about it to his old D&D group and they totally vibe on his new Homebrew campaign so much they help him innovate it to hell and back.

New Post

Hey guys, first of all, wow. You've clearly been busy since Christmas time. It sucks that my boarding school is so restrictive about internet access or I would be here working with you all. As it stands, I've only had a chance to skim through a few pages of your mad genius and wanted to make a post addressing something before I really get into it.

So to get started. Some of the newer thread participants need to reread the stickied posts at the beginning. This massive worldbuilding exercise we've been undertaking together already has a foundation that we are building on. Please don't suggest changing any underlying rules as that diminishes the work we've all done together within those constraints. That being said, if something seems inconsistent in the foundation rules feel free to bring it up. As xxXDragonbornHedgehodXxx pointed out last year, the requirement for wands is partially superfluous and wandless magic should be a possibility. Thank you once again Hedge, that's been a huge hit with my group at school.

I know that MagicWiz420 and his buddies have really taken to the spell crafting aspect of the world and I wanted to give you an update on their work. Those spells you crafted have worked great in our playtesting and are regularly employed by my friends at school, though I might pull the Thermite spell out of play for balance issues.

More good news is that my mom found some more books in the attic. Seriously, the amount of effort that whoever wrote this stuff to start with put into the lore building for this world is astounding. It's like Tolkein level. Anyway, these look like more textbooks, for arithmancy and ancient runes. Cursory glances this afternoon show that it should answer some of the questions that MagicWiz and potatologist had when they were trying to figure out the rules of spell crafting. Similarly LadyClarice should be interested in how the ancient runes lore compares with her dissertation work. I'll upload some scans as soon as I have a chance.

For those of you more interested in the story arcs we've been building I promise an update on where things have ended up for the political plotline as well as the magic school plot thread. I look forward to your analysis and where you think things are going to go from here.

I have lots more to tell you and A LOT of back posts to get through. I'll be on Discord tonight while I read through the old posts. I promise more updates on spellcrafting, new potions, herbology, and the results of our thoughts about a 13th use for dragon blood later. Looking forward to another summer with you guys.

RavenMudMage out.
