Jesus healed the sick, walked on water, multiplied food, turned water into wine - miraculous things to a muggle, but all actions that are very realistic for wizards.

When muggles learn about the wizarding world, how will it change Christian (and other religious) beliefs? What happens when miracles become commonplace, and 2000 years worth of religious belief is challenged?


** this is so fucking loaded religon and reddit is a bad idea

Honestly nothing changes, religion is built on faith plus Jesus is said to have raised the dead something magic can not do might lead to some issues though

Islam has less trouble due to the fact mohammad was merely a prophet and did not have magical powers as I recall

Buddism wouldnt be affected by magic from what I know of it

Lots of religious text books are thousands of years old and are often writting as a bunch of stories which can be taken dozens of different ways

so I imagine with the reveal of wizards some religious people would start looking at passages differently and being like it means this now

but lots of fun times ahead maybe violence, maybe not

** There's Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach) which has a religious subplot. Basically, there's a ghost of an old testament prophet who decides to interact with society again now that everyone knows about magic, and he's completely flabbergasted that there's now three abrahamic religions. He tries to reconcile Christianity, Judaism and Islam into one religion but only really achieves to create a fourth. Apart from him, reactions to magic vary from "cool, can we use it to power a spaceship?" to "wizards are all of the devil and must be killed!". There's multiple religious extremist groups targeting wizards, the common enemy manages to somehow get a group of Bible Belt christian extremists to ally with Al-Qaida, and they try to use a plane as a weapon against a wizarding community.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** Religious beliefs have long withstood challenges from all sorts of facts, so I can't see more information having much of an effect.

Many religious people would declare magic demonic, but that's more about how religion would effect magic than magic would effect religion.

** Most of those things are easily done via optical illusions now, and the whole faith based healing ... I guess it would be called a scam.. is still alive and well.

Quite frankly, the time for religions to die due to a lack of concrete proof or religions to be born our of the seemingly miraculous has passed. They are social institutions now. That is why new ones are usually called cults :p.

Also the reason first contact sci-fi doesn't usually imagine the death of abrehamic religions, even though it would seem to be the death kneel to the whole 'humans are gods perfect little creation' thing.

*** There've been theories as to how deistic religion may evolve in the wake of first contact, and possibilities range from "Well Jesus is just Humanity's god I guess" through "I guess it's time for a third Testament" and "Well then you probably fit into this book somewhere" to "Well then you need to be exterminated"
