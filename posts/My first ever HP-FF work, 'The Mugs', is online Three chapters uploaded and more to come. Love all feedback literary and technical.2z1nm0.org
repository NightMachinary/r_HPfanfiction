Hello,

This really is my first every online published fan fiction and it is part of a big project I am working on. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11112812/1/The-Mugs][The first three chapters of 'The Mugs' are now live on ff.net.]] I want to thank everyone here for their advice over the past few weeks and welcome everyone here to take a look. I'd love feedback not only on the story but on formatting and the technical stuff - never used ff.net before and I want to get it right!

If anyone really likes the story, I am also looking for volunteer artists to do a better front cover. You'll be credited of course. Please let me know what you think of the story so far; I have several new chapters ready to upload but was advised to keep it short for now and let people get a taste first.

Thank you all!

EDIT: So far, mostly negative. This is quite an experimental fiction and not to everyone's taste - if there is like a 90% DO NOT WANT ratio then I will hear it loud and clear. All honest opinions are worth a lot and will help future revisions and future new work. Thank you all!


** The setting is pretty amazing. But after reading its not for me, really.

But keep this going! This has some great potential, objectively speaking.

** To me, so far, it reads more like an OC story. A fic like this I would usually pass by, because partly how I choose my stories is based on who the main characters are - and so far the characters you have listed don't seem to be the main ones.

With that said, the world you've created is fascinating and I'd want to know more about it. I am used to reading the same stories told in much the same way (granted, there is comfort in that; it's why I continue to read the fics I do), but your story is original and I like the mystery and the feeling that I can't predict what happens next because I haven't read a similar concept before. Anyway, that was all to say, I like your idea. You should keep at it.

** Too slow a start and OC-full for me. Stories need to start out with a strong hook. Fanfic doubly so, as it is free and abundant, with tooth-rotting candy tropes everywhere -- something I feel you might be avoiding here to the betterment of your prose and the detrement of your popularity. It reads like high-concept litfic not fanfic. Take that as you will. I didn't enjoy it, though.

Despite the clearly well thought-out AU world, I just don't see where this is going. I don't even understand what the protagonist is (is it the world itself?) or will be doing (if they even exist) or what challenges need to be overcome. Am I rooting for the magicals? The...whatever they are Muggles? I simply feel lost. I can't identify with anything that happens or even see a picture being painted.

It is like an experimental foreign film someone also badly subtitled. I consider myself, well, quite smart and well traveled as to a history of pop culture, and at least aware of high culture. And I just don't see where this is coming from or heading towards.

Full disclosure, read chapter one half way (the actual one with...story? BTW don't post just a page of quotes. Fanfiction.net gets snippy about that sort of non-story-body thing) then skimmed the rest. Maybe I missed something.
