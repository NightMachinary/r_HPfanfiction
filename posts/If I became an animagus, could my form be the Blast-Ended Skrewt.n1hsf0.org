** They aren't naturally occurring, Hagrid crossbred some stuff to make them. Could someone be a Zorse animagi, or a Liger? My best guess is a big maybe? Probably a pretty rare outcome within an already rare skill.

** There's no canon proof that an animagus can not be magical.

I imagine if the blast ended skrewt were around for a while then maybe they could.

*** Maybe after they came into existence the possibility of an animagus form or patronus came into being at the same time. So McGonagall couldn't have become one, but anyone trying to become an animagi after Hagrid creates them might.

I wonder if extinct animals are a possibility then. Could someone have a T-rex patronus? Or a plesiosaur? Mastodon? Whatever that weird squirrel thing Scrat is supposed to be?

** All the animagus forms we see are animals very common in the UK, so it seems unlikely, but canon doesn't say it's impossible.

** No, Animagus form can only be mundane animal.

*** No proof for or against the existence magical animagi, so its for us to decide whether or not they exist inside our own personal headcanon.

**** I agree with your assessment. Personal reasoning for my answer is that it creates a floodgate of mary-sues and gary-stus with dragon/thestral/phoenix animagi. Moreover, we didn't see a single non-mundane animal animagus in series or mention of them in lore.

** Technically yes if the animagusnform is based on your personality however well that's your business not mine

Technically by Canon no but I'm gonna go out a leap and act like magic is sentient would it qualify blast ended skewerts as real animals or the fact that they are a horrific half breed which may or may not have uncontrollable gas passing that horribly pains them because it comes out as fire so yes but no
