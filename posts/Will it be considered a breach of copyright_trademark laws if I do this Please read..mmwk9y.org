** If you were hoping to monetise it you would not be able to use any of the same characters (outside of ones that have been borrowed from other legends like Merlin) or universe specific terms like muggle, Quidditch, Hogwarts, etc. The concept of there being magic, of children going to magic schools, of there being a secret part of society, etc, that's all fine. But you should consider that people don't tend to like "rip offs".

*** Yep, exactly. Another book series I read awhile ago (don't wanna name it because author isn't a good person) definitely had similar themes to hp but it had its own worldbuilding, magic system, etc.

Essentially you need to change things enough to make it your own. Maybe non magic people are called "mortals", if you want to lean into power dynamics, or maybe people are categorized as "ordinary" and "extraordinary"

Or think about how the magic world is concealed. Is it well integrated, such that any regular community might have secret magic locations? (eg. leaky cauldron, 9 3/4) Maybe it's more distinct, and very difficult to travel from one world to another. Perhaps you have to get a license to transport people back and forth.

Basically just watch your writing for specific words or phrases that were invented for hp. If you find any, replace them with alternate terms and spend some time thinking about if the concept is too close. (ie. parseltongue is an invented word for hp, but you can still have characters speak to snakes if you want. Animagus is an hp term, but shapeshifting isn't a new concept.)

Sorry I got a bit carried away, but I hope this helps!

**** This actually really helps. Thank you! I still am on the rough idea stage, but hopefully I'll have a plot ready soon! Well, soon by writing standards.

*** I was actually hoping to. If I want to monetize it, I should probably invent a new world, shouldn't I? Way different than the HP world?

**** Absolutely. You /cannot/ make money from someone else's work. If it helps, write it in HP first and then alter things.

**** Yes. It doesn't need to be radically different, but don't just clone Harry Potter. Make something interesting and intriguing.

What's one thing you wish the books had focused on more?

***** How they're allowed to still have literal slaves.. Oh, and the fact that the books mostly wanked the British wizarding world, and the British way of doing Magic. Even Fantastic Beasts mainly focused on USA and Britain, so I'd probably focus more on other ways of using Magic.

It's still an idea, not yet a plan even. So I'll have a lot of preparation to do before I even begin writing.

****** JKR explained away the slaves part by saying they “had no other purpose outside of servitude.” Kinda messed up IMO.

******* Definitely messed up. Then, when it was sort of implied that Hermione was Black, or descended from Blacks, then she was the only one being bothered by the slaver. And the whites dismissed it as nothing.

Don't know if JKR implied it, or the fans did.
