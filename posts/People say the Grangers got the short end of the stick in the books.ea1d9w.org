** Harry Potter doesn't have /any/ positive muggle characters. For a series that later focuses on the war against prejudiced genocidal terrorists killing muggles and muggleborns, this is a glaring absence.

She's not a doctor. It's not actually her responsibility to ensure that Merope lives, any more than it is that a guy giving CPR to a stranger, or someone pulling a victim of a car crash out of their vehicle before it explodes. She did what she could, which was more than she had to.

A sick pregnant girl showed up at the door of an orphanage. The father, if he were tracked down, would have disavowed the kid in a heartbeat. Let's not pretend that it isn't what it clearly looks like.

He wasn't treated any differently than the other kids. He was just cruel, even as a child. Some kids have personality disorders.

****** I can believe he wasn't treated any differently that other kids in orphanages at the time, like in this [[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/28/world/europe/tuam-ireland-babies-children.html][New York Times Article.]]

Some excerpts:

“In 1947, a government health inspector filed a report describing the conditions of infants in the nursery: “a miserable emaciated child...delicate...occasional fits...emaciated and delicate...fragile abscess on hip...not thriving wizened limbs emaciated...pot-bellied emaciated...a very poor baby...”

That year, 52 died.” In that one orphanage.

Another excerpt from the same article, about how people recently happened across the remains. This one orphanage killed far too many children to bury properly, so they apparently just stacked the corpses in a disused septic tank.

“One morning, close to Halloween, a neighbor told her that a boy was running about with a skull on a stick.

The boy, Martin, said he had found his prize in the overgrown muck, and there were loads more.

What the boy mistook for a plastic toy was actually the skull of a child, with a nearly complete set of teeth. “That's not plastic, Martin,” Mary recalled saying. “You have to put it back where you found it.”

Mary and a couple of neighbors followed the boy through the weeds and rubble, across the soft wet ground. Suddenly, the earth beneath her feet began to give, and down she fell into some cave or tunnel, with just enough light to illuminate the subterranean scene.

As far as she could see were little bundles stacked one on top of another, like packets in a grocery, each about the size of a large soda bottle and wrapped tight in graying cloth.”

It's a miracle any kids came out of those terrible institutions alive and sane.

Dumbledore is right there, evaluating things, and sees no need to step in.

I don't know why fanon feels the need to write the abuse way worse then what it was, it's pretty bad in canon.

Living in a cupboard under the stairs, when they had two other bedrooms he could have been in?

Over sized clothes aren't a bad thing, but Vernon had a good job, was able to take Dudley to a good school, buy Dudley plenty of toys, they could have bought Harry clothes that actually fit, and didn't.

Plus the whole "Harry Hunting" and don't tell me it was boys rough housing or what not, rough housing is both of them attacking each other, Harry would often run away from Dudley and the other bullies.

Being forced to do a ton of chores, when Dudley wasn't? I'm fine with children being given chores, but they should be reasonable, within the rightful age range.

Plus the verbal abuse, calling his parents worthless, that he was a freak, et cetra.

She wasn't reporting to him. She wasn't involved in the magical world at all. She was just there in case of an emergency. She wasn't an agent or spy or whatever.

True, and yet Dudley wasn't given chores, that's what I'm saying. I'm fine with children being given chores, but Harry was given chores and Dudley wasn't, that's unfair, and could be a sign of neglect or a form of abuse. (Abuse doesn't have to be sexual, verbal or physical)

They told him that his parents died in a car crash and that his father was a worthless drunk. I mean okay, if you don't want to tell him about magic and decide to tell him they died in a car crash, that's one thing, but they didn't have to say his father was worthless and was a drunk.

The fact that she didn't have an established way to talk to Dumbledore during Book 5 suggests that she was not. She doesn't own an owl and she almost certainly wouldn't have been permitted to live in a Muggle neighborhood with other active magical methods of communication (like a Floo network connection, which Arthur specifically points out is incredibly rare).

3 bedrooms (master, Dudley's, Harry's). Vernon is a Smeltings alumnus, and thus Dudley would likely get preferential treatment/reduced tuition. Where is it stated that they could give Harry clothes?

They never said that to Harry. Marge asked what his father did, and Vernon told her that he was unemployed. Marge said that he was probably a drunk, as well. Vernon probably would have come up with something else if he hadn't been put on the spot, too.

****** You're making a weird argument. I'm assuming someone told Merope to go to the orphanage because that's the place for destitute pregnant women. It was literally the job of someone there to take care of her, not necessarily themselves, but by calling a midwife.

Merope told the orphanage the father's name. We don't know if Merope mentioned that he was legally her husband, but either way, he was at least financially responsible for his offspring. It's pretty standard for rich men to pay for the upbringing of their bastards.

Oh, here's a thought: what if the orphanage did track down the Little Hangleton Riddles and extract hush money from them, which would be standard procedure, but just pocketed it, so little Tom didn't see a penny?

Even if Tom was treated the same as the other kids, do you have any idea about the cruelty of orphanages in Britain at the time? You can google for news stories about that disused septic tank full of the skeletons of hundreds of babies and children that was uncovered a few years ago. There are way too many news stories like that. I'm sure many kids raised in such horrific conditions would have become dark lords if they'd had the ability. As it was, many just wound up with mental health problems, if they survived at all.

It was storming, on New Year's Eve, and Merope died literally an hour after arriving. I don't think a midwife is that easy to get a hold of.
