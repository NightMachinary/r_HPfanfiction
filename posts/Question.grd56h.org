Okay, so I've been searching for a specific Harry Potter fanfiction for a while, and I just can't find it, so I joined this app to see if anyone can help me out. All I remember about the fanfiction is that Harry time travels (or travels to an au, but I can't remember) into the middle of a Death Eater meeting. He then proceeds to tell Voldemort that the future Voldemort sent him there as an ally to help fight for the dark. I believe there was Dumbledore bashing as well as slash.

It would be amazing to read the story again, it was probably one of the most memorable fanfictions I have ever read, and I hope you guys can help me out. Thanks a bunch!


** Oh my god, guys I found it!!!!! If anyone is interested the story is called Shaping the Future. It can be found on Fanfiction.net and was written by Charmed Artist. Have a great day!
