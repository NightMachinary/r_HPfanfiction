:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's a harry x Draco fic where Draco “betrays” Harry and becomes the new Voldemort and he has Harry's child in secret. Then he kills all the death eaters in one go because they are all connected in a spell of some sort and almost dies but they maybe have a happily ever after. I know. It's wild. But it's a damn good fic if you ask me.


** You'll likely have better luck on [[/r/Drarry]] than here.
