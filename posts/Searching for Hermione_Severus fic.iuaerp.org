Hi, I remember reading a book where Hermione time travels back in time before she starts Hogwarts in her old body. She drinks I think a potion that makes her look older. She goes to apothecar/potion shop to buy more ingredients. That's where she meets Severus. They start talking and eventually dating. When it's time for her to go to school he recognizes her and even helps her get rid of the horuxes.

If someone could please help me find the name of the fix I would really appreciate it. Thanks in advance.
