Been doing a bit of a James Bond movie marathon for the past few days and it's given me an itch for any fanfics that use the spy fiction genre as the basic framework for their story.

*** Oh dude that is so unfair. A good and interesting idea like that with only 2 chapters. If you ever get the notion to pick the fic back up please keep me in the back of your head.

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] It's been a while since I've read it, but iirc it's a non-magic Alex Mack AU where Hogwarts is a spy school.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies]] I always got the James Bond's vibe from it. Not in a spy sense but secret agent kinda?

And there was one that I can't remember the title or the plot, but maybe someone will. It was Harry on vacation, but tried to be as anonymous as possible. He accidently crafted this persona that was deemed by all international Ministers as some sort of unknown Agent. It was all miss communication, and miss interpretation, but he had to roll with it. I think. I can't remember it well. I remember that he bought some gadgets in the first chapter so no one would see him or something and he put it wrongly so he was seen just not as himself. And he fought some random Death Eaters in a bar in some European country and run away. And later there was investigation of it and they were like 'so mysterious who was it why did he do it' but it was all an accident and it basically goes like that? And I don't know if it's the same fic but I have this scene in my head that Harry is traveling by a balloon with OC friends and has kinda mad scientist vibe. My memory is so bad.
