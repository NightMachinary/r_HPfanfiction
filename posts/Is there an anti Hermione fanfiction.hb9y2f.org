Something like Hermione the Shiteater but less gross? I don't mind violence or gore. I prefer it, actually, but Hermione the Shiteater makes me shudder. I would like something with similar sentiments but less filth. Any pairing except Voldemort or Tom Riddle paired with anyone other than Bellatrix is fine and so is no pairing.

Thank you! And no hate, please.
