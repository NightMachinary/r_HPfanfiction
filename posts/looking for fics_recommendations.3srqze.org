a genre i enjoy but cant find lost of fics in is where harry goes to an alternate world and meets a female counter self and they fall in love or work together. there was a never fic i liked and have no idea if there is anything similar : the soul within, in that story harry has a "voice" in his head and he tries to give her a body if there is anything similar i would like to know. thank you.


** Theres linkffn(equal and opposite) but harry and fem!harry dont really work together, and harry does some dark stuff so keep that in mind.

Linkffn(11160991) has harry summoned to a world with a fem!harry, but i stopped after a few chapters before she was introduced.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

  Left bitter and angry when his female self leaves him, Harry decides he will do anything for revenge. Nobody will stand in his way. Because desperation and anger can turn even the most noblest of hearts into darkness... HarryFemHarry COMPLETE

  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Holly/Harry/we're not sure what'll happen. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in subject to entanglement).
