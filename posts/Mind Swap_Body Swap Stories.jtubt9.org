Character A suddenly (Not through Polyjuice) becomes character B

I'd like if they can learn things about the other and become better people or have a better understanding of that someone.

Anyone can be the main character, can be any length, can be on any site, can be old or new

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes etc (Doesn't have to focus on a pairing).

The mind/body swap doesn't have to be the full part of the story though it can.

Would rather NOT have Weasley Bashing/Weasley Manipulation, No Weasley's using Harry for his fame/fortune, NO Ginny giving Harry love potions, no Ron abusing Hermione, etc.

Am fine with male pregnancy as long as it's not detailed

Can be through a magical object/spell/time travel, etc. No self inserts though.


** linkffn(Rules of Conduct by BittyBlueEyes). I haven't read this one yet, so all I can say is that Fred runs afoul of one of Hermione's potions experiments.

linkffn(The Dark Lord's Much Needed Vacation by childofflameandwave). Voldemort decides to go on vacation in a different body. He wasn't expecting Harry to end up in his.

If your restriction on polyjuice is because it's only a temporary measure, Luna devises a method of permanent changes using polyjuice in linkffn(To Walk A Mile in someone else's Shoes by IamMegumi).

  Dark Lord Voldemort needed a vacation. He even had the perfect plan so that his followers would not even notice his weeklong spree. Too bad his closest horcrux resided in Harry James Potter, the "Brat-Who-Lived"!

  Harry hasn't always had things easy. But with the defeat of Voldemort, maybe he can finally get some rest. But make no mistake, it has taken a toll on Harry. He has grown tired of being the famous Harry Potter, only to discover there may be other options.

  There are certain segments of the Harry Potter fandom which more or less idolize Hermione. You know, the people who think that Hermione really should have been the main character of the stories all along, because she was the only one of the trio with a brain. Now, I don't necessarily think JKR did a great job portraying her as very intelligent in the series, but I'm still one of those people who wants to see what she could have been if she were actually the main character, and not just the brainy sidekick (or, as in Mary Potter, a mostly-independent secondary protagonist doing her own thing on the sidelines). So this is that story: What happens if you put Hermione Granger's mind into Harry Potter's body, effectively making her the Boy Who Lived?So she wakes up in his body, and vice versa. While he revels in his new-found loving family (which more than makes up for the strangeness of waking up as a girl), she drastically re-evaluates her priorities, endeavoring to act like the story-book heroines with whom she is so familiar and deal with this unpleasant development as efficiently as possible.

** you belong to me (i belong to you) by Child_OTW on ao3 is one of my fave fics period but it's veryyyyy possibly triggering! can't directly link it bc of sub rules on noncon + underage stuff as well (its not glamorized or anything tho). def check it out if the warnings don't bother you. it's a time travel + a one way body swap? like character A becomes character B, but since its a character A time travelling into the past, character B doesn't become character A. it's not 100% what you're looking for but i can't NOT recommend it lol.
