:END:
I remember when Draco and Harry met on the train Draco goes "the Hufflepuff." Also, Dumbledore and Snape (in the beginning) think that Harry is the reincarnation of Voldemort or something. (I'm pretty sure it's a time travel fic but you can never be too sure.)

If you can help me find this please do, I can't for the life of me remember what the title is.

  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.(cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)
