** It's a terrible idea if you don't rewrite the plot of the entire series as well. Dumbledore is one of the biggest problems in canon and you won't have any idea what to do with him, especially during the early books.

Like, what are you going to write about during book 2 when students are being petrified in his school? Is he going to discuss politics with Fudge while the 12 year olds solve the problem?

*** The right way to do it would be to introduce things that are totally outside of canon that Dumbledore has to deal with. Explain away his absentmindedness and leaving everything to children to solve by him fixing problems no one else even knew existed. Political issues (but ugh, not too much), maybe international wizarding issues (canon has him creating portkeys on a whim, right?), or maybe Hogwarts is way more dangerous than we realize and he spends most of his time as headmaster dealing with the dangers and keeping the students safe without anyone other than the staff realizing.

**** Okay, yeah, I like some of those ideas, but I think it is fair to say that this falls under the purview of "rewriting the plot of the entire series".

I don't think you can still say that you are writing the series from Dumbledore's point of view if you do any of this. You are writing something completely different from the series from Dumbledore's point of view.

  Harry proudly accepted the title of 'Dumbledore's man through and through' but how little does he, do we realize that Dumbledore was 'Harry's man through and through? Their years together, now through Albus's eyes, see the bond that these two share.
