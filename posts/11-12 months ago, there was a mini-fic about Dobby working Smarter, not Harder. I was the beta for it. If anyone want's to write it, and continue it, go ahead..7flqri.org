The original author, and I wanted to continue working on it, but we got busy, so we decided to drop it, but here, near its 1 year anniversary, i wanted to revive it, and let the people who want it, have it.

If you are interested in writing the story, or helping out with it, leave a comment down below, and we can figure out something.
