See above. I'm looking for fics which are not set in Britain, and ideally not in America. *Anywhere* else is fine, as long as it's a part of the magical world we haven't seen.

Show me Bill in Egypt. Show me Eastern Europe with Viktor. Show me wizarding Australia, or Greece, or Japan. I have an itch that needs to be scratched!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146), has great world building as readers get to see actions in magical Australia, East Africa, and Mexico. In its companion piece [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076644/1/The-World-of-The-Accidental-Animagus][The World of The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(12076644), worldwide reactions to Voldemort's return are depicted. Then in its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], linkffn(12088294), magical Russia will play a major role.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  A series of one-shots in the Animagus-Verse showing the state of the magical world at the time of Voldemort's return. Some brace for war, while for others, life goes on. A bridge between The Accidental Animagus and Animagus at War.

***** Hey there, I just read your first chapter and I must admit that I'm quite impressed. I'm a sucker for stories dealing with remorse and tragedy, especially caused by one's own actions. The very fact that Tom does seem to show a semblance of "remorse" just as Harry had asked him in The Flaw in the Plan but yet still struggles to find a balance between his hateful ideology against the Muggles and even Goblins truly makes for an interesting read. Oh, and this takes place during Grindelwald's reign of terror...I have no doubt in my mind that the future Fantastic Beasts films will involve Tom Riddle but I've struggled to find fanfics that have a young Voldemort during Grindelwald's reign, so I'm truly glad I found yours. Following Half-Blood Prince, where we saw Tom Riddle's efficacious charm and manipulation, Voldemort's terrifying antics in the final chapter would have always made for a story about reflection. I don't quite believe Voldemort is redeemable but your style of writing is captivating and does make me pity the choices this young man will make and the havoc he ended up wrecking just a few decades from here on out. I'll be checking your later chapters in the morning coz I've got an assignment to complete tonight xD, but suffice to say you've hooked me. Oh, and the chapter names?! Darn it if they don't sound beautiful!! And I'll also be on the lookout for plotholes and inconsistencies if I find them, it just makes for a great excercise!! Cheers, mate! :))

***** If you want to, you can also read my story...be on the lookout for the 3rd Chapter "Misfortunes under the Mistletoe", because that's where the thriller and war elements start, the first two chapters are more sweet and romantic. I'm hoping to write longer chapters from here on out!!

(it's already down in the comments but I'm posting another link anyway xD)

Yes, the chapters are usually between 5500 and 7500 words. 4. Please do tell me of any inconsistencies if you find them.

** I've explored the Wizarding World in my AUs.

In "Patron", Magical France, the Balkans, the Magical Ottoman Empire, Jamaica, Scandinavia and Magical Bulgaria are visited. Viktor's wedding, for example, takes part in Bulgaria.

"Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider" is partially set in Egypt, though mostly in tombs and desert camps there as Bill and Petunia explore tombs and temples. "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis", the sequel, has the trio visiting the Caribbean and the Rainforest, so far.

"Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution" takes partially part in Magical France, Germany, Poland, Bulgaria (Where Viktor ends up leading a coup mostly against his will) and Russia.

**** Yeah, this was my first story, and it suffers from me trying to stick to the canon events in the books and trying to make sense of and take seriously all the children's books tropes (useless adults) and plot railroading (in the later books). That either leads to senile or evil Dumbledore - bashing either way since his canon actions and inactions do not fit his characterisation as a wise, benevolent wizard.

These days (and in my other stories) I go with "Fuck Canon, my Dumbledore's acting as a good, decent man would, not as a plot device". That means canon events do not happen or happen differently - a good man would never risk innocents to save the guilty, as canon Dumbledore did in book 6 when Draco tried to kill him. Ron and Hermione would never assume Draco was harmless after knowing the scumbag for years and seeing his father imprisoned after year 5. And so on.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** I'm writing a story about an elderly Harry and Hermione being called to action after World War 3 wrecked havoc on the Muggle worlds, and there's a brewing Civil War amongst all Magical Creatures. The next chapter I write is the one where Harry and Hermione will begin their journey and leave for Japan... Always thought it would be an interesting prospect, we know very little of the Japanese wizarding community. You can read the last chapter I wrote if you want some insight into my writing style and if you want to commit to the story. I update regularly!!

  This tale intends to chronicle Harry and Hermione's adventures and lives well into their old age after World War 3.It starts off sweet but quickly heads into the thriller territory, and some parts of it are truly intense, going to never before seen places in Wizarding World with a Civil War brewing up, and a mysterious Auror with an agenda of his own. Romantic Thriller.

** The New Skin series is both complete and severely underrated. It goes to South America and Canada in addition to Britain and the U.S., and it has really interesting magic and narrative voice to boot.

  From a narrow escape from death at the end of the war Snape embarks on a new life. Yet how can a single escape be enough when it's not over? How can he move forward when the past is close on his trail? Rated for language, some violence.

  (Continuation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) It's easy to make big plans and ask big questions, but harder to follow them through. Find out what happens to Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, Hermione, Draco, and everyone else once they grow into their roles as leaders, leave the shelter of Hogwarts, and venture out into a wider world.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
