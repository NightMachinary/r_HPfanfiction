I'm looking for fics in shich Harry 'returns'. Whether that be because he was locked in Azkaban, he was though dead, he faked his own death, or he was kidnapped. I'm also looking for fics in which Harry is different than expected when arriving at Hogwarts. Whether that be through acting more Slytherin, being more powerful, or (and I've seen this before with beauxbatons but sadly that story wasn't finished) he went to a different magical school /before/ arriving at Hogwarts.

Thank you in advance.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13306212/][*/The Revelation Of Harry Forrester/*]]

Sirius flees with Harry to America, He gets killed by death eaters leaving Harry in a muggle hospital in Boston. Harry gets raised with a musical obsession. He subconsciously integrates his magic into his playing. Due to a charm Sirius put on Harry during the chase he doesn't get discovered by the American magical authorities until he has a big burst of magic during a concert.

Warnings: Mild manipulative Dumbledore, Wizarding world bashing. Is like half musical theory.

Harry runs away from the dursleys at a young age and lives on the streets. He doesn't get his Hogwarts letter for a few years because the place he found that hides him from Dumbledore's tracking charms also hides him from owls.

  Sirius escapes with Harry after the Potters die. He makes it all the way into the US before Death Eaters catch up to them and he has to abandon Harry. Now Harry is alone. With no name, no history, and no trace. Then, after 13 years, Harry returns to Britain as a very different person. With a completely different view of Magic. A view that breaks everything. H/Hr.

  Harry Potter: the boy-who-lived, the boy-who-ran-away, the boy-who-is-missing, the street urchin, the boy-who-hung-around, the survivor, the boy-who-changed-everything. AU since 31 Oct 1981. Rated T for some language and violence. A HHr story with a poor relationship with Dumbledore.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

  When the Hogwarts letters go out in 1991, Harry Potter doesn't receive one. A year before, the Dursley family sent the child to an orphanage in London with a different name and a new identity. Growing up in London alone, Harry may escape the abuse of the Dursley's but he enters a world of neglect and handwork. When he's 13, he befriends a blue haired boy called Teddy, whom over the years becomes the closest of friends Harry could have asked for.At 16, Harry is getting on with his life just fine. He's got two jobs, college, a great group of friends and an endless supply of cigarettes to keep his hands from uncontrollably shaking. And then, Teddy's parents announce they're coming down for the week and suddenly Harry has people coming up to him saying he's supposed to be dead and that a Dark Lord is after him.
