Imagine, if you will, a story where Life Debts magically prevent a person from putting their savior in mortal danger. Harry, having inherited James and Lily's Life Debts, finds he cannot knowingly put his life at risk.

Sorcerer's Stone is behind that trap door? Well, that Cerberus is pretty big and nasty, we don't know what other traps are down there, and we know Snape is going after the Stone. Sorry guys, I gotta sit this one out. Dobby says I'll be in mortal danger if I go back to Hogwarts? I have to convince myself and magic that it's not really that bad, is it? Cursed bludger attacking me during the match? Wood, we need a reserve Seeker 5 seconds ago because I'm benching myself please and thank you.

And so on and so forth, as Harry has to find a way to help people and save the day without ever being danger of dying


** "Coward!" yelled Malfoy.

---

"Bloody hell Harry! I know bacon has a lot of grease and is bad for your system but... you gotta be effing kidding me!" said Ron.

---

"Ron, maybe we should listen to Professor Lockhart, he has a point with staying here," Harry said.

---

The twins run after Harry, "Come on mate! It's just a map! It won't do you any harm... don't you want to go to Hogsmeade?"

"No thank you,"

---

"No, Potter, potion ingredients do not come sliced. You have to use your knife," Snape sneered. Wondering all of his life choices.

---

"Floaties? Really?" asked Cedric.

"The rules allow me to look only near the shore of the Lake, right?" asked Harry.

---

"Come on Harry! You have to give me something to work with here!" said Sirius.

---

"You should all learn of Mr. Potter, " said Professor Umbridge, as everyone rolled their eyes, "He is a very committed student and knowns that theoretical magic is safe and all that you need."

---

Neville hits Harry in the head, "Man up!"

---

"Are you serious? Sex can be dangerous?! I'm fucking naked here and you come with that rubbish!?" thundered Ginny, she took Harry's hand and forced it onto her breast, "Are you having a heart attack already?!"

---

Dumbledore sighs in frustration looking at the Gryffindor boy. "I think sometimes we sort people too soon."

---

"You're such a pussy, Harry," said Hermione, crossing her arms, as Harry tried to talk her out of Horcrux Hunt.

---

"I'm sorry my lord, we will have to kill everyone and blow the castle up to get to the boy, " said Lucius, "I'm being told that he is hiding under his bed in the Gryffindor tower."

*** This goes a bit farther than I'd intended, but it's a good example of how extreme it could be. I can't decide if it would be funnier for Harry to more or less try to jump into danger and be physically held back by magic to the point it's like running into an invisible wall, or if he gets a sort of "spidey sense" and just nopes out of every mildly dangerous situation, similar to what you wrote.

I wonder if Voldemort, when he uses Harry's blood, would inherit the Life Debt as well, with magic essentially identifying him as Harry because they share the same blood.

*** Sorta like an imperio that he cant fight, crested by Dumbledore when he crested the blood wards around the dursley residence would be funny as hell.

Imagine him trying to break it, or Harry litterally trying to save someone, only for him to loose control completly, walk away and be normal again.

** Owing yourself a debt of any kind seems like an interesting topological exercise - since he's both the debtor and the debtee, logically it'd be a zero-sum debt so nothing would happen. Then again, magic and logic don't really mix.

An interesting moment, if the Life Debt is purely "conserve your own life", would be learning of the prophecy - which would probably happen in the form of Dumbledore telling it to him, since no way is Harry going into the Department of Mysteries if there's a credible threat there.\\
"Neither can live while the other survives" so Harry goes full, one-track-mind, Voldemort needs to /die/. Every time Harry sees Voldemort, he uncontrollably starts shooting Killing Curses.

**** There's no age requirement to a Life Debt, canonically. Just depends on when you get the opportunity to repay it.

The only thing that happens, magically, upon adulthood is the Trace falling away - and that piece of magic was specifically created that way.

***** I would assume it goes under ordinary laws, that you would need a Guardians permisson to deal with debts and large economic purchases, or contracts in general.

Debts can be given when under the age of majority, but cant be handeled by indebted untill he or she is either emancipated or has reached adulthood.

****** I honestly don't think, given that a Life Debt is something /magic/ imposes, that the Ministry has anything to say about when Magic decides the debt has been repaid. They could try to legislate it, but it's out of their hands.

  or contracts in general.
#+end_quote

Evidence to the contrary there: Harry's name coming out of the Goblet constitutes a magically binding contract.\\
If that required the guardian's permission, the entire plot of Goblet of Fire wouldn't happen simply because "he's underage and clearly did this without his Guardian's permission, so it's void. He's not a Champion".\\
Ergo, legislation either doesn't apply to Magical contracts and debts, or your fanfic has an uneventful fourth year.

****** But is it even possible to legislate a Life Debt if it's magic that's not invoked purposefully? If so, will wizarding world laws follow real world logic? Would they follow a logic that only makes sense to wizards, or a logic that makes no sense but has to be followed because it's how magic works? Magic can be really really weird and I think that's something that should be explored more in fanfic.

** In code Geass, the main character has a power that enables him to order anyone to do one thing, ie, "shoot yourself!" And they do it immediately.

He asks someone on the brink of death to "Live!" and from then on that person scrabbles desperately to get out of lethal situations and fulfills the order in the face of incredible odds or a legitimate desire to sacrifice himself. Putting Harry under such a geas could make book 7 look really different

*** Yes! This is what I like about this idea. It can be as cracky, as scheme-y, as dramatic, as horrifying, or as exploratory as we want. Is Harry under a compulsion he can't escape? Does he use it to get out of stuff he doesn't want to do? What does it mean to owe a debt to oneself? How does he save the wizarding world when he has to walk away from situations where he knows he could die? It's a prompt with so much openness and so much to try and explore that I can't help but hope it takes off.

*** I'm not sure it's quite the same thing. Harry's sacrifice gives protection, but I reread and don't see where that protection specifically saved anyone's life. Without that, there's no Life Debt.

That said, if you wanted to make it work that way in fanfic, there's an argument to be made, and it would have some interesting repercussions after the war. Heck, depending on how liberal you want to be with it, you could argue that Harry saved the lives of everyone at Hogwarts when he defeated the basilisk. How do things change if every student from 5 years above him to 1 below owes him a Life Debt and can't put his life at risk?
