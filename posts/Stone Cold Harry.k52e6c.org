I saw a thing for Bad Ass Harry. In Harry's 4th year summer he saw the peak of Stone Cold in WWF (Hogwarts years gets moved up).

Harry lives his life like Stone Cold does.

The Weasely Siblings are faceish DX: Bill is Triple H, Charlie is X-Pac, Percy is like Rick Rude, The Twins are New Age Outlaws, Ron is Chyna, and Ginny is HBK.

Hermione is Kurt Angle (01) with the 3 I's.

Neville and Luna are the Hardy Boys (Neville is Matt while Luna jumps off everything like Jeff).

Cedric is Mick Foley and his never say died attitude.

Fleur is Lita and she doesn't care what people think about her.

Viktor is like the Rock.

McGonagall is Badass enough to be a American Badass Undertaker.

And finally Snape is Vince McMaohn with his hate towards Harry.

After Harry's name comes out of the Goblet he flips of Dumbledore and gives him a Stunner, which kicks off chaos.

Fleur climbs up on the head table and does a Moonsault off of it and lands Dean and Seamus.

Snape pushes Harry and replied with the double finger before Hermione Angle Slam him.

Ginny and Luna made some ladders and climb up.

Viktor nails Draco with a Rock Bottom.

Hermione and Viktor rolls Snape and Draco onto tables as Luna broke Draco in half with a Swanton Bomb and Ginny nail Snape's black heart with an elbow Drop.

Before Dumbledore could do anything Cedric put a dirty sock in Dumbledore mouth until McGonagall grabs the headmaster and sends him on his last ride through a table.

Harry stands on the head table piece that isn't broken and yells if you had fun give me a hell yeah. And Everyone yells Hell Yeah.

Dobby pop's in and gives Harry two beers at the Glass Shattered.
