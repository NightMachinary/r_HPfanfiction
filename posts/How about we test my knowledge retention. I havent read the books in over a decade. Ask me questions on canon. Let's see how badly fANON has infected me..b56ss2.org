****** I suppose the main reason would because than particular bit of fanon builds on what few sparse details we were given about the Potter family to reach a logical conclusion. It makes the world feel deeper, I suppose?

Fleamont came out of nowhere and was a completely new character with no previous links to any established characters. To me, it felt more like Rowling forgot about Charlus and Dorea when she was writing about James' family.

What even happened to those two? What was their story? How did they get married? When and how did they die? What happened to their unnamed son (who everyone assumed to have been James).

Rowling stated that Harry had no living family so that means Charlus, Dorea, their son and any potential grandchildren are dead. This made sense if you assumed Charlus and Dorea were Harry's grandparents and James their son. Without that assumption? We get a whole lot of questions.

What happened to them? How were they related to James? Will we ever get more information on them? Were they a detail Rowling included and then completely forgot about?

I don't think James and Sirius being cousins cheapens their friendship. Remember that Sirius hated his family. Wouldn't knowing James is the son of a Black made it less likely for them to become friends and not more? It also introduces another "good" Black. Slytherin being portrayed as the evil house is one of HP's often criticized flaws.

I also really liked the idea of Harry and Draco being cousins. Another very petty reason is that I like the name Charlus much better than Fleamont. It keeps to the Potter naming scheme.

**** Little Hangleton is definitely not Cornwall. The name is completely wrong for Cornwall, it's not Kernowek at all. We know Little Hangleton is approximately 200 miles away from Little Whinging, which we know is near Heathrow Airport. If we draw an arc 200 miles in a circle from Heathrow, you're either in the middle of Cornwall (which we've ruled out), in the Northwest of Wales (impossible for the same reason as Cornwall,) leaving the remaining arc between just north of Liverpool to just north of Hull. So it is in northern England, and Yorkshire is probably the most well known part of Northern England, which is why most people probably place it there.

It doesn't make sense to deliver Hogwarts letters to students in October, or in Hermione's case, in September. Dumbledore had trouble tracking down DADA teachers and didn't get them until July or August. They set their own textbooks, and the school supplies shopping list changed by the year depending on who was teaching.

Remember that Hermione was basically a year older than Harry and Ron and while also starting in the same year. If she got her letter on her 11th birthday (ie. Sept.19, 1990) she would've had to wait to the following year to start her education at Hogwarts (which she did).

Because the Grangers were told that Hogwarts was the best school of magic in Britain, and not studying magic was dangerous to children living in the muggle world who can't control their bursts of accidental magic.

They're close enough that they went with her in her second year to Diagon Alley to help her buy supplies, gone camping together, went to the theatre in London (I think), and they're close enough that Hermione felt the need to protect them in the seventh book by erasing their memories of her and sending them away. That doesn't sound like a family that doesn't want anything to do with the other imo...

Honestly wouldn't surprise me if the policies of things in the wizarding world aren't enforced/enacted consistently since it's a lot of stuff for J.K.

Just... Why the hate? I just want to hang out and celebrate how awesome fanfic, specifically, HP fanfic is, within an active community, but this community just downvotes Drarry so hard.

Dumbledore was able to magically hold Harry frozen throughout the confrontation, but couldn't disarm Draco? That's ridiculous. A much more likely theory is that he intentionally let Draco disarm him, so that mastership of the wand would become muddled after his death. Nobody was witness to this scene except for Harry, so this was information only Harry (and Snape in the film) could figure out. Voldemort thinks Snape had mastery of the Elder Wand, and this is another thing that saves Harry IMHO.

Then why did Dumbledore hide the Resurrection stone inside the snitch to "open at the close"? Obviously the blood protection was planned far longer than the hallows, but why else would Dumbledore leave the Resurrection Stone to Harry, and a book with important hints about their significance to Hermione? Why would he make Harry stand still while witnessing Draco disarm him?

While the blood protection is the main reason Harry survived, there is evidence in the text to argue that the disposition of the Deathly Hallows were also very important in Harry surviving death and defeating Voldemort. To me this reads as someone who's made a long planned safeguard but added something else in the last minute just in case.

  ‘But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,' Harry started again, ‘and nobody died for me this time -- how can I be alive?'

  ‘I think you know,' said Dumbledore. ‘Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.'

  Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort.

  ‘He took my blood,' said Harry.

  ‘Precisely!' said Dumbledore. ‘He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!'

I think you're overstating how weakened Dumbledore is at this point. I doubt he'd be able to survive a confrontation with Voldemort or effortlessly cow Bellatrix like he did at the end of OoTP at this point in HBP, but I don't think he'd be easily killed by a 6th year student. He let himself get disarmed because he never planned to fight Draco, not because he was to weak to do so.

I have never disagreed that the blood protection was what kept Harry alive through the killing curse (that would be stupid), but I contend you are downplaying the possibility that Dumbledore arranging the disposition of the Deathly Hallows was a measure to add an additional safeguard that Harry would survive. Dumbledore speaking to Harry in the afterlife is after it happened, and this Dumbledore obviously knows that the blood protection is what pulled through in the end. The way Dumbledore goes about planning the Deathly Hallows to fall into Harry's posession is too convoluted otherwise IMHO.

But there is no way Dumbledore could have planned for the Elder Wand to pass to Harry, even if for some reason he intended for Draco to become the Master. He couldn't be sure that Harry would defeat Draco before he sacrifices himself, or even before Draco is defeated himself. Also if Dumbledore had allowed Draco to disarm him, it wouldn't count as defeat, the same way Harry allowing Voldemort to kill him didn't count as defeat.

Harry basically ended up as master of the Elder Wand and owner of all deathly Hallows by sheer Luck. If anyone else had defeated Draco then Harry would probably never have ended up with it. In Malfoy Manor for example it could easily have been Ron who disarmed Draco and not Harry.

Draco was an ideal person to gain mastery of the wand because he was in Harry's "weight class" in terms of combat ability and magical knowledge, their previous antipathy and the current circumstances basically guaranteed Harry would seek conflict with him in the coming fight, Draco's unique position as pampered son of precariously positioned yet still important Death Eaters means he would be too cowed to attack anyone, yet have protectors who would keep him from being attacked, insulating him from most circumstances where he would be "defeated".

It was a very tenuous plan, but when you go back throughout the books, so many of Dumbledore's plans were. Sending Fawkes with the Sorting Hat against a basilisk? Sending two 13 year olds through time to rescue an innocent man against hundreds of Dementors? Spending a year doling out pieces of Voldemort's life story? Hiding the Resurrection Stone inside a snitch to only open when Harry's about to die?

  You can't apparate in Hogwarts.

Firstly Dumbledore can apparate to Hogwarts, and I actually meant that Dumbeldore wasnt able to apparate to Hogsmeade and Harry had to take them both.

#+begin_quote
  I'm talking about before he was disarmed.
#+end_quote

Draco wasn't even in the scene before Harry head somebody yell Expelliarmus from outside the room.

Its likely that Dumbeldore was caught off guard as well. The only time Dumbledore and Draco were in the same room Dumbledore was wandless.

He froze Harry so he wouldn't intervene, Dumbledore froze at the same time Draco busted the door open.

And what if Voldemort decided to punish for not killing Dumbeldore himself, or if it were Ron or Hermione who succeeded in disarming him.

#+begin_quote
  It was a very tenuous plan, but when you go back throughout the books, so many of Dumbledore's plans were.
#+end_quote

But why would he use such a plan when in canon he stated his actual less complicated plan.

​

Look here

#+begin_quote
  ‘But you expected him to go after the wand?'

  ‘I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort's in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus ...'

  ‘If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn't you?'

  ‘I admit that was my intention,' said Dumbledore, ‘but it did not work as I intended, did it?'

  ‘No,' said Harry. ‘That bit didn't work out.'
#+end_quote

​

and

#+begin_quote
  ‘That wand still isn't working properly for you, because you murdered the wrong person.

  Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore. '

  ‘He killed --'

  ‘Aren't you listening?

  *Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore's death was planned between them! Dumbledore intended to die undefeated, the wand's last true master! If all had gone as planned, the wand's power would have died with him, because it had never been won from him! '*

  ‘But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!

  ' Voldemort's voice shook with malicious pleasure. ‘I stole the wand from its last master's tomb! I removed it against its last master's wishes! Its power is mine! '

  ‘You still don't get it, Riddle, do you?

  Possessing the wand isn't enough! Holding it, using it, doesn't make it really yours. Didn't you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard ... the Elder Wand recognised a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. *The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realising exactly what he had done,* or that the world's most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance ...'

  Voldemort's chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face.

  ‘The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.

You're assuming Dumbledore needs someone to be in the same room to perceive them.

#+begin_quote
  *Its likely* that Dumbeldore was caught off guard as well. The only time Dumbledore and Draco were in the same room Dumbledore was wandless.
#+end_quote

That may be your reading of it, but it's not mine. Draco was stressed out because he didn't want to kill anyone, but he was also stressed because he knew that Dumbledore was a lot more powerful than he was. He didn't know how real his advantage over Dumbledore was. What I'm saying is that Dumbledore, the man who could defeat Grindelwald and stalemate Voldemort in direct magical duels, *chose* not to defend himself from Draco's disarming.

#+begin_quote
  But why would he use such a plan when in canon he stated his actual less complicated plan.
#+end_quote

The placement of the Elder Wand is indeed really tenuous and random. But the Resurrection Stone is much clearer and direct. Why leave Hermione a book about them? When there are several Horcruxes to be found and destroyed, why the focus on the Hallows? Why is the novel that covers the destruction of the Horcruxes called "The Deathly Hallows"? Dumbledore certainly attached more significance to them than you are arguing.

******** For the stone, there are several theories that go from "manipulative Dumbledore using the stone to push Harry one final step toward his death" to "gentle old man wishing to give one last memory to Harry before he makes a sacrifice he may not come back".

But for Draco, I don't think it was a plot about the Elder Wand. I think it was more showing the foresight of Dumbledore.

He probably knew that if Draco was here, other Death Eaters would be near. Disarming Draco (no matter if he could or not after the potion) would have probably been enough for Voldemort to considere his task a faillure, and so kill him and his family, something he tried to avoid all year. Knowing Draco would not be able to finish the job and wait for Snape was a dangerous bet, but it's Dumbledore and not even his worst supposition.\\
So rather than disarming Draco, he did the most important thing for him, stopping Harry to act. If Harry was not paralyzed, it's pretty much assured he would have tried to protect Dumbledore, even if it means facing the whole pack of Death Eater. And Snape really would have had a hard time to not get him killed or captured if he was faced with him on top of the tower, unlike later when all the other focused on their escape.

9.  No, she comes up with some quick strategies such as escaping from the Lovegoods' house

10. No, she easily makes a corporeal patronus in the DA

11. I don't think she is ever offered the choice

12. All teenage boys are stupid jerks. Ron is a good person in addition to being a moron at times

13. Subjective but I don't think so; he adds needed humor and Harry notes that when Hermione is your best friend, things are kind of boring

14. Before they are friends Ron calls her a know it all, which leads to the troll bathroom scene. But after, no, he gets mad at Snape over that

15. "betray"? No, he becomes frosty and distant until the first task ends

16. Ew, no

18. Probably not, but it was a funny movie line

Its actually on the underage wizards themselves, but it only reports that at the location magic has been cast near an underage wizard, it doesn't specify who used the magic or even whose trace it was.

2.  Sort of? I mean, partially successful spells do have some effect - it isn't like a true or false flag, so there is some sort of measure.
3.  No. Dobby is able to fool the trace into thinking the Hover charm came from Harry, even though Dobby doesn't use a wand. And Crouch Jr uses Harry's wand in the Quidditch WC final to cast the Dark Mark, but no letter came.

Does the Order of the Phoenix abide by “no killing” rule? Fanon i believe. Though Moody didn't kill during first war I think as he was said to have brought in most death eaters i think.

Does Hermione worship authority and rules? No, but she does trust in adults too much.

Does Hermione always panic in a fight? No.

Does Hermione have problem producing Patronus? I do not remember. Likely yes due to it being such a difficult spell even for adults.

Is Ron redundant for the Trio? No. And the golden trio is not a canon term.

Does Ron agree with Snape that Hermione is an “annoying know-it-all”? Since she was crying due to essentially calling her a swot, at one time he did.

Does Ron betray Harry after the names of the TWT are revealed? No, he's just a cunt. Though he kinda didn't tell harry about charlie and the dragons i think? Maybe a hair.

Does Ginny use love potion on Harry? No.

Does Molly use love potion on Arthur? I think she was joking with ginny and hermione.

Does Arthur really have a problem understanding the function of a rubber duck? God, that is in fanon so much but i'm sure it's asked in canon of mr granger.

Do (some) Death Eaters know that Voldemort is a half blood? The ones who knew him at hogwarts as riddle would think him a mudblood at first. His parentage mighta been leaked later but it's not ever actually mentioned in canon i believe.

Are Neville and Luna getting together? No. He marries bones's bff iirc. Luna marries rolf scamander and promptly murders him for his money then she and ginny run off togethef saddling harry with three poorly named brats while ron sells hermione to an oil sheik and promptly dies from his stomach bursting due to eating his wand thinking it was a candy one. Fleur leaves bill and consoles harry along with a pack of veela.

Wait, that's my fix it fic.

Are Ginny and Luna friends before Year 5? I feel like no. Though the families do live nearby one another.
