:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry doesn't answer Hogwarts letters and show up to sorting, so Dumbledore sends Snape to check the situation. Snape discovers different family living in Privet Drive 4, who tell him about Dursley being in prison because they killed their nephew. Snape goes to the police station to check - I think Harry died when he was around 4 years old. Then he tells Minerva who gangs up on Dumbledore to tell the truth (and he didn't know because Mrs. Figg was killed the same night). Which is followed by Ministry andWizarding UK finding the truth, followed by a funeral. The last thing I remember is Will reading at Gringotts and some time travel - fix it plan.

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE
