** Try linkffn(Against my Nature by Araceil).

It has adult Harry who time travelled to the past, and runs into Newt. I found it pretty engaging and the story was brilliant. Hasn't been updated in a while though, it is still over 100k words.

Do try

  Newt/Harry, Timetravel Shenanigans, Canon Divergent. His plan was to avoid changing the timeline. He knew he wouldn't be able to resist if the opportunity presented itself. So he fled to Africa, where opportunity found him instead.
