**** It's possible in AU. Can't a man who holds all the key positions, 2 of the 3 deathly hallows be kind of, you know, selfish?

Selfless people never make it to the top of food chain.

Even in Canon his death was because he got sloppy at the sight of resurrecting stone.

***** Lol, I just meant it as a joke against the classic manipulative Dumbledore fanfics.

Either way, I don't really care if Dumbledore was manipulative or not. Though I personally feel that he felt he should take more responsibilities and try to correct everything as he was more powerful, especially after the whole Grindelwald/Ariana fiasco.

** Honestly, most of the good stories are ones where Harry has Voldemort as a Father figure but is not his son biologically (at least not without some sort of ritual or potion). Most of the ones where he is related to Voldemort directly are pretty bad and/or rather short. Someone else has lready mentionned Antithesis otherwise I would link it myself. It is flawed but truthfully, it is one of the best fics out there in terms of what you are looking for.

** Linkffn(darkness within by kurinoone) Linkffn(Antithesis by oceanbreez7) He's not a biological father to harry in those, but Harry does call him a father in both.

Unfortunately, can't think of any where he is his real father, would have loved to read it as well.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

Revelin is an OC and Voldemort's grandson. The character is, I think, Harry-like enough that you might enjoy it. Linkffn(Revelin)

  They all thought Lily was Light. She wasn't. She was in love with the Dark Lord, and gave birth to his son. Now Erus Riddle is growing up, showing just how evil the son of Lord Voldemort can be. Of course, the Light doesn't know that fact. Slash later.
