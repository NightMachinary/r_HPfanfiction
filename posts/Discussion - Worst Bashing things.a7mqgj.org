I like some bashing, some is just funny and some make you roll your eyes, but what are some things that people have a character do that makes you blanch, gag or go 'really, what reality aren't you in?' One fic for me was when Ron went around raping people, and tried to rape Harry. Another is when Harry was sorted into Slytherin, Dumbledore told him that his parents specified that he had to be in Gryffindor in order for them to pay for his education or he had to pay his own way through Hogwarts. So poor 11 year old Harry was kicked out of Hogwarts. A third was when Petunia purchased a strap-on so she could rape Harry. All of those where Nope, done reading these.


** Just rape in general is completely overused and written really poorly in fanfic. It's just such a lazy way to make a character unreemably evil and give the story some "edge".

**** I'm not sure what this is referring to, but, Yeah? I suppose so. Rape is a sensitive issue that actually happens to a hell of a lot of people (though not usually in the ridiculously over the top ways we see in fanfic), which is why authors should either have the decency to treat it with sincerity and responsible realism, or be open and honest if it's just a rape fantasy. I think very few people reading fanfic will find their entrails suddenly expelled.

***** It is referring to the authors toolbox. The point is, human suffering is a topic of interest and is varied and as subjective as any of these things can be. I don't think authors should feel limited simply because some of their readers may have suffered similar traumas in the past. That kind of censorship is not really appropriate any more, especially given that something like rape is an act based desired power imbalance and a perversion of human sexuality, which are both fundamental themes in war and coming of age stories respectively.

I think dancing around the issue might be acceptable if your target audience is immature, but if you are writing to an older audience, then pulling the punches is likely going to lead to a less effective story.

Downvotes are not going to change my mind people. Conversation might.

It's not that an audience is mature or not mature. Rape is constantly written badly in fanfic and I would say it's even kind of lazy. People can be super fucked up by things that don't have to do with sex if you just use your imagination. Happens IRL all the time :)

** Hermione is one of my favourite characters, but not many people do her justice. Yes, she's an insufferable nagging brat with a compulsion to spew forth facts about the most obscure things in canon some of the time, but other times she's caring, or loyal, or vindictive, or sarcastic, or just a teenage girl. The problem lies herein: people tend to not want to write multi-dimensional characters with believable flaws. So nagging is amplified to uber-mega-bitch level, and everything else is lost. Or she's an infallible goddess. I don't know which oversimplification is more boring.

Draco Malfoy was humbly traversing the fourth-floor corridor, collecting money in a tin can to fund his soup kitchen for disenfranchised kneazle kittens, when suddenly:

/BANG/!

"AHA!" shouted fat, ugly, lazy bully Ronald Weasley, stepping out from an abandoned classroom and slamming the door behind him. "SLIMY SLYTHERIN! GRYFFINDORS RULE!" He had greasy food stains all over his ghastly, almost-brown-from-dirt hand me down robes, making him look like a deformed, red toupee-wearing mountain troll. His red hair was so intensely red that it burned into Malfoy's retina, temporarily blinding him. Then he kicked Malfoy like a muggle - since he was too incompetent to use any hexes. (Unlike the Malfoy scion, who always got straight O***Triple stars with smiley stickers.)

Immediately the biased Professor Dumbledore came out from another abandoned classroom and said "100 points to Gryffindor for exceptional bravery, Mr. Weasley."

Ronald Weasley, who didn't know how to eat properly in the great hall and was therefore evil, then said "Headmaster, the slimy snake stole my money! It's right there in the tin can!"

"Tsk tsk," twinkled Dumbledore, "200 points from Slytherin and detention with Filch for 2 months Mr. Malfoy. You must reform yourself for you are /dark/," Dumbledore intoned, putting extra stress on the word /dark/. Even his twinkling stopped (only to resume at full force a second later). Then he stole all of Draco's money.

"But-" Draco tried to interrupt, but instead the evil Ministry came out from another abandoned classroom and told him "No, you're NOT allowed to do any fancy hocus-pocus rituals at Halloween/Samhain! The old ways must be repressed! (whatever they are). Muggleborns rule!"

Then the goblins came and took all of Malfoy's galleons. Then the arrogant evil brat Harry Potter (who always tried to prevent Draco from talking to his secret veela-bonded girlfriend Hermione Dagworth-Merlin-Granger) came out from another abandoned classroom and accused Draco of being dark, even though he wasn't dark at all - and if he was, then being dark was actually perfectly reasonable and the REAL baddies were the 'light' side, who embezzled and used love potions and evil mind magic; and Voldemort was actually a really cool dude who taught destitute orphans how to read and write, and organized the local choir every Sunday evening.

It comes from the rich boy falls for the poor girl trope, especially with dubious way which he gets those feelings regarding Ginny. There's a raging monster in his chest every time he thinks of Ginny in sixth year, and only sixth year, which is really, really weird. He had nothing of the sort when Cho was with Cedric, or when Cho was on the outs with him in previous years. I've been jealous of other guys for being with girls I liked, but trust me, there were no roaring chest monsters (or anything remotely similar) for me. Ginny and Hermione are also shown giggling at love potions when they visit Fred and George's shop. Molly does admit to dosing Arthur with a love potion to get him to ask her out or something, and Ginny+Hermione giggle along when they hear that.

Not saying that HP gets doesd with love potions, but it isn't an unreasonable assumption to make.

Looking at her dot moving around in her school, while you were hiding in a tent half-starved, half-frozen while you were supposed to be finding out ways to destroy horcruxes felt like stalkerish and escapist behaviour to me.

Canon HP has no idea what love is, just a horribly warped perversion of it. He thought that fucking Snape loved his mother, he was that deluded.

Besides, as I said, the chest monster is noticeably absent in his fourth and fifth year, and seventh year. What is it, something all sixteen year olds have between the day they turn 16 and wanders off when they turn 17? That shit is NOT normal.

*** If there's one thing I appreciate about the Harry Potter fandom, it's that people are generally good about tagging their bashing. Bashing of characters who are not Dumbledore, that is. The Dumbledore bashing is basically omnipresent. Half the time, you'll get three chapters into a fic that has fuck-all to do with Dumbledore when Harry will suddenly go 'oh, and by the way, it's finally time for me to extricate myself from Dumbledore's evil clutches'. Then he'll go on with his business, because Dumbledore being evil is a foregone conclusion.

It just baffles me. We /know/ what it looks like when he's upset with Dumbledore. It featured pretty prominently in the fifth and seventh books. And why is Manipulative Dumbledore so much worse at being manipulative than he is in canon?

I think bashing is lazy writing in general. It creates easy conflict without needing to come up with a plot (i.e. escaping evil clutches), or removes inconvenient complicated conflict. Like want to ship H/Hr? Ok, let's make Ron a jerk instead of dealing with his and Hermione's feelings.

** It's all about storytelling. If you give enough backstory and sound reasoning for why a character would do something that seems sort of ludicrous, have at it. My least favorite by far are the bashes of the Weasleys/Hermione/Gryffindors in general just to make Harry's relationship with someone else acceptable (usually a Slytherin like Daphne Greengrass). It's perfectly plausible for Ginny to not be put out by never getting with Harry. It's perfectly fine for everyone being fine with him getting with a Slytherin because you can just establish that character however you want, we literally only see her mentioned once in canon. The bashing is unnecessary. A lot of the Harry in Slytherin stories have to bash his Gryffindor friends from canon as some sort of explanation for why they aren't best friends when that's unnecessary. They aren't best friends because their lives are completely different, you already set that up with the House switch. Ron doesn't have to get rapey or ultraviolent or an asshole to all the Slytherins to break off their friendship.

****** *Permanent revolution*

Permanent revolution is a term within Marxist theory, coined by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels by at least 1850 but which has since become most closely associated with Leon Trotsky. The uses of the term by different theorists are not identical. Marx used it to describe the strategy of a revolutionary class to continue to pursue its class interests independently and without compromise, despite overtures for political alliances, and despite the political dominance of opposing sections of society.

Trotsky put forward his conception of "permanent revolution" as an explanation of how socialist revolutions could occur in societies that had not achieved advanced capitalism.

--------------

*Socialism in One Country*

Socialism in One Country was a theory put forth by Joseph Stalin and Nikolai Bukharin in 1924 which was eventually adopted by the Soviet Union as state policy. The theory held that given the defeat of all the communist revolutions in Europe in 1917--1923 except Russia, the Soviet Union should begin to strengthen itself internally. That turn toward national communism was a shift from the previously held position by classical Marxism that socialism must be established globally (world communism). However, proponents of the theory argue that it contradicts neither world revolution nor world communism.

--------------

*Red Terror*

The Red Terror was a period of political repression and mass killings carried out by Bolsheviks after the beginning of the Russian Civil War in 1918. The term is usually applied to Bolshevik political repression during the whole period of the Civil War (1917--1922), as distinguished from the White Terror carried out by the White Army (Russian monarchists) against their political enemies (including the Bolsheviks). It was modeled on the Terror of the French Revolution. The Cheka (the Bolshevik secret police) carried out the repressions of the Red Terror.

Although there is actually a communist revolt, with soviet songs, in the story - when the muggleborns in Magical Russia rise up against their oppressors. But it wasn't started or aided by Harry and Hermione. Which is another thing the "summary" misses: In the story, Magical Europe is a worse place for muggleborns than Britain was, and when war shakes the regimes, the muggleborns start to rise. As do the purebloods in some countries "closely allied" with Magical Russia, such a Poland and Bulgaria, who don't like serving as Russia's cannon fodder.

***** I told you when you wrote it, but no. The Nuremberg trials tried top leadership in pursuit of justice, left most of the rank and file alone in the service of keeping a workable country afterward.

Meanwhile, you very specifically note that Hermione wishes to wipe purebloods, and then had Hermione put "everyone in the Ministry' on trial. Everyone means everyone from the Minister down to the tea lady and the mail boy. And then you went out of your way to state that the punishment for support of the regime was death (not actual actions mind you, but mere support of the regime) and that "'support' was defined broadly," quotations around support and all, meaning that's it's direct meaning is in question. So we learn the following facts:

- Hermione wishes to wipe out the Purebloods.

- Hermione puts everyone in the Ministry on trial for 'supporting' the previous regime.

- 'Support' is defined quite broadly.

- The penalty for support is death, the penalty for being innocent is: you're not innocent, have some magically binding oaths.

This doers not paint a picture of Nuremberg in anyone's mind. This is why people keep coming back to Stalinist Hermione interpretation despite your repeated protests that it isn't what you wrote.

I'm not seeing a modicum of restraint here. We don't even see her reasoning because you consider it self-evident, and she manages to convince Harry of her view in two sentences and no elucidation for the reader. You paint with such minimalist strokes that the reader is forced to make interpretations and the way you have written Hermoine is deliberately invoking hard men making hard decisions while hard. You literally have her smiling while Harry gives a speech surrounded by corpses.

This is the whole paragraph that covers the trials:

#+begin_quote
  The last few weeks had been a stressful time. The Wizengamot members who had voted for the law had all been interrogated with veritaserum to ferret out further crimes, tried, and pushed through the Veil of Death. Then the Tribunals had started. Any employee in the ministry they had captured was dosed with veritaserum, and interrogated about their role in the war. Everyone among them who had supported Voldemort or his extermination of muggleborns was sent through the veil - and since Hermione had prepared the questions, "support" was defined quite generously. Those not implicated were forced to swear a magical oath that prevented them from supporting any pureblood supremacy or hurting muggles or muggleborns except in self-defense. Hermione had made sure there were no loopholes in the oath that would allow anyone to "defend traditional lives" or such. At the end of the Tribunals, the majority of the pureblood aristocracy was wiped out and most of the survivors were hunted or under oath. Hermione and the new Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, Harry Potter, were kept busy reorganizing the Ministry and keeping the basic functions of a government running - or, most often, getting them started since the pureblood regime hadn't really been concerned with much beyond making sure the purebloods in power stayed in power and got rich.
#+end_quote

No mention of 'only those willingly supporting rape/genocide.' Only 'supported Voldemort' with a very specific callout that support is defined quite broadly, and support is in quotations, bringing it's standard meaning into question.

***** The fic was written after reading one too many "a marriage law is so romantic; the government forcefully marrying people will let them find true love" stories, and explores what would be a (IMHO) more fitting response of the very people who just defeated Voldemort and his Death Eaters when subjected to what is essentially legalised rape. If you've never read a marriage law story you're quite lucky - they are a very common method to ship two people who wouldn't give each other the time of the day, and the fact that it's rape is generally ignored in the stories.

With regards to "these people are OOC", Harry used or tried to use the Torture Curse in canon and Hermione is as ruthless as they come. Add the trauma from the war, and they're not in a forgiving mood. But then, that's also addressed - they realise in the story just how far they've gone down that particular slope, and get therapy.

And yes, the tirade about pens is meant to be surreal. I can very well imagine Hermione being just that petty. And Harry did rant in canon quite often as well, at his friends, his teachers, Dumbledore, for real or perceived insults and hurts.

Hatred for the silly little things? That's the character, not me. Heck, Percy's POV pretty much states that Harry and Hermione are overdoing it, and there'll be a backlash against all the muggle things because you can't simply use muggle solutions and laws for the magical world. And since he becomes the Minister for Magic at the end of the story, I would say his views were validated in that part.

Yes, I can understand that it's not for everyone - I wouldn't write the story without changing more of the canon past these days - but claiming I hate Ron and everyone else and the whole world simply has no base in the story.

Harry and Ginny get together in year 4, and things look good for Harry despite how that year ends. For some reason the Dursleys lock Harry in his room for the summer with no food, and essentially falls into a coma almost dying. Ginny, Ron, and Hermione get pissed at Harry for this because he never responded to their letters; I think Ginny then breaks up with Harry for being "inconsiderate". Harry then blows up at them all, cue general bashing of them. Molly then tries to make Harry apologize; cue Molly bashing.

Now I know what you're thinking, that sounds pretty standard how does this get up to a 12? Well as Harry refuses to get back with Ginny, and starts dating Susan Bones. Charlie, Percy, and Bill all try and kill Harry for shaming Ginny. I think the Twins try and get revenge as well. The only saving grace of the Weasly bashing fest the story becomes is Ginny is basically a non entity for a long time.

** I can stomach a lot of bashing, but one thing I will never like is Hermione bashing. I identified a lot with her “unsociable bookworm girl” character when I first read the books, so seeing her bashed kinda makes me feel like a shitty person for having that personality type. Also, stories where they murder Malfoy for literally no reason other than ‘he's a death eater kid'. Its not his fault he was born into a bad family and raised that way, its not a valid reason to kill a teenager.

**** I'm assuming you're talking about SilentlyWatchesOut's Black Queen series. It seems like quite a few people on reddit were really fond of that story, so I gave it a go. After 6 chapters or so, I have regrets.

I'm not even all that disturbed that child prostitution existed in the fic, so much as how it was completely glazed over and Narcissa completely exonerated of child rape, but other characters who committed far less upsetting crimes are treated as the scum of the earth. I mean the author states that what they write doesn't mean this is how they view child prostitution, but that isn't how it comes across in the fic at all.

** Bashing mostly occur in romantic stories. I despise ships which fandoms bash some character. There is no fucking possibility that their pairing would happen without OOC and trashing some characters so they make obstacle for their ship into scumbag to justify why these two characters who aren't attracted to each other would suddenly madly fell in love. Many of these fanfics also contains Deus ex Machina like arranged marriage/marriage law.

No.

My comments is just observation from this fandom and others that the a lot of bashing is done by salty shippers who thinks that their ship is perfect and author is dumb because s/he didn't see what "amazing chemistry" these characters have/would have together. Gen fanfics in my opinion have a lot less bashing than romantic stories.

And in canon while characters have flaws they also have a lot of positive traits. In fanfics bashed characters are caricatures.

I don't think "a character having some positive traits" is an exclusionary criteria for bashing and making such a distinction is not as easy as you think. Often what some people perceive as positive traits for Ron, I perceive as negative traits. "He's relatable" vs. "He's an annoying teen". "He's easy going" vs. "He's lazy and stupid".

Or Snape: "Oh, he's so brave for switching sides" vs. "Why did he have to switch sides in the first place?"

Or Lupin: "He has been delt a terrible hand by fate and strives to be a better man" vs. "He's a self-involved coward who can't get over himself"

It's not just about taking all the goods things away and replacing it by made up bad stuff ("Ron stole Harry's money"). That bottom of the barrel bashing definitely exists too (that's what the thread is about), but it's not the norm and I wouldn't defend it

** As everybody here knows, I'm not exactly the biggest fan of Ron, but I really really hate one thing about Ron bashing:

/Ron stealing Harry's money./

It makes no sense. It's completely out of character even in my "this guy is a douche" interpretation of Ron. As someone who really doesn't like Ron it seems like a distraction from his actual shortcomings and is a pretty lazy way to make him evil. There's more than enough wrong with the guy. I don't think the sad & pathetic jealousy I see in Ron is the kind of jealousy that transfers into "I want to take your stuff" as that would require a high level of self awareness - one that Ron doesn't possess in this circumstance.

Same shit if Hermione betrays them for books (ridiculous) or money (lol).

*** Agreed. Another aspect of this I absolutely loathe is gloryhound!Ron who tries to steal or profit off Harry's achievements and uses them to brag to others.

In canon we never see Ron brag, even about things that would be worth bragging about, like his chess match in book one, or his flawless quiddicht match in book 6.

Ron wants to prove himself, yes, but mostly to himself, not to others. He is definetly not the type to take credits for the achievements of other people.

**** He brags when around Fleur. And he exaggerates wildly about his experiences being held hostage under the lake until Hermione calls him on it. Plus, his whole snit with Harry in book 4 was about Harry getting all the attention. Not saying this is at all gloryhound territory, just that it's not never. Pardon the nitpick. That whole arc is pretty contained within the 4th book, too - he starts bragging, is dumb, and learns better.

That said, I don't actually mind at all when people change personalities for their fics.

** I'm the only Harry/Cho fan on the internet here :P but I will happily read Harry with other pairings. Back in the 3 year gap between books 4 and 5, Cho was looking like Harry's main love interest, so most fanfic writers who wanted Harry's eyes to go elsewhere had to first get rid of Cho. This was usually done by turning her into Regina George from Mean Girls, which made absolutely no sense to me, because Cho never once behaved that way. Even today, when I see Cho bashed like this in a fanfic it turns me off almost straight away.
