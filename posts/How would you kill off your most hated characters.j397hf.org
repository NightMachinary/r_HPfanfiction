** Well during huge fights where deatheaters fight against the Order I always end up killing annoying characters that just have to be here because of canon-compliance! Like, someone I like just avoids a mortal curse out of skill or luck, and then, damn, too bad this guy died instead! I want it to be as realistic as possible, so that the reader cannot hate me openly :D

** Well, I've had Dumbledore step out in front of a bus while demonstrating to a colleague how well he understands the Muggle world... They were in Canada and Dumble's looked the wrong way.

I've killed Voldemort by having him summon Harry's glasses, causing Velma from Scooby Doo level blindness for everyone's favorite boy wizard. Unable to see, Harry summons the entire frontage of a Diagon Alley store down on the Death Eaters, trapping Voldemort, then stumbling forward, Harry tripped over Lucius Malfoy and crushed Tom's throat with his knee.

I've also had Tom get Fricasseed in the graveyard because Harry made friends with the Horntale from the Triwizard (and her hatchlings).

Honestly, the most fun with Tom isn't killing him, it's making him live and suffer, like when I once had his Horcruxi combined into a sentient animated Teddy Bear and handed down through multiple generations of Harry's descendants while he lives in fear of the Washing Machine.

I don't think I've ever actually killed Umbridge... Though I've been playing with one where after her adventures with the Centaurs, she builds a cottage in the Forbidden Forest and coerces Bane to live with her as she's become a bit of a size queen. A miserable Bane begs Harry to save him from the horrible woman.

Snape is too much fun to fuck with to ever bother killing. In one story I made him 'lucky' to the point where his skills in potions no longer mattered, no matter what he did his potions turned out perfect... So he was miserable. In another, I suggested that the reason for Snape's general assholy-ness was due to a bad case of virginity, and that once solved old Severus became a Mister Rogers clone.

**** Dumbledore set Harry up to die in the untested hope that he might survive a killing curse a second time. I guess Harry was just lucky that Tom didn't use a different spell.

Snape was a bitch. He went out of his way to pick on Harry because he resembled James Potter, and Neville for no reason at all. What he went through, cry me a fucking river. He intended for Harry and James to be killed and for Lily to become his property. I take it back, he wasn't a bitch, he was a cunt.

***** So you did rather that Dumbledore try to keep Harry alive while Voldemort wipes out the muggle and Magical world, an unstoppable force who can't be killed due to the Hocruxes and Prophecy? Seems a big price to pay, even for Harry.

As for Snape - His childhood was bad. Worse than Harry. You see, Harry at least knew that his parents loved him. Snape had a father who was a drunk bastard who used to outright beat him. Snape's mother loved him, but lived in the fear of his father. Although his treatment to the students is still NOT acceptable, it isn't completely his problem is it? Never having a good childhood, he of course despises those who had, and is jealous of them in a way. And the trio wasn't in clear themselves. They sneaked in Slytherin common room and Snape's private stock and stole items without paying for them. And Slytherins would have made their life a hell at Hogwarts if they ever found out. So the way I see it, Snape did them favours as well. They just didn't count them.

Lily. When he had met her, he had found someone who cared for him, like his mother, and was able to show it freely, unlike his mother. He discovered what it felt like to truly care and perhaps properly loved for the first time.

When he reached Hogwarts, he had so many plans. He had studies so much. He wanted to be great, to be known, knowledgeable and famous like Dumbledore. And in come James and Sirius. Rich, good looking attention seeking prats. They disliked him. Treated him badly because he was in Slytherin, a house that hated him because of his Half blood Status. Because he didn't look as good as them. Because he had Lily, whom James had a crush on. Can you imagine 7 years of tormenting, without nearly 0 friends and nobody to talk to?!! Lily left him 5th year for James, who was still a prat although improved. But he still treated Snape the same. And Snape loved Lily forever. Can you the bloddy hell imagine?!! He can't talk to his mother, not wishing to further make her life miserable. And his ideal, Dumbledore, had just brushed past the fact that Sirius had tried to kill him!!! And getting saved by the boy who tried to make his life as miserable as possible!!! Do you even the fcking realise that Snape was alone for 17 years most of his life. I think even the other Slytherins only warmed upto him because he was a better wizard, and that too only to use him. With all this in his adolescence years?? I can't believe he never tried to suicide. But perhaps nobody would have cared even then.

Then Voldemort tries to kill lily. He never intended to get Harry and James killed. He just wanted Lily alive. It was Dumbledore who had twisted his words to make it mean like That ( Dumbledore wanted to save him from the dark side). Only to see the child of Lily and James grow up, and put himself in danger (not intentionally Though!!). And finally die looking into the eyes of Lily, in James' face, reminding his failures.

Hope you understand. It is not always that if something looks bad from the main character's view, it is necessary bad.

Please try to understand, as Dumbledore would say, the bigger picture. And stop being immature. I am like 15 years old and understand what I talked about (unfortunately). "Please try tk understand it.

PS--sorry for swearing, I get a little involved into it when I write.

Thanks for reading.

******* Bro... If Dumbledore had not done that than for the life of one Child I don't know how many other children would have perished. I never said that I like what Dumbledore did to Harry, to have spend a childhood still makes me sorry. But would Harry have not done it if he had know that he could save the lives of millions. I still feel mad that Harry never got a choice, even if we all knew what he would choose. I guess I could have worded it a better. I know that it is always a chance that Dumbledore is actually as you say, but he might not be. Harry isn't as powerful in Canon as in fanon so that needs to be kept in mind. That is something people keep forgetting.

And thank you very much but I have encountered enough children in my family and you would be happy to know that they are all fit and healthy.

So do you agree with the part about Snape?

******** Not at all, Snape is a class A cunt. And I don't mean that in a good way. Lots of people have crappy childhoods, that doesn't make you, or Snape, special. Yet, somehow, those people with crappy childhoods don't set out to torture the children of their bullies.

Weird that.

Dumble's plan, which by the way, didn't work, with Harry winning completely by accident in no way associated with any plans made by Dumbledore, rested entirely upon Tom using the killing curse to kill Harry. What if, like all of this other plans, a different decision had been made? What if instead of the AK, Tom decided that beheading Harry with a cutting curse would impress his followers more?

She'll even come along to the Ministry in 5th year, but she'll meet Voldemort, who'll compel her to join his ranks by promising her a new and better future and a position where she can make a change for what she believes in, and where peope will respect her.

It'll end up with Bellatrix killing her for thinking Hermione took her place as Voldemort's "first lady" while Voldemort just watches. The world will think of her as a Death Eater.
