Are there any good stories that take the themes, and story-telling conventions from a western and apply it to Harry Potter settings and characters? Preferably nothing that's just “Harry Potter, but he's wearing a Stetson in the 1800s.”

Examples of the kinds of stories I'm looking for include; Logan, Hell or High Water, Wind River, etc.

It's not a common genre, so I wouldn't be surprised if there's next to nothing on it.

Thanks in advance!


** I would hope there would be something, but the only (very unfinished) story on the Western theme I found is “[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/102514713][The Western Front (a Harry potter fanfiction) by Doctorfright]]”.
