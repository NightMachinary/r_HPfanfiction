It just occurred to me, I know it isn't canon, but should magical creatures be immune to wand magic from wands they continued to the creation of?

I just imagine it being an equivalent to the brother wand effect that Harry and Voldemort experienced, when Voldy forced the duel in the Goblet of Fire


** And if you thing about the duel between Voldemort and Harry the two phoenix feathers were evenly matched and it was the magic strength and will of the caster that determined which wand would submit. So in this case you would have a single feather in a wand contesting against the entire magical creature so the wand should lose.

However, that effect would only be against the specific creature that the wand core came from. Eg the wand would lose against the one Hippogriff that the core came from but the wand shouldn't have any problem against the rest of the herd.

** It makes sense. Only time I saw something similar was in Adopted life debt when harry had a staff made cause his wand couldnt handle his newly unblocked power andnolivander said that only harry and those that contributed to its core could use it. In this case fleur gabby and appoline

*** I was more thinking along the lines of Harry's wand couldn't work on Fawkes, because the core came from Fawkes.

**** No I get what you mean just saying that's the closest I've seen to that. Thiugh it would mean little against a dragon but someone trying to kill a unicorn with a wand containing it's own hair. Yea that would be a nasty surprise

***** Considering the wands are made from dragon heartstrings, it probably wouldn't be an issue.

***** Well if we consider that dragon heartstring was magic- surgically removed then that's a problem.

But why would you wanna kill an unicorn

********* I can't help but wonder if a wizard tried to channel dark magic through a unicorn wand, if it would backfire, at the very least..

Or at least, if they did so with evil intent. An "Avada Kedavra" with intent to protect the innocent might be acceptable(frankly, of all the ways to kill someone with magic, AK seems like the gentlest).

** While possible, this effect is unlikely to happen in Britain considering what Olivander use for wands core :

- Unicorn hair : it is my understanding the Unicorn's hair core use several strand of hairs braided together. Because of this, no individual licorn could start this "link" effect
- Phoenix feather : Phoenix are pretty much invincible, so it's not like they would need it (though Fawkes "ate" a killing curse send by Voldemort's wand and it did kill him).
- Dragon heartstring : if you have a dragon heartstring wand, the dragon is dead.

Maybe such an effect could be possible in other countried though, where Veela's hair and others are used.

*** Could happen in Britain. Ollivanders isn't the only wand shop in Britain. He's typically regarded as the best in Britain, however.
