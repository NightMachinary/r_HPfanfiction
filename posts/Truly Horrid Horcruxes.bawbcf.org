** In linkffn(Heart and Soul by Sillimaure), only a magical living thing can be turned into a true horcrux. If a dark wizard tries to turn an inanimate object into one, the soul piece will try to switch to any nearby magical beings/creatures or will expire if it can't find any.

What's so horrible about this? A soul is infinite and while the dark wizard's soul will be mutilated, the host's soul is entirely possessed/marked by the horcrux and is thus impossible to be cleansed. Upon the dark wizard's death, his soul will travel along the connection between itself and the horcrux and take possession of the host's body. The host's soul is completely helpless and is left as a horrified passenger in its own body.

The dark wizard just has to create a new horcrux again and the process repeats, with all the hosts' souls helplessly tagging along.

The only fortunate thing in the story about this was that Voldemort was unaware about these details and so /most/ of his "horcruxes" failed as they were inanimate.

** I can't remember the exact fic this was in but rather than having horcruxs be any murder dumbledore said that the only way to make a horcrux was to kill a true innocent and enjoy it. There could be no saying this is what he deserved for justice or any gains for the murder except for the horcrux. I think there was more but I can't remember.

**** I remember that. I still remember when I first read “the worst crime anyone can commit..... murder” or something like that and remembered thinking 1) why don't more fake wizards have them and 2) how is that the worst thing. That story just brought up the fact that just killing someone isn't as bad as so many other things.

******** One way would be for him to reward the ones who went to Azkaban for him (since he's such an egomaniac) with a horcrux and an unbreakable vow to keep the presence of horcruxs secret. I wonder actually, if a person has a horcrux and breaks an unbreakable vow, what happens? But anyway have people die in questioning just to come back which is why the ministry can't use veritserum and get information that way. Another question I have now is what happens if someone gets kissed by a dementor and has horcruxs? Would that person be trapped or freed from the dementor? Would they just pass on and the horcruxs still be around just with no main soul?

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding?

** In the linkffn(The Prince of Slytherin) having a horcrux requires the wizard to believe they are the only person of any worth in the world. So they haven't necessarily down anything bad, but nothing is to evil for them to consider.

Also, canon is the correct spelling, a cannon shoots heavy metal balls.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Not exactly more evil horcruxes, but definitely a lot more interesting and badass than in canon. linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky)

Especially about the fact that each horcrux has a bigger meaning and depth than in canon and there's more of them. Its actually in my top 3 favourite fics all time, so I love it.

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.

** My own headcanon to make horcruxes more interesting is that you have to do something horrible - to you. If murder is an everyday thing, then it really isn't anything horrible to do it again. You have to be incredibly unwilling to do the act while still being willing enough if it is for a horcrux. If you have any other motivation in why you did the act, then it doesn't work.

I like the concept because it makes for interesting scenarios. Where we can see what Tom is NOT willing to do. Someone who does bad things indiscriminately for the lolz isn't as compelling as a villain who saw an objectively better path that they refused to take due to it crossing a line.

  Albus still didn't fully understand what magic young Lily had wrought that night. At the time, he'd only been grateful her noble sacrifice had earned them peace, however temporary. He should have looked into it deeper. He should have done something. Unknowingly, long dead, that arrogant girl might just have ruined everything. (independent!GWL, black/white magic)

** I forget what fanfic I saw this in but someone had the really interesting idea to involve cannibalism in the making of a horcrux- basically to make a horcrux you had to do a ritualistic eating of the human being you murdered... which is so much worse than just murder. I liked this idea because it's just so grotesque and terrible. Sure, murder spilts your soul and is terrible, but people kill eachother all the time in media. Cannibalism is an act so taboo and vile it makes the making of a horcrux a real crime against humanity that is unequivocally understandable to the reader.

**** Well that's only because Voldemort doesn't believe in souls in that story. If you believe a ghost is a soul (like Dumbledore) then them over writing it is exactly the same thing.

edit: down voting me doesn't mean I'm wrong. If you believe in souls in this universe, To make a horcrux you are taking their immortal soul and merging your own memories into it then placing it inside an item.
