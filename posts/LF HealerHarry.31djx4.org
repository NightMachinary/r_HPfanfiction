** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7539141/1/Incorruptible-The-Dementor-s-Stigma][Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma]]. I remember this fic as "the dementors and zombies". I'm 99% sure Harry is/was a Healer in this fic.

*** Yes he was. The St. Mungo's scene ripped my poor heart to pieces.

** To Shape and Change might meet your requirements. It's basically a first year AU but Harry does some crazy healing in it. Also long. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change]]

Summary: AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

*** Personally, I think that fic is giving Snape too much credit. I think, given a shot at time travel, he'd just use it for a second chance at boning Lily.

** I read this one fic where Harry was a Slytherin and told Umbridge he needed to perform defensive spells to pass the tests to be a healer, and she grudging had to admit he was right, but I forgot it and everything else in it /:
