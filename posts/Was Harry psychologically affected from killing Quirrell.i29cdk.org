So, I'm in the process of re-reading the series. It's been awhile, so I don't remember a lot of the details.

I was wondering, does J.K. Rowling just kinda skate over the fact that Harry basically had to kill one of his professors?

Doesn't that seem like something that would traumatize an eleven year old boy? Even if he didn't realize it in the moment, he still has the knowledge after, right?

Let me know your thoughts!


** As a person who teaches students with trauma in their background I am thinking about this too. But it is also a children's book. So that's why we have fanfic to explore these ideas.

** I mean, I'm definitely not a fan of how Rowling handles most mental health in her books - the idea of love potions alone is particularly Fridge-Horror to me - but you'd be surprised at just how effective the human mind can be when denying or repressing the heck out of trauma.

If anything, it's probably the most realistic reaction Harry could have, especially if he's got Dumbledore's "Voldemort killed Quirrell, Harry. You just forced Voldemort to leave his possessed servant." explanation to cling to.

Hell, the "That's a nice question. Don't ask those, you're too young to know." bit from the same conversation probably had a bit to do with it as well. He's too young to think about things, Dumbledore is wise and probably right, so that's the end of that line of thinking and he can stick it off in the back of his mind somewhere to ignore.

Out of sight, out of mind does not really work for mental health though. Carrying around that kind of burden can make it a lot worse over time.

**** Oh, I'm not denying it makes it far, /far/ worse in the long run. Neither Denial nor Repression are a good method for anything, especially a healthy mental state.

All I was saying was that the human mind can be very effective when doing it and it'd be a perfectly normal thing for Harry to do and be good at doing in the first year circumstances. Unfortunately, trauma is really hard to deal with and some people simply don't feel ready to do so immediately. So, they put it out of their mind until they do and it works quite well for them. And Harry did have a trusted authority figure giving him an easy out absolving him from the blame, a logical-sounding explanation, and telling him he was too young to be concerned about things.

I've had friends and acquaintances, case studies, and people I've met and worked with through my volunteering (I work with a few mental health charities and services for young people in the UK) who've had traumatic experiences they've repressed for months, and even years in some cases, and while they're repressing it, they can function in day-to-day life to a reasonable degree. It slips, yes, and that slip can manifest in eminently dangerous ways, but broadly they keep the memory and emotion behind what happened contained. While it's out of sight, it is (mostly) out of mind.

And in every case, you're absolutely right - it makes it far harder to deal with when they finally do admit what happened and start trying to get help for it.

I would never say that it's healthy, but the end of the day though, sometimes it's something people can feel is entirely necessary for them. People are gonna cope however they're gonna cope. If they're not in a place where they feel ready to deal with something, repression and denial can be the only thing keeping them going until they reach the point they feel they are ready to deal with their trauma. And that's okay. It's not healthy, but it's okay.

Though I am a big advocate of the buddy system in those situations - cardinal rule of dark places and all that. Mental Health, especially while you're taking steps to get to a place where you're ready to deal with it, is a lot easier when it's shared. Even if it's just telling a friend "I'm really struggling today. Can we talk about lemmings and look at pictures of fluffy llamas for a couple hours?". :)

** Throughout the books, Harry endures */a lot/* of trauma which would leave any ordinary person with a myriad of mental health problems - depression, anxiety, PTSD, schizophrenia to name a few. Good thing Harry has plot armour though, right?

*** I mean, you can clearly see how the trauma from fourth year(as well as his treatment at the hands of the ministry, the general population, and Dumbledore) affects Harry in OOTP. Of course he's more resilient than the average person, but he suffers.

*** I like to imagine Lily's protection also has a mental health component; helps explain why he isn't as badly affected by the Dursley's as he realistically would be.

** Rowling skates over a LOT of stuff - not only for Harry (but hoo boy Harry) but for Ron, Ginny, and Hermione. I would even argue that Krum and Fleur could have needed therapy after the Tournament. Even if they didn't see Cedric die, a fellow competitor did die in the tournament, Fleur was tortured and Krum was mind-jacked into doing it. (I mean, they might have got it off-screen but I doubt it)

Yes. Not much more to say than that. And tbh, I quite like it that way, everything else would distract from the story. Harry is the type to shrug it off, people like that exist, so it's fine.

** In a children's book? No, he wasn't.

If Harry Potter had been a mature book, then he should have end up with trauma.

*** Eh, I always dislike "should", "must", ...

People vary wildly. No two persons are the same. And children are quite resilient, they have an amazing ability to handle terrible events, better even than adults. If you look at studies about child soldiers, for instance, the PTSD rate is "only" something like 50%; or survivors of Nazi persecution -- if children at the time -- actually grew up to be unremarkable, compared to a reference sample, quite as opposed to those who were adults.

So it's certainly reasonable to say he could have had a trauma. But it's equally possible he wouldn't have, and given that you can pick and choose when writing, deciding not give him mental problems -- for this, just as for the treatment by the Dursleys -- seems fair.
