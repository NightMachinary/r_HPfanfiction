So kind of like a mix between Inside Out and the Sanders Sides Youtube Series (If you haven't watched those, have a look and you'll see what I mean). It'd be interesting to see the different Aspects evolve as separate personalities in his mind, all built around a singular purpose they took on over the years. Could have a Creative Harry, a Logical Harry, an Anxiety Harry, a Compassionate Harry, etc etc.


** 'We Harry Potter' has has multiple personalities... But it's a bit outside your request

  Disclaimer: I don't own anything from Harry Potter.A/U. Voldy won't really be a problem, although he's still alive, just greatly weakened. (And only a few Horcruxes).Harry has Dissociative Identity Disorder. When he was a child, he was aware of his alters, but as the trauma continued, his dissociation grew until he blocked them out. Essentially.MIght have still worked out just fine until he was Sorted into Slytherin...where a certain Potions Professor ends up eventually taking him under his wing and discovering his little...secret. :3
