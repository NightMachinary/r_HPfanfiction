Hi all!

I remember reading a fic like this a while back, and I can't for the life of me remember what it's called. The details I remember are that it was a fem!Harry fic, and Voldemort's goals shifted as soon as he learned she was a Parselmouth - he hadn't been able to claim the Slytherin lordship before, because he needed a Parselmouth wife for whatever reason. I think it was also unfinished, and that Parselmouths had physical changes in that fic (although I am less certain of this last detail). I also cannot recall during what years it took place, I think after GoF onwards?

If anyone could point me in the right direction that would be appreciated!

*** Thank you, I'll check it out! The former name does come across as familiar to me so it's likely to be that one, and thank you for the extra suggestion!
