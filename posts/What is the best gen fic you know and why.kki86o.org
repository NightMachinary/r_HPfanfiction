Tastes are not something that should be judged, but that still leaves plenty for discussion. Did you like the plot? Was it well written? Maybe it had some original ideas? Did it elevate a chearcter you like or condemn one you think really had it coming?

What non-pairing focused fics you enjoyed the most? The floor is open!

EDIT: The fic doesn't have to have 0 pairings, it just shouldn't be the focus of the story.


** Stages of Hope is one of my all time favorites and has no pairings. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope]] I generally like fics with pairings but I think this works because it's so emotionally rich without any romance at its center.

** /Faith and Understanding/ is one of my very favorites. It's Ginny and Luna's friendship, with Ginny's musings therein.

[[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18LfF7F3kBx7FpHUIa_FMGTDvnChrEaN9][Link]]

As a final note, it has my favorite passage from any /Harry Potter/ fanfic:

#+begin_quote
  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  “Luna, who's your favorite person?”

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  “You are.”

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely---nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

** I have a few non-pairing fics!

Majestic Dolphin on has a few you should check out. Theyre oneshots but give a good introspection into some of the characters. One is on James visiting the shack by himself for the first time ever and just being horrified at the carnage. The other is Madam Pomfry and how is curating knowledge which will lead to Wolfsbane eventually. They were interesting I highly reccommend them as I hadn't seen either takes on those stories before. I really enjoy introspections. linkffn(13772236) linkffn(13772212)

Marie Kavanagh on Ao3 also does some excellent insights into the Black Family. So many of her stories are brilliant but the Black Archives have a great overview into different aspects of this difficult political environment linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23104075/chapters/64085560]])

Also JanuaryGrey has this excellent story about Sirius dealing with the consiquences of not taking on Arithmancy. Just terrifyingly brilliant. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19086139]])

  A student knowing his secret would mean removing Remus from Poppys' care. Which would certainly not be happening. She hadn't cured him yet. "Come with me, Mr Black." / A short OneShot showing how vital Poppy was to the creation of Wolfsbane Potion. And how much caring for the incurable can be so heartbreaking.

** The Eyes is a Lovecraftian awe inspiring story that never left my mind after all these years. “The old man frowned. "My child?"

"They do not blink," Harry continued. "They do not breathe, drink, eat, properly talk or walk. They walk, but not well enough. They are not real. They are more than real. I see them," he whispered. "I see their shadows at night dance under the pale light of death's candle, and I'm afraid. Afraid..."

A sixteen year old would have been able to speak in such a way. At eleven with his shoddy and gaunt appearance, the words that Harry Potter, the saviour of the wizardry world, spoke were starting to make the back of Dumbledore's beard rise.”

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9767473/1/The-Eyes]]

2) This story is more lighthearted but still amazing and worth reading The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks » Harry recalls that a pale little girl called Sally-Anne was sorted into Hufflepuff during his first year, but no one else remembers her. Was there really a Sally-Anne? Harry and Hermione set out to solve the chilling mystery of the lost Hogwarts student. Harry Potter, T, English, Mystery & Suspense

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks]]

3) It has a shocking Twist...

The Serpent and the Mirror » Dr. Dumbledore suspects that Harry's hallucinations about Hogwarts and the Dark Lord hold the clues to a terrible family secret. What are the Potters hiding? And what is Harry's relationship to the shadowy Voldemort?

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6034766/1/The-Serpent-and-the-Mirror]]

4)I like How this story is atmospheric

Elizium for the Sleepless Souls » The crumbling island prison of Azkaban has been evacuated, its remaining prisoners left behind. Time growing short, Harry Potter will make one final bid for freedom, enlisting an unlikely crew of allies in a daring escape, where nothing is as it seems

******* Oh Gertrude.... Gertrude.... Please... If nothing else, just so I have someone to rant about it!! It's exactly what you want and I cannot say anything because spoilers but trust me you won't be dissapointed! I don't want to spoil any of it and I will if I say anything...

It's brilliant. Simply brilliant. There's so much history and world building/fixing. All the flaws and plotholes in the books, they fix. More than that, they expand on it. There's so much intricacies into the politics of the ministry and the school and magic. What having magic means, what Hogwarts means and stands for. The motivations of people and teachers. The history of Hogwarts and the Order and all the other secret societies.

There are family forrest's of Trees. Going back generations in the most amazing ways. There War Mages, Lord's and Ladies of Magic, Protectoris, the bloody queen!!! There's schemes wrapped into enigmas twisted into secrets.

It's without doubt, the most incredible story I've ever read. It's so detailed. So heavy. I don't have a clue what's happening half the time and I don't care. Without doubt my favourite story ever written. I completely adore it and everyone needs to read it you will learn so much about language and history and magic and morals.

******** The Snarry pairing is a bit of a put-outer though (1000 year old portrait x 30 yr old former DE). While the worldbuilding is indeed the best in the fandom , their characters leave much to be desired. Nizar is constantly complaining and trying to fix each and every single detail besides Snape (who happens to be perfect). The founder's era is described to be better from every perspective (better healing, better Wolfsbane, better divination and so on, seriously?) which is difficult to believe. Nizar seemingly breezes through every problem with unheard of magic and common sense. Rampant Dumbledore bashing. Arguably reasonable but this Dumbledore is very unlikable. Still highly recommended in my opinion but it does have its flaws.
