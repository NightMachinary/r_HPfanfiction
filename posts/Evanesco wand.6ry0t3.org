Why doesn't anyone try this in a duel? Any long fics where vanishing magic plays a significant part?


** I guess the wand is a small object and can be moved out of the way easily, while a disarming charm has the whole person's body as its target.

**** Yeah I would guess that a person's magic fights other spells, and so an evanesco would need at least as much magic as the target?? Who knows... But this post made remember a fic where decided to simply accio his enemies body parts, and when he failed to summon a heart it still ripped apart inside his owner.

** My headcanon was that if something is magical and/or alive/intelligent it becomes exponentially more difficult to vanish. Also part of that is that if you want to vanish something, it must be possible to conjure it as well. I don't think it's possible to conjure a wand, as that would be rather world-breaking.

******* Huh that is rather clear yea..

I just googled the spell to see if there was any extra info on it, but all I found is that aparently Neville used it in his second year by mistake (a fifth year spell!). Also Harry wanted to learn it to vanish Creepy's camera.

***** Snape did vanish Harry's failed potion.

Do potions have innate magic though? Or do wizards imbue them with their own magic? And I don't think Snape vanishes potion ingredients; he probably just Banishes them back to his stores. Why waste good ingredients.

****** Second lesson as I recall. Possibly even later

They started on snails as the first animate objects they vanish. Then they moved on to mice. And Hermione is mentioned to be able to vanish a kitten.

So I'm guessing a variety of factors is at play. Size, state of matter, and degree of sapience all seem to be factors.

**** Snapped because it was also damaged, and a good part of that damage was inflicted by the Whomping Willow, a pretty magical...creature? Thing. I'd like to think a wand is pretty resilient to mundane accidents. Neville's pretty classically clumsy, but even his wand lasted til Dolohov snapped it.

Wands are described as being kinda alive - choosing a wizard, switching allegiances, and acting on their own, like Harry's did against Voldemort. So I'd think they'd be more resilient, just like wizards and witches are.

** I'd say Ollivander makes sure his wands are warded against that kind of munchkinism. (Maybe that's one of the ways Gregorovitch wands sucked compared to his.) As for vanishing /people/, we're shown in canon that vanishing living beings gets exponentially more difficult the more complex and more magical the creature is. Vanishing humans seems to be like something probably only someone like Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Voldemort or Merlin could have done in a diuel, and with more concentration needed than for any other curse.
