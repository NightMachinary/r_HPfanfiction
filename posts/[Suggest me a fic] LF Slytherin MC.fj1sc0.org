DEFINITELY NO Slytherin! Harry\\
Preferably original character, or canon existing Slytherin as MC. Just craving for a story where I can enjoy a slytherin MC being smart and cunning, tricking fellow students and professors. It can be oneshot or 100k words, as long as its completed I will read it.

Thank you in advance!


** Linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House) is my go-to Slytherin OC centric. The writing is a bit blocky, though, and even though there are many faults in their writing it's still a commending effort for someone who's native language is Greek. But I don't really notice it because the story is so thrilling. Linkffn(New Blood) is also a good Slytherin centric but the mc is Hermione.

I could recommend my story but I currently have author's block for my latest chapter and there is only 11 chapters out. Maybe i'll recommend it when I reach 100k words.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))
