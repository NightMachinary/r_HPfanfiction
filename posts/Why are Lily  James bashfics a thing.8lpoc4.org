For example, the WBWL fics where they utterly ignore Harry, and any other younger siblings he has, in favor of the 'Boy Who Lived'. I mean, they literally died for their son so the likelihood of them doing that is pretty damn minimal. I can understand Dumbledore bashing, as he was a dick to Harry, but not this. It's the epitome of lazy writing in my opinion. A serious chunk of fics where the Potters survive portray them as poor/uncaring parents, and it one of those things that annoy me.


** I feel like it'd be way easier to write a Harry raised by Augusta Longbottom if they want abuse. It's a common trope that Alice is Harry's godmother, so all it would take is a Harry ignored for Neville. We've already seen she's a less than stellar parent. If Frank had caught Neville doing accidental magic while only a few hours old, which apparently he did do, then that'd be Gran's little prodigy, and she'd hate the Boy Who Lived to be favoured over her own grandson.

** I'm an ardent defender of Dumbledore on this subreddit, but I never question the "why" of people's stories. I don't think anyone is arguing that James or Lily are bad parents who would ignore their son - it's just in the plot for plot's sake. There's a difference between making a character behave in a manner to serve your story and actually thinking that's the way they are canonically.

** All bashing stories are just lazy writing, the only ones even remotely worth reading are the crack fics that mock them. The rest are just tired rehashes with authors unable to create an interesting plot or nuanced characters, thinking dialing up the laughable "angst" is a quick way to show how cool their main character is. There is literally no point having a character with nothing but negative attributes, there is not a single interesting story to tell about them.

(I may have strayed into the Captain America:Civil War fandom recently and there is just so much shit to wade through, may be having a slight effect on me)

The only even tolerable one I have read is linkffn(Deprived by The Crimson Lord), which manages to work in spite of the bashing because some of the ideas are reasonably entertaining. But to sum up, Lily and James bashing is a thing because lots of fan fiction writers are shit, understandably obviously but I really do wish they would try something new.

** It probably started with it appearing as a dislike to put a new spin on the known tale, and when others enjoyed the concept they ran with it themselves writing more stories with the that idea. After this the dislike between characters turned to true bashing.

The reason it still exists is probably due to some people enjoying writing/reading about antsy angry characters and starting at the beginning of childhood is easier then later on plus like I said, new spin on a known tale.

While I definitely agree with you that canon Lily and James should be respected but sadly potter-bashing is to rooted in the fandom and won't be going anywhere. Still the bright side is that the irritating cliches of fanfic like bashing are a great way for rookie writers to build some experience,, or for the emotionally compromised to vent their emotions in a relatively harmless manner so that's something.

*** Why not? Well, it kind of goes against the foundation of the series: Harry's family loved him and it was taken away from him by Voldemort. Having them mistreating Harry is equivalent to having Bruce Wayne's parents mistreating him, or having Peter Parker's Uncle Ben be an abuser.

It doesn't mean you can't do it in your fanfic, and it fact some people look for very AU stories, but you have to be aware that it will turn off most readers.

***** I haven't conducted any polls, so that was just my impression and I may be wrong. However, I would point out that "turning most readers off" and "getting comments" are not incompatible. Only a tiny minority of the fandom reads a certain fic, and only a tiny minority of people leave comments. If you fic turns off most readers but it has a tiny but loyal readership you get your comments.

** It's a cycle- first there were a lot of fics (and canon) that idolized them, which eventually led to a pushback in the form of bashing.

Lily and James are almost always presented as "perfect" in canon and canon-compliant fics, so writing them as imperfect is an easy contrast/what if scenario. Harry also needs some form of hardship when growing up if you want to keep his personality similar to canon. Most writers just can't pull it off well/convincingly, so they stick to what they've seen done elsewhere. Also lots of fanfiction writers are kids, often people without great relationships with their parents, so it's easy for them to channel that into their writing.

It's no more lazy than any other well-tried trope, and it certainly can be written well, even if it requires some level of change to character motivations.

Why do people write Draco as a suave god instead of as a whiny brat?

In that sense, the most popular "mischaracterizations" are almost entirely due to the movie, specifically in relation to Ron, Hermione, and Snape. Mischaracterizations of Lily and James are peanuts in comparison.

** It's because they were poorly developed in the books. Lily's best friend is Snape and Petunia is her sister, Idk but I don't believe that she would have the kindest nicest personality we're told she would. James was a terrible bully, but he 'grew up'. No explanation of how or why, just Lily finally ditched Snape and boom over the next year she falls for James. Kids don't change that much that fast without a serious reason. So, I don't think they were the perfect people they are in peoples memories.

*** The problem is WBWL fics work from a ridiculous premise. Lily was never suggested to be like Petunia, and Petunia's behavior was founded in extreme jealousy, not their parents, so there's no reason at all to think Lily would be anything but kind (according to Petunia, their parents adored Lily and her magic). James is a better case, but it's pretty clear that no one thought they were perfect, they were just good people later on. Lupin on OOTP says as much about James being an idiot as a kid and Sirius admits to it.

Dumbledore unilaterally deciding where to place Harry, putting him in a home he later admits he knew would be abusive, wanting them.to stop Voldemort from getting the Stone in book 1 (Ron speculates this at the end of the book), etc. The Ginny Potion bit is ridiculous, but it's really a reaction to the spontaneous, random "monster in the chest" Harry has for Ginny in HBP. The romance in HP was just bad. But anyway, the fics that do these aren't correct (well, Dumbledore was manipulative and negligent, but arguably not evil)

This version of WBWL literally has no roots in canon and basically requires making the Potters into wizarding Dursleys to function. It's a joke of a premise

And you can bash Arthur and Molly on canon grounds as well. Arthur for his sheer incompetence and Molly for telling Harry that she suspects home abuse in CoS and yet never doing anything but sending food.

He also didn't leave because it was wrong but because he wanted to fuck a married woman who happened to be on Voldemort's "to kill" list.

************** I am not talking about the chronological order but where to place the HP equivalent. The Death Eaters were created long before Voldemort was in power. They were his street muscle, the force who gets him political clout by force. Just like in the SA, members joined out of ideological conviction or because they just wanted to fight people.

Your Ratzinger example, on the other hand, falls in a time where people had no choice but to join, where dodging the draft was punished severely. There's an old saying from the time of the Nürnberg trials, that the Allies simply looked at your NSDAP membership number and if it was sufficiently high (you joined after it became necessary if you wanted to go places), you were not considered a loyal member.

Now, Snape joined early. By 1979, he was a Death Eater. This proves that he joined out of conviction (or desire to use the dark arts), not because he had no other choice. If anything, someone with his abilities had all doors open. Yet he made his choice, to join Voldemort because he thought it to be the best course for him. This makes him scum, human trash, call it what you want to, it doesn't change the fact that Severus Snape joined a racially motivated terrorist group out of conviction. Yes, the "Mudblood" thing was a slip, but those do not happen at random. Even at Hogwarts, Snape was hanging out with people who disgusted Lily and Snape didn't even try to defend himself or them. He made his choice out of his own free will. Your interpretation is simply looking through rose-tinted glasses, [[https://zorm.deviantart.com/art/Canon-Vs-Fanon-Snape-34384180][much like fanon Snape in general.]]

**** Petunia hating Lily does not make Lily a good person. Nor does it make Lily a bad person. I was siting those two as examples of the kind of people she was around. If her sister turned out to be abusive, no just cold/distant but actively abusive, it does not speak well for the environment they were raised in. And the only thing we know about the parents is that Petunia thinks they played favorites. She was already jealous of Lily's magic, but they clearly didn't handle it well, at least and did play favorites at worst.

That said ALL bashing is about finding or interpreting the least evidence and blowing it up. Look at the Molly and/or Ginny dose Harry with love potion bit, that comes from one line about Molly making the potion (something they did in sixth year potions class). Is it flimsy as hell? Yes. Is the L&J bashing just as thin for the 'screen time' they get? Yes. But that's bashing for you.

  Look at the Molly and/or Ginny

Ginny and especially Molly bashing has a lot more going on. "Flem", wimpy Arthur, disrespecting Sirius in his own home, "you'll only be happy if you fight Voldemort"... i could go on.

Lily has no characterization besides that she fought what equates to Nazis, ended a personal friendship because he became what equates to a Nazi and that she loved her child very much.

****** The 'problems' per relative screen time are about the same. Admittedly most of Lily's time is viewed through the lens of either James or Snape. But a lack of characterization never stopped a fan fic author. It fuels them actually. The book doesn't say no, so it must be yes. Book is vague, must be yes. Book doesn't ram no down your throat, must be yes.
