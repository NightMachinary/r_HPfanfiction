:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Back in 2016, a friend I've since lost contact with, gave me a fanfic recommendation. It was a Hermione Granger/Viktor Krum fic on AO3. It had multiple chapters. At the beginning of each chapter it told what would be in it.

I don't remember the exact details of the story, but I know at some point, Hermione went to visit Krum's family. She also visited with his friends while up there and Krum, and maybe his friends, was an animagus. He was a bird I'm pretty sure. I think they may have split up, but got back together again at some point.

If you know what story I'm talking about, a link would be appreciated. I tried looking on AO3, but I'm not finding it under the Hermione Granger/Viktor Krum tag, but I may be missing it. I'm just sorta hoping someone knows what I'm talking about.

Thank you!


** Maybe this one?

*** Possibly, I looked and saw it was on AO3 too. I'll be sure to read it soon and figure out if that was it. Thank you!
