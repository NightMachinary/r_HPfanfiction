:END:
So there was this Drarry fic I read a while back where Draco asks Harry to teach him to throw off the imperious curse and Cedric is like a friend mentor to both of them. I can't find the link and really want to finish it so does anyone have a link. I think the fic starts with Harry finding out about Draco messing with his memories during Draco's Death Eater trial. I also think there is a secret room where Harry and Draco meet up a lot. Can anyone help?
