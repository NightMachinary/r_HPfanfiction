I'm reading a fanfic on ao3 (website launched in 2008) yet the publish date of the fic says 2004. how is this possible?


** It was most likely on another site first. A lot of writers have brought their older fics to AO3 from the obsolete archives, and can put the story's original published date when they upload to AO3.

  Now AU, 6th Year, following OoTP. Tired of the way Dumbledore and the Order treat him, and ready to face his destiny, Harry dedicates long hours to muggle and magical training to take the fight to Voldemort for a change. Slight HPGW, not shippy though.

** And AO3 had different projects where they went to different sites that were closing and imported their entire collections.
