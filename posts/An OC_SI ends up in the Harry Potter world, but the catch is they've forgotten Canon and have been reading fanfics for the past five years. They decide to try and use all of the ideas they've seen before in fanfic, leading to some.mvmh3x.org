"I require my Heir Ring, Master Goblin," he spoke politely but firmly, just as the Goblins were supposed to like it... maybe.

The Goblin glared down at him.

"What nonsense is this, whelp? Get lost or else!"

'Harry' knew he was not ready to take on the might of Gringotts at this stage, so he embarasedly made his way out of the building, hearing the Goblin's angry mutterings all the while.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

"Say, Sirius, where is the Black Family Grimoire?" 'Harry' asked nonchalantly.

Sirius spit out his tea, making a choking sound.

Jackpot! So it was real after all.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Malfoy was grating on his nerves, and this latest stunt was really way over the line. He had to retaliate. He browsed his brain for any useful spells he knew, but of course his first year books didn't have anything combat-oriented.

Well, he'd just have to use knowledge from his previous life then, he reasoned. He knew just the spell.

He didn't remember the wand motion, who even needed these things, so he just went with what felt right, slashing his wand downwards in a vertical arc.

"FULMEN STUPEFY!"

There was a loud bang. A bright blue light streaking across towards Malfoy. And then he knew no more.


** "Daphne, you're the most beautiful girl in Hogwarts. Please, will you be my girlfriend?"

"I'm not sure I can do that. But why don't you stay with me over the holidays? You can meet my family and we can...work something out."

"Ahh, your family will want a betrothal agreement first. I should have known."

"Sure, that is exactly it. And make sure you don't tell /anyone/ that you'll be with me."

"Of course, we can't let Dumbledore know that I'm associating with a 'Dark' family. He'd never allow it."

Harry later learned that the Greengrasses were faithful Death Eaters, and he was never seen again.

They would become a magical powerhouse, but they would also become a completely inept idiot socially and they would basically bumble through the world doing stupid shit Haha

I can just imagine the superharry/hermione/Ron using their ultra occlumency enhanced brain to bring down magical WMD's but then asking snape to cut off the bully act and be himself. Getting a bunch of detention and losing 50 points just out of spite haha

** "May your vaults overflow with gold and the blood of your enemies never dry on your sword!" 'Harry' announced as he walked in confidently in Gringotts to the first available Goblin teller.

The Goblin gave him a confused look but decided to act professionally, "Good day to you too. With what may I be of help to you today?"

"I, Harry Potter, friend of the Goblin nation have come to give you information of the utmost importance. I believe that the Lestrange vault is host to a Horcrux."

Now the Goblin was visibly confused, "A what now?"

"A piece of Voldemort's (the Goblin gasped at the sound of the name) soul is hosted within the Lestrange vault," 'Harry' repeated.

"And have you come to claim it, Mr. Potter?"

"No. I have come to ask you to destroy it. And while we are at it, I also seem to have a piece of Voldemort's soul latched onto my own. I was wondering whether any of your cursebreakers could remove it."

"I am afraid we do not know much about this Horcrux or soul magic for that matter. Our cursebreakers deal only with - well - curses. Having a piece of soul contained within an object does not qualify as a curse according to bank policy and therefore we cannot destroy it. As for your issue, have you tried St Mungo's?"

"I would like to see King Ragnok," 'Harry' insisted not willing to give up just yet. For some reason this had been the final straw for the Goblin as he yelled, "GET OUT!" while brandishing an axe at 'Harry'.

After he was out and well away from the angry Goblin, Harry shrugged and told himself, "I guess it was worth a try."

** “The Greengrass family has the largest fortune in Europe! We must get them to join my side anyway possible. Preferably a way where Daphne ‘The Ice Queen' Greengrass touch's my penis”

“Yeah ..., mate there's just a couple problems with that plan. One is that Daphne Greengrass is an open and proud lesbian. Two, the reason they call her ‘The Ice Queen' is that her hands are made out of ice. So her touching your penis is a very bad idea. Third, the Greengrass family is poorer than mine. Even their name is a bit of a misnomer. Their ancestral home is located in the middle of a muddy puddle south of Cardiff and is even more haphazardly held together than the burrow. But fourth and most bloody important is the fact that you're already dating my Sister!”

“Those are all just details Ron. Don't let facts get in the way. Plus everyone know that I need a wife for all my inherited houses. Ginny is wife one, Daphne is wife two, and I think I'll make Tonks wife three after I let Remus die for following the werewolf laws and never visiting me as a child. Maybe my mom can be wife four? Since magical incest is fine”

** This actually reminded me of a thought I once had:

There's no way to guarantee that the reality you were thrown into is any version of the story you've seen before. Even if everything you've seen so far is the same, that doesn't mean everything that comes next will be. Reality has no need to conform to fiction.

Any foreknowledge, from canon or fanon, has no guarantees. Maybe Peter is a death eater, maybe he isn't. Maybe Harry is the chosen one, maybe he isn't. Maybe Dumbledore is manipulative, maybe he isn't.

Until you verify the facts in-universe, you can't know for sure. And thus you have no real advantage over the other people. Sure, your knowledge /might/ allow you to solve problems faster, but it could also all be inaccurate and send you down the wrong path every single time.

*** It's interesting because even in that case, your foreknowledge doesn't have to be guaranteed - just because events in the past have occurred a certain way doesn't imply that the events in the future (especially after your arrival) will be constant.

And I don't mean the small day to day changed but even the long term ones - it's possible that in this world, Wormtail escapes but maybe dies along the way to Albania - and if in any case you had no way to track him until you got the visions pre-GOF, you wouldn't know if he was alive or dead
