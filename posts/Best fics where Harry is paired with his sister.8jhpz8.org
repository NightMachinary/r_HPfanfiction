*** I'm always down to get weird and the preface alone is worth the read. Goes on about inauthenticity and proper historical context then, without batting an eye trots out this gem:

  What I'm talking about is historical context. Anyone who has ever played one of Paradox's games like Crusader Kings or Victoria: An Empire Under the Sun will tell you that history ....

  I got sick of seeing the same old shit, done the same old way, in Harry Potter Fan-fiction.So I decided to take as many new ideas as i could think of, while mixing in things that I have seen before in ways I haven't seen before.That means that while there will be graphic sex, among other things in this story, it won't be for a few chapters. Also there is an excessive number of content tags, but I want to be through, and rest assured anything tagged will be in the story at some point.
