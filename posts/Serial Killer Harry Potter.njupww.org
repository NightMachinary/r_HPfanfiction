** Boy who lived being the serial killer would be cool. That said, killing shouldn't be his only psychopathic trait. Have him be a hedonist (enjoying life since he never had the chance to beforehand) or a guy who refines his killing technique (due to threat of Voldemort).

** I'd be especially interested to see how he resolves his troubles at school- assuming he wants to stay under the radar and not get caught out as a killer, but also that Dumbledore is no fool and already lived through Tom Riddle (and Harry is, after all, only a child with a child's capabilities).

Dumbledore knows that Harry is needed to vanquish Voldemort but is also dangerous to other people...it would be a difficult line for him to walk morally.

** I think making him a righteous serial killer like Dexter would be good.

He only targets abusers of children. Stalks them properly and uses legilimancy to get proof of their crimes to leave for the police though he just vanishes their bodies once he is done with them.

He runs into trouble when he starts targeting wizard families with government connections.

** "My name is Harry Potter. I'm 15 years old. My home in the Muggle world is in Little Whinging, in the southeast of England, and I don't have a girlfriend. I attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I don't smoke, neither do I drink. I'm in bed by 10 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

Basically, Draco Malfoy, you are a troublesome thing that would hinder my sleep. Therefore, I shall eliminate you with my Stand.....

I have seem two takes on this which I liked; one had it be a sort of accepted background aspect (important stuff but not focused on by our protagonists) to the actual story linkffn(4655545), the other was a short one-shot in an idea collection where he goes back to Snape's time in school and acts as The Punisher (thematic crossover).

**** I've seen authors write such stories with lots of scenes of Harry's suffering and being wronged, usually both as prelude and during the main story. It feels like 90% suffering and 10% planning/killing.

My guess is that they are trying to justify a story about killing but end up writing a story about a kid suffering by mistake.

** Sounds interesting. I think the best way for this to happen is through injustice. Harry keeps thinking that things will be better, someone will save him and it never happens. He speaks to the teachers about his household problems and it makes things worse, and no matter what he does it always amounts to nothing, then perhaps Harry witness injustice in the neighbourhood(like a man beating a child and realizes that nobody will ever help) and comes to the realization that justice can only be applied by oneself.

** Writing a serial killer ain't easy. It ultimately boils down to the POV. It can be hard for a reader to relate to someone with mental illness, especially if neither the reader or the author has it.

You can either write American Psycho, and make it like that--weird, alien, confusing smorgasbord, OR like Hannibal (the TV show), which is also weird, alien, confusing, but from the main POVs from the non-serial killers (so like Ron or whatever; or have Harry be an apprentenice to a Hannibal-like character, such as Voldemort). Relatability of characters is readability of the story, and serial killers are really hard to relate with.

I'm not saying your story wouldn't work out--it could, it just needs the right mindset and outlining.

*** I like Punisher type ideas - straight up ‘a job that needs doing', no excess dwelling on emotions.

----

I read a take on a serial killer once that fucked me up for a bit - the author even said they would not like to do a story like that again.

It was about a guy who thought he was an agent from the future, needing to get rid of specific people to avoid serious catastrophes coming about.

It was insidious and horrifyingly relatable for someone who just wanted to read a sci-fi story. The horror was at the end when the reader realizes that the guy is most likely just insane rather than some future-time hero.
