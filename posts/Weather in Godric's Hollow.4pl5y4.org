I'm writing a story and I really just need to know what normal weather might be like? I plan to make it a crossover so I don't want the other universes quirks to ruin the feel.


** Describing the /normal weather/ of the British Isles? Oh dear, I guess I'd better give it a shot... Variable. Mercurial. Unpredictable. Actively malevolent. Having lived here all my life, I have to say that the big standby is that it actually does rain a lot, though not as much as the stereotype would suggest. It probably doesn't snow much, since it's in the south-west, and if it does, only in the dead of winter. During spring and summer, it may vary between cold and wet, and uncomfortably moist. Basically, the picture of rural idyll, but with grey clouds hanging overhead unless it's June-September time.

*** That you that was most helpful.

As I told someone else just a moment ago. I am really looking for a estimation on the year round. I'm doing a few scenes from different months during Harry's early life with his parents to help set the scene and the weather will have a small part, but I still want to make it feel okay.

** I always visualized Godric's Hollow as being in Dorset. Though Canonically it's in the West Country so that could potentially be Devon, Somerset or Cornwall.

Anyway [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorset#Climate][Dorset's climate]]. The other counties are close enough for this to be pretty much the same for them.

Note that the area is somewhat warmer than is typical for the UK, so the snow depicted there would have been quite unusual. Unlike Hogwarts i the North of Scotland

*** Interesting - I see it as being in Cornwall, but that's just because I like Cornwall.

**** I think of the place as being quintessentially English. and Cornwall's own identity is too strong for it to be also 100% English.

But that's just me.

** What time of the year would it be? The UK is fairly small so there's not a huge amount of variance in weather across the country. It's minimally warmer down south where Godric's hollow would be, compared to hogwarts in the far north

**** British weather is rarely dramatic, despite how much we talk about it. Most winters we don't get snow at all, if we do it is usually a few inches. Only once in my life has it reached past my knees. Summers are renowned for being disappointing, but we do occasionally get warm days in the high 30s (Celsius). General day to day weather is changeable and unpredictable. You can get glorious sun one day and pouring rain the next. Drizzle and sleet is common. But always, always, always far more boring than weather in most other places.

** In my experience: If the sky is blue, it's going to rain soon. If it isn't, it's raining.
