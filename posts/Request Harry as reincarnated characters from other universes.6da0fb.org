I would love to read some fanfics where Harry has the memories or characters from other universes in his head.

** There are a few Code Geass and Tokyo Ghoul crossovers which do this but if I am honest, they are mostly pretty rubbish. Still worth looking into though if like me you enjoy that sort of thing.

*** I think OP was expecting people to link the fics.

**** I know. The reason I did not was that there are very few of the fics that I mentionned and I think that they would be better off going and searching through the list of crossovers on ffn for stories they might like. I am nit trying to be dofficult, it is just that when there are so few crosssovers (I think that there may be 30-50 in total for code geass and tokyo ghoul), you migt as well go and look for yourself. If this was say, star wars, where there are hundreds of fics, then I would have linked specific fics.
