** This has potential for romance.. for those who want to explore Romione and Ron being unable to attend the Yule Ball because he it may be full moon... (or any other even for that matter)

Has potential for angst with Remus guilt

Has potential for family drama... Molly's reaction to Remus and new family dynamics

Has potential for hearing UMbridge yell to Harry "No, Mr. Potter, you'll stay silent! I've had it you... and those half-breed friends of yours."

  "I'm not a werewolf," Ron growled.

  "Denial is unattractive, Ron," I said. "If you would just admit it, at least you could nab one of the creature lovers."

  "I'm not going to pretend to be a werewolf to get a girlfriend," Ron said.”

  Ron's mouth fell open. "You know about that?"

  "Well, yeah, people have mentioned it. I can't cite any specific examples, but I presume it's happened."

  "Ron's not a werewolf!" Ginevra shouted.

  Right, yes, I had often lied to cover for Ron's lycanthropy.”

  Ron laughed nervously. "It's not like I do that much, really. I'm just a guy...who turns into a werewolf sometimes."

  Lavender kissed him on the nose. "So humble, too!"

  I said, "I, for one, am glad that Ron is finally being open about his werewolf status after so many years of hiding."

  "I'm not a...uh, hiding. Anymore."

  Lavender squeezed his arm, beaming.”

** There is a bunch of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gkt8vx/whats_the_deal_with_hermiones_tail/][weremione]] tales, but they are universally horrible. I think neowerewolf [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10294436][could be written well]], but apparently nobody has done it yet for her.
