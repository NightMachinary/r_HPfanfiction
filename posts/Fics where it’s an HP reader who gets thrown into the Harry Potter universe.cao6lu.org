I know 99% of them tend to just be bad self inserts, but I've read a couple of good fics where it's a self insert, and I really like that niche genre


** This is a fun one:

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

*** This fic really made me conflicted. One the one hand it extended the world of Harry Potter in quite unique ways. Polynesian magical communities? Hell yeah! On the other hand, the SI goes on about their Christian faith, which I think is the author's. Don't get me wrong, I'm not some rabid anti-theist. A character talking about their faith is totally acceptable. It just pulled me sharply out of the world of Harry Potter.

#+begin_quote
  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

** Linkffn(A curse of truth) pretty good serious SI who's very careful not to make things worse, but still makes serious mistakes mixing canon and fanon.

Linkffn(The Evil Overlord List)

Tom and Jerry take over the world! HP reader dropped into the back of young Tom Riddle's mind, with a strange sense of humor.

Linkffn(I Am Lord Voldemort?)

Similar spirit, but completely replacing Tom as Voldemort in 1981 and taking the death eater movement in a slightly different direction. Lily didn't expect to be spared, and especially didn't expect to become the Dark Lord's personal student and the second most feared person of Britain.

Linkffn(So How Can I Weaponize This?)

What happens when a nerd and engineer attends Hogwarts? Insanity, butter powered laser beams of doom, various flying vehicles from a tank to a MURICA van, Sirius has found his equal.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy

" A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. AU OotP."

  It was eleven AM on a Saturday and I was sitting at the desk, spreading a disappointing Vegemite substitute across an equally disappointing piece of gluten free toast. The only thing that wasn't innately disappointing was that I'd made a very good cup of tea. It was still steaming in my giant, garish mug and I was counting on it to make this breakfast worth getting up for.Less than an hour later, Lucius Malfoy would be trying to convince me I was his long lost daughter.
