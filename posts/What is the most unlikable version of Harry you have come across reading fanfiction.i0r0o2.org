For me it's the Harry that appears in any Sinyk story He's such an obnoxious little prick. In one he constantly spouts quotes from famous people and in another he is essentially a more polite blood purist.


** - All those stories where Harry is taken by some old pureblood good family (Amelia Bones, Andromeda Tonks, etc.), swiftly changed into boring Lord Potter, and immediately gets rid of all his old friends (namely and especially Ron, Hermione, and all Weasleys).
- there was that story ... OK, I cannot find it now. It was one of Sirius Black takes Harry from Dursleys, but it eventually leads into so awful political opportunistic monstrosity, that in the end Sirius and Harry make Voldemort and all Death Eaters into their minions and protect them from persecution. Bloughhhh!

*** I can understand distancing himself from Mrs Weasley after two bits in CoS in particular. Namely, completely disregarding what the twins said or tried to say about the abuse he went through. And the bit where she said that she was worried about how he was treated by the Durselys to the point where she was about to get him away from there and then never does anything in that regard.

So if someone actually permanently gets him away from the Dursleys, that might lead to a break depending on how exactly you write the consequences of the canonical abuse.

***** Ron's a git half the time, and Ginny's canon version is an obsessive little thing that somehow didn't learn much from almost being devoured by a magical artifact.

Although honestly, in the later years I can absolutely see Harry trying to distance himself from Ron and Hermione just to keep them out of the splash damage when things inevitably try and kill him. Especially after the Ministry fight.

****** It was entirely unintentional. He learned to control his aura and used it not for control, but almost entirely to cause pleasure. He used it to try and help Luna cope with the death of her father in a comforting way, and with his girlfriend to enhance pleasure while they were fooling around. The second he learned it was subverting their will and changing their personality, he stopped and taught them how to prevent it. I'm not denying Harry is a prick and is definitely self-aggrandizing, but It's not fair to say he was a rapist. The exception might be Narcissa in that story, where she offered to have sex with him in order to support herself and Draco after being complicit with Lucius in an assassination attempt against Harry and Harry killed Lucius for it. He then manipulated her not to rape her, but to suborn her free will and make her less of a blood purist and loyal to him. Not good, in fact rather ghoulish, but she was the one who offered sex, he wasn't raping her.

******** It really wasn't. You had to be emotionally open and willing. It was explicitly stated that if your walls were up it wouldn't allow you to use it as a manipulation or coercion tool. The entire thing was based on the idea that when you have consensual sex with someone, you are at your most open. Even with Narcissa, the worst case in the story, she initiated the sexual contact. He used it to manipulate her after that fact, but the sex itself was consensual. Prostitution, but consensual. I'm not trying to make him out as a good guy, but calling it a rape aura is entirely inaccurate. That's just not how it worked.

If so, then yeah, I agree. However, from all I know about the story, you gotta admit that the author has an unnatural obsession with sex. There's constant references, situations, weird 'facts' that boil down to either rape or casual sex and I find it seriously disturbing.

**** iirc Harry performed a ritual in a mosque that caused a worldwide irrational hate towards muslims. The express purpose was the eradication of Islam. I think that might have been the absolute worst thing Harry ever did in that fic; it's a targeted eradication of an entire culture.

To elaborate on the "mind control aura" basically it's sex magic that heightens pleasure. The "mind control" (brainwashing would be more accurate) is something Harry had been unintentionally performing on Tonks. Once Harry found out what he'd been doing, he immediately told Tonks and she broke it off.

To be clear, I'm fairly certain Harry could use the sex magic without the brainwashing once he became aware of it.

But he later intentionally brainwashed (in other words, raped) Narcissa essentially to become his PR person. Oh, and Tonks got back together with him anyway, so there's zero consequences for the unintentional brainwashing.

I think my favorite moment (as in, so backwards it's hilarious) comes in the sequel, A Discordant Note, where Harry ends up in the asoiaf universe. There a good chunk of a chapter where Harry is lecturing future King Aegon VI (the one who, in canon (maybe) got his head bashed in by the Mountain) on 'how to be a good king'.

A good chunk of that lecture consists of Harry unironically trying to argue that the collapse of society in his world was caused by... wait for it... giving women the ability the vote.

***** I personally think that bringing the end of the world while killing literally billions of people before declaring that he will make the new world more hellish to the survivors in an attempt to force progress on them was very much worse than the mosque thing, with the definitely misogynistic actions being a close second.

While the mosque ritual was bad the truth is that people don't need a magical ritual or even an excuse to be prejudiced against each-other (just look at the Mexico wall). At most he only worsened and directed a problem that already existed.

*** It's not like the other people around him were better, practically everyone was OOC, Many in Gryffindor House practically shun him for a time, Ron abandons him, Hermione follows for a time, most of Hogwarts turn into assholes towards him.

He begins fairly normal, but so much shit happens to him he starts becoming paranoid AND decides not to trust anyone other than Salazar and Sirius, until he connects with Fleur and with some of his friends that steered clear because he was overly stressed out and paranoid.

I thought it was a fairly normal reaction considering what others did to him, and how they behaved, it's not like some other fics were he just wakes up as an elitist asshole and starts turning his nose at everyone.

I don't see it as him being unlikable, he's just reacting, sure he is super paranoid with Dumbledore(which ends up being unfounded, it's just that Dumbledore was secretive as hell). And yeah, he ends up not caring for anyone but a few people(namely Fleur, Sirius, Salazar and some of his friends).

Yeah, people complain that he was edgy and didn't trust his "friends" and later manipulated them, the DA and Umbridge just so he could get Dumbledore out of the school to do something(I /think/ it was destroying a Horcrux).

Of course, few people were behaving in character, but if they were the story would be different because Harry's character wouldn't change that way.

**** While it is coherent and does side-step cannon I personally think it gave a wrong idea of how a psychopath behaves as it makes it seems like he went crazy because of the abuse he suffered at the hands of the Dursley's. Psychopathy is a mental illness marked by the anomaly atrophy and hypertrophy of certain parts of the brain. Not all psychopaths will turn to crime or murder and how they are raised does have big impacts in how they act when adults, but in the end it just isn't something acquired or discarded through life as the story seems to want to show.

***** That not how I did interpret it, I always thought it as "what if Harry was a psychopath and the Dursley made him reach his tipping point". So for how I've read it Harry was a psychopath from the beginning and not because of the abuse. There was even a point in the story where Harry himself gets mad because Rita picture him as an abused kid and he say that he was not abused and that was not the reason why he killed them.

** Whatever happened to Sinyk, anyway? He said he was going to finish Daft Morons at the end of 2018, but since then...nothing at all. For more than two years.

I honestly liked his stories; they were well-written, and (even if his Harrys could be obnoxious and controversial) well-characterised. Is he dead, or something?

Just curious, since I used to read his stuff all time time in 2018, but since the disappearance...I no longer do.

**** At the end of Stargate, in an Author's Note, Sinyk did write "I'd hoped to get DM finished by now, but the new ending kind of grew on me. It is going well again, though; have no fear it won't be completed", but...well. Two years later, and nope.

I guess what you wrote is supported by the next bit: "I've used the writer's trick of 'just get ink onto paper, don't worry about what's written' to get my mojo back for that story". He had, apparently, lost his interest ("mojo") in Daft Morons, so you could be correct - but not posting an alert detailing this to people following him? Or editing his bio to state he had lost interest in writing HP fanfiction? That's...cruel.
