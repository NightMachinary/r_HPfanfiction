So, I am writing a fic that takes place in a mod for a quite obscure video game, won't say what it is, but it is where the Axis win WW2. Its quite a dark world, and the mod is very narrative-heavy, and I enjoyed the narrative it weaved, so I wanted ot write a fic in this world. My idea was that Grindelwald never died, and German wizards joined with Hitler due to the medieval anti-semtism prevelant in the 1600s, when Wizards went underground.

Yet, someone kept on insisting to me that this idea was 'militaristic wank'. They never explained why it was so, only that it was trash. I really don't want this to be a wanky fic at all, I just really like HP and this particular mod, and wanted to combine them into a story.

Any advice? Or should I just ignore them as a 'troll'.


** The excuse for the German wizards to join seems very forced. There was no antisemitism in the middle ages since antisemitism is the hatred of jews due to racial reasons, something only really invented in the 19th century. What you had before was antjudaism, which was based on religion rather than a concept of race (since the Jews were the ones calling for Jesus execution, or at least that's how their narrative goes).

If you want a common ground between the Third Reich and Wizards, go with anti-Bolshevism. Given that the Red Revolution was carried by dissatisfied peasants and workers while even the poorest wizards would be considered class enemies by revolutionary communists and quite a few would still have ties to the old aristocracy, it would be reasonable to presume that the USSR would have modern witch hunts, at least in the early days (howeeffective tthey'd be is a different question , but with authoritarian methods it would be easy to "recruit" Muggleborn into the secret police/NKWD.

So if someone with a deeply anti-soviet agenda like Hitler comes around, that would be appealing for wizards who want to settle a score with the Soviets. This works especially well if Grindelwald has ties to the Baltic and already cooperated with Imperial Germany for their liberation only to have his achievements reversed by Versailles (which cancelled Brest-Litovsk) and then had his home annexed by Stalin early into the war. Or if Grindelwald has ties to Karelia.

*** Grindelwald never existed in this world, although I agree that anti-Bolshevism would be a good reason for the wizards to join the Third Reich. But only German Wizards. BTW, in this fic, the Dark and Light wizards of canon are allies against Germany. They're apart of the Wizarding Resistance, under the larger British Resistance. The Death Eaters are the more radical group. They hate Germans as much as they do muggles in canon. While the Order are more moderate. This is the main moral quandry of the fic. When faced with hellish evil, does one dare become hellish as well to fight it?

**** If you go with anti-bolshevism as motivation, that loops back perfectly to the "dare to become hellish to fight hellish evil" question since those who made the Pact with Hitler already answered the question for themselves.

Also, one thing to keep in mind is that the final solution would have looked differently had Germany won. The original plan were large scale deportations out of Europe, not extermination. If Germany won, there would be no Wannensee conference. Although that raises the most important question. How did Germany win? Because the Royal Navy reserve alone would have been enough to prevent any invasion, even if Dunkirk failed completely and Germany somehow won the Battle of Britain.

***** In the game I am basing it off of, Germany enslaved the undesirables, which is quite economically advantageous.

Also, Germany won in 1945, just like the Allies in the Second World War.

In the game, or rather a mod for a game, President Roosevelt died of polio, and Bukharin won the Soviet election instead of Stalin, in addition to Grindelwald being a stillbirth(In the fic). Joseph P. Kennedy, an isolationist, becomes President, depriving Britian of the resources it needed to fight the war. Pearl Harbor still happens, and the US declares war on Japan, followed by Germany declaring war on the US. The US tries to fight in Britain, but the Germans defeat them. A similar thing happens with Japan, due to Kennedy's isolationist leanings. The war ends in 1945, with the atomic bombing of Pearl Harbor, the annexation of Hawaii, and the indefinite leasing of the Los Angels and Sanfrancisco ports to Japan. Russia, meanwhile, collapses into warlord states after the invasion, becoming a hellscape in the process.

Germany dominates Europe, with a collaborator government in England(The UK broke up, with Wales and Scotland staying free from German domination), and most of Europe bowing to them. However, Heinrich Himmler attempts a coup against Hitler during the West Russian War, an attempt by the Soviet remnants to reclaim the Westermost portions of Russia, taken by Germany after the war. The coup fails, and Himmler is given a state of his own in Eastern France known as Burgundy. Burgundy eventually becomes the villian of the story, a dystopia worse than Nazi Germany. It is run by the SS, and I can best describe it as if Orwell's Oceania was run by Nazis. It is said that Burgundy contains more labor camps than houses.

One event which will be crucial is the bombing of the International Confederation of Wizards's General Assembly. The German delegates hid several magical bombs in their seats, detonating them after they snuck out for a minute. Every delegate was killed, leaving the Wizarding World without leadership. The Statute was not abolished. There was no one left to give a shit.

In the fic, Tom Riddle fights alongside the British Ministry against the Germans, and is taken to a Labor camp. He escapes, but the experience radicalizes himself and several of his fellow Slytherins against Germany. They form the core of the Death Eaters.

Food? Oil? Because I don't see the US embargo any of these since, unlike Japan, the UK was not the aggressor in a war where they had execution competitions for fun. And as long as food and oil come in (neither of which has to come from the US), the UK can fight on indefinitely by the sake of having the Royal Navy and Germany having nothing to counter it even after 5 more years of naval building at 1910 levels.

With what? The Japanese concluded that atomic weapons were unfeasible even for the US and their program never made it past the lab.

If you want a realistic Germany won scenario, it is Britain accepting a honourable peace in 1940.

******* This is the scenario of the mod. Germany actually nukes Pearl Harbor. Remember, Operation Sea Lion was a thing. Kennedy was very isolationist, and refused aid to Britain. The mod is basically the worst scenario possible. The TV Tropes for the mod calls it a 'horror game'.

I am German and rather familiar with our braindead plans.

Sea Lion was completely infeasible since most of the "planned" landing craft were unpowered barges. And that's before the Royal Navy destroyed most of them with a nighttime raid carried out by HMS Revenge. And even if they landed a division or 3 in the UK, their only avenue for resupply was across the channel, which meant facing the Royal Navy again and again.

The UK had 15 battleships and battlecruisers, with 5 more building and 1 sunk early on by Submarine. Germany had 0 ready, two being repaired after Norway, 2 under construction, and that's it. 7 Aircraft Carriers vs 0. 66 cruisers vs a dozen. 184 destroyers vs 20, half of which were sunk during the Norway campaign.

#+begin_quote
  The mod is basically the worst scenario possible.
#+end_quote

Short of the UK deciding to scuttle the Royal Navy and melting down the RAF, Germany cannot defeat the UK. Force them to terms maybe if the Battle of the Atlantic is more decisive, but even then it is an honourable peace for Britain rather than some kind of imposed measures scenario that mod came up with.

********* Firstly, Germany has the A-Bomb in this timeline. That changes everything. Britain's survival was on a knife-edge during the early stages of the war. Sealion was succssful, I am told, because Ireland joined the Axis. Heck, they even took part of Ulster. However, Ireland regrets their decision, as they got nothing for it but pain.

*********** Kind of, but its more personal. Stalin and Roosevelt were never exactly friends. In this world, however, there is no reason for them to hate each other. Muggles aren't hated by either group, heck I have Bellatrix maryr a young muggle Lieutenant. Seeing their fellow wizards turn against them anihilated any lingering anti-muggle sentiment. Now, its just kill-all-germans, VS. kill-all-nazis.

** Militaristic Wank, IIRC, is used a little differently in other fandoms to how the HP fandom uses it. It's usually used for that 'Starship Troopers'-'Halo' level of "Ooh, rah! We're the Marines! The Marines are the greatest thing since sliced bread, and a marine invented that too!" sentiment and usually means you're overly glorifying war and soldiers in an unrealistic way.

At a guess, I'd say alleviating that would be done through not just writing a novel version of a 4X strategy game. Add drama and plot other than just armies charging at one another and various battleground events going down.

A book series called The Lost Fleet by Jack Campbell is a pretty good example of how to do this. While the main thrust of the plot is military battles to win a war, there are plots other than warfare going on. The main character has personal concerns going on (actual genuine personal concerns, not just 'oh no, I'm killing more people'), there's plots and politics, social issues coming up, development of characters, and a background mystery that develops over the course of the series, plus a few others I'm probably forgetting.

But yeah. Think about adding in the smaller stories of war (Anne Frank, Oscar Schindler, Hanns Scharff, Liesel Meminger, Vera Atkins, etc), and some stories that have nothing to do with actual martial battles. Make sure your fic isn't just battle scenes and people talking about and planning for doing more battle scenes while making 'ooh-rah' noises, and you'll probably be alright on that note.

*** Well, I am a huge fan of the old Star Wars Legends novels. That has a lot of military stuff, but also personal aspects, social issues, lots of politics, tons of character development, etc. TNO actually already has a mystery in the form of Burgundy,on of the most evil nations in fiction. They're responsible for most of the trouble in the game, and make the Nazis look like nice guys. There is an unstable coalition between MACUSA and the no-maj Goverment. Unstable not because Wizards dislike no-majs. No, hatred of Japan and Germany overrid that. But because when it comes to the government, they still haven't figured out who does what. The Supreme Court did decide that the MACUSA President and the no-maj President act like the Consuls in Rome, but everything else is still being sorted. But yes, I will add personal aspects. That was kind of why I wanted to write this in the first place.

**** Oh, I'd probably read something like this regardless - you just seemed to be wanting some clarification of what that 'militaristic wank' term might mean and how to avoid it.

My only real advice about writing something like this otherwise would be to ask yourself questions. In one fandom, why is something the way it is? How is it different in the other fandom? How could you combine two ideas from the two fandoms? What would A be like if B we were true? That sort of thing. You're writing an alternate history story, essentially, so try look into Turtledove or Harrison or Flint and see what advice they give on this sorta thing.

** The premise is not necessarily bad. It's certainly not objectively bad like a WBWL fic or bashing fic. The execution of this story will be what matters. Do I think the premise is a bit stretched? Yeah. Do I think good writing, excellent plot, and great worldbuilding could see this story through? Yes as well.

My only cautions about taking inspiration from a video game are that you should be careful transferring any mechanics from said video game and against having muggles be equal to wizards in the new Axis regime.

*** One question. How do I make well-rounded characters? One of my ideas is for Tom Riddle to be a leader of one of several British Resistance factions under the leadership of a General. His reasons include, witnessing his friends killed by German wizards, and spending several years in a labor camp. But how do I make him a good, well-written character?
