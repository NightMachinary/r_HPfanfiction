I never read any of the books, I saw movies up to SNAPE KILLS DUMBLEDORE*, and only once, long ago. All my knowledge comes from some random musings on "Space Battles", and few fanfictions.

I intend to write a story, which obviously will be AU, but not a total one. There's still gonna be Harry, Dumble, Snape, and others. I might gender-bent Hermione, or make an OC replace the ginger ass, cos I have no idea how to write from a female's perspective, and the main hero MUST be Muggle-born.

Would anyone be intrigued by something like this, even if to watch it burn, like a car crash in slow motion? Or just scoff in my general direction for adding more potential crap the already full toilet bowl?

*I used meme cos I don't remember the title of the movie... or which one in the series it was.

** [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page][For the love of god, consult the wiki]]. It's got summaries of /literally everything,/ including detailed summaries of all the books. You could probably read the chapter-by-chapter summaries of all seven books in under an hour. Ground yourself with that first.

*** I'm rarely here, so I don't even know what thread are you referring to.

Whatever it was about, no, it's not.

** As long as it's well-written enough in practice, it might be interesting to have a look...
