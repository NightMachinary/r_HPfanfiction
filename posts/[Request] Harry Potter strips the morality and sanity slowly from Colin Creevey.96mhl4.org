Imagine Harry slowly creates a monster no one would ever expect. Colin Creevey a small Gryffindor that looks and sounds so innocent. Imagine smiling at you with a smile that is not all that sane with blood slowly dripping off his fingers that lay at his side.

He joyfully says suddently "Hi Harry!!!!"

/I dunno where my mind has been/
