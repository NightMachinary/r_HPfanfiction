So like, he blatantly violates every rule of magic nobody ever explicitly stated.

Examples:

- he shoots one spell that pinballs around the room, hitting and affecting a bunch of Death Eaters?
- Throwing a wand and casting from it while it is still midair?
- Duelling someone by casting locomotor on the Sword of Gryffindor?
- Throwing his wand while casting a spell and having it act like a missile/boomerang?
- levitating like eight more wands and casting via those simultaneously?
- flak cannon style spells that detonate with proximity or hitting something and split into a bunch of slightly weaker spells?
- casting two spells with one wand at the same time?
- casting from each end of his wand at the same time?
- using the summoning spell on magically stable objects to use it like a grappling hook?

ect.

** I've seen Banishing spells used for super-jumps, and linkffn(The One He Feared) has Harry use a Pinball Stunner invented by Dumbledore.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.
