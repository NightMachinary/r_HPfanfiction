I understand why Rowling did what she did with the adults, but re reading the books as an adult, just makes me want to slap the adults in the books.

Adults can be oblivious, and even downright stupid, but dang, they really irk me.

Like McGonagall's reaction to Harry knowing about the stone. The fact that he knew about the stone should have been enough of a reason to do something about it, or check it out or whatever.

Not stopping the Marauders from messing with the Slytherins, not stopping Umbridge at all, Fudge being so easily controlled by Malfoy, et cetra.

It all just makes me want to bang my head against the wall. You can have Harry comes into his own in the story, while having the adults actually be competent.

So yeah, looking for stories where the adults are competent in some way. It doesn't have to be a major thing, and they don't have to be perfect, they can make mistakes, but just more competent would be good.

If it's set in Golden Trio Era: No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

It can be any ERA

No Dumbledore or Weasley bashing, please.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed but if not that's fine.

What are your thoughts on it? How would you re write the story to work with the adults as well?


** Well, I would rec Escape, but you don't want Harry/Hermione. Some of the better Grangers out there.

Petrification Prolification linkffn(11265467) remains the best example of this.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

*** Oh I liked this one! It had something that looked like responsible adults, even if some felt forced to act that way. Mainly, it has adults actually looking out for children.

** Don't know how to link. What comes to mind is A Marauders Plan by CatsAreCool. The whole premise is basically about Sirius and other adults getting their head out of the sand and doing something. It's long and a complete fic. Is heavy on some cringy tropes but still readable.

** McGonagall: Admittedly dropped the ball in letting the kids run rampant. But she and the other adults were right that the stone was protected and Voldemort would not have been able to bypass Dumbledore's mirror.

Marauders: Happened in the 70's where anti-bullying was barely a thing.

Umbridge: Had the government backing her. They couldn't stop her any more than a school could stop the FBI.

Fudge: Is acting exactly as our politicians are about climate change. I get being annoyed by Mcgonagall and the Marauders but Fudge is /supposed/ to be incompetent. That's his character. He's an allegory about how willful ignorance and corruption endangers everyone.

Incompetent adults are a fact of life and stories are a reflection of life.

*** McGonagall gets a lot of shit for not hearing Harry and co out at the end of first year. The problem was that she was completely correct, but did not give any sort of explanation as to why the stone was perfectly safe whether or not Dumbledore was in the castle. From Harry's point of view she just dismisses their concerns out of hand.

Or adults solve the plot of the next few years in about a week while Harry just sits there and waits.
