Part 2 of the specific time period of the Wizarding World. Recommend me your favorite fics from the Marauder-era. This is when Severus Snape, Lily Evans, James Potter, Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew, Remus Lupin, and assorted others went to Hogwarts (1960s-1980s and onward). Note, these fics don't have to include these characters or take place at Hogwarts.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

linkffn(Come Once Again and Love Me by laventadorn) Snape and Lily Marauders era time-travel. Eventual Snape/Lily.

linkffn(The Apprentice by Deborah Peters) Snape Marauders era time-travel. Probably abandoned.

linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles by Rannaro) covers the Marauder years. You might disagree with some characterizations but it got the time-period right.

  "Knockturn Alley," Hermione breathed, and a rush of relief flooded inside of her. At least she didn't end up amongst cavemen or dinosaurs. Time-turner fic. Sirius Black falls behind the veil, the time-turners are destroyed, and a Gryffindor is going to change history.

  VERY LONG fic charting the Marauder's time at Hogwarts from Remus' POV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges.Eventual wolfstar, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! On the plus side, I do update very often (sometimes twice a week, sometimes daily).First Year - Fifth Year complete, Sixth Year about to begin!***Nominated for the 2017 Marauder Medal, 'Best Work in Progress' by the Shrieking Shack Society!***
