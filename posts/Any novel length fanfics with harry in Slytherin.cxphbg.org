** Arc Of Sacrifices, starting with linkffn(2580283) is dang long, though it's WBWL and Drarry so, it may not be your particular cup of tea. It's also super angsty.

Lionsnake Chronicles linkffn(10179438) is likewise pretty long, pretty unfinished and, in my humble opinion, pretty terrible... but you didn't say they had to be good though so [[https://media.giphy.com/media/22xfPU5c9YeGI/giphy.gif][uhhhhhh]]

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

  AU-ish. Harry rebels against two particular traits expected of a Slytherin, that of unwavering House loyalty and self-serving ambition. As he experiences life as a student of Hogwarts, he learns that, while some of his housemates are not who they merely appear to be, others are precisely the sort of person they present. The chess board is set... How will Harry play the game?
