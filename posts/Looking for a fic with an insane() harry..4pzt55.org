There is one fic in which Harry goes around the bend, kills his relatives and when confronted with Dumbledore yells "40 seconds of freedom" or something along those lines.

That all went down in the first to second chapter. I can't remember what came afterwards - hence why I look for it.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry
