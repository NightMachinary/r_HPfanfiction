I've been brainstorming some ideas and Durmstrang caught my interest. I looked at the lore a bit and there is a lot of crucial information missing. For example, what language do they actually use in the school. The school is located in Scandanavia but has a lot of Bulgarian affiliations (founder, Krum, etc). Is there a possibility that lessons are taught in English? What are your thoughts? If you have any headcanons or interesting theories/ideas post them here as well, I am really curious.

If you know any well-written Durmstrang fics, feel free to post them here too. The ones I read are kind of edgy, so I have avoided them for a while, but it never hurts to give it another go.

Appreciate it!


** In my story there is a subplot in one chapter in which the secret location of Durmstrang is investigated and eventually discovered:

#+begin_quote
  No outsider knew where Durmstrang was located. Even its students did not know; I knew this, because I had tried to learn the location from their minds with Legilimency during the months they had been sitting at the same table as I. There was probably some spell in place preventing them from learning their location.

  What was known was that the majority of Durmstrang students came from Slavic countries and that the institute was under the jurisdiction of wizarding Russia. However, that meant little, not only because Russia was vast, but because wizarding Russia had no clear geographical borders. In many parts of Northern and Eastern Europe magical population was so sparse that they had not bothered to form actual magical states. It was like a magical frontier, almost a lawless region, but if the people living there needed a political authority, they usually relied on the People's Commissariat for Magic in Moscow. Those few wizards who lived in the frontier usually had much closer ties to the Muggle societies around them than to other wizards, much to the disapproval of the International Confederation of Wizards.

  As far as any outsider knew, Durmstrang could be located anywhere in this vast frontier. However, a resourceful person capable of problem-solving could rule out much of this area just by considering certain facts.

  First, the institute's name was Germanic, suggesting that it had a long history with Germanic nations. Medieval German wizards would not have established their secret castle in Siberia or any other part of wizarding Russia that would have been impractically far from their sphere of influence.

  Second, Durmstrang students wore thick cloaks and furs, meaning their school was somewhere far in the north where they had to protect themselves from the arctic cold. But even the northern reaches of European Russia were enormous, so I had needed more hints. I had used Legilimency on the Durmstrang students and found a piece of information someone might have considered trivial: every winter in Durmstrang there were around three weeks when the sun did not rise above the horizon. That meant the institute had to be located somewhere north from the Arctic Circle. It was on top of a hill which meant it received more sunlight than the surrounding plains, so it had to be some distance further north from places where the polar night was three weeks long.

  This narrowed the possible location so much that finding Durmstrang should, in theory, be possible simply by flying north of the Arctic Circle and checking each hilltop.

Later, after weeks of fruitless searching the main character (sorry for the first person point-of-view) decides to visit a Muggle tourist centre and ask if anyone has seen Karkaroff (who he is after), because the Muggle world seems to be a good place to hide.

#+begin_quote
  "Hello," I said to a Muggle in a tourist centre. "I'm looking for someone... a foreigner... and I think he might've been seen somewhere around here."

  "What does he look like?" the Muggle asked.

  "He's an old man, he has a beard and the last time I saw him he wore a uniform, a red set of robes. And -- someone might call him a wizard."

  The Muggle stared at me as if I was out of my mind.

  "Everyone knows him!" he said. "You're speaking of Father Christmas!"

  /Oh no/, I thought, my hope deflating.

  "Father Christmas isn't usually seen this time of the year, but his workshop is not that far from here. It's a magical place hidden from the sight of ordinary people, but everyone knows it's located on top of Korvatunturi, a hill on the Russian border."

  /A magical place of an old bearded man wearing a red uniform... hidden from the sight of ordinary people... on top of a hill in the Arctic region.../ This was too fitting to be a mere coincidence. Many Muggle legends had origins in the wizarding world. Why could Father Christmas and his hidden workshop not be among them?

  ...

  Soon Korvatunturi (the Finnish name literally meant 'Ear Fell') loomed ahead of me. I was quite sure I had checked it on one of the early days of my trip, but of course good wards could make a place hidden even from those who were actively seeking it. This time I focused on landing on the hilltop, nothing else...

  ... and for some reason the hilltop always eluded me, but with such a subtle way that I had to do it many times to be sure.
#+end_quote

For your information, according to modern Finnish folklore, Father Christmas does live on that particular hill, not the North Pole. Durmstrang's connection to this folklore snapped in place in my mind the moment I realised that in the Harry Potter books the Durmstrang uniform is red.

** I always imagined Durmstrang to be in Northern Norway or maybe in Lapland region of Finland based on what people describe of it in book 4. Word Durmstrang seem to come from Germanic Art Movement "Sturm und Drang" so I think Norway is more likely.

I think they would be speaking Norwegian or maybe German. As for Slavic members such as Victor Krum and Igor Karkaroff, It can be explained the same way why Hogwarts have Patil Twins.

I think Durmstrang is a private school designed for rich purebloods and recuits students from all over europe as long as they are able to pay their fees and are willing to attend. Being a private school, Durmstrang does not follow ICW approved material and teaches Dark Arts too. Basically it is a school designed to spawn likes of Lucius Malfoy. Maybe hey even have a class on pureblood supremacy or something.

*** What are the dynamics between the Scandinavian countries IRL and perhaps throughout history? Sorry, I am asking these kinds of questions. But I feel like it's somewhat important for me to get a good mental image.

**** Sweden, Denmark and Norway formed a personal union (common monarch) from 1397 to 1523. Denmark was the strongest kingdom, but the union collapsed after the Danish king executed much of the Swedish aristocracy. That caused a series of wars between Sweden and Denmark and hostile relations that lasted for around three centuries. Ever since there has been some bickering between the nations, because they both consider themselves the traditional great power of the Nordic. In the 19th century there was a short period when the reforming of the union was considered, but then the Danish got upset when Sweden did not help in a war against the unifying Germany.

Norway continued in a union with Denmark until 1814, but it was always the weaker, poorer and less important kingdom. Then it was annexed to Sweden, because Denmark had sided with Napol√©on while Sweden had not. The union of Sweden and Norway continued until 1905, when the Norwegians left the union peacefully. Norway was a poor country until the 1970s when the discovery of oil suddenly made it immensely rich.

Finland was a province of Sweden from the Middle Ages until 1809 when Russia conquered and annexed the country. Finland became independent in 1917 and industrialised and became wealthy rapidly after the Second World War. However, it remains the least prosperous of the Nordic countries. Finns traditionally consider Sweden as a "big brother," but there is a long-standing grudge caused by Sweden not officially siding with Finland against the Soviet Union during the Second World War.

As far as I know, Swedish and Norwegian are very close to one another, and Swedes and Norwegians can understand each other's speech. They undestand written Danish to some extent, but can't understand Danish speech. Finnish is not a language relative of any of them, and practically nobody in the other Nordic countries understands Finnish unless they have a Finnish background. Most Finns learn at least a little Swedish.

Then there is Iceland. Its population is very tiny, it has the closest ties to Denmark and its language is quite close to the archaic Nordic language spoken by the Vikings in the early Middle Ages.

The population of the Nordic countries together is about a third of the British population. I think that's quite a small base for a school. Durmstrang seems to have quite a lot of students from the Slavic countries, and that's why I think it's more likely that Durmstrang is in Russia. It probably has some history with Germanic nations, though.

***** Durmstrang is confirmed by Rowling to be "somewhere in Scandinavia". Russian school is called Koldovstorezt (although its name means Magic Castle in Russian wich makes it seem to be made up in the last second so maybe you might be right).

Also name of Durmstrang comes from German art movement Sturm und Drang which means brew turmoil in German if i am not mistaken(Could be the motto of Durmstrang)

**** I am not a native. From what i know Pretty much all of Scandinavia was ruled by Denmark in early middle ages then Sweden broke out causing some wars and stuff. Linguistically Sweden and Danish is in the same branch while Norwegian, Faroese and Icelandic are on the same branch of North Germanic Languages although they are apparently still pretty similar except for Icelandic due to its long isolation. Finnish language spoken in Finland is an Uralic Language completely unrelated to rest of the languages except for the languages of nomadic Sami people in Northernmost parts of Scandinavia.

** I wouldn't be surprised at all if they did teach in English. Egad, did we get around in our Imperialistic days. Even if you only include people who have it as a second language, there's still a shit-tonne of folks around.

It's not the route I'd go, though. If they're outside Scandinavia, I'd probably have them speak something German-ish and perhaps historical - maybe old Prussian?

If they're within Scandinavia, I'd put them in Finland. The Finns are appropriately hardcore that the idea amuses me greatly - they were the ones to invent molotov cocktails as an accompaniment to the aid-food-package bombs the Russians were dropping on them at the time, and that vibes considerably with the kind of 'ridiculous iron-man reality-show meets military boot-camp' vibe fanon seems to have given Durmstrang.
