As rightful heirs to the Founders, Hepzibah Smith and Marvolo Gaunt team up to lay their claim to Hogwarts.


** Hilarious, but why "vs. the United Kingdom"? I don't think Hogwarts (supposedly) belongs to the United Kingdom --- it's not, after all, under the control of the Ministry, which leaves me to think the institution owns itself.

*** It most probably does, but Smith and Gaunt could still present their case before the Wizengamot :)

They would lose, of course, but not before turning up against everyone else and each other and causing a massive stir in wizarding Britain, where everyone would claim that they, too, are descendants from the Founders and deserve their fair share of rights to the castle.

** This is probably the dumbest thing I've ever written. Your prompt set to the tune of Fuck Tha Police:

[Albus D]

Right about now, Wizengamot is in full effect

Judge Albus D presiding

In the case of the Founders vs. the Auror Department

prosecuting attorneys are H Smith, Tom Gaunt, and Gryffin-motherfucking-dor

Order, order, order Tom Gaunt, take the motherfucking stand

Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help your snaky white ass?

[Gaunt as Witness]

You goddamn right!

[Albus]

Well won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

[Gaunt] Fuck the Aurors coming straight from the Floo

A young heir's got it bad 'cause they ain't from the mudblood zoo

And not like the other halfbloods so Aurors think

they have the superiority to kill those in authority

Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one for a punk motherfucker with a badge and a wand

** Judge: This application has been brought by Hepzibah Smith and Marvolo Gaunt, who seek a declaration that title in Hogwarts castle vests in them. Please present the title deeds to the court.

Lawyers for Smith and Gaunt: So yeah... we don't actually have the title deeds.

Judge: So you're not the owners. Case dismissed!

*** There's no chance they'd win the case, of course, but they could still try, both being greedy and stupid people who think they are better than others because of their heritage. Hepzibah would try to bribe Wizengamot members and Marvolo would insult the judge and hiss at everybody in Parseltongue. Then the Prophet reports on the case, and mayhem ensues, because everybody would suddenly dig up their family tree and claim to be a descendant of the Founders, trying to get their own piece of Hogwarts.

It wasn't really a serious prompt, hence "courtroom farce" instead of "drama". It was actually inspired by a discussion in a different thread about all those "Hadrian Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin" fics where Harry inherits Gryffindor Castle, Merlin Manor, Slytherin vault and Hogwarts itself.
