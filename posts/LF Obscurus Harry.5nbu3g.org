I've recently watched "Fantastic beasts and where to find them" (loved it, despite not liking all the characters...didn't like the Auror-Girl from the MACUSA much, I mean I know she tried doing the right thing, but at first she made everything worse and constantly ruined Newt's plans!) and I kind of got this idea stuck in my head:

What if Harry became an obscurus because of the Dursleys? How would the world react to Dumbledore's blunder (putting Harry with them in the first place)? Would they have Harry killed or would they try to undo the damage? Would Dumbledore feel any guilt (I mean it fulfills what he needs: He needs Harry to die in order for the Horcrux to be destroyed)? Would the Horcrux be annhilated by the obscurus or would it make Harry survive the experience (after all a Horcrux makes its "container" more durable to the point of needing either basilisk venom or fiend-fire to get rid of one!)?

Questions and more questions - so, you guys:

Any fanfictions like that out there? (I haven't found any so far sadly!)

greetings LAX :)

I haven't come across one yet. I can tell you that a well-written one will take its time. Give it a few months. Why?

It's unusually hard to write: You have to introduce /a lot/ of OCs. I mean you can take Dumbledore, but everyone knows that he requires a lot of interpretation. Then we obviously have Newt, who is rather hard to write: (exaggerated)

#+begin_quote
  "Mr. Laxian, I have a very particular way of expressing myself."\\
  "See, I'm in the Beast Division now, an interesting job."
#+end_quote

But as soon as he is talking with you, he sometimes makes very blunt statements in between ("No, I tend to annoy people")

For most other characters we have the books to go off, and here we have the movie scripts - dialogue is a bit different in each medium. Newt is around 80 at the time Harry would become an obscurus, so his mannerisms will be different from the movie. He is older. He got an order of Merlin two years before Voldemort killed Harry's parents. So he's a very respected member of society. I assume at least in the ministry it is known that the guy had a duel with Grindelwald and held his own - how will Aurors react to him? I mean people who know of this must know he's a badass. He escaped a death cell in MACUSA! Obliviated the who of New York. Newt /would/ be called in, having dealt with 3 obscurials. Will Tina come too? How is she? I mean, by now she has years of experience as Auror. Now you need to work out your law enforcement. Invent a few backstories, make sure stuff adds up.

That's Newt. Dumbledore, Newt, and now flesh out Amalia Bones. Now, one or two OCs, and you have a few characters to play with.

Next job write an exciting or interesting story. Which perspective will you use? Harry? Newt? Dumbledore? An OC? (I recommend 1 or 2, because I think Dumbledore is hard as heck to write, and OC perspectives will need an OC with a lot of personality)

Oh, and the main focus is on adults. Normally it's on people between 11 to 18 with [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless][useless adults]]. But we can't have useless adults, since they actually will solve the problem.

All the problems I listed here are unusual for HP fanfiction. Stories are usually written from Harry's perspective, with Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, the teachers + a few sidekicks. Maybe an fleshed out OC or two, mostly Amalia Bones. The rough story line is clear (Year 1: Philosopher's stone, Year 2: Chamber, ...), and very often only minor details are changed.

This thins out the pool of capable authors, and so my guess is that we have to wait some time until we have a few good stories about this.

*** Why would you need Newt?

You don't need him to have an obscurus :( - sure he might be part of the team trying to help Harry or turn him back to normal again, still he's not exactly needed ;)

Perspective? What works best for a certain chapter IMHO!

Sure, it will take time but I thought that maybe someone had started writing one already :)

No, the story outline is NOT clear - would they even let Harry into Hogwarts if he's dangerous (he puts a werewolf to shame, I mean look at the havoc and destruction in the movie!), would an obscurus even be able to learn magic in the first place? (If you repress it, wouldn't all your spells fail? Would any wand select you?)

Still, yeah I agree with you: Might - sadly - be some time till we get a good story with that plot :)

**** You don't need Newt to have an Obscurus... but it's a pretty damn safe bet that he's going to get called in if there's one.

Because he dealt with 2 obscurials - at least. That's 1 more than anyone else on the planet. (Dumbledore had one - Ariana)

Additionally, he was until recently or is a rather senior ministry official. You don't want to discount that. In 1920 he was the only one in the room to spot that it was an Obscurial that killed, in a room full of highly ranking wizards. Since then there wasn't a big Obscurial, probably.

** There was one up a few days after the movie, I didn't think it was great though, the idea is good but a talented writer needs to be the one to pull it off.. I'll search through my history and try to find it.
