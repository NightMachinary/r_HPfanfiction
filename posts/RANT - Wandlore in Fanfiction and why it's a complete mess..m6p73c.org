I have a rant to make about fanfiction wandlore.

It's a fucking mess!

Too many times in fanfiction we see authors explain how wands are never truly compatible with a wizard or that one type of core or wood work better with a certain type of wizard and... NO!

I don't know what happened but it seems like the majority of authors forgot how wands works! If we were to believe them, certain cores and certain woods affect how much power a wand can produce or what spells work best with it. Heck, some fanfictions have Harry and Co go to Ollivander's to have new wands that have a new, fancy core/wood or, better yet, two cores/woods so that they can be more powerful or use a special type of magic! There's the thing however.

THAT'S NOT HOW WANDS WORKS!

Wands are sentient, to some extend! Wand cores and woods don't matter! It's the sentience of the personality wand that do!

Here is how it works: When a wand is presented to a wizard, the wand will check everything about the wizard and then make a decision on whether or not it wand to BOND with them and allow them to use it.

What? You think Harry and Riddle were so alike that they got sister wands? NO! It's because Harry's wand probably knew somehow what its sister ended up doing in the hands of Riddle and Harry's wand decided to bond with someone's whose fate was already intertwined with Riddle's: Harry Potter!

Some people seem to think that a wizard need some compatibility with a wand for it to work. THAT'S NOT TRUE!

Wand cores and woods don't matter! It's the sentience that is important! Like Garrick Ollivander said: "It's the wand that choose the wizard!" Not "Well this wizard will be more powerful if he use a wand with ____ because ____." or some bullshit thing like this!

Yes, wand components can and will influence the wand, but they will influence who they chose, not how much magical power the wizard can use!

It's the same reason why Ollivander said that Lily Potter's wand was nice for charm work. It doesn't make Charms easier to do, its just that this type of wand is more likely to bond with someone who has a natural affinity with charms, like Lily!

Compatibility has nothing to do with this! Sometimes, wands just don't want someone!

Heck, the way some people write wandlore, its like if the wizard was a bloke who just grabbed a random girl in the street and started kissing her. Then, when the girl push back and fight him, they are like "Oh well, I guess we weren't compatible!"

/FUCK!/

Sentience is the reason why wands have allegiances as well. Wands aren't whores! They aren't about to let anyone use them! They will choose someone when they decide to and only that wizard will be allowed to use them to the full extend of their capabilities. If someone who isn't bonded try to use the wand, the wand will actively fight it!

It's what happened with Neville. Neville was pretty much forcing himself on his father's wand. Of course the wand didn't want him! It was loyal to his father! Not his son!

Wands can change allegiances but only when an opposing wizard win a duel. The wand will see it as someone worthy of using them.

The only exception to all this seems to be the Elder Wand. No surprise people like Ollivander and Gregorovich wanted to study it. The Elder Wand is a fucking mess!

Now, sorry for my rant, I just had to get it out. Don't hesitate to discuss it, I guess. My post is probably an incoherent mess of its own anyway. I could easily have done a mistake or not known something from canon that JK Rowling decided to put in 10 years after the release of the last book or something. But, like I said, had to get it out. The way wandlore is used in fanfiction was really getting on my nerves.


** I agree with the gist, but the some of the details are off.

The wood and core absolutely matter. They're what give the wand personality to choose a witch or wizard it's compatible with. I'm also positive they're what make the wand semi-sentient.

No, the wood and core don't influence "magical power" but they can influence what a wizard is good at; skill. I don't think there's anything in canon that suggests certain wizards have an affinity for a certain type of magic. What the books suggest and Pottermore outright tells us is that certain woods are good with certain types of magic. It in turn gives the wizard it chooses a higher potential to be better in certain areas. Some wizards live up to it. Some don't.

Holly is good for protection. Protective spells are Harry's thing. Yew is excellent in dark magic. That's Voldemort's thing. McGongall had a fir wand, which is excellent in Transfiguration.

And I wouldn't say similar personalities wasn't a factor in the holly wand choosing Harry. That is to say, Harry harboring a piece of Voldemort was most likely the deciding factor.

** I understand what you are saying about the issues with wand lore in fanfiction. However, I think Rowling confirmed that wands choose based on personality and talent. I don't like the fandom trope that a powerful witch or wizard is going to get a different kind of wand with more than one core. I don't think that would work very well, and I've been seeing this trope since I first entered fandom years ago.

I mean Dumbledore was a powerful wizard and he had a normal wand. Harry could also be seen as a powerful wizard as well, and his wand was most definitely normal... or as normal as Harry's wand can be considering Voldemort and all.

The most ridiculous I have seen was a writer that tried to show off her amazing original character that was so powerful that she needed special training to control her power. Her wand had three different cores... including crushed crystals or something. Totally unrealistic.

** Actually, it doesn't matter how similar Harry and Tom are, because Harry's wand didn't pair to him, but to the chunk of Tom's soul in him.

** The wandlore in Harry Potter seems to be loosely based off of Celtic tree mythology. For example, Harry's wand wood, holly, is associated with protection and warding off evil spirits, etc.

I don't think the power differences between wands is that significant. But I'm pretty sure it's canon that certain wands give you a slight edge in different skills, as someone else mentioned.

Now, to bring in your point, the wand usually chooses a user who has that same skill set. Harry, whose wand wood represents protection, is very good at defensive magic (Expelliarmus, anyone?). Yew wood has to do with death and immortality and rebirth etc, hence it went to Riddle, who's afraid of death, uses the Killing Curse all the time, is obsessed with immortality, and came back to life.

Loosely, dragon heartstring is better for dark magic than unicorn hair. Not sure where phoenix feather falls on that spectrum.

True, you can't usually pick up a random wand and start using it unless you claimed its allegiance, but that's a whole other issue IMO. For example, Draco's wand is his wand, regardless of an outcome in a duel, and I'm sure he didn't need to defeat Harry to get his wand working again.

Harry and Riddle are a very special case. The same way that the Horcrux gave him Parseltongue must have contributed to his magic in other ways that made him feel similar to wands.
