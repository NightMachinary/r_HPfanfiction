Has anyone ever written a story where when the order of the Phoenix summon the defeater(s) of Voldemort, instead of just summoning Harry they get everyone who fought for the light? And Narcissa Malfoy?

I just think it'd be funny for them to be expecting one person and end up getting like 30 humans, a few centaurs, and a small contingent of house elves.


** Imagine the ensuing chaos when they summoned Harrymort from the Seventh Horcrux Universe, or the uproar when the Diary Riddle from Black Comedy Dimension showed up, or the confusion about Bellatrix from the Delenda Est World (they might not recognize her anyway).

Or, for something that is less undistiled crack and more feels, Harry Evans from “the family evans” (the one-shot story where Petunia tries to do right by her family).

** I had an idea for a crackfic where they summon a "Harry Potter" who "knows how to defeat the dark lord" and they get some non-magical book reading nerd who happens to have the same name. Sort of a SI premise. There's probably a few dozen or more Harry Potters.

** I seem to recall one story did the whole summoning story line, and summoned Harry then pulled over his entire army from his home dimension --- an army that was fresh off of defeating Voldemort and then defending Britain from a combined strike from the entire ICW. Can't remember what it was called though.

  When things go wrong in one world, wizards seek help from another. Unfortunately what you want and what you get can sometimes be entirely different things. A tale featuring Harry, Hermione, Luna, Susan, Neville and a whole host of others. Loosely inspired by "The Meaning of Fear" by Rorschach's Blot. Rating for highly probable violence, and likely bad language.

**** So I've seen this criticism of this story a lot, and I don't understand it. What exactly do you expect Harry to do here - he has no money, and he isn't super powerful. He can't afford to oppose the order, not when Dumbledore is probably the only person willing to offer him a job.

****** Yeah, that second point is pretty inexcusable, like I guess he was desperate to help her? It's rough. [[/spoiler][Plus, I guess he could always kill Dobby if things got hairy.]]

The first thing however, despite how obvious it may have been to you, took me by relative surprise. [[/spoiler][Also, I read the friendship more as Harry was desperate to connect with someone in this new world where he had no friends, so perhaps he made some choices that would otherwise be subpar.]]

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP
