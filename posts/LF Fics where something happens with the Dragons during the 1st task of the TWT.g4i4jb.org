After Reading "The queen who fell to earth" I kind of got hungry for more like it. Aside from the general tag in AO3, I have no clue how else to filter the stories, and ffn is even worse. So this is me, asking for help.

Any story where the plot involves the dragon(s) in the 1st task doing something other than what Canon gave us. The story above is an extreme example, it could be something as simple as Harry using parseltongue to speak to the dragon. Or go the more complex routes. I really don't mind as long the dragons are used differently.

  Forced to compete and abandoned by his friends, he steps from the tent with only one goal in mind, suicide. Instead Harry awakens a power that spans time and space and starts a war between the worlds.

** Island of Fire by Esama linkao3(3236603) also goes the Temeraire route, though the dragons in the story aren't the TWT dragons themselves, but are hatched from the eggs in the challenge.

** If you'd enjoy a story that's completely out of left field:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3177607/chapters/6902765][Alone Together]] begins with the first task going catastrophically wrong, causing Lily's blood protection to save Harry's life in an unexpected way. The magic gives him a mental link to the body of the Horntail dragon before shunting them both into the alternate universe of the /Temeraire/ series.

** How about Triwizard Tales by Clell65619. It has Harry making a deal with the dragon and then getting "adopted" as an honorary uncle by the dragons when the eggs all hatch. It's a pretty funny story about the 4th year.
