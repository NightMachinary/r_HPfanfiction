There is a subreddit for it, called [[/r/TNOmod][r/TNOmod]]. It takes places in a world where the Axis won WW2, and the world has become divided between Japan's Co-Prosperity Sphere, Germany's Unity Pakt the Italian-led Triumvirate, and the last bastion of freedom, the US-led Organization of Free Nations. This world is an awful place to be, especially in Russia and Africa. Warlord states vie for control of Russia, and both areas are under constant threat of Luftwaffe terror bombing. I personally would love a fic exploring the Wizarding branch of HMMLR, or Her Majestys Most Loyal Resistance, the main English resistance force. I see this being an ironic alliance between light and dark(In canon atleast) characters. The fic should take place in 1962, around the same time HMMLR starts to become a legitimate threat to the Collaborators.


** That would be fun, actually. I've been really enjoying The Man in the High Castle recently and a more British version would be totes cool.

Would you see Magicals and Muggles integrated in this? Like, working together in the HMMLR, for example?

**** Ooooh, that does look interesting. Gotta love Len Deighton - he puts such interesting spins on the Bond formulas. :D

Thanks!

*** Yes. MACUSA is integrated with the US, and Tom Riddle leads a small group known as 'the Death Reavers' within HMMLR. Bellatrix is a young girl in 1962, and is a scout for HMMLR. Ironically, Bella is friends with Molly Weasley, another scout only a year older than her. Equally ironic, Riddle is friends with Bill Alexander, a muggle Libertarian Socialist, and leader of the 'red monarchist' faction of HMMLR.

**** Oooh, okay. So, full and open magical integration. I'm assuming Germany would be a big player due to Grindelwald?

***** Germany is already a big player, mate. The ICW's session was bombed by Hitler after he managed to break free of Grindelwalds grasp. Grindelwald was killed, and Hitler destroyed the ICW in revenge against the Wizarding World. So, the Statute is gone. Remember, Anti-semitism exists even in the Wizarding World, especially in europe in a culture that hasn't progressed since the medieval era. So, there are nazi wizards.

******* I've always wondered: What if the Black family wasn't evil? In this case, the devestation of the world would have been caused by hatred. Hatred of the jews, specifically. Wizards and muggles all participated in the holocaust, in this world. As such, there really isn't an anti-muggle ideology in the Wizarding World. Only an anti-Nazi ideology. The Death Reavers are just as anti-Nazi in this timeline as the Death Eaters are anti-muggle in canon.
