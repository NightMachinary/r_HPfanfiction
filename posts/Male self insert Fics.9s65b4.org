Any good ones out there? I'm only getting the female SI's who ship with Sirius Black, Regulus etc. looking for good males ones where they either in Harry's time or maybe in the Marauders era


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth]]

I remember reading this one. I found it memorable. Sadly, not a lot of male SIs are memorable in HP. Then there's the female SIs. A select number are not ship fests. That said, just because an SI has a pairing it doesn't make it a ship fest.

A Fresh Bouquet is a good example of that. Regulus and the female SI have a good chemistry with the way they hate each others guts at first.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

*** I get what you're saying, in that the cliche independent Harry is generally a projection of the author's own behavior and values onto the character, but generally when I hear "self insert" I think of a brand new OC who may or may not have the same name as the person being inserted.

*** If canon Harry at least showed any indication to moral weakness or gullibility (like for example Anakin Skywalker) it would not be that unbelievable that a situation like Sirius death could twist him into the average indyHarry. But Harry is pretty much always doing the "right, moral" thing, even if it costs lives (eg not executing any Death Eater he can get his hands on or not trying to take a whole lot of DE with him at Voldemort's camp). If anything, Harry has too much moral fibre and it would honestly more believable if Hermione somehow got a harem of scantily clad girls and simply rolled with it due to a justification she can get behind (eg the girls would be forced to marry men older than their grandparents).

I'll post this right here just in case you didn't see it. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/umbrus-shade-the-incredibly-annoyed-ravenclaw-harry-potter-si.48980/]]

And then there's this new one.... not by shade but still enjoyable.

Keep in mind that Jeeves and Wizards is recent. So far, there are only two chapters with a third on the way.

Also, I noticed your screen name... Maybe you might like this. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12917701/1/Sword-Art-Online-SI-The-NPC-Experience]]

It's not a Harry Potter SI, but the SI is male. I still don't get why his name is Lyrista though.

****** I doubt it hardly matters that it's SAO. I found it highly entertaining. The person writing it doesn't have many errors in their work either. Though, since it came from Space Battles that's a given(those people are either unforgiving, honest, or nitpic everything). If you want a top teir quality SAO fanfic just go read The Fairy Dance of Death

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death]]

which reworks the hell out of Reki Kawahara's mess.

This comment is coming from someone who thinks Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation is a work of art that came out of the HP fandom.

If you can't at least read through that like I did, then you have no business looking down on my reading habits.

** Wasn't that fanfic the one where the creator of SAO was obsessed with Nordic mythology? I did read the first few chapters a while back, though I barely remember anything.

I was being rather unjust; my problem with SAO fanfiction isn't that I find the source material to be rather poorly executed but the target audience.

Like with Percy Jackson fanfics, the target audience for the original work was rather young and thus the fanfiction is mostly written by preteens. Not that there aren't any hidden gems but of the few that I have read, the quality of the works seems to be rather poor.

*** The same can be said about Harry Potter. It started out as a children's book. I still find terrible fanfics about it out there. But that's the point of fanfiction. A community of fandoms willing to read fan works and help its writers grow.

Ohhh... and on the topic of Male SIs...

The OP didn't specify if the SI had to be human or not, so I'm leaving this here.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/jeeves-and-wizards-harry-potter-s-i.51035/]]

It's relatively new.

Also... it was inspired by this wacky SI. A complete story, which is rare.

I think they're male, since they're a self described wizard and not witch.

  The words be careful what you wish for had never rung truer. "Wait... what did she just call my father? Oh, oh god no, anyone but them! Please god no! I'd rather scourgify my own blood then have them for a family! I would take the Malfoys- no, even Voldemort over them! Anyone but...!" SI-OC. Pairings undecided. Not an SI you've read before, according to reviewers.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.
