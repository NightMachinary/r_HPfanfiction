Just looking for some fics where Harry builds his power at a realistic rate or at least a reasonable one. I read a lot of good fics where he gets stronger incredibly fast. Would prefer if they are complete or at least regularly updated.


** If you don't mind Harry already being slightly OP linkffn(The Mind Arts by Wu Gang) is a good story.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
