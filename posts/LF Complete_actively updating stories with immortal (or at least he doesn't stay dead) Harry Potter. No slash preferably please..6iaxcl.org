MOD!Harry, God!Harry, Crossovers with The Avengers or whomever, etc. I'd prefer no slash but as long as the slash isn't lemons or is HarryxVoldemort or a Death Eater I will read it, assuming it's finiahed/updatinf of course.

Thank you


** Linkffn(Lily and the art of being Sisyphus) she doesn't stay dead. Being updated.

Man, that fic! It's the only fic that I've ever read that I just failed, entirely, to understand. Most of the time, even if the author fails to achieve what they're aiming for, or I don't like what the author is doing, I at least know what the author was trying to do. But with this one...I don't understand the point well enough to have any opinion about it. Is it good? Bad? I wouldn't even know how to tell! Reading it is certainly an experience, though. It's pretty rare to read something where I understand all of the words, and yet know I'm still totally disconnected from the author.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** Linkffn(the many deaths of Harry Potter by shaynet). Harry dies many times, but wakes up some time in the recent past. Honestly, the most impressive thing about the fic was the rate if updates, sometimes we'd get four or five chapters a week, but it's finished now.

Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.
