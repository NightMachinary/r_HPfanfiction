There are a lot of aspects to be considered - I mean, Gryffindor was obviously the choice for Harry (by Rowling), as it fits the "brave hero, going on adventures and risking his life to save the day" - plot. It makes an exciting story, and Gryffindors can easily be portrayed as the good guys. A lot of fics pick up on that, varying the heroic acts of them, always up for a battle, and never backing down from what's right and wrong.

While I did enjoy the books a lot, Gryffindor and their traits are not my favorite. Why? Because I wouldn't be sorted into Gryffindor if I was a Hogwarts student. I'd never charge into a battle (physical or verbal) without knowing my enemies and having contingency plans. Hell, I'd rather be in the shadows and avoid confrontations as much as possible, especially if I know I am risking something. Between Slytherin and Ravenclaw, I'm tending to choose Slytherin. I am quite a studious person and believe, that knowledge can get you very far, but I like the possibilities of Slytherin more. Mind games, cunning, alliances and politics, I missed those aspects in the canon books from the protagonists. Granted they were kids and Harry didn't know about magic before his eleventh birthday, so was Tom Riddle and he began his rise to power already in Hogwarts.

So what's your favorite House and why? Which House do you prefer to read about in fanfictions?


** I think Hufflepuff - They somehow feel the most realistic and down to earth. Dunno I get the feeling I'd be in that house if I were sorted.

*** Hufflepuffs seem the most likely to embody "your house will be like your family". That seems like a real stretch for Slytherin, and Ravenclaw also seems like it would be too competitive (academically) for that to work. Plus, we saw how they treated Luna. And the books clearly showed how willing Gryffindor was to ostracize one of their own.

So Hufflepuff: where they'll help you with your homework even if you might end up doing better than them, where someone will cuddle you on a bad day and bring you ice cream after a breakup. And everyone will cheer when you get a good grade or nice news from home.

** Hufflepuff. Loyal and hard working are two traits I prefer over anything else. Gryffindors are too loud for me, Ravenclaws too much of an ivory tower society and Slytherin... well, Slytherin is Slytherin. Basically, if you are a true Slytherin, you wouldn't be /in/ Slytherin, as it is like a branding on you saying in big bold letters "*DO NOT TRUST THIS PERSON*".

*** About the Slytherin part, wouldn't the sorting hat be responsible for putting you in Slytherin? I agree, that a cunning person shouldn't mark himself like that, but does he have a choice? It's not like everybody gets to choose which House he gets in, like Harry, otherwise the Sorting Hat would be pretty pointless, wouldn't it?

**** Yeah, that is true. The whole purpose of the House of Slytherin is over at the Sorting. Every trait of Slytherin is nothing you want people to associate you with, as knwoing about your ambition and cunning defeats the purpose of both.

New thesis: Gryffindor charmed the Sorting Hat in a way that makes it call out every "Slytherin" he finds, giving them a serious disadvantage right away.

** Canon Slytherin is unfortunately kind of my thing, minus the fantastic racism; in all honesty though I'd stall and then end up in Ravenclaw (because who wants to be grouped in with the "bad guys"?).

Fanon Slytherin is a giant hot mess in my opinion. If I hear politics one more time I might scream.

*** Yeah, I'm speaking of canon Slytherin. Politics isn't necessarily Ministry politics / Wizengamot stuff, politics is a generic term for me, verbally interaction with each other to archieve goals, etc. I agree, that fanon Slytherin is messed up. A lot of fics equal Slytherin = rich purebloods, evil, racism, you get the meaning.

** I find I must agree with Dumbledore (my sworn enemy (hehe)) on that we sort too soon. Years ago I was a Griffindor, when pottermore changed I was forced to create a new account, and was sorted into Slytherin.

House preferences change and I find myself rooting for Slytherin now.

I think it all depends on your position in life and so, what qualities you most value at the present moment.

I wanted Griffindor back then because I wanted to be a hero in a fairytale and knew nothing of cruelty or unfairness. I was 10.

*** I agree, I was originally sorted as a Ravenclaw, then later as a Slytherin, but nowadays I identify more and more with Hufflepuff and find myself valuing that House more. It's too bad that they weren't given more chances to shine in canon.

*** Perhaps. And you are right in that sense. I always thought that Dumbledore meant by what he said was that Snape is a good guy and brave and so he might have been sorted wrong and perhaps that they 'sort too soon.' As if being in Slytherin makes you evil.

What he said wasn't wrong and I agree with him. But the context is wrong.

**** You are right. When I was writing a reply I wasn't really thinking about the context of when it was said.

I just a have fondness for the quote when it's taken out of context. It could then be Dumbledore admitting that people have the capacity to change and I like the thought that are personalities evolve and that we can become better people.

** While I have little to no Hufflepuff in me, I think it is the best house overall. Hufflepuffs aren't arrogant big brassy toerags like Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs don't have OCD like Ravenclaws do, and Hufflepuffs don't manipulate every good thing that happens to their liking like Slytherins do. (pardon me for the stereotypes)

I agree with Dumbledore. Sometimes people, like Snape, are sorted too soon. People can change. James Potter toned down his arrogant buffonism, and Severus Snape spied for Dumbledore at great personal risk.

Slytherins have gotten shafted in both canon and fanon. Being ambitious does not mean you are a slimy, evil junior Death Eater. It's self fufilling. People believe Slytherins are evil, bully them, Slytherins get resentful of their treatment, and then they lash out. (ex. Death Eaters)

I enjoy reading Slytherin!Harry. Overcoming the amount of prejudice some people in fanon Slytherin isn't an easy or quick thing in any of the fics I have read.

** I'd go with Slytherin. Because of the bias against it which even Dumbledore was prone to. Anyone remember the line, 'perhaps we sort too soon...'. forgive me if the quote is not word for word as it is off the top of my head.

Harry was also exposed to this bias eventhough he sorting hat wanted him in Slytherin.

'You could be great, you know, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that.' 'Or perhaps in Slytherin, You'll make your real friends,...'

It was just sad to see in the end how everyone stood against them, in the seventh book. I don't remember if they were or weren't given a choice to stay and fight.

That's why I really enjoy reading Slytherin!Harry and well I haven't really read something that focuses mainly on the prejudice.

** Well, I'd be in hufflepuff. I like it when everyone gets along. Usually pretty boring to read about in fanfiction, though.

I hate how Slytherin gets shafted in everything, including canon. Being ambitious and cunning doesn't mean you're evil. Remember when you were a kid, and you always said "I'm gonna be a fireman/police officer/astronaut"? And then when you get older, you said "I'm gonna be the /best/ fireman/police officer/astronaut"? That's ambition. Wanting to be the best isn't a bad thing. And being cunning in getting what you want doesn't mean you have to be a racist cunt about it. Harry's an unreliable narrator, and we never hear about the older students, or even the younger ones later in the series. Half the house is probably looking at the other half and wondering who dropped them on their heads as children.

Slytherin house wouldn't exist as it was for the past thousand years if everybody in it was a despicable person, like canon implies.

** In an AU where the HP world acts like you'd expect it to in real life: Ravenclaw. Because intelligence is clearly the best characteristic out of the four primary characteristics.

In the actual HP universe: Gryffindor, because they're the main character good guys.

** I'm very much not a Hufflepuff, but I do think they're seriously underrated. In real life, I'd try to convince the hat to put me there, but I suspect I'd fail, as my reasoning would be all wrong. I'd certainly try to network with them though. The house of the loyal and hardworking? Those are people you really want to know.

That said, I do very much love reading about Slytherin. But I think it's rarely done well, as a lot of classical villian tropes are over applied to Slytherins, and really, what good Slytherin overshares that much?

In particular, I see pride more as a Gryffindor trait. Not that a Slytherin would never be prideful, but more that they would be encouraged to set that aside when necessary. Claiming to be Imperioused does not make Lucius Malfoy look strong, but it makes him look innocent. I wish I saw more of that behavior, really. The idea in fanon that Slytherin house status is all about looking strong is silly to me.

** I would fit anywhere probably (ok: Not with the 'puffs probably...I like fair play, but I am not above playing dirty if my opponent does so as well and hard work? Something to be avoided if possible!), but I'd probably either be Ravenclaw or Slytherin...if I could decide I'd go with the Ravenclaws probably (No one would bother me when I want to be alone with a book), but I guess the hat would still put me in Slytherin (why? Because I don't like knowledge for knowledge's sake, I prefer stuff that has practical applications and I am not above lying if doing so is really advantageous (not about petty little things, but important stuff))

My over all favorite? Slytherin, because the students there (past and present (present being Harry's time)) are the most interesting and the opportunity to network with the rich and powerful would be appreciated by me (something I only ever had the chance to once and I squandered it because I was young and stupid!))

My least favorite would be Gryffindor - loudmouths and not half as honorable (or noble) as they should be (they ostracize Harry, just like the other houses, despite probably knowing him way better than they do!) and they never have a battle plan (courageousness is great, but being able to back that up with a sound plan is way better - otherwise you might be brave, but dead! Sometimes discretion (and planning) is the better part of valor after all!)

ps: Hufflepuff isn't great and I kind of agree with Draco (while it might be nice because they love fair play and probably help each other out a lot etc. (so it might be the house you constantly feel welcome in, it also doesn't push you to be better than you already are etc.), it's also kind of mediocre - we only know one Hufflepuff who was great and he died (Cedric)) here...don't think any really famous wizard came from there :( while the other houses have shining examples IMHO (and not so shiny ones, too...Voldemort and Peter to name a few!)

pps: The world must be ending...I agreed with Malfoy :( (need to bleach my brain right NOW!)
