The title says it all... brotherhood, apprenticeship, father-son relationship, friendship or whatever they care for each other to some extent. Again, anything but slash!

I've already read PotDK, Altered destines, Fate's Favourite, Solace In Shadows. What else? Hopefully no tragedy tags or abandoned fics!


** I'm also looking for same kind of fics where Voldemort act as a mentor or father of sorts and has a bittersweet relationship with harry. I hate when they show Voldemort goining all soft all of a sudden.

*** Agreed. Voldemort is a man of great self respect with power, and even old lol, which makes him obstinate and hard to change. I can hardly think of a 100 percent sweet relationship regarding him cuz he would never stop being manipulative even after Harry or somebody else grew on him.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.
