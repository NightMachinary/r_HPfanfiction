I seem to recall a strange story where Harry somehow ended up with a pet monkey or ape. He may or may not have befriended them during the zoo scene, I really can't remember. I believe I stumbled upon it while looking for another fic, had no time to check it out and forgot to save the link...


** linkffn(8551180) has a chimpanzee named Zeus that Harry uses for experiments, not sure if it's what you really are looking for.

*** No, no, I know that story, but the one I was looking for really had the pet-ape thing as its premise. Hell, I'm not sure it was even such a /good/ story, but the premise was arresting and now I can't find it anymore and it's just driving me crazy.

**** Sadly, no, but it would be fitting, since he has the Invisibility Cloak, and Demiguise hair is often used to weave Invisibility Cloaks, so Harry would have an invisible pet to romp around the castle with.

***** Ah. For a moment I wondered if that was the story I'd seen, and the ape was revealed to be a demiguise in the later chapters I didn't read.

Although yes. That would be a terrific idea in the right hands.

** He has a whole bunch of pets in this one, including a monkey [[/spoiler][who attacks Percy Weasley in Chapter 10]]. I found it by Google searching "Harry Potter pet ape fanfic" - a search for which, congratulations, your thread is the first result.
