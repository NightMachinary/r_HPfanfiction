I'm so happy to have found some well-written Ron. I forgot how kind and wonderful he can be, and it's so nice to be reminded. The fic I've got still has him rude and abrasive, but it also has him being perceptive and worried and kind.

I think it's the kindness that gets me above all.

  Hermione couldn't believe she had been so stupid. What a foolish and perfectly prideful thing to do. The brightest witch of her generation, gifted and sensible Hermione Granger, gave into peer pressure. She wasn't going to. Not originally. Not until that bloody smirk. Now magically entangled in the Triwizard Tournament, Hermione must ensure her survival in the Wizarding World's most dangerous game. But as her dreams become haunted by an omnipotent, mysterious force, the young witch must come to terms with her own mortality and learn to appreciate both life and love.
