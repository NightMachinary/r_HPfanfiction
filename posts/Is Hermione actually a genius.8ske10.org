To clarify, I've only read the seven Mainline books (several years ago) and seen the first few movies, so I have no idea about anything that happened in any suplemental material or that sequalish thing about their kids. Anyways, with that out of the way... Is Hermione a Genius? I see this portrayal very very often in fanfic and even when people are just arguing about the characters but I can't remember Hermione doing anything that struck me as truly genius or being portrayed that way. Intelligent, dedicated and motivated in the extreme? Certainly. But I don't recall anything that would justify being the "Brightest Witch of her Age" that's so often thrown about or her often being portrayed as a magical researcher making stunning breakthroughs. Am I just miss-remembering and Hermione is a legit genius, or is it just the fandom being Hermione FUCK YEAH?


** Well, it depends on what you mean by genius. Lots of people use this as shorthand for someone who is really quick at thinking or knows a lot of information. Other people refer to it with some quantifiable variable: for example anyone with a tested IQ over 140 is often referred to as "a genius." So what that implies varies from person to person.

On a more relevant note, Harry Potter is weird like this. What I mean is, the most magically skilled wizards/witches are overwhelmingly the most scholarly and "bookish." Now, some people seem to have more of a "connection" to magic than others (like Riddle from what we see in canon), but generally the more you study and research, the better you are at magic. Thats what Hermione does. Its plausible that, had she not been more interested in professions in law and politics, she could have eventually reached the level of someone like Dumbledore and Voldemort. Its unlikely, but more plausible than say Harry, who is often shown in such a manner.

In a way, the setup in the magical world is sort of like the ultimate nerd dream: the smartest become the most powerful, while the athletic or wealthy people inevitably can be bent to whatever nerds want. Sounds great.

*** You wouldn't describe either Dumbledore or Voldemort as bookish though. You could probably describe Dumbledore as scholarly, but that's never been a defining trait of his. I'm also not sure I'd agree that it's anymore plausible for Hermione over Harry to be at that level. It's not significant evidence, but there's a fair argument for Harry's relative success with the Patronus and his compatibility with esoteric or greater magic.

**** But Dumbledore and Riddle are known to have scoured tons of magical books. Hermione is bookish because they're in school. Generally, Dumbledore doesn't need to cite his sources because he's Dumbledore, Mr. Magic himself. The series makes clear, I think, that it's those who know the most who are the most powerful wizards (the Patronus example is, really, Harry's one one-up over Hermione in strictly magic skill).

***** I wasn't trying to imply that just because she hasn't invented a new branch of magick or whatever by 19 that she's not a genius rather that IMHO to be labeled "Genius" you need to have a certain certain...something. You need to be able to think in a different way to everyone that came before you, and Hermione just doesn't feel like she has it IMO. She certainly seems like the type of person, who in the real world, would be perfectly able to go to higher education, get her Ph.D., and Become a researcher in whatever field she wanted, but...I don't know. I guess she always just felt "ordinarily" highly intelligent rather than being extraordinary.

** Some of her magical exploits:

- Brewed Polyjuice potion, a NEWT subject, in her Year 2
- Replicated the Dark Mark on a piece of Galleon in her Year 5
- Created cursed contract in her Year 5
- Cast complex memory charms and protective enchantments in her Year 7
- Made undetectable extension charm in her Year 7

The memory charm she planted on her parents was especially scary and powerful. It's basically [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception][Inception]].

--------------

Comparably,

- Voldemort managed to deposit his memories in a Book and create Horcruxes by age 16
- Snape improved potion making and created his own spells
- The Marauders created an advanced surveillance device of Hogwarts and became Animagus at age 15
- Dumbledore was said to have aced all his subjects (significantly better OWLs than Hermione).

--------------

Hermione, on the other hand, was constantly fighting for her own life and that of her friends, challenges Voldemort, Snape, the Marauders, and Dumbledore didn't have to face during their times in school.

So I think it's up to readers to decide whether she was a genius or not.

Those are all extracurriculars or awards and none of those things even seem to be /around/ during Harry's time at Hogwarts. Entirely possibly because JKR hadn't even thought of them prior to DH.

So no we don't see Hermione doing some of those things, but we also don't see any of Harry's other peers doing them either.

We know that Dumbledore did things during his Charms and Transfiguration NEWTS which Griselda Marchbanks had never seen before. However we also know that he didn't take Divination.

So theoretically one could say that Bill and Percy Weasley (who are both known to have taken 12 OWLs and got a perfect score on them) got marks which were the same or better than Dumbledore.

****** A lot of the extracurricular things Dumbledore got/did would likely be awarded during seventh year. Notably, Hermione spent what would have been her seventh year living out of a tent, and we never saw what happened if she went back to Hogwarts again to do it properly.

There's also the part where a lot of her most impressive magic - the DA coins, brewing Polyjuice at twelve - was, by its nature, secretive stuff which no one was supposed to know she was doing. Magic she couldn't say she was doing is magic that no one could really assess her on.

If she'd gone up in front of a board of examiners and showed the work she'd done modifying the Protean Charm for the coins...she probably /would/ have been given some kind of prize or recognition for that, because that's brilliant. Finkley Prize won, right there. But she couldn't do that.

Dumbledore's most impressive achievements as a student were very, very public. Hermione's best work was all strictly secret.

However, he regretted doing this /very quickly/. Most of their estrangement is spent with him wishing they weren't estranged, and not having a clue how to end it. I think he made several attempts at reconciliation, but each time he said something insensitive or put his foot in it again (I headcanon that him sending back Molly's jumper was something he did because Bill had contacted him and pricked his pride by telling him to pull his head in) or one of the /others/ was insensitive back to him. Bit by bit, Percy comes to realise that what the Ministry is doing is morally repugnant, but because of pride and awkwardness and stubbornness, the rift doesn't close.

It only closes when events around them all are too big for stubbornness or bad wording to matter.

Notice that she never resented Harry over other things he was better at, like the Patronus.

Don't get me wrong. Hermione worked very hard, and it paid off, but a lot of the things she worked hard at were not directly conducive to getting better at magic. In PoA, for example, she spent much of the year learning a completely unfamiliar legal system.

She wouldn't have acted like a bitch for a whole year just because Harry was supposedly not understanding what he was doing. Did he understand what he is doing in Potion before it ? I'm not sure he was, and he certainly wasn't anymore lost in HBP than he was before it.

Here's another quote, this one from Chapter 10:

#+begin_quote
  Although /Harry had offered to share his book with both of them/, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely ploughing on with what she called the ‘official' instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince's.
#+end_quote

So, Hermione had an opportunity to use the book, but /chose/ not to cheat. That sounds like integrity, not jealousy.

As for Harry being better at DADA, he is certainly more talented in the nerve and reflexes department, but to say that Hermione could not have done anything about it is stretching it a bit: she spent more time personally tutoring Harry in DADA than the other way around---time which she could have chosen to invest in getting better at DADA herself---and she mastered some techniques, such as silent casting, faster than he did.

That's called stubborness, how can you use some books instructions after having acted as some bitch over it. Throughout the year she kept trying to argue over it even for irrational reasons such as Harry not believing it could be written by a woman.

Even when Harry used a bezoard instead of making the potion, she was frustrated while Slughorn hadn't praised his potion skills but his audacity. Her problem was her jealousy over him getting some praises. And actually he deserved it, I don't think most student would done what he did with the bezoard and he proved later in front of that same potion master that he wasn't just a bookish student, he could react instinctively thanks to the knowledge he gathered.

As for DADA, are you referring to the preparation of the third task ? Because otherwise I don't see when she's ever tutored him in that area and actually in that case she didn't tutor him, she helped him the same way Ron did and it was useful to both of them a lot.

Granted, Hermione and Ron both benefited, but Harry benefited about twice as much, since their focus was on helping him get better.

Several issues with DA:

1. Hermione invested about as much time into DA as Harry, since she handled the planning and the logistics. Notably, Hermione learns magic faster than Harry, so if both spend an equal amount of time helping others, Hermione is the one foregoing a greater advantage.

2. Hermione could have passed her DADA OWLs with independent study alone, or in a small group. The reasons she organised DA were strategic: to get the message out about Voldemort's return and to prepare others to fight if it came to that. She probably could have asked an upper-year Gryffindor to teach, but it wouldn't have the same appeal as Harry's celebrity, so no, her asking Harry is not indicative of him being beyond any student at Hogwarts.

3. DA probably improved Harry's skills as much as it improved hers: she knew all the spells that he knew---other than the Patronus---so the most she got was some duelling practice, and probably not the kind that she actually needed. I doubt Harry spent much time working with her specifically, since he had other students who needed his attention more.

In any case, I think that I was unnecessarily narrow in my phrasing: the massive amount of time Hermione spent that year---and other years---helping Harry get better at magic in general, including but not limited to the Summoning Charm, she could have spent working on her own DADA skills.

She could have worked as much as she wanted as she did actually, yet she was never depicted as the best in DADA while Harry who didn't particularly work more than her was outwardly considered to be the top student. Lupin and Hermione simply disagree with you.

I am not portraying Hermione as disadvantaged. I am portraying Harry as twice as advantaged. They went in with the goal of getting /Harry/ ready for TWT tasks, not the other two. That means that whatever training they used was focused on training up Harry. That means, in particular, that they went at his pace, not Hermione's or Ron's. It also means, for example, that they did exercises like having Hermione and Ron cast jinxes at Harry while he shielded, but they probably didn't, say, have Harry and Ron cast at Hermione while she shielded, because that would be an inefficient use of time from the point of view of training up Harry.

His reputation exceeded his magical ability, and his experiences were mainly about nerve and other things he couldn't teach. The "older students" were all either his Quiddich friends or his crush (or her friend).

In fact, Harry suspected that many of DA members showed up just to hear about Voldemort's return.

Hermione already learned all the spells she would need in the OWLs (at least based on Harry's OWL experience) when training Harry in GoF, and she's shown learning and applying NEWT-level magic just from books like it's not a big deal. If there's anything to suggest that she couldn't have learned OWL-level DADA spells the same way, show me the evidence.

When it comes to Hermione's spiel about Harry being more experienced, notice that she was saying that while trying to convince reluctant Harry to be involved in organising her militia. To reiterate what I wrote upthread, if all she wanted was for Harry to teach her, she could have just asked him to practice with her in an unused classroom, not organised a whole organisation.

That's not what the discussion was about. Yes, Harry in canon was better than Hermione at DADA most of the time. The OP question was about Hermione's innate talents, and this branch was about my point that Hermione didn't have the same motivation (including rivals) and resources (including collaborators) as Snape and the Marauders had for getting better at magic. Then, it morphed into the question of whether Hermione could have surpassed Harry in DADA if she had set out to do so.

I don't think I've ever denied that Harry was better at DADA than Hermione. However, no, Hermione didn't spend that much more time on DADA than Harry, especially if you count Quiddich practice. Regarding Hermione getting an EE on her DADA OWL, it the OWL wasn't just about the magical skill: the students had to, for example, fight past a Boggart. Also, given the dialogue around the Patronus in the OWL, Harry was probably the only one given the opportunity for bonus marks.

Sure. Here, in DH:

#+end_quote

Keep in mind that Harry is our point-of-view character, so we only see, maybe, 3 instances of Hermione actually casting a Shield charm in the first place. Most of Harry's shields don't knock people backwards either.

For that matter, did Harry ever master any other variants of Protego?

** While Hermione is smart, she is not a genius by any meaning of the word. If that were the case, then every straight-A student in the world would be a genius, and that isn't the case.

To make the real world analogy, Hermione is the type of student who would get almost all As and in her GCSEs, get A and A-stars on her A-Levels, and then go off to Oxford or Cambridge to get a First. That alone doesn't make someone a genius since tens of thousands of people in the UK attend universities requiring them to get As and A*s on their A-Levels. It certainly shows ability and intelligence, but genius is more than just regurgitating textbooks. In Hermione's case, she's a good student who achieves top grades, just like Percy/Bill/Dawlish/etc, but she was never in the same league as the Marauders, Snape, or Dumbledore/Voldemort when they were all Hogwarts students.

Hermione is book smart, but there is a difference between being book smart (i.e. Hermione, Percy, Dawlish) and actual geniuses such as Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald, Snape, and the Marauders. In all subjects except DADA (and Divination, but she never really cared about the subject anyway), she is the best in Harry's year. But that doesn't make her a genius. It simply makes her a competent witch and a model student.

She isn't creative and never invents anything, unlike the various actual geniuses in the series. Snape invented spells and outclassed Potions experts while he was still a Hogwarts student; the Marauders (minus Lupin) became Animagi without any assistance or support from Hogwarts professors (unlike the Uagadou students who would learnt it formally from their school's professor); Dumbledore, Voldemort and Grindelwald all speak for themselves really. Even Fred and George were closer to geniuses than Hermione.

From what we see, nobody in Harry's year could be considered even close to being a genius. The only ones in Harry's generation (attending Hogwarts at any point between 1991-1998) would be Fred and George. Even as talented as Hermione is, she wouldn't be able to beat an Auror in a 1v1 duel. James or Sirius were probably above the average Auror by their sixth or seventh year, and either Dumbledore or Voldemort as Hogwarts students would have wipe the floor with Bellatrix single-handedly.

*TL;DR: Hermione wasn't a genius. She was a good student and was overall the most intelligent student in Harry's year, but she wasn't a genius, and was far below actual geniuses in the series.*

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This is incorrect. The fake galleons could count as an invention, and they were certainly a creative spin on the Dark Mark tattoo. Also, it's unclear if becoming an Animagus is hard in the sense that would contribute to being labelled a genius. Pettigrew also managed it, but while he is perhaps competent, it's clear that everyone else considers him he bottom of the wrung in whatever group he runs around in, and we know not all the Death Eaters are exceptional (most are simply brutal). The Animagus ritual is more cumbersome and requiring in diligence than skill.

She'd definitely be notches below Dumbledore and Voldemort (although in strictly OWLs, she only had one non-O). But Snape and the Marauders? Hardly obvious she's below them, that would make Lupin's comment about her intelligence completely incomprehensible. If I recall correctly, JKR either outright said she was a genius in an interview or said she was a borderline genius.

  Let me phrase it in a very simple example: Would you really argue that the kid which creates a new software to solve a simple problem is smarter than the kid which reads math-books all his childhood but first needs to spend years of studying before he can produce something original?
#+end_quote

I would argue, for example, that someone who can create a grand idea or concept from nothing is smarter than a person who can replicate such a feat in hindsight. Its easier to do something others have done before you than doing something that nobody before you has ever done. There is a difference between studying Pythagoras theorem and actually inventing Pythagoras theorem, or the difference between knowing how to make an atomic bomb vs inventing the very first atomic bomb.

To take a different example from the HP series, Snape being capable of unaided flight is impressive. What's more impressive is that Voldemort /invented/ the ability of unsupported flight, defying the in-universe belief that flight without a broom or Thestral was impossible. Similarly, while Voldemort never actually invented Horcruxes, he was the first to create multiple Horcruxes. Both accomplishments are almost like successfully cloning an animal or creating a designer baby given that both of Voldemort's accomplishments were deemed in-universe to be impossible until he did it. To a lesser extent, Harry's ability to quickly learn Snape's invented spells shows Harry's natural affinity for dark magic, but Snape actually inventing those spells at a younger age than when Harry first learnt them is a greater accomplishment.

Hermione was always a hardworker and, if anything, it is this aspect of her character I feel is underrated. She was never a genius because she actually had to study and put in effort to get to where she was, unlike the aforementioned geniuses who put in little to no effort whatsoever. If anything, the fact that Hermione had to practice and study so much to outclass the other students in her year makes her a much better character than had she actually been a genius since it humanises her.

She would have quickly learnt that there a loud yet very fringe minority of wizards who believe muggle-borns are inferior to half-blood and pure-blood. I think she studied as hard as she did because she wanted to prove that being a muggle-born didn't make her an inferior witch; that she was just as much of a witch as her peers. If she were actually a genius in the same vein as the Marauders or Snape, then she wouldn't be an underdog and would overshadow Harry even more than she already did.

*TL;DR: Inventing an idea or ability is more significant than mastering/understanding that idea or ability. Voldemort's invention of flight vs Snape learning the ability from Voldemort; Snape's inventing Sectumsempra and Levicorpus in or before his fifth year vs Harry learning them in his sixth year. IMO, Hermione being a talented and hard-working witch makes her a better-written character than if she were just another genius.*

****** You put too much faith in that coin. Hermione did not invent it. She used an existing charm, albeit a difficult one beyond most wizards (the Protean Charm), and applied it to her purpose.

Hermione is no magical inventor, she is a magical engineer - she uses existing tools and adapts and applies them to create a solution to a specific problem. She is good at that, no question. Half because she knows and and is capable of using a wide array of tools, more that possibly 90% of wizardkind. Half because when faced with a problem that she has the tools for she very capable at developing a solution.

What she doesn't do is create new tools. When faced with a problem she has no tool for (or can't find a pre-existing tool she can learn to use in her library) she is stumped and unable to solve the problem.

**** The books put James and Sirius as being equally talented. As for the Aurors, they aren't THAT skilled in the first place. Kingsley and Moody are top-tier, but they are exceptional Aurors, not the norm. Lucius Malfoy could defeat most Aurors in a 1v1 duel, and he's not exactly that skilled compared to the likes of Snape, Bellatrix, or Dolohov.

I'd even argue that the Trio (or at least Harry) were each comparable to most Aurors during the events of DH, whether it be academically or in terms of dueling. While I don't think that any of the three could beat Tonks in a 1v1 duel, she certainly wouldn't have an easy win. I do think at least one of the three could beat Dawlish in a 1v1 duel. Given Dumbledore's praise of Dawlish coupled with Dawlish being Fudge's bodyguard (and not Scrimgeour or Gawain Robards), I'd wager that Dawlish is also more skilled than the average Auror even despite his incompetence, but his strengths are mostly academic rather than dueling.

From that, I think its reasonable to assume that most Aurors would be comparable to Harry or Hermione during DH. Since Snape was far more talented than Hermione at the same age, and both James and Sirius outclassed Snape in basically every subject except Potions and the Dark Arts, I think that either James and Sirius in their sixth or seventh year would be equal or better than most Aurors.

The fact that the wizarding world believed Sirius was Voldemort's right-hand man despite being about 20-21 years old speaks volumes of how talented Sirius was. Even though the likes of Bellatrix Lestrange, Antonin Dolohov, Evan Rosier, Crouch Jr, and Igor Karkaroff were among the Death Eaters, Sirius in particular was a believable right-hand man to Voldemort.

Back to the Auror topic, the fact that the Trio are each comparable to Aurors, and Neville/Ginny/Luna being talented in their own right, actually makes Bellatrix's duel against Hermione+Ginny+Luna. If Hermione is comparable to an Auror, and the combination of Ginny and Luna would defeat an Auror 2v1, then Bellatrix basically dueled the skill equivalent of 2 Aurors.

*TL;DR: James and Sirius are equals, being the most talented students in their year. The magical skill of Aurors are vastly overrated, especially when compared to Kingsley and Moody, or even just Tonks.*

Obviously Snape was the best at Potions in his year, but James and Sirius outclassed him (and everyone else in their year) in every other subject. The best that Lily could ever do is doing better than Lupin, and even that is questionable since I got the impression that Lily was about equal to Lupin in skill (making her very impressive in her own right).

I feel like people overestimate Lily for the same reason they overestimate Hermione: Lily is a female character who is not just talented, but is a muggle-born. This makes Lily one of only two muggleborns in the entire series that can be considered competent, and Lily being the only muggleborn that could be deemed a prodigy. While its obvious that Lily was very talented even as a student, she wasn't as talented as Snape, let alone James and Sirius who outclass both him and Lily.

Because Lily was head girl, there is a misconception that she was the best in her year along with James... even though head boy/girl, in canon and even real-life doesn't work that way. James and Lily would have been made head boy and head girl based on their behavior, popularity, and serving as positive role models for younger students (like Hermione did as a prefect).

It doesn't help that the entirety of HBP subtly implies that Lily's potions skill (at least prior to sixth year) was to some extent attribute to Snape helping her. HBP even draws parallels between Harry learning from Snape's annotated textbook, and due to Slughorn's comparison of Harry's enhanced ability with Potions to Lily's ability, it suggests that Harry learnt from the textbook the way Lily learnt from Snape.

The difference between mother and son is that Lily would have been comparable to Hermione; all Snape did was make Lily's even better at Potions than she already was, and that would have been far above Harry's Potions skill. Lily probably got all Outstandings on her O.W.L.s and N.E.W.Ts (given Lily was far more talented than Harry was), but I don't see her as being in the same league as James and Sirius.

I always saw the Head positions reserved for popular, social people with decent grades, responsible, mature, pleasant, trusted by Dumbledore and active in extracurricular activities. Which explains both Lily and James getting the positions.

However, I have also seen arguments that they weren't really Heads as Hagrid tends to lie a lot, especially about people he loves to people he loves even more (Harry). I can see it, but I don't think Rowling intended it to be that way.

But that doesn't actually put her even anywhere near Voldemort or Dumbledore's level. Slughorn said she was "one of the brightest I ever taught", not that she was ever comparable to Dumbledore and Voldemort.

Yes, Lily was among the brightest that Slughorn ever taught, but so would McGonagall, Flitwick, James, Sirius, and Snape. So even though he called Lily one of the brightest he taught (in Potions), the statement basically gets watered down by James and Sirius being tied for the brightest students in their year, while Snape outclassing Lily at Potions and DADA (if not most subjects).

Even in Slughorn's debut, he mentioned Lily being only one of his favorites, not the absolute favorite. So while Lily was highly talented, she just wasn't in the same league as James and Sirius, let alone Snape who is also outclassed by James and Sirius. I got the impression she was on-par with Lupin, maybe a tiny bit better at best, but Lily lacks the accomplishments that James, Sirius, or even Snape had at her age.

#+begin_quote

Lily wasn't a Charms mistress, nor did she invent the charm that saved Harry (especially since both Voldemort and the diary Riddle knew about the charm's existence). She was good at Charms, but not as good at Charms as Snape was at Potions. She didn't actually duel Voldemort three times, nor did James for that matter. Its a misconception where people assume that defying Voldemort three times means dueling him and escaping. When asked about it, Rowling said the following:

#+begin_quote
  It depends how you take defying, doesn't it. I mean, if you're counting, which I do, anytime you arrested one of his henchmen, anytime you escaped him, anytime you thwarted him, that's what he's looking for. And both couples qualified because they were both fighting. Also, James and Lily turned him down, that was established in "Philosopher's Stone". He wanted them, and they wouldn't come over, so that's one strike against them before they were even out of their teens.
#+end_quote

By Rowling's definition of what it means to defy Voldemort three times, many characters have defied Voldemort three or more times. Most notably would be Moody who would have arrested/killed several Death Eaters before Voldemort even fell from power in 1981.

Rowling just messed up and said he wanted them, which isn't Canon because she literally contradicted herself and what she's written in the books. I'd rather take the books as canon instead of the interviews. But I think most people take 'escape' as dueled him. Which means they both didn't as far as canon goes. The three situations could easily be them assassinating one of his Death Eaters, Voldemort knwonibg about it and hunting them down, only to escape by some miracle. Or they were captured for information and were later rescued. So, you're right, it depends on the situation as it's very vague.

When Lupin calls Hermione the brightest witch of her age he's ever met that means that Hermione at fourteen was brighter and more talented than Lily at fourteen, so I don't think she'd be a straight-O student. Because Lupin did study with Lily, after all. Probably five O's and the rest is either E's or A's. Depending on what she's good at and what she isn't. She was probably great in Potions, Herbology and Care of Magical Creatures so that's three O's. Another two, maybe Charms (you don't need an O to be good at Charms, Ron's wand was good for Charms and he got an E, still exceptional) and Astronomy.

You can still be a genius and memorise the definition of something. I don't see what's wrong with that. She was also the best when it came to practical examinations. Sure, she might have defined it using her own words but Hermione is a perfectionist and worries a lot. She doesn't just memorise the book, she applies everything and gets it right exactly on the first or second try. She brewed a Polyjuice Potion when she was just in her second year, was the only one to be able to apply transfiguration successfully during first year and constantly proved she can cast spells way above her level.

That's not just it: she was able to figure out Snape's puzzle when she was only a first year, found out that it was a basilisk terrorising the school and figured out Remus was a werewolf (she herself says how, his boggart, how he was always sickly around that time). She was also sneaky and used a NEWT level Protean Charm. She proved herself creative when she was talking about the Half-Blood Prince (how many people would assume that maybe just maybe, Prince is a surname?) and she was right about it.

She didn't get an O in Defense Against the Dark Arts, so what? She got an E, which is well above average and I'd imagine most of the Wizarding World would be happy to get such a grade. She was also able to cast a patronus, a sign of superior magical ability. She was competent in DADA, as she constantly showed us in the books.

But if she was writing down possibilities and theories of her own, then that is a sign of intelligence. Again, it depends on /what/ she was writing exactly.

Harry is best in practical when it comes to /Defense Against the Dark Arts/ but Hermione is the one who gets the spells right on her second effort. Harry was a prodigy when it came to Defense only, it was the subject he beat her at. But when Rowling writes the classes they attend, Harry and Ron are always trying and Hermione gets it right almost effortlessly.

Outstanding needs you to have both theoretical and practical. You can get an E when you are good at only one of those, but noticeably bad in another. An 'A' is achieved when you're generally OK. So she was good at practical spells and for example, she cast all the spells she tried before even attending Hogwarts quite successfully. She was also the one to make Harry and Ron apparate with her in Deathly Hallows (or maybe not, I haven't read it in a long time). When it came to DADA, she was good at theory, but noticeably worse when dealing with it in her presence. Even if she wasn't able to defeat a boggart, that's the point of DADA: strength of character. That is evidenced by the patronus (happiest memory) and the Riddikulus Spell (using humour in a situation). Hermione lacked this, to be honest. But she was skilled at it, she used the full Body-Bind in just her first year and the Stunning Spell in her fourth year.

She was in no way on the level of the likes of Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald or even Snape and the Marauders. But she would have clearly reached Amelia Bones's level when she became older.

I think people write her that way because she was clearly shown as more skilled than Harry and Ron, but Remus's 'brightest witch' isn't an official title where it's written down in the Newspapers, that's just ridiculous. That's not justifiable to be on the level of Merlin, but this is fanfiction, not necessarily canon. She wasn't able to find the Bubblehead Charm in the library, so she sure as hell wouldn't know an ancient Chinese Spell because /'oh my god I'm such a talented witch, I have an endless encyclopaedia installed in my brain'/. Her abilities are overrated but she's not the only one (arguably, Lily Evans is portrayed as worse). Obviously, she wouldn't be like Dumbledore at eleven, or when she's a full-grown adult as well.

She doesn't have flaws and is just there to be the ideal picture of what Harry should aim to be, which is frankly boring and differs a lot to book!Hermione, a very flawed and intelligent yet complex girl. I don't see fanfiction Hermione, nor do I see movie Hermione. Part of why I hate the movies so much is because they stripped Ron of all his good attributes and piled them up on Hermione, increasing her skills and making her a match to people like Bones (without Luna or Ginny by her side). Bashing a character, in my opinion, is just as bad, if not worse, as making them flawless and perfect.

But the Hermione in the books is simply brilliant for someone her age and especially if you compare her to people in her year. I mean, being clever is Hermione's most stressed on trait and the one most people will give her when what her traits are is 'clever'. However, her powers do get exaggerated in fanfiction and the movies. I don't read fanfiction involving Hermione that much, but I do read ones that have Lily in them and let me just tell you, it's not just Hermione.

If you reread the books, there are so many little details that show how brilliant Hermione is at practical magic. They're mentioned so casually so I guess that's why people don't remember it as her always reading a book. Again, her wiki page contains some of those (just ignore the movie ones).

********* And Sirius and James were extraordinary at transfiguration (and potions? I mean they did brew the thing), arguably the hardest branch of magic (transfiguration). If the Animagus process is that simple, then anyone can become one with enough concentration and it wouldn't be considered such an incredible feat by many. Pettigrew was said to have got all the help he could get, which is a lot obviously. And given their age, it's hard. Yeah, it's not that Snape invented them, it's about how /young/ he was when he did. There are arguments that his mother was in fact the one who invented them. To be honest, Rowling seems to think everything through today with little consideration to the books. This is a huge reason why people don't consider Pottermore canon anymore. Some things are better left to the imagination and headcanons, which is disappointing when it turns out so incredibly mediocre to some of the best fan theories and headcanons out there. When I found out about the Animagus Transformation I was a little disappointed. Which is why I don't want to know more, like the Horcrux process.

I think the same argument can apply to potions. It's putting a bunch of things in a cauldron and doing some weird things with your stirrer where you stir with it and mix it up occasionally. The instructions are complex but if you want to pay enough attention, you can brew it. Really, you rarely use any magic with your wand in the subject and even Ron got an E in it. Potions are difficult to follow because of how complex the instructions get later on and have no real effect on things such as conjuring stuff, casting magic, etc. Potions is all about precise timing and being diligent as well. You need to have patience for them, that's the key of it. Also, you really need to enjoy it. I don't see how that can help anyone in a duel or practical magic though.

A witch or wizard can be exceptional at potions but how will it help if Voldemort came knocking down your door unless you had a batch of it at the ready?

#+end_quote

When was becoming an Animagus considered incredible? The point is its too much work for such little gain, the transformation is stated to be of little use unless you need concealment, and the requirement of being registered nixes that for most people who aren't going to risk Azkaban to become an animal.

I don't really see the issue with Pottermore. For example, I never thought becoming an Animagus was difficult in terms of the skill required. I just assumed it was cumbersome, which turned out to be partly right. Horcruxes are a bit similar. We know from the books that the ritual requires a spell detailed in /Secrets of the Darkest Art/ and murder. The real reason most don't do it (aside from the almost complete obscurity of the magic) is the one of the fundamental laws of magic: messing with fundamental things (like the "essence of self") has extremely dangerous consequences.

Snape's spells are cool and it's definitely impressive at that age, but does Langlock have any real advantage over Silencio? Like we know /Expelimellius/, despite just being a mispronuciation, ignites a fire, but who would use it over Incendio?

Being exceptional at Potions goes beyond good timing. There's knowing how and why to prepare ingredients a certain way, when to cast certain spells in the process (which is why muggles can't do potions), and having a sharp eye for what solution works best at a given time. The Animagus ritual is, essentially, doing an incantation everyday and drinking a single potion at the required time (when there's a thunderstorm). That's more annoying than anything.

*********** Potions is essentially The Wizarding World's answer to Chemistry. You need to be careful, use the correct ingredients, use balance and be precise in your brewing of it. The spells are probably nothing extraordinary since we don't get how to actually cast it and it was never a focus. The spell said is a small part of the process and seemingly insignificant to all the things you have to do to reach that single spell at the end. You can have anyone brew it but just bring in a magical and let them cast the spell, simple. Chemistry but with magical words.

Yes, it is annoying, but do we actually know what the incantation does and how hard it is to say and to get the desirable effect? Simple spells such as 'accio' require hard work, then what does the Animagus incantation require? It must be horribly difficult to get it right. No, I doubt it's just saying it and getting back to sleep. Otherwise, Pettigrew wouldn't have needed that much help if he just had loads of attention and a lot of other people would be animagi as well. You can't just say it and move on. Being an Animagus is said multiple times to be a hard and complex process that could go incredibly wrong. And the potion is very hard to brew, like it or not. So even if it's simply muttering an incantation (you can't just say /wingardium leviosa/ and get the desired effect so it must have been hard), which it's obviously not, there's more of a presence to potions than the transfiguration itself. So they must've been just as talented as Hermione in potions. Its not just for concealment though, it's a very hard form of self-transfiguration dB would be listed as such. Something that is NEWT level and beyond.

And I'm also pretty sure that that single incantation is much harder than any spell required at potions is going to be.

When was becoming an Animagus said to be hard enough that doing it makes one a genius? It's time consuming, dangerous and requires diligence sure (the daily incantation and holding the leaf in your mouth), but we know Pettigrew isn't a great wizard and yet seems to have managed it about the same time as the other Marauders.

And it only requires a single potion, which seems unlikely to be hard aside from acquiring the correct ingredients. So making it doesn't seem to require extraordinary Potions skill. It has more to do with Transfiguration. Dumbledore says that's the reason McGonagall asked him to help her become an Animagus, to further her Transfiguration knowledge.

************* Let me just say it from here: agree to disagree.

#+begin_quote
  It takes *skill*, practice and patience for wizards and witches to become Animagi. The process of becoming an Animagus is long and arduous, and has the potential to backfire and cause the transformation to go horribly wrong. Many witches and wizards simply feel that their time might better be employed in other ways, as the skill is of limited practical use unless one has a great need of disguise or concealment.

  The process is extremely difficult and can result in disaster (such as permanent half-human, half-animal mutations) if done incorrectly

  *Talented* and determined students may acquire the skill during their school years if they wish to. Minerva had become an Animagus by the age of seventeen, being taught by Professor Dumbledore.
#+end_quote

It's not just patience, you need to be talented and skilled as well, something Sirius and James both were. It seems to me that you want to prove Sirius and James are nothing remarkable because of it while arguing that potions makes Lily and Snape the same level as Hermione, claiming it's talent and yet disregard the Animagus Potion completely. I know you love Lily and Hermione but you're contradicting your own self. If the process doesn't convince you then surely a potion would, but no, you just want to prove that Lily, Snape and Hermione are in the second tier of magically powerful because they are extraordinary potineers (Hermione is up there and so is Snape, but we simply dot know that much about Lily to rank her anywhere), then so are Sirius and James, being borderline geniuses at the subject in their own right.

#+begin_quote
  This potion is a key step to becoming an animagus, and is very difficult, complex and time-consuming to brew correctly, with frightening consequences if done incorrectly.

  The Animagus potion cannot be bought from someone else, as brewing it involves including a piece of one's own hair and a Mandrake Leaf soaked in the mouth of the person who is intended to drink it. Some of the ingredients, however, can be purchased.

  One batch makes approximately a mouthful and only holds enough for one person.
#+end_quote

Wasn't just one batch as well so they must have brewed more than one and not it's highly unlikely only one brew three potions. It was clearly complex and difficult and Pottermore won't provide all the steps, just the key ones so anything like 'simple steps' is simply not true. So it is hard, it says so above. They won't include all the stirs and spells in the process, just like we don't know the exact steps to brewing Amortentia or any of the potions mentioned in canon.

Spells don't need to have a physical effect, you must say this incantation daily and for what? Obviously it must have an effect otherwise it wouldn't be part of the incantation. Pettigrew needed /all the help he can get/, Lupin said as much. So it's likely he messed up multiple times and Sirius and James must have helped him. Does the Fidelius Charm have a physical effect? No, and yet it is described by Flitwick as a highly complex spell. So a spell doesn't need physicality for it to work nor does it need to have a physical presence for it be difficult. If it were so easy, why is it even there?

Becoming an animagus is a complex branch of transfiguration and disregarding that is ignoring why the entire process is special anyway. You also need to have an understanding of the theory behind it, otherwise you're just blindly following instructions. It's mostly transfiguration and transfiguration is considered one of the hardest branches of magic:

#+begin_quote
  Transfiguration is also regarded as "very hard work" and is "more scientific" than any other form of magic, i.e. the practising witch or wizard has to get it exactly right for the transfiguration to be successful.
#+end_quote

So becoming an animagus is something remarkable and sign of superior magical ability and intelligence. If brewing a complex potion makes you such a powerful person, then even if the incantation is as easy as Wingardium Leviosa the potion proves that they're skilled and significantly above average,. You can ignore that if you want but don't disregard it as not that difficult, because it clearly is.

And if that isn't enough then there's this:

#+begin_quote
  'Black and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. *Both very bright, of course - exceptionally bright, in fact*

  'Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school.'

  But Sirius snorted. 'I don't need to look at that rubbish. I know it all.'
#+end_quote

Considering past comments, he's not being overconfident. This is regarding the Transfiguration paper.

#+begin_quote
  'Look, Harry, what you've got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in school at whatever they did'.

  'Sirius was a brave, *clever*, and energetic man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger.'
#+end_quote

And then Slughorn talks about Sirius himself and bring the topic up about him without Harry even hinting at the fact that he knows him.

#+begin_quote
  'The whole Black family had been in my house, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor. *Shame - he was a talented boy*.'
#+end_quote

If the Animagus Potion isn't too reliable then Slughorn would like to disagree with you when it comes to Sirius. He was his Potions Professor, after all. He said it himself that he was talented and he'd have liked him in the Slug Club. Of course, it might have been about his potions skills or transfiguration or his overall abilities as a wizard, since he doesn't bring up any particular subject in /his/ regard.

So, ignore the Animagus Transformation, they were obviously talented, You're free to ignore that as well obviously, but they were /at least/ as talented as Hermione herself, Sirius at least, if not more.

"Clever" I agree, I never once doubted that book Hermione is Clever. But i was using the more "Smartest witch of her age" thing, which i took as "Smartest girl in the year" rather than "of the generation" (makes more sense) I was top of my year and got a First at Oxford, but I don't see myself as a Genius, I'm above Average and overspecialised.

I was basically using the "Chocolate Frog" scale. Hermione, other than "Friend of Harry Potter who assisted in the defeat of Voldemort" Wouldn't have much on her resume, and perfect Grades at OWL Level would help her. She's not much of a duelist though

Hermione's main problem is that even when she's written well, or in Canon, she overshadows everyone else in class.(She actively stands up and raises her hand during the first year potions class)

For Hermione to be "Genius" I'd want to see her do her own thing. Snape created his own spells. Voldemort made horcruxes. Hermione lost a potential resource becauuse of pride. If she'd worked with Harry instead of whining about the Prince's book, that'd have shown more intelligence to me, as it's "Ooh, a genius Potions master left this... let's investigate" and then they try the spells on dummies in the ROR and Draco doesn't nearly die (eh, he was about to torture Harry, I don't blame Harry, but everyone else did)

This sounds made up or at least misplaced a bit. It's certainly preferable for the purposes of papers which, you know, have a word count. But we know their courses had minimum thresholds, not limits beyond which one was penalized (otherwise Hermione wouldn't have aced basically every class). Most of Snape's spells were superfluous (a Dark Magic diffindo, a specific /Levi/ spell, a more crude /Silencio/, etc) and spell creation is something Dumbledore isn't shown doing either. Riddle was more exceptional in making a Horcrux because what sixteen year old knows about something so obscure and requiring in complete malice? It's not like that suggests Riddle was above Dumbledore at that age simply because he actually went through with it (although Dumbledore does say he was the most brilliant student in the school's history).

She wouldn't be one of those rare cards where someone's like "Hermione Granger, wicked cool, heard she's better than Dumbledore' no. But Hermione was a prodigious witch in her own right and wasn't just 'Harry's sidekick friend'. She later went on to become a distinguished figure at the Ministry and changing the laws under the Minister. She is brilliant in her own right and doesn't need Harry for her fame.

So what if she raised her hand in potions class? She knew the answer and wanted to prove herself on the very first day. Is there a problem with that?

Well, she's not a genius in the same sense as Snape, Voldemort, the Marauders, Dumbledore. She was proud, it's a flaw and Harry needed to be better at potions so we could hear all the stuff about Lily that Rowling suddenly noticed she must have missed in earlier books and couldn't have included it in book seven and to hear all about the Half-Blood Prince and his spells, providing drama for later on plot points in Deathly Hallows and the dramatic realisation Snape is a genius. But she does do her own thing, not necessarily a form of proving her magical ability but SPEW: it was a sign of her maturity and emotional intelligence.

** No!

Hermione is intelligent, hard working and really into academics, but she's no Dumbledore, Tom Riddle, Merlin or Morgana!

What do I mean by that?

She doesn't do magic effortlessly and maybe even for fun and without thinking about it! She also doesn't do that much extra curricular work! Yes, bits and pieces and she's ahead of people in most subjects, but she for example doesn't try to pick up runes in first year or do arithmancy before it becomes an elective and even the polyjuice-potion was a one off thing (so no brewing potions above her year level in her free time!)! I mean she saw McGonagall do the animagus transformation in her first transfiguration lesson - but she never looked into that ability? Not even after hearing that Harry's father and Sirius are/were animagi? Damned, why not? (I seriously would look that up and if I had to shop at Borgin and Burkes (or Knockturn Alley in general!) to get info on that...hell, I'd turn the Black Library upside down, too!

Hermione also doesn't make her own spells like say: SNAPE (I hate the guy, but he is very good at magic and potions!) - No, at best she modifies existing ones or uses them on objects, but no new spells!

She also isn't into creatures like say Newt Scammander who keeps creatures no ministry would really want him to have and writes very very very good books about them!

** I agree with the consensus here; she is an overachiever and highly clever, but not a genius.

Geniuses create things that others don't even recognize as possibilities. They aren't just hyper-intelligent; they're hyper-intelligent visionaries. Netwon, Jobs, Einstein, and of course Dumbledore. Professor Marchbanks had this to say about Dumbledore:

#+begin_quote
  Examined him personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did N.E.W.T.s... Did things with a wand I'd never seen before...
#+end_quote

Thank God Hermione wasn't a genius. If she was, she would have played such an outsized role in the story that would make even Steve Kloves blush.

*** That's ridiculous. You're basically saying "genius" only refers to people who create totally novel things and trailblaze entire disciplines, e.g. Newton inventing calculus and discovering Newtonian dynamics, Einstein with Relativity, etc. On that basis, Hawking isn't a genius (even though he obviously was), childhood math geniuses aren't geniuses since they're just really good at existing math, etc.

That's a nonsense standard, most geniuses improve what exists or else have an incredible knowledge and understanding of something; Hermione is clearly the latter sort of genius, something JKR basically said (referred to her as "borderline genius").

**** Agree with [[/u/MindForgedManacle]] and strongly disagree with [[/u/GovernorHumphries]] that a consensus has been reached.

You really can't compare Hermione's academic achievements as a teenager during a war to the achievements of great physicists *over their entire lives.*

You can't even compare her work to Dumbledore's NEWTs performance, given that Hermione didn't get a chance to do her NEWTs!

As for the argument that a genius has to recognise things that others don't see as possibilities, Hermione does demonstrate that kind of thinking: her iconoclastic views on house-elves, for example, or the way she anticipates the Ministry's fall and how she is prepared to flee at a moments notice having even protected her parents (where was the Order in this!?) she also leaves behind a read-made resistance movement of students...

*** It's more like Hermione completing coursework that an 18 year old would be doing. That's generally a sign that they're more than a bit clever.
