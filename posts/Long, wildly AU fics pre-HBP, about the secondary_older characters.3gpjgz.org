I recently rediscovered my favourite fanfiction: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2713360/1/It-Falls-to-the-Young][It Falls To The Young]] (Gen, 149,494 words, Complete). It's mostly Snape-centric with a heavy side order of the James, Sirius and Remus, set when they were still in Hogwarts. The author started the story in 2005 so it's wildly, /wildly/ AU when it comes to Snape's origins and so on, but it's beautifully written and gripping and funny and tearjerking all at the same time. There's no bashing, everyone's very much in character...except Snape, sort of, but then again they're all still young and so much is different that he might as well be an OC. Even then he still has his snark and spite and general darkness.

It's sort of a For Want of a Nail fic. In this AU due to Snape's (rather unique) origins the Death Eaters started recruiting him much earlier; since he was still very young at the time he panicked and went to Dumbledore, meaning he's been a spy from the start. I can't say more than that without spoiling it but I really can't recommend this fic more; no other Hogwarts-era Marauder or Snape fic has been able to match it to me.

What about y'all? Do you have any favourite fics written pre-HBP that you stubbornly refuse to let go of? No Harry/Ron/Hermione please, those have been done to death and mostly aren't much different from the canon universe except for maybe characterization and shipping. Fics that inspired crazy headcanons about Dumbledore or the other teachers or the Malfoys or whoever! As for me, I'll never stop thinking of Snape as Skittles :D
