Hermione joins at some time during the Schoolyears (or after the War) an secret organization that fights dark arts. She gets the Order to protect Harry from the Shadows. She gains access to more advanced magic than in school and during her "Guardian Angel" time, she more and more develop feelings for her VIP Target. Harry stays mostly oblivious, but may get sceptical over time (also developing feelings, if he hasnt them at the beginning).

So, if she joins during the schoolyears you can say, that her Student life is more or less a Undercover part of her.

Alternatively i would accept them to be together right from the Beginning but she gets an invitation to join because there is a new threat. But she is ordered to keep secrets and because of her Behaviour Harry gets suspicious about her might be unfaithful


** Maybe?

  (Bashing! Harem! Based on, but not an answer to, DZ2's 'Evil Never Dies' and 'The Potter Race' challenges) After a near-fatal beating by Vernon after Third Year, Harry is rescued by the most unlikely of...people. Except they're monsters, including an old friend. And he is the heir to the throne of their lord, Ainz Ooal Gown. Will Harry grasp the power that is being offered to him?

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Spygirl by Starfox5) sort of fits.

Other than that, there are some fics where Hermione is trained by Dumbledore and/or Snape to be Harry's bodyguard, usually with a lot of time-turner abuse. All those that I know of are Snamione, however. Do you want links?

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.
