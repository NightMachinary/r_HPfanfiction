** I think that I remember that story. I can't remember the name of it though. I'm pretty sure that Sirius had to name his kid Elvendork.

*** Correct, although I think you have to get into the sequel before Elvendork Black makes an appearance. The name 'Elvendork' is actually lifted from the short James & Sirius prequel that Rowling released a few years ago, so it's even canon-esque.
