So, yall know how Neville was also a candidate for the Prophecy, right? Well I had this idea for a fanfiction where Neville is the Boy Who Lived, and he's the focus of the series. Problem is I've never written a fanfic before. Is anyone with fanfic writing experience willing to help me out and co-author it? I'm probably gonna use Quotev to publish it.

FFN and AO3 would be better options to get noticed

*** Yeah I was thinking more imagine if the Neville from the books was the BWL. Like roughly the same level of nervous courage and stuff. I was planning on none of those things happening in mine lol

***** My idea was that Neville would have grown up with his grandma still but I think he would have less of his nervousness because he didn't have to watch his parents be insane. I was planning on Neville being a bit more like Harry where he's not necessarily the most brave person but he's still willing to do the right thing no matter what. And I also want Harry to be in it with his parents still alive. I think it would make a really interesting Harry, probably a lot like his dad but less mean about his pranks
