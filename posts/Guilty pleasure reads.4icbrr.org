God I don't know how but I keep getting sucked in to read megamatt09 stories and I haaaaaaate myself for it. Granted it's proably because he's one of the most prolific writers of certain pairings i.e. Harry/Kara Kent from the DC universe, and just Harry Potter DC universe crossovers in general. But still.Anyone else have this issue with this or any other author?


** I have a thing for Marriage Contract fics (and to a lesser extent Veela bonds). They're usually incredibly cheesy and i've really only found one or two that did it in a decent and at least somewhat realistic way but i just can't stop reading them.

It's like watching bad romance movies. Objectively i know that this is stupid but it just makes me feel good when they patch up their differences about half way through the story and then start to kick Voldies arse and take over the Wizarding World.

** linkffn(Malachite Gift by Lazov) and its sequels. Harry is a complete Gary-Stu, it's full of stupid cliches and his actions often make me cringe, but there's a charm and technical competency to it that makes it a fun read for a rainy day.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** Ah. I'm the same with megamatt09. The writing can be pretty Ugh. and the sex scenes fairly bland/practically copy pasted every chapter. But damn do I love some of his stories. And he even has some really, really good ones. Like not his usual stuff. But my guilty pleasure read is probably linkffn(5353683). Harry Potter/Sailor Moon/Ranma 1/2 crossover. Has threats of m!preg and evil!dumbles. But I love this story and it's sequel. Holds a special place in my heart.

**** All of robst's stories follow a similar structure.

- Harry and or Hermione suffer a great injustice, usually by the hands of the Ministry of Magic government, and or the Wizarding world as a whole.

- Harry and or Hermione suffer as a result of this injustice, and vow for revenge.

- A miraculous event occurs or a miraculous person assists Harry and or Hermione achieve this revenge, followed by roughly 50-100 chapters of pure ass kicking done by aforementioned characters.

- At some point during this time, Harry and Hermione hook up (if not already) and proceed to have sex at every possible moment.

- The story then ends, Harry and or Hermione living happily ever after, their revenge now taken.

That's not to say I don't like robst's fics, in fact I enjoy them a lot, just be aware that if you liked one story, his others are fairly similar, for better or worse depending on your opinion.

**** I tried reading it and while it was good...it got annoying because Harry was always the winner without him ever facing any "real" issue. I like books with a bit more angst and problems so that book wasn't for me.

Although it is one that I recommend for others because of the author's beautiful writing style.
