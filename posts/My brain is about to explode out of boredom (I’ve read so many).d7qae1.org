I have been reading HP fan fiction since 2005, I feel that I have officially read all of the greater HP fan fictions that have been written that are 10k+ words (I read too quickly to want to read o stories less than that unless asked for a review)

I have read stories with multiple ships pairings ; h/hr.. hr/fl .. hr/gw.. hp/nt.. hp/dm.. hr/dm.. gw/dm You get the point

Please help a fellow reader out T__T (if you're starting something new yourself and it has any of the below criteria lmk and I'll leave a review for you)

-I'm longing for a great adventure AU preferably but I'll dabble in something that follows cannon loosely.

-preferably a h/hr fic with a realistic get together( please please no more “ily so much!!! * make out make out *” in the first chapter, I'll close out of that story faster than you can say Hogwarts )

- any year is alright, but the characters can't be too ‘grown' so to speak. So if it's in 1st year Harry should have misjudgments, should have some ignorance and NOT be an all knowing god.

-he can be a lord or a lord of many or not at all

- 10k+ words

So many thanks for anyone who responds

**** No sweat. =)

In response to your request, I'm currently reading linkffn(Time To Live by loralee1). Harry kills Voldemort almost by accident after OOTP (drops #4 Privet Drive on his head), and spends the summer on holiday and trying to figure out what to do next in life. It's pretty entertaining, and the plot is hinting that there may be trouble with Dumbledore coming up as the MOF suggests Harry might be the next Dark Lord.

** If you haven't already, I just go to ao3 and filter by some pretty broad things (English, complete, 30k+ words) and sort by something like kudos, then I work my way through the dozens of pages of results. I'm currently on page 34 of 107 of my current search. I find some surprising gems this far into the search results. I also find a bunch of duds, but I'm not opposed to abandoning a story after a couple of chapters if it's terrible.

**** On my phone. The one annoying thing about ao3 on my phone is I can only have one window open with the site. If I open another window to do a different search, when I refresh the first window it goes to the same search as the second window (the latest search) which is super annoying when I'm on page 34 of the results and I don't remember exactly what filters and sorting I had on.

** Here is a summary to one that I'm in the progress of writing:

Harry has always been able to see people who aren't really there. After a few years, he learned he was seeing the spirits of those who haven't moved on. Trying his best, he helped those pass on.      After arriving at Hogwarts he is relieved to find that his classmates can see the spirits too. That relief is short-lived when he quickly finds out that none of the other students can touch them as he can.      With the help of his newly acquired friends, head of house, and a curious potion professor, Harry sets out to discover why he is so different from his peers. Those answers may just lay in the night he lived, at least partially.
