I'm looking for a good Voldie victory fanfic. I don't care how twisted it is. I just want Voldemort to win. Thanks in advance, loves!


** I'm surprised no one has yet mentioned [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] linkffn(3766574).

There is a tag on AO3 for that (the "alternate Universe - Voldemort Wins" tag). A lot of them are Harry/Voldemort stories, often with heavy BDSM themes. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/620411][The Courtesan]] linkao3(620411) comes to mind. For non Harry/Voldemort slash: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1815505][Savior's Calling]] linkao3(1815505) is unfinished but started well. It does have Harry/Draco.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/966896][Love's Loathing]] linkao3(966896) has no explicit slash (but does have a relationship between H/V). Despite Riddle not exactly ruling the world, I also think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe][A Riddled Universe]] linkffn(8678567) may be something you enjoy.

#+begin_quote
  In the prejudiced world where the Dark Lord won, Harry Potter is part of the servile caste, the lowest caste in the new society. Resigned to a life of servitude as a Courtesan, Harry is instead drawn under the wing of the Dark Lord himself. Between the scheming Order and his powerful benefactor, Harry finds himself steadily drawn deeper into the growing conflict. Eventual Lord Voldemort/Harry Potter. Minor Rabastan Lestrange/Harry Potter and OMC/Harry Potter.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

There's a checkpoint on every corner, a curfew enforced by Voldemort's most trusted followers, and the only way back to the Boy Who Lived is through the Death Eater responsible for her capture in the first place.
