I've read fanfiction for years, and have seen many cliches used over and over again, what are some unique/different/interesting fanfics that you really like?

Different twists and turns would be fun, though not mandatory. It just has to be different from the norm in some sort of way.

Can be set in the Golden Trio Era but doesn't have to be. It can be from a different timeline/Era.

Can have Harry as the main character, but doesn't have to be.

To make things more fair, it can be about any pairings. Even if it's a pairing I don't care for, someone else might be interested in it.

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

Crossovers are fine.

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)
