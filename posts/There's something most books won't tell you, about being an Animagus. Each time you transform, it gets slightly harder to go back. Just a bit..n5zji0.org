You really shouldn't worry too much about it, It's hardly noticeable! Many do not realize it at all!

Until it's too late, of course.


** Muscle memory. Or magic memory, in this case. The more you cast a spell, the easier it gets to do so. The focus for it comes more naturally, the wand movement becomes an easy reflex, your magic power surges more readily. Eventually, you can do it with a wave of your hand.\\
 \\
The animagus transformation is no different. Initiating the first transformation is a time-consuming, difficult task, requiring a particularly complex potion just to teach the body that it /can/ be done.\\
But it gets easier. The transformation becomes quicker and smoother, the animal comes more readily, and over time, turning into an animal just becomes easy as walking. The animal form becomes just as natural as the human form.\\
 \\
Natural, that's the important word. Spells like Finite and Homorphus can reverse a transfiguration, but they can't change something or someone that's already in its natural state.\\
While the animagus transformation is induced by magic, that doesn't stop it from becoming someone's true form, not when they've embraced their animal skin as fundamental to their being and their human form just a mask.\\
 \\
It doesn't come as a shock, when an animagus can no longer change back to human. The change is mental as well as physical, less of a 'I can't turn back' and more of a 'I don't want to turn back'.\\
Some continue to live among humans, engaging in what human behaviors they enjoy whilst remaining comfortable in their bestial identity. Some become pets for those they love, or settle down for a simple life as a beast of burden. Some disappear into the country, finding animals of their own kind and forming new bonds with their wild kin.\\
 \\
A few, though, those few whom view human form as a tool to be used, those who desire to manipulate humans despite their separation from mankind...they gain the power to transform into a human again, as a disguise rather than a true reflection of their being.\\
Some of these shapeshifters are benevolent, using their human guise to steer others towards better lives. Some are whimsical pranksters, inflicting all manner of mischief and confusion upon civilized settlements before vanishing without a trace. But a rare few are monsters, impersonating others to spread discord and hatred, turning entire towns against each other just because they can.

**** Hmm...I'm imagining a capital-V Vampire. An Animagus who became abloodsucking bat, but clung to the desire to manipulate humankind. They don a human disguise, but don't resist the temptation to drink blood.

** This prompt has the potential to be quite creepy. I remember reading a really eerie kind of fic on the same prompt with Sirius and his Animagus Form.

** I did a slight variant on this in one chapter of my fic Pointing Out The Obvious - the longer an Animagus goes without turning back, the harder it is to do so. So Pettigrew as Scabbers gets himself eaten by Hermes.
