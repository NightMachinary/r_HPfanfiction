It's the “Those Who...” series by TheLonelyGodWithABox. I am confused on several things about the series. 1. In the first installment, what is the ship? I assumed that it is Harry/Theodore Nott at first, but then I saw that in the last installment it said “no slash,” so I was confused. 2. How does the third installment even play into the “Those Who...” story? It seems completely separate, like it's part of a whole different universe, at least from the summary. 3. Is the series abandoned? The most recent installment hasn't been updated since 2016, and it seems the author hasn't been active on AO3 since 2018... 4. If it is abandoned, is it possible to just read the first installment and then stop? Does the first installment have a satisfying ending?


** I haven't read this but, when it's been 3+ years since a series update, I assume it's not going to be continued. You could subscribe to the series if you are super interested. Re the pairing - it seems like Harry whump. IOW, more about torturing Harry. And maybe part 3 is an AU.

If you really want to know, post a comment and maybe the author will respond. Last update was 2018 (another HP story).
