  "Socks are Dobby's favorite, favorite clothes, sir!" he said, ripping off his odd ones and pulling on Uncle Vernon's. "I has seven now, sir....But sir..." he said, his eyes widening, having pulled both socks up to their highest extent, so that they reached to the bottom of his shorts, "they has made a mistake in the shop, Harry Potter, they is giving you two the same!"

  *"Ah, no, Harry, how come you didn't spot that?" said Ron, grinning over from his own bed,* which was now strewn with wrapping paper. "Tell you what, Dobby - here you go - take these two, and you can mix them up properly. And here's your sweater."

  *He threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped, and the hand-knitted sweater Mrs. Weasley had sent,* Dobby looked quite overwhelmed.

  "Sir is very kind!" he squeaked, his eyes brimming with tears again, bowing deeply to Ron. "Dobby knew sir must be a great wizard, for he is Harry Potter's greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless -"

  "They're only socks," said Ron, who had gone slightly pink around the ears, though he looked rather pleased all the same.

Also, book 6 Ron had excellent insights on Hermione's views on things. Like the Prince's book for instance. Unfortunately, he also started thinking with his dick.

Abusive Ron is also a trope that makes no sense in canon, considering Hermione is the only one in that relationship who hit the other. Frankly, barring book 4, I actually tend to lean towards Ron in most of the arguments.

I do get why Kingsley wasn't still Minister (you're getting awfully close to an Authoritarian Government doing that), but it just reads as meh fanfiction to have her become Minister. I think she'd be better than Fudge, but anything else? She shows absolutely no leadership during canon. Harry is the leader of the trio. Harry teaches the DA. Neville leads and organizes a fucking resistance against Death Eaters.

#+end_quote

In fairness to Ron, this suggestion came during war time. The Death Eaters weren't in the cafe for a friendly duel or exchange ideas - they came to seize Harry for Voldemort to murder later, and Hermione and Ron would've inevitably been tortured and killed as well. Not to mention the fact that even if Harry, Ron, and Hermione are able to get away, those Death Eaters are certain to terrorize and harm /somebody/ (as many somebodies as they can, and probably targeting people very close to Ron), and how exactly is it righteous to leave open that possibility? Ron isn't really being ruthless, he's being pragmatic.

I understand the short-term strategic reasons behind leaving them alive, but sending two murderous enemy combatants back into the fray (in fine condition, no less) was not an ideal outcome, particularly long-term.

Book 6 Hermione was a bit nicer to Lavender than book 3 Hermione. Lavender's character is treated horribly in canon.

I'm glad you aren't buying in the Daphne Greengrass hype. I've read good fics with the canon OC, but that's in spite of the character.

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

** For the most part, I agree with this post. But I don't think the example you gave was good. Not when Ron was being a low effort guy in that scene. He gave away a gift he received, and yes, that was sweet of him to do, but it falls flat when you remember Harry actually went out of his way to free Dobby.

Better example of Ron's thoughtfulness would have been one of the scenes where he notices Hermione's breakdown in third year or one of the scenes he magnificently eases tension when Harry gets mad or upset.

Honestly, for all Hermione's claims that Ron has the emotional range of a spoon, Ron was adept at reading a situation. He understood his friends better than they understood each other or him. He was a great friend.

What he lacked was a plot purpose while he had narrative purpose. So, he was thought as the useless guy.

I really suggest anyone who thinks about rereading the series to pay close attention to Harry's thought process. He bases so many decisions on what Ron thinks. Theirs is truly a special relationship. Much more than one between canon couples. Bros forever.

*** Hermione might have been more loyal to Harry as a whole, but Ron was the one he loved spending time with. And Ron wasn't disloyal as peeved. He handled the situation in book 4 poorly and spent book 7 being affected by a horcrux.

But looking at the Ron and Hermione relationship, I don't think Hermione gives Ron enough credit, and actually treats him quite poorly. Book 1, while Ron was thoughtless to mention Hermione's lack of friends within earshot, he had a point. She was very condescending.

Book 2, she fawned on Lockhart. We'll save this for later.

Book 3, she ignored her pet trying to presumably eat Scabbers, dismissing Ron.

Book 4, while she was right to be mad at Ron for the Yule Ball, she was also wrong to call him out for admiring Fleur, as she did the exact same thing.

Book 5, look at her response to Ron becoming a prefect.

Book 6, she freaking attacks Ron with birds for daring to have fun with his girlfriend while she's sad.

Book 7... I have nothing on this front.

​

Ron was actually a pretty cool character, who just didn't a chance to shine. In the books or the movies, where Hermione steals all his parts.
