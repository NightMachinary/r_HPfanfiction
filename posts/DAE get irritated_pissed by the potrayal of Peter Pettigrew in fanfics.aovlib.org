So, quite a lot of fanfics that I read show Peter as a dumb guy, who the others are hanging around out of pity and like a very weak character all together. DAE get pissed at that?


** Yep. Me. "Less bold and skilled than the other Marauders" doesn't have to mean "irredeemably shlop", especially considering he still managed to become an Animagus at such a young age. And he was also not already showing signs of untrustworthiness and underlying evil as a kid; there's every reason to believe he was a good and loyal friend for most of his life, and only broke during the war because he just couldn't take the pressure of the constant Damocles sword. His betrayal loses most of its narrative and emotional weight if he was always a weaselly little coward ready to sell out his friends for anything.

Sure, but in context that /means/ he was slow/er/ than the other three. Having such talented friends made him look worse for comparison, but Pettigrew consistently manages rather difficult magics throughout the series --- the Animagus Transformation, of course; contributing to the creation of the Marauder's Map; that spur-of-the-moment spell to blow up the Muggle street and cut his finger, /while/ performing the Transformation at the same time; casting a Killing Curse with another man's wand...

#+end_quote

...If nothing else, there's perhaps the fact that everyone, including Dumbledore, trusted him? Enough to make him the Secret-Keeper, enough for him to be a part of the Order of the Phoenix.

/Also/, if Pettigrew had always been disloyal and an utter coward, I don't think he'd have gone his whole school life without blabbing to Filch or some other authority figure about the Marauders, or, indeed, continued to participate in their reckless rule-breaking.

Let's also not forget the whole "went through the trouble of learning how to become an Animagus just so Remus wouldn't be lonely" thing.

wormtail also can't remember how to identify a werewolf during SWM. nothing suggests he was slow relative to them, as opposed to being slow or bad at school in general. if he was bad at school, he'd obviously also be slow compared to them. we don't know what he contributed to the map. he needed all the help he could get for the animagus. and to be frank, the actual process seems more tedious than difficult. we know that there are students who accomplish it younger than the marauders in other parts of the world

also, i don't see that lupin was especially talented

sirius told snape how to get past the willow, betraying lupin's trust. during the war, sirius and lupin, suspected each other during the war. sirius was, objectively, not a good friend. he'd still die for lupin

snape would do anything to keep lily alive. /anything/. snape was also a horrible friend

#+begin_quote
  Also, if Pettigrew had always been disloyal and an utter coward
#+end_quote

this is my point. posts like this see only two extremes: either he was an obvious traitor, or the perfect friend. everything we see of wormtail suggests he's cowardly, sycophantic, annoying, and selfish. that's how he comes off in SWM. the key isn't to portray him as a good friend, but to portray his foibles as minor enough to allow the friendship to trudge on in context. maybe he did break under pressure from filch to some misdeed sometime

** All the time!

It particularly annoys me because the plot makes no sense with him being stupid and weak. However much Sirius distrusted Remus, he'd never put someone who he thought was stupid and weak, and therefore more likely to crumble, forward to be James' secret keeper. So he must have been convincing enough as a friend to be able to be trusted by James and Sirius in 1981, and, therefore, intelligent enough to hide his switching of sides.

Also, he's able to turn into an Animagus. Yes, it's canon that he had significant help with that, but it's still very much said to be something most wizards can't manage even with help.

My personal head canon of a personality for Peter is that he's intelligent, good at schemes and has tendencies towards being manipulative, but really does love his friends. But, ultimately, he wants to save himself, as well, so he ties himself up in knots and eventually joins the Death Eaters because he's convinced himself it's the best outcome for everyone, somehow, that the Dark Lord will leave Remus and Sirius alone, and at least only one of them will have to die.

It's my theory, anyway.

And yet Sirius himself described Pettigrew that way. Hang on, let me find the exact quote - it's in the Shrieking Shack scene, after Sirius comments that Peter was only chosen as Secret-Keeper at Sirius's behest.

*"I thought it was the perfect plan...a bluff...Voldemort would be sure to come after me, would never dream they'd use /a weak, talentless thing like you/..."*

^{Ch.19, /The Servant of Lord Voldemort/}

Mind you, talentless compared to Sirius and James, who were exceptionally bright, doesn't necessarily mean he was /completely/ inept. But it's clear already that Sirius had a low opinion of Peter's magical abilities.

That said, he certainly wasn't completely stupid, as Iniga mentioned below.

** Yes, I was just saying this in the Sirius thread the other day.

Peter managed to complete the animagus transformation at 15/16. Yes, he had help. He still did it. He then proceeded to outmaneuver James, Lily, Remus, and Sirius simultaneously when he betrayed the Order, and then outmaneuvered Sirius again to get him sent to prison. Then, after a decade-plus as a rat, he brewed the potion needed for Voldemort's resurrection.

During the big confrontation in the Shrieking Shack, Sirius explicitly says that the rest of them would have died for Peter. That line has always had a particular ring of truth for me.

More than anything else that we haven't already learned from canon-supplemental material, I'd like to know a bit about Peter's backstory and what drew the other Marauders to him when they were kids.

I don't know that I rise to the level of getting pissed when Peter is written as a weak cartoon (since that is mostly how we see him act in canon) but I do have a lot of praise for a writer who is able to avoid that trope.

I've always associated his behaviour from PoA onwards as being influenced by his animal half, as per the fanon idea that an Animagus who spends too much time in their animal form risks losing themselves to the animal.

**** True, but I was thinking more of his behavior in the SWM flashback. I remember being so disappointed the first time I read it because I was hoping for a window into a complex Judas-figure and instead we got Peter not able to name the signs of a werewolf on his exam (!) and so slavishly cheerleading James that Sirius tells James to stop before Peter wets himself.

Now maybe Peter was just the type to freak out during exams and forget everything he knows, which was frustrating to Sirius who was clearly the type to be so confident that he'd be in the mindset to guess correctly where he didn't know. And maybe coming down off the stress of the exams had him more in awe of, and unequal to, James than normal.

But it was still too much of a mirror of the Shrieking Shack in POA for me: Peter says idiotic things, Sirius doesn't bother to hide his disdain.

** I do! I can't think of any off the top of my head, but there are several time-travel fics back to the Marauder's Era where the MC attempts to get preemptive justice by bullying or killing him or whatnot. I /understand/ if the character is doing that to other people like Snape and Malfoy and whoever, but I don't /approve/ of it either way. It's against my moral code to punish someone for something they won't do for years to come---especially if it's a "screw the timeline!" fic where Pettigrew ccould've been pushed to become better and not make that choice in the first place.

In the end, I've got to agree with Achille-Talon; Pettigrew was probably a great friend who broke under the stress of war. It does not make his actions forgivable by any means, and I must agree with Sirius' statement of "he should've died rather than betray them" or however it went. But there was a period of time where Pettigrew was /Peter/, and Peter loved and cared for his friends just as much as the next bloke.

And while we're on the subject, does anyone have any fics where Peter doesn't betray the Potter family? I feel like that might make an interesting read, so long as it's well-written...

*** Well, now, Snape and Wormtail aren't exactly comparable when their motives for turning traitor were completely different. One did it out of love, however twisted that love may be and he kept at it even after his love's death just to repent for his sins. That's not to say his actions can be repented and the man himself doubts it, apparent by the shame he feels when he makes Dumbledore's swear he won't tell a soul.

Wormtail, in the other hand, turns out of fear. Though it is understandable for him to break under the pressure of war, it is his search of Voldemort after escaping from the Shack and his part in bringing that horror back when he could have just as easily disappeared into obscurity.

But you are right in that Wormtail proves himself to be a danger. Hell, he proved more dangerous that Lucius Malfoy at the height of the peacock's power. Would I call him the most dangerous Marauder? Perhaps not, but I don't think he was lesser than them.

#+end_quote

Does he, though? Everyone else /says/ he did, but everyone else has already been proven wrong about Wormtail multiple times. Wormtail says he did in the Shrieking Shack, but of course he would try to play into Sirius's perceptions. Maybe Wormtail himself believes he did it out of fear and because he had no other options -- he tells himself this to assuage his guilt over his betrayal. But.. Wormtail's actions are entirely incongruous with the perception that he is a coward. He joined the Order /and/ the Death Eaters -- both highly dangerous organisations. He /chose/ to turn spy against the Order and successfully spied on them for more than a year -- a spy, the most gutsy profession there can possibly be! He lobs off his own body parts with impunity where most people would balk, he argues with Voldemort regarding the morals of killing, he /wants/ to be put in dangerous (and important) missions by Voldemort, he has been breaking rules ever since he joined school and became friends with the Marauders.

So I don't believe Peter is or was ever a coward. Normally cautious and perpetually nervous, maybe. Coward, no. Peter always chose to associate himself with the biggest bullies in town. For security, perhaps, but also for self-importance, and for satisfying his baser urges for violence. He is described in the pensieve scene to be watching James and Sirius bully Snape eagerly and delightfully egging them on. But post-Hogwarts James and Sirius are no longer the big bad bullies on top of the world -- that's Voldemort. Even with the Marauders he probably resented that he was a bit of a hanger-on and seen as seen as weak and unintelligent -- perhaps that is why he is initially /offended/ that Voldemort chooses Barty Crouch over him in GoF. Wormtail probably saw joining the death Eaters as a super grand and cool thing, a place where he would finally be appreciated. Alas, Voldemort seems to bear as much disdain for him as his now former friends.

So I doubt Wormatil's motive for turning against his friends was something as simple as fear. It may have been part of it -- insofar as being part of the winning side appealed to him, but it just doesn't add up on its own -- and Wormtail shows other motivations in the series that make more sense imo.

Everyone always takes that conversation at face value, when it's obvious that Pettigrew just tried to bullshit his way out. What else could he say when it was revealed he was a Death Eater? That he joined Voldemort of his own free will to indulde his baser instincts and score one over his more talented, popular and successful friends who had always underestimated him? Instead, he tried to portray himself as a victim to avoid being killed on the spot and escape. A good strategy, seeing that it worked.

******* except everything does, lol. he joins the order because james and sirius do, and with a war on, he thinks he's safest closest to them. either voldemort gets to him or he thinks voldemort is winning, so he defects. both actions are in line with him as a coward, but a specific type of coward- he thinks he's safest only with stronger people. as for 'baser instincts'- he eggs james and sirius on because he's their sycophant, and it's snape, who probably talked shit about him, or hexed him. wormtail prioritises his own safety above all. also, if he wants power or respect, aligning himself with people treat him like dirt, which james, sirius and voldemort all do, isn't exacty the way to go. he lobs his hands off because again, he thinks he's safest with voldemort

#+end_quote

that's...not obvious at all, or canon. being a spy doesn't mean you know occlumency. nor was he playing at pretense most of his life. he was an anxious, slow kid, and learned to act within that perception of himself, but he can't really change that perception

** yeah, usually he's all cowardly, pathetic, unskilled, bad with girls and socially awkward all the time. Like, they are supposed to be friends, right? If he behaved like that, there should be some people at least who believed he was a coward and traitor, and not his loyal friend Sirius?

I personally haven't read a good fanfic except one that explored his betrayal, the reasons and his role as a friend (can't remember the title tho, somehow he told James he was a death eater and turned spy? and he worked in the ministry and Harry and co were kinda young, if I remember it right) he should've had SOME good qualities.

He's able to trick James, Lily and Sirius, with no one being the wiser.

He's able to frame Sirius for James and Lily, and the 12 Muggles murder.

And he's able to escape, faking his own death and living life as a rat for years.

He's also able to bring Voldemort back.

Pretty damn awesome for the "weakest or dumbest Marauder" as so many people like to write him as.

Though I think a lot of it has to do with how Rowling ended up writing Pettigrew as well. Seeing him cower against Voldemort and the like.

** I generally ignore him because I rarely see him written as anything more than a plot device to resurrect old Voldy, but I do remember one story where he had somehow been tricked into everything, he'd had some inkling of what was going on but he was as much a coward as he was clever, but later in the story he was very penitent about everything, and Harry had forgiven him for what happened and strong-armed Sirius and Remus into reluctantly forgiving him as well. I think he'd been under Voldy's imperius or something.

But yeah, it does get annoying when an author goes out of their way to write him as a buffoon.

How would you feel about him being written as clever enough to hide his being clever behind a dullard's façade? Maybe playing at being the good friend and gopher of the marauders (supplying snacks and supplies for prank planning sessions), while judging them and their pranks with hints and suggestions?

I did get horribly irritated with the ones that have Peter captured and (under Veritaserum) go 'yup, I'm an unrepentant Death Eater, rape and murder woo-hoo!'. And the ones where the 'heroes' just murder or torture him for his supposed death-eater-iness.

Come to think of it, seeing as Voldemort is an expert at Legilimency, and Imperius, and False Memory Charms and who-knows-what-other mind manipulations (LF Voldemort doses Peter with a love potion), why do people assume that Peter wilfully betrayed the Potters at all?

Welp, now I have two ideas in mind.

One is that James & Lily /knew/ that Peter was under duress by the Dark Lord (between various mind-altering magics and intimidation and such) but that he was also succeeding in withstanding Voldemort's attempts to brainwash him via a combination of paranoia and strong will (and a Pensive to double-check his memories).\\
Given the choice between choosing someone who had beaten all of Voldemort's mind-manipulating tricks before (up to that point, probably only Peter and Alastor Moody), or anyone else who they couldn't be sure could stand up to Voldemort's magic (everyone else, keeping in mind that there was already a willing-or-unwilling spy within the Order of the Phoenix), they chose Peter Pettigrew.\\
It's just ill-fortune that a year after being chosen as the Secret Keeper, Voldemort finally found a way to capture and break Peter, leaving him a terrified, obedient shell of his former self and having gained the Secret of the Potters' location.

The other thing that occurs to me is that sparing or killing Peter/sending him to Azkaban has serious consequences for Harry himself; Harry's power to defeat Voldemort lies in his ability to love and to sacrifice himself (see; making everyone Voldemort-proof at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts) and his ability to forgive is a big part of that (note the students he sacrificed his life to help are the same ones who shunned/abused him on various occasions over the years, up to saving Draco's life personally despite his many misdeeds).\\
If Harry chose to let Peter be killed, or succeeded in sending him to Azkaban (which he should well know is just as bad, given his (and Hagrid's) first-hand knowledge of dementors), that decision to reject mercy and throw away someone else's life would resonate through his later years, hardening his heart when dealing with others and withering his all-important power to love; that in turn could fatally weaken his will on several later occasions, being possessed by Voldemort, facing the locket Horcrux, and sacrificing himself at the Battle of Hogwarts. In fact, I'd say Harry failed the test of his ability to love in PoA; he chose to send Peter Pettigrew to Azkaban, though he aimed to clear Sirius's name as well. If Harry had succeeded in delivering Peter to the Ministry, Harry's soul would be stained by his decision to sacrifice another for his own gain. Even though he failed, and Peter escaped, his decision meant that Peter had no choice but to return to Voldemort, initiating the events of the next four books (to quote Voldemort; "Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go.").\\
Even if Harry had stood aside and let Sirius and Lupin kill Peter, his soul would still have been tainted by his refusal to show mercy; though Voldemort's return would have been delayed (with no Peter to help him rescue Crouch Jr. and orchestrate the Triwizard kidnapping), the fact that his horcruxes and their defences were intact (case in point, the Ring definitely cut Dumbledore's life short) meant that his return would still be inevitable, and Harry would still be worse off for it.\\
The best path for Harry at that point would have been to spare and forgive Peter (he kept the peace for years as a rat, after all), even if it meant Sirius's name wouldn't be cleared; this test of his resolve and choosing mercy over wrath would strengthen Harry and delay Voldemort (since if Peter doesn't need to flee, he doesn't need to serve Voldemort).

*** Not that I don't agree that Azkaban is not a merciful option but Harry also didn't show any mercy when Lucius Malfoy went to Azkaban or when he cast cruciatus and especially when he successfully cast it on one of the Carrow twins. Failing to deliver justice isn't mercy. It is not sacrificing someone for your own gain when that someone is a murderer of over a dozen people and has caused an innocent man to live the horrors you think Harry shouldn't bestow upon him.

Cunning doesn't have to mean smart. I know plenty of people who are clever and cunning in a viscous sense without being smart.
