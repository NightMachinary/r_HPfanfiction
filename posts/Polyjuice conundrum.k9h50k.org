So I was at work and this popped into my head.

If you are terminally sick with some incurable magical disease, are you completely healthy while under the effects of polyjuice if the person you are polyjuicing as is healthy?

Provided there is a way created to permanently stay in the new polyjuice form, if aurors saved a hair from before they went on a mission and lost a limb, could they gain it back using polyjuice? I get that this part is just conjecture (not canon), but as far as I remember Moody polyjuiced as Harry, and had all his limbs at the time, so that's where this question came from.

** Didn't Harry not need his glasses after he took Polyjuice to become Goyle? That would support you taking on the medical state of the new body. Not sure if you can take it to become a previous version of yourself.

** I read one story where flamels immorality was really just a solid decade of taking and meticulously storing hair samples and now just guzzling polyjuice. A side effect is that he always has a stupid hair cut. (Since his polyjuice form is almost always from the middle of a haircut)

*** I was about to mention this, too. I cannot remember the title of the fic.

** Barty Crouch's wife polyjuiced into her son, but she still died, so terminal illnesses probably don't go away.

*** It's also possible that the strain of the polyjuice change is what killed her, since she was so weak when she drank it. And since the guards in canon never really checked on prisoners it's possible she died pretty quickly to.

** I always assumed Polyjuice potion is a sort of an illusion. Nothing more. It will give you your target's body likeness (physique, voice, height, weight, etc.) and their deformities (missing limbs, scars, eyesight, etc...), but won't turn you actually into them.

It is still /you/ inside. So whatever ilness plagues you - you still have it. If you are old and feeble, the potion won't give you a youthful body. In the same vane if you are a man, the potion won't give you a real female body. You won't be able to get pregnant for instance.

** You know, if I was living in that world and was a terminal patient, I would purchase a magical creature and attempt whatever happened to Hermione when she stuck cat hair in that potion. You're right that a healthy person would give a Polyjuicer temporary health, problem is the strain might kill them.

In the case of Barty crouch's mom, I would assume that she knew she was about to die, and did something to ensure she perished before the potion ran out, leaving a very convincing corpse of her son.

** When the six people posed as Harry, they needed to wear glasses too, right? So yeah, I'm thinking that if you have a medical illness, it won't be present in other person's body, but if they have a medical disease, you would have it too, for the time.

I dk if the six people impersonating Harry wore glasses that were fake, or actual glasses, so I can't help you much, I guess...
