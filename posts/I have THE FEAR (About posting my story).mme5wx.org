At this point I've been writing this story for over a year and I'm in deep, like 48 chapters 180k words deep. I've not posted a chapter of it yet and won't until I've finished. I promised myself as I felt it would be the only way I'd finish without getting discouraged.

The thing is, I was reading a random other fic and noticed a comment stating that the main character was written way out of character and suddenly I felt THE FEAR.

My story Is told in first person present tense from Hermione's point of view. I have the feeling that of all the characters she's the one that people get most het up about being out of character. I just have visions of negative comments about my writing of her being out of character or a Mary Sue, of endless people telling me she would never do that/think that/react that way.

Honestly, it's enough to make me not want to post. Which seems a shame considering how much time I've invested and how excited I still am personally about the story. I've written for many years and many fandoms and normally I don't give a damn if people have a problem with what I post, but I've never written anything this long before and I've only written a couple of one-shots for this fandom before. HP fanfiction readers seem... Intense.

I'm looking for advice and a pep-talk really. If you come across a story that isn't quite how you understand and interpret a character, would it put you off? Or would you be willing to go with it, as long as the writing is engaging (or at least competent?) Do you have any advice on how I can get over myself?! Ha.

Thanks all.


** Hello!!! I am in almost your exact situation, although I'm only nine chapters in to mine.

First of all, I'm so proud of you for making it this far! That's a crazy big accomplishment and time commitment.

Secondly, I 100% read out of character Hermione stories. Almost all of them are out of character in some way. The only thing that I look for is a coherent writing style that isn't riddled with grammar/spelling/formatting errors. That's the only thing that kicks me out of a fic.

I feel the same way as you do- I'm so happy writing my fic in my own little bubble, and I'm too afraid to share it with others right now. I think the key is to recognize that some people criticize instead of taking a moment to realize that the fic isn't necessarily for them, but that doesn't mean it is inherently bad.

You will undoubtedly get rude reviews that punch you in the gut, but you will also get reviews from people who get you, and who love what you did with the story. It's worth it. You clearly love the story enough to dedicate this much time to it. I promise you there will be so many people who love it too.

I'm excited for you!

** Fuck em.

Seriously, fuck them.

You wrote a 48 chapter story. You write 160,000 words for FUN!?? Thats, jesus that's absolutely insane!! The amount of time and effort you've put into that?? That's incredible. It shows a level of commitment and dedication you should be putting on cvs. You did all that with no incentive, you are amazing.

And absolutely no one can take away how proud of yourself you should be.

Fuck anyone who tries to take you down. If they don't like your characterisation. Fuck them. Have they ever written a story with that much depth?? Not bloody likely, what legs have the to stand on? They have no idea how hard it is to out that much work into something.

So screw them. Their opinions don't matter. They can't hurt, yes. But please don't let that stop you from posting. You put so much work into this, you deserve to get some love and likes for it.

** When I wrote my first, I had zero intention on posting it, and then about 70k words in I thought "there has to be at least one other person out there who would want to read this" and it kick started a fantastic year of writing for me. I know OCC is a big complaint in any fics, so if you're worried about it, I'd call it out at the beginning and this way if people still read it, then that's on them. I have an occ Snape (with good reason, he's an AU version) and made sure to state it promptly at the beginning and didn't think twice about it. You'll get some good feedback, and inevitably you'll get some bad too, but you shouldn't hold back your accomplishment because of others.

My biggest piece of advice to any writer is to write the story YOU want to read, not for anyone else. Since you're going to wait to post it it's completed, you have less influence coming in, but that mentality will help against any negativity you may recipe. I do sometimes adjust based on feedback (during my latest I had a reviewer ask if a certain conversation had occurred yet, and it triggered me to add a specific scene to address it which I'm actually very happy with), but overall I write the story for me - not my beta reader, not the general readers, just me.

Congratulations on how far you've come already! I hope you don't feel discouraged by others and let the fandom read what you have to offer!

** Ok, firstly: well done, you! And I understand your hesitance to upload the story; I went through the same.

Write what you want to write, and write for yourself. And this is very important: it's impossible to please everyone. Don't even try. Do not fall into the trap of trying to revise your story, for someone else's benefit. Do not let others compromise your vision.

Getting good reviews is nice, but don't allow them to influence you too much. It will only make the inevitable negative ones sting that much more.

Now, about in character. It all depends on what you're going for. Are you trying to write a Hermione who is true to book canon? Perhaps more akin to her film counterpart?

Perhaps you are starting with an in character Hermione who develops into a different person? That's perfectly fine, so long as you provide reasons/context.

That's what I did with my own Harry. He's changed, since the start of my story, and he's had to bend some of his principles, but he is still very much Harry, and driven by his core motivations. Always provide context!

Hope this helps, and best of luck to you!

*** Thank you! I think it's a case of me picking certain traits of hers and ignoring others I don't want to write. The determined, headstrong, passionate parts of her I'm all for. The spiteful, insensitive, bossy parts not so much! But one big thing happens before the story even begins that I figure is big enough to change anyone a bit.

** My big piece of advice is that if you're posting only on ao3, which is the only website I've ever used for ff, then change the comment settings so that only registered users can comment. People are so much more respectful when you take away the ability to be anonymous.

I don't allow any comments whatsoever, which is sad because the only feedback I get now is from the number of likes and subscriptions, but I love writing fanfiction so much and am so sensitive that I'm willing to pass up some potentially beautiful comments in order to avoid the horrible ones. I used to adore receiving comments then got trolled for three straight days for making a canonically capitalist character into a socialist (it was a weird time, but I took half a year off and switched fandoms and now it's fun again).

In terms of your specific concerns, yes, it's really easy to turn readers off. There are so many fanfictions out there that people are accustomed to really niche content, a lot of which is pretty well written. The idea that you should post it just because one person might really connect to it is completely accurate; someone is going to love it and be so happy that they found it, and someone else is not going to like it. Something like the characterization or perspective or verb tense could make or break the story regardless of the writing quality because people are used to getting what they want. That's why I write it myself, because I want to create the exact content I want to see. I definitely believe that if someone dislikes your work, they should just move on, but this is the Internet and people are spoiled and do feel entitled to spend five minutes leaving a nasty review that could undermine the price of months of effort and passion for the writer.

Also, the advice to tag as much as possible if you're feeling insecure about something is good. People hate feeling like a fic's been misrepresented.

tl;dr definitely post it both for yourself and for others but if you think a mean review could ruin the experience for you, then change the comment settings to limit who can leave reviews

** I have never wrote fanfiction but I'm going to try to give you advice. I don't really care what I read but I do kind of get put of by some really sirius topics. But I think your fanfiction would be AMAZING! You wrote 49 chapters I have never read a fanfiction with that many chapters! If people don't like it, well that's their problem. You are proud of you work and that's all that matters. There will be some people who won't like your work but there will probably be more people who love it. Those people you should pay attention too. You put DAYS into your work and if they can't see that dedication then they should leave. I hope you submit it because it sounds great!

** Not everyone will like your story. Some will be nice about it and air their issues, perhaps even with constructive criticism. Some will just flame your story.

Meanwhile, your work will enlighten other people's day, and likely be enjoyed. They'll be happy to review it, or perhaps leave a favorite.

Most will just stay silent.

Personally, as long as you accept that not everyone will enjoy it, and some will inevitably flame you for it if it's popular enough, you should be fine. Don't take whatever flames you do happen to get to heart. Perhaps they had a bad day, or they just want to ruin someone else's day for the heck of it. Also, the more... creative ways people criticize the work can also just be downright amusing -- if they disliked it so much, why did they put the effort into complaining about it in first place?

** If people have the time to sit and write a review criticising someone else about a FICTIONAL CHARACTER WHO CAN BE INTERPRETED IN MULTIPLE WAYS that's their problem. All the characters in any series are open to interpretation from the reader and different people will see them in different ways. Besides, JKR didn't write anything in first person from Hermiones POV, so any conceptions about how she thinks are likely built up from other fanfics. So how can anyone say one way of writing her thoughts is right or wrong? It sounds like you've put a lot of effort and time into this story, so be proud of what you've written and don't let the Muggles get you down!! I hope you post it, I love Hermione stories and I'm sure it will be great!!

** I just read a story where the characters are all way out of character. At first I didn't know if I liked it but I always keep reading if I've started a story. If your story has a great plot and the change in character fits for that storyline I'm sure it will be a great story and noone will care about being out of character Please don't let thoughts like that discourage you, we need more long storys!

** People are hateful. Even as much as media would have us believe we are born "good". Really we're just innocent. Till we grow up. To be honest I'll never understand why people feel the need to be hateful (trolling) other people. I suppose it's why we still have bullies.

Others have given you some sound advice. What you need to remember is why you're writing. What interests you about this that you would spend so much of your time and support on it? It takes a certain amount of passion to write as much as you've written. That's precious. That's amazing. As an almost writer I tip my hat to you.

I'm this situation only you have the power. Perhaps try to think about ways you can cope with idiots. Special candle lit bath with music? Maybe a taking yourself to a yummy dinner. I'm fond of a nap to give my emotions time to calm down (sometimes a couple of days). What I'm saying is there are ways to help your emotional self deal with trolls. Use your knowledge as a shield. Of course your going to write hermione differently than JK. Your story is told from her perspective with no narrator. The choices you've made have been purposeful even when it was a stroke of inspiration.

** Honestly, a canon person being 'out of character' in a fanfic is one of the most ridiculous complaint. As a reader, I can appreciate both very realistic fanfiction talking about events not showed in the canon but stick to the canon representation as best as possible or showing an alternative stories where a change causes butterfly effect but the characters are still very similar AND completely AU/OOC stories. Often, the original plot actually starts because one of the characters is different than in canon.

There is lots of other things to take care of: make sure your grammar is correct, your style of writing reads well, the characters are well developed and stay in character considering your fanfic only (if Hermione does something completely different than in canon it's fine, if she does something completely different in your chapter 10 than she was doing in chapters 1-9 there might be something wrong) or if the characters change over the course of the story, their growth is natural. Make sure your plot is interesting and consistent. If you are using AO3, tag that your Hermione is OOC.

** As an avid fanfic reader, I will read any fanfic that is well-written and compelling, even if the characters are "out-of-character". Basically, many people would love to read your story. There will always be a few people that get hung up on how J.K. Rowling portrayed the characters vs. how you will, but they are just being nitpicky. It doesn't matter if the characters are OC. If the story is good, people will read it.
