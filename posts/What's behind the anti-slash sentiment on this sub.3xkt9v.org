It's very common to have people on here requesting non-slash ships. It's not like Reddit is this uber anti-gay haven with people thumping their Bibles and saying that "Christian values are what founded America", in fact it's quite liberal, so why is this sub so anti-slash?

I mean, I am opposed to slash ships with Harry in it, but only because I exclusively ship Harry/Ginny.


** Coming from a straight male, I'm all for equality and "love whoever you love", but when I'm reading a story, I prefer a pairing to have at least one character be the gender I am attracted to.

It doesn't help that slash fics tend to be pretty explicit and smutty; it's not that I'm against homosexuality, it just doesn't do anything for me in a fictional setting.

**** I don't mind either as long as it isn't with the character I identify with. Note that I consider (fem)slash to include romance, I don't mind a fling here or there as long as the character ends up with a nice guy eventually.

And when I'm reading smut I actually am a bit of a closet fan of mmf triads, including scenes of the two guys with each other.

I'm not so much against femslash as that it just plain bores me. And getting bored with a story tends to make me stop reading. I do think any half-decent story should include at least one slash side-pairing though, it's just weird how EVERYONE in the wizarding world is heterosexual in many stories. But some of the few slash stories I've read had the same issue, everyone was gay there.

** I'm not against the homosexual relationship in slash, quite the contrary, actually.

Its just that a lot of slash-fics tend to get so hung up on the fact that theres a gay relationship in it that the story is coming to a halt. Not that this isn't happening in fics with straight characters, its just less common. Worst case scenario are some Drarry fics in which they spend chapter after chapter basking in the glory of their new found gay relationship that transcend every house rivalry and bigotry, while theres still a war going on. Romance fics are of course excepted in this, since its their point to get hung up on relationships, obviously. A very cute slash there would be "Crazy Little Things", a Luna x Hermione.

Then theres the point of relatability. Its an easily observeable fact that there are more heterosexual people out there than homosexuals. Heterosexuals will more likely find heterosexual relationships more relatable and vise versa.

I think theres also the thing that while a lot of people are generally supportive of loving relationships of all sexualities, old prejudices are still hardcoded into the parts of our brain that get influenced by family and parents from early on. Those prejudices can be overcome, but they often remain uncomfortable to think about because you've been told your entire childhood that these things are bad. I'm myself someone who finds male homosexual sex scenes uncomfortable to read because of the images they create in my brain. Images that subconciously bring me back to when my parents hushed the words "Gays and lesbians" and my grandparents openly ranted about it. I avoid slash fics solely for the reason that I try to relax with them and hence, try not to feel uncomfortable while reading them.

** As a lesbian who's been reading fics for well over a decade, I myself tend to avoid slash. Not because I have any problem with non-het relationships of course. But because 90% of them (in my opinion) are either poorly written or fetishize the slash relationship. In a lot of slash fic, the author just want to write about something that is 'sexy' and forbidden and they focus on the gay factor at the expense of plot and character development. It's squicks me out in the same way that most lesbian porn squicks me out. It's not produced for lesbians... It's produced for men who think lesbians are sexy.

Is there good slash out there? Absolutely. But I hate slogging through all the terrible ones to find the few good ones, especially when my preferred pairings are hetero.

Exactly. And in my opinion many of them are poorly written /because/ they're fetishizing the slash relationship. It either gets strongly overlaid with heteronormativity (with one character who's a woman, or rather traditionally feminine, in all but name) or it's used to depict stuff with all sorts of unfortunate implications that would be rightly called out in a het or even femslash relationship.

Also I think I'll scream if I ever read another anal sex scene by someone who's clearly never done anything of the sort before. Some things are just plain anatomically impossible, yo.

** My guess would be that there's a higher percentage of straight men on this sub compared to some of the other places HP fanfic readers congregate. Also, people in general tend to have a certain amount of baggage around sexuality and/or explicit sexual description, with different comfort levels.

This sub is more resistant to sexual variety than other HP communities I've visited; it tends to hew to the straight and narrow, which I assume is why slash topics get downvoted rather than merely skipped over by redditors who aren't interested. Consistently downvoting an interest translates as rejection. There's also a certain amount of scoffing and kneejerk assumptions made about the poor quality of slash as a genre, where I've had the impression that it's the ship and the general homoerotic atmosphere, not the writing quality, that makes posters dismiss them. Which is ironic, because most of the named fics that get pointed to as awful, boring, ridiculous, etc. here are het fics.

There's also a Harry-centric, anti-Slytherin tilt to the preferences, and different ideas about what constitutes OOC. I suspect a lot of redditors don't want to read shipfic with Draco or Snape, so they downvote it to make it go away. SS/HP and HP/DM are two of the most popular slash ships, though. Meanwhile, I have zero interest in superpowered, world-conquering Harry with his "harem" of women (scare quotes because the term "harem" has negative connotations to me), and I haven't found Harry (or anyone else) recognizable in the fics I've tried. That's okay, though. Those aren't written for me. Play and exaggeration and favorite tropes and self-indulgence are what fanfic is for, IMO. But posters here use the downvote button against Snape and Draco slash fairly often instead of just ignoring it.

There may also be some pushback because the users don't want slash fic and slash talk to take over this sub. It /is/ extremely popular in HP fandom, and the more it's discussed, the more slashers will find their way here and bring their desires to the table. Which could make for a lively subreddit, but for some members it would be at cross-purposes with what they want to talk about and whether they'd feel welcome here. You don't see many straight men hanging out in slash communities, after all.

** First off often Slash comes across more as shipping (ie. the pushing/promoting of a couple) than as romance. I am not big on romance but if done well it is great. The whole point of those stories is getting them together in the end (with non angsty conflict getting there). I prefer my romance in the background to a more compelling narrative/larger events. In my limited experience Slash itself, in the majority of cases, becomes the focus. Sometimes this 'ruins' the story.

Let's say it starts with an alternative start to CoS- a rousing adventure surviving the cars crash in the forbidden forest. Harry survives but is put in St. Mungos or the Hospital Wing. So far it has been something ala Indiana Jones. All of a sudden SLASH- Harry discovers Draco has a magical sickness and requires treatment or whatever. The story grounds to a halt and everything revolves around this new relationship (filled with angst). Even when a story is properly introduced and set up as a Romance it then fails to deliver. They get together and then it is endless drama about being together. ie. the payload/climax of them getting together is short shifted and then the rest of the book is dragged on- and the plot whether mystery or adventure or whatever is entirely or nearly forgotten. This of course can happen in non-slash pairings, but in my (again limited) experience Slash seems to fall to the worst of making it the entire focus.

This focus is also highlighted when canon is disturbed (and often absurd). Even a neutral and popular example- you've got Sirirus 'hangs muggle chicks and motorcycles on his wall' Black and Remus 'married a woman' Lupin together. This is automatically disavowing canon. Now this could be very interesting. However when I said canon is disturbed it isn't just about they like girls. Sirius is a guy, a man, and he is so much a guy that as a pureblood wizard he still becomes a motorhead and gets a motorcycle. So when this bastion of irresponsible uncle crazed manliness is turned into a delicate soft overly emotional and motherly figure then it is 'disturbing'$ not just one layer of character but often the foundational ones (to me) ($Note NOT 'eww this is icky , gross gay. But it is breaking deeply set preset conceptions). This isn't Slash only as Harry Hermione seems to often be shifted too because one is forced into character change (more studious, less bossy etc.) and in my experience it is always to their detriment. This though, IMO, is exacerbated when it is Harry and Draco because their dislike is near automatic and runs deep. So this change I imagine is often done very cheaply.

The absurd then is Harry and Snape or Voldemort- in 30's and 60's respectively with a CHILD. So this is not going to be popular (generally on this subreddit) even if it was with Hermione, but it stretches beyond belief when it is Harry. The object of unreserved and undeserved hate from Snape, and Numero Uno on the Kill list for Voldemort. ANYTHING can work/be written well, but I simply haven't seen it done. Which brings me to the next point-

Slash, it seems, is often done by girls and poorly. I think I read this from a Taure comment, which he may have disavowed since then, but Slash seems to be written by women and for women. Like its cute to pair two hot guys together. The characters get written/treated like how the author dreams- like they are the ones being wooed on either side (or the related feels angst fest). So if I've explained properly it isn't HarryxDraco it is TheWriterasHarryxDraco etc. So yet again the character is changed (losing their male qualities/characteristics/feel), ruined for many, and the story may not have anything else on offer. Are there feminine, flamboyant, every other stripe of gay (or otherwise) men? Sure. But Harry - HARRY - who seems oblivious to the other sex, who shows only the minimum of self consciousness for his state of dress I just can't believe when I read-

'Draco's silver orbs glistened with the fear of unrequited longing. Harry couldn't take it. Draco's slender chin trembled as Harry gently caressed Draco's smooth cheek, With his other hand Harry took his petite waist and kissed him full on his ruby red lips.' blah blah blah.

So here we a few problems- one Draco is turned feminine as are Harry's perceptions or at the very least are untypical. (Sometimes this might happen from multiple POVs) ie. Slender, petite, tremble etc. things which barring political correctness are feminine. So Slash, two guys, somehow feels distinctly unmanly. Draco being vulnerable also seems to be overplayed. (the only time I remember vulnerability was after a YEAR of worrying over his dad, mom, self and saving them by killing someone in cold blood.) Draco would probably handle Pansy or Harry or any new frightening prospect of attraction or relationship with more pompous arrogance or other compensating measures- not falling apart. Again character are no longer recognizable or relatable.

Now I won't pretend to now how in general a gay man feels and thinks (and of course that will vary wildly). BUT when we are talking about Harry, unless his character has been changed forcibly from canon- which is a real issue with Slash for me- is male. He is painfully male. If he is gay it can be done but it is never done believably in my very limited experience. Something like how I imagine a gay Harry might work. ex.

'Harry entered the changing room and saw the team had hit the showers already. He stripped of his sweaty uniform and entered the showers. Angelina and Kate had taken the closest set, Fred and George were each marching in place under the water with their heads turned up garbling an old marching song, Wood was lathering up with a fierce look of concentration. He wasn't as tall or burly as other keepers but his wired frame proved hard to beat. Harry was always amused to see how the captain took his duties so seriously. Harry turned the shower head on hot, as usual, and let its warmth pour over him. Oliver turned and nodded seeing him there, Harry nodded in return and noticed a large bruise across Woods slab of a thigh.\\
'Twins,' he said smiling.\\
Harry snorted.\\
Again!? He busied his mind and fixed the shower on cold until he was shivering. At least in the air he could hide it well enough.' (failing to resist making a 'wood' happens at the strangest times remark)

So Harry doesn't linger on the ladies and while he may not realize it he is spending more time on the lads. He is still thick headed in some ways. He doesn't even realize it yet, and when he does he isn't going to suddenly become a gushy mushy mess. So the story is either a romance where the whole story is the conflict of ending up with Harry and X, ie. 75% of the story is trying to get to the goal of hooking up. You read Jane Austen because in the end she delivers- she doesn't hand it to you 20 pages in and then deal with the angst and minutia of married life. OR Harry being gay is just a sub facet of what is going on in an actually interesting story. Him being gay isn't the focus and never becomes the focus.

Which should also be mentioned- when a story is Slash the whole world becomes Slash it seems. Never for any real reason. This doesn't interest me. Perhaps for the same reason as Harem doesn't interest me- you are just shoving people together for the sex or to couple and it doesn't feel real.

*TL:DR* - What does Slash offer the majority male (majority hetero) hpfanfiction reddit? Unrelatable and altered characters, often several layers deep, put together just so we can experience them kissing or boinking, often with little narrative or a derailed narrative besides. This on top of the fact that the vast majority of fanfiction is bad. So this isn't about gay hate or liberal or conservative or anything but the fact that there isn't a reason why in the vast majority of cases Slash would interest us.

** It's easier to be immersed into a story if there is a character you identify and as the majority of people in the world are heterosexual, people tend to prefer stories in which the main characters are straight.

Also, slash fics tend to concentrate on romance a lot and bend characters out of character to fit one another in an unrealistic way and a lot of people don't want to read convoluted romance. From what I've seen recommended a lot of the pairings in slash are between characters who hate each other in canon, harry/draco, harry/snape, harry/voldemort.

** it's true of a lot of straight stuff also, anything focusing on romance is nearly always bad for the same reason no matter the sexuality. although i did actually think harry was gay right up till jk said otherwise. harry basically gets with ginny after she fucks all his friends, and because he wants to replicate the only family he has every even seen. imo there are two version of characters: there is the one that is actually in the story doing stuff, you usually see this in ff with one character trait stretch over the rest; then there is the one where you take what jk told you about characters that isn't backed up much in what they say do (but she explained it explicitly) and this perfect (and perfectly imperfect) character is usually what you get in shipping ff. and, as the epilogue tells us, all wizard couples are 100% perfect and last for ever, ships just explain the mechanics behind how it happened, gay or otherwise. snape too, thought he was gay right up until jk tells you he loved lily, but she picked the flamboyant dressing wiz who speak differently to be the gay. it's almost as bad as how she always tells you how black a black character is -then a blacky walks in with black skin as black as something black.

tl;dr straight ships are the same and so is jk!

** My hate-on for slash fics is entirely because of Malfoy/Snape. I hate both those characters, and [anecdotally] most slash fics have one or the other as protagonists/significant characters. Slogging through a ton of shit to find something that I'm not particularly interested in finding isn't worth it to me, so I merely avoid the entire 'genre'.

** I'll admit that I kneejerk rather badly when it comes to stereotyping the general quality of slash. My reason, justified or not, is that it's really not to my taste at all, and the idea of MPreg squicks me out. If you really want a baby that badly, just adopt FFS, don't use magic as an excuse to force the male body to do something it's not even vaguely designed to do...

** Slash is often the tip of the iceberg of AU changes. Unless the story is about Dumbledore's romances, it isn't strictly canon.

Often, the twists and turns involved in making a pair out of little to nothing in a fanfic drawn from HP canon makes the entire fanfic about that change.

And finally, there is a lot of terrible slashfic out there. Just tons. Asking for anything else is a relatively good filter for quality.

I am so tired of this claim. For "slashfic," please just substitute "fanfic." Believe me, hetfic is just as overwhelmingly awful, which is one reason why people make reccing communities. Good fics need people to spread the word. Shipfic readers of all stripes are willing to forgive a lot more if the fic caters to their interests, but that doesn't make bad hetfic better than bad slashfic.

**** But if you compare the number of slashfic and hetfic, and the number of well written ones. There is an overwhelming abundance of slash fic, often too short for many readers to even try to read, that are written by teenage girls with very poor writing skills.

On fic searches I often find myself going through whole pages of results at a time looking for non-slash pairings, and when I find a slash fic with a decent premise, I give it a shot and am sorely disappointed. Makes it very easy for hetero people to quickly tire of even trying to read a good slash fic, it just isn't worth it when they arent even interested in a slash pairing in the first place.

I have no problem with homosexual characters in their own fandoms or in real life. I have problems with badly written characters that were hetero in cannon being suddenly gay (not even bi...just gay) with no real explanation.

***** The same is true of hetfic, though. I noped out of reading hetfic on ff.net once I discovered how exhausting the winnowing process was and how over-represented HP-in-American-high-schools seemed to be. Also, the writers tended (probably still tend) to focus on adolescent preoccupations and posturing, which are beyond boring if you're not stuck at that emotional age.

Since then, I've relied on friends who read and write hetfic to steer me toward stories I might enjoy.

I'm not actually advocating that straight male readers have to seek out or enjoy slash, btw. I can understand why they wouldn't, although I've spent my fandom life with people who are /far/ more flexible in their reading habits and will generally try anything if they trust the author/reccer. That being my experience (a delightful one, I must say), the resistance here sticks out as a curious limitation - certainly insofar as this subreddit has something to offer me personally. But them's the breaks. The form that resistance takes can sometimes be expressed, shall we say, less than tactfully, but for the most part redditors here are pretty gracious and not intentionally offensive.

Reading through the thread, I think there's also a divide between people who think shipfic is a non-legit narrative because it focuses on romance and is therefore automatically bad, and those who treat it as a genre unto itself, blessed by a small number of good writers, those few shining beacons of talent in a wasteland of bad fic. In other words, the usual state of fanfic, whatever the category, genre, rating, or source.

My opinion: romance is a perfectly good fictional genre (I don't read mainstream romance novels, but I have no problem with them existing). Smut is a perfectly good reason to write a story. In shipfic, the process of getting the protagonists together /is/ the plot. If that bores your pants off, it's okay to move on.

(Side note: I don't enjoy sappiness, I can't stand masculine/feminine gender stereotypes being projected onto same-sex pairings (or opposite-sex pairings, for that matter), and I prefer antagonistic and/or cross-gen ships and unconventionally attractive characters. I want the issues and troubled histories and legacies to be explored and leave a mark. That said, I've seen anti-slashers complain that slash fics are /only/ about the characters falling into each other's arms and boning, but when a non-canon gay couple is included as part of an ensemble fic with only minimum page time spent on how they became a couple, then the complaint turns into, "You don't even try to explain how this could happen. You can't just expect us to accept that they're gay without doing something to justify it." My arse I can't. Fanfic makes far more substantial changes than sexual orientation in pursuit of entertainment or "what if." And I don't think having an apparently straight canon character be gay violates or changes their personality in the slightest. In any case, it's fairly miraculous to find /any/ writer capable of keeping their favorites in character. Not to mention that perceptions of "in character" vary wildly across fandom.)

At this point, I should probably admit that I've read very few fics by male writers. Only two men (that I'm aware of) have made it onto my favorites list, and not for the sort of thing that's generally recced here.

(Also, sorry about my longwindedness. I'm really, really bad at keeping things short.)

I never said it was /worse/. Just that there is more slashfic being written now than either canon relationship or hetfic (and almost no pure F/F stuff).

Bad slashfic is usually short, ugly, and jams up the ff.net search results like a hairball in a drainpipe. It is clear and obvious that it is a problem to anyone who has tried to search for new stuff in the last five years. Pretending it isn't a problem is silly. Pretending there is numerically as much short, ugly canon relationship or hetfic is also silly.

** The problem is that there's almost no such thing as subtle slash. Like, I've read hundreds of straight harry fics, where there's either no romance, or it's minor. But, when it's slash, it's up in your face. When there's slash, it's almost impossible for the author to go through the plot without harry blowing five dudes in the process, or bottoming for snape.
