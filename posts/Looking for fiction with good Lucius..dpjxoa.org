:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I'm going to try and be fairly detailed, but it's been years and I can't for the life of me remember the name of this story. I remember the basic premise was good Lucius and Malfoys in general. Harry's scar is actually a rune that signifies like an important destiny and Lucius takes notice. The Finch-Fletchleys also play an important role, and are friends with the malfoys, because while they might be muggles they recognize nobility, and Justin's family are bougie af. They also get into like little competitions to show off. Sally Ann Perkins as well I think is a fairly important character. Now this is where I can't remember if this is part of this fic or if I'm confusing it. Harry and draco and friends start a group called amicii something, which means friends of light. Vincent and crabbe are in it, but either one dies or both die because their father lets them get used for a ritual for Voldemort. That's about all I remember, just can't for the life of me recall the title.


** I think you might have more than one fic in mind. Apologies in advance as I don't know how to link via the bot, but here: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3655940/1/Harry-Potter-Dark-Memories]] - Harry Potter: Dark Memories by Blueowl. This has the Amici de Lux but not good Malfoys or the rune scar, afaik.

Summary: What if Voldemort didn't just unknowingly give Harry some of his powers that night? What if he gave him all of his memories, memories that are now just waiting to come forth?

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge]] - The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville. This has good Malfoys and the rune scar aspect, as well as them interacting with Justin's family. Sally Anne Perks is a prominent-ish character.

Summary: AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva.
