What are your favorite Harry/Daphne stories? It's fun to read a pairing with one character defined almost exclusively by the fandom itself.


** TE7's "The Pureblood Princess" is pretty good. I also like Clell's "The Marriage Contracts", which there is two versions of.

  A rewrite of 'Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts' done to improve some of the story elements, cut down on the Weasley bashing, and generally make a bit more sense. The changes are minor, but I believe make for a better story.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** linkffn(Contractual Invalidation) is the best I know. R-dude is a DLP writer for a reason and he showed it in this fic. It's an unique and refreshing take on the 'marriage contract' trope.

There are others but none come close to it really. There are the stories written by Spooky, or whatever he's called, and a few stories that start from the Triwizard tournament but none are truly memorable.

**** Have you read it or are you just basing it off of the description? Because the description sucks.

I like the slow, character driven nature of the story myself, but I understand that a lot of people don't.

But I do sort of agree about the pairing. It's not a great pairing overall, and most writers neuter anything interesting they could do with it by pointing out so much how she isn't like all those other Slytherins.

****** You might like it better once they leave Hogwarts, but I get it. Its possible that I would have gotten just as far as you or less if I hadn't found it during my Harry/Daphne phrase. All the magical theory stuff at the beginning is a bit excessive.

I feel like the writer was trying to avoid a lot of the problems of other fics with some of the choices he made. For example, the memories don't all come at once, and while some Horcruxes are found easily because of them, not all are.

I enjoyed the way the writer used the marriage contract. I found it much more interesting than the way they are used normally.

******* Yeah, it can be excessively verbose at times, and the lack of plot advancement in the last several chapters made my interest taper off a bit. That being said, the marriage contract is used in an interesting way and attempts to stay in character for Harry (in a self-sacrificing sense). The way in which they fight the death eaters is interesting and somewhat novel, and the character and relationship development for Daphne is fairly well handled on the whole.

Certainly not perfect, but well ahead of most fics as a general description.
