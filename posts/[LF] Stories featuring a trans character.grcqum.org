I recently stumbled on this story, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21993277/chapters/52482529]]) and really enjoyed how it has been handling the trans themes so far..

Does anyone have anything similar?


** I have a fic developing in my head featuring a non-binary metamorphmagus who spends some time as female, some as male, but whether I'll ever get the story actually out in writing is anyone's guess.

** I love In Defiance so much!

There's my fic, which I've had lots of positive feedback for (and I'll update again soon I promise).

  Voldemort was too obsessive and too picky not to have had all seven horcruxes (including a Gryffindor relic) completed when he moved against the Potters in October 1981. So he didn't stay dead at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts, and things got very, very bad. Ancient magic returns a 20-year-old Hermione back to her 15-year-old body, and she must set up complicated plans in secret to ensure the end of the world doesn't come to pass. Her first goal is to stop Voldemort before his body is restored, but she cannot do it alone. She must enlist the help of at least one of the champions of the Triwizard Tournament if she has any shot at stopping Voldemort and protecting Harry in the process. And she is as surprised as anyone when she finds love along the way.If you enjoy Fleurmione stories, sibling dynamics between Hermione and Harry, or time-travel fix-its generally, this is the story for you!I make no promises about any kind of an update schedule. If you're a fan of any of my other works, you'll know I can be all over the place. Sorry! But I'm a busy lawyer. I do have the gist of the story plotted out, and as with all my stories, I promise not to abandon it.

  Though nobody would be able to tell --- it was winter, and she had official Ministry robes on over her other clothes --- she was, for the first time, wearing a skirt to work.And today, she was going to ask her coworkers to call her Audrey.-In which efficient bureaucracy gives Audrey a much needed confidence boost about coming out.

** There were a lot of great recommendations in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ecxv6n/request_fics_featuring_trans_characters/][this thread.]] I can't vouch for all of them, but from what I remember I enjoyed all the ones I read. Some that stand out in my memory are Magical Metamorphosis which has already been rec'd, The Girl Who Lived (again), and, even though it's incomplete, To Reach Without was immensely enjoyable.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.
