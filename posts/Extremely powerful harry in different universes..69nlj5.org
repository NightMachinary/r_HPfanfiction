Pretty much harry in a crossover, but the crossover isn't based in the wizarding world. I would also prefer it if harry could do magic without a wand, wandless magic. Heres an example [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12132088/7/Beyond-The-Veil]]

So to sum it up extremely powerful wandless magic casting harry not based in the wizarding world.

Also if voldermort could be done away with already or quickly that would be a plus as well.


** linkffn(Harry Potter: Geth by mjimeyg)

He still has his wands but it isn't a huge point. The story is incredible.

***** Harry is accidentally taken out of time at the end of the final battle only to be put back some odd hundred years later on the quarian home world while it's overrun by non-heratic Geth. They ask him to be their Emmisary to the other organic races because they want to integrate into galactic civilization.

It loosely follows the entire mass effect plot line while following Harry as he goes around and does stuff.

I was worried because of the description the author gave about harry just deciding to have fun but it's a fantastic story and way more than a random crack fic. It has a satisfying ending to top everything else off as well.

******* I remember looking up a few things about mass effect mostly because I wanted to see how certain things looked, it explains what's going on pretty well as the story goes.

I actually surprised one of my friends with a summary of what must have happened in mass effect a few weeks ago based just on what I had learned from the fanfic, because he knew I hadn't played any of the games.

*** Well, this made me read it (I'm currently doing it, at any rate), and I have to ask this:

Just ... why, with a sword, at the bloody monster thing? Why would you think that is a good idea in any way?

Umm ... yeah, it's entertaining. But Harry needs help, of a medical kind.

** linkffn(Potter's Protector)

This is painful on mobile lol. Harry Potter becomes very powerful, well more like he learns to use the power that is there. If told he Can do something he basically can do it if he believes it. Might need to know just a bit about the Buffy Universe considering Xander and Joyce are two major characters but they do explain quite a bit.

I mention this one because the follow up stories take place in various other universes include superhero (mostly xmen) smallville and eventually Buffy.

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.
