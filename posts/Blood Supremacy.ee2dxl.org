Pure-blood implies the same thing as mud-blood but is the opposite. For some people to have pure blood jt means others blood must be impure. Pure represents perfect, untainted blood and that those that aren't pure-bloods are less perfect and bellow those described as pure-bloods. It should be changed to full-bloods, half-bloods and muggleborn. A full-blood has four magical grandparents, a half-blood has one to three magical grandparents and a muggleborn has none.

This is the exact reason why it shouldn't be changed. Full-blood doesn't make sense in a world where the big bad is still a blood supremacist.

** If you're trying to create an AU with better terms to avoid the supremacy stuff starting with blood status is failing out the gate.

Maybe try something like Magic Raised vs Mundane Rasied or similar. Anyone trying to define themselves by terms created by supremacist will fail from the start.

** I think I prefer "old blood", "new blood", and something like "part blood" if it's /really/ necessary, even though it somewhat reminds me of the "part-jew" in nazi germany, something I think JKR wanted to imply. Gets rid of the strange "purity" talk, as well as the borderline slur that the word "muggle" is.

"old blood" is relatively neutral and doesn't have any strong positive or negative connotations to it (the word can mean stale, decaying, rotting, but also experienced, sophisticated and established), same as "new blood", which is at once good a word for good (new, fresh, never-before seen, innovative) and bad (inexperienced, unfamiliar, naive, etc)

*** Fantastic Beasts uses no-maj, which imo is less negative than muggle, so I could see that being adopted by British wizarding community by the time Harry's kids go off to Hogwarts (Hermione pushes for it maybe). It could also replace "blood" in descriptions. Someone's a new-maj, old-maj, etc.

**** It's a good word on paper, but doesn't really flow all too well into spoken language, especially "no-maj", which is... really bad linguism. Like, there is nowhere that "magic" would in any way turn into "maj" in spoken language drift, it's a more complex word than before, mostly because of the "j", which becomes a sound that's very rare in american english at the end of words. Sure, "Magic" has it, but there's something hard in "Magic" that's not present in "Maj" - something which would definitely carry over and color the written term.

If the J has to be in there, then the slang term doesn't have a dash in the middle, and the first word isn't unshortened:

Muggle -> Nomaj

Oldblood -> Olmaj

Newblood -> Numaj

***** No-maj was spelled with a dash in fantastic beasts, so I just generalised that formatting. I agree it sounds a little unnatural in spoken English and the slang spelling would be different. I was pointing out there's already another canon word to describe nonmagical people, which imo could end up being the "official" or ministry way to describe them. In the real world, people use both LatinX and Hispanic to describe people from that region, but Hispanic is the term used for official records. Does that make sense?

** What's your goal here? Rowling chose these terms because they sound bigoted. They're good stand-ins for the various bigoted terms people use to insult each other in the real world.

*** I think it would be interesting to see how those terms evolve in a more muggle & muggleborn friendly environment, like in the next gen era. Would they receive backlash, much like how modern "politically correct" terms do? What would replace them? etc.

** A Pureblood would be someone that does not have any muggle or muggle-born blood in their family tree. One site I read says "Most wizards and witches consider an individual to be a pure-blood if his or her parents and grandparents were not Muggles or Muggle-born".

So one could be a full blood without being a pureblood. If all four grandparents are magical, the person would be a fullblood, but if one of those grandparents is a muggleborn, then the person, while technically a fullblood, would not be a pureblood.

** I think that's the point of pureblood though. The types of people who use the terms frequently are blood supremacist and think they are better for having more magical blood. The logic, much like real world racism, breaks down once you think about it. Are you a mudblood if both or your parents are muggleborn? what if all of your grandparents are?

if in a fic you wanted to give your characters a better way of talking about magical ancestry when they aren't a particularly prejudice character i think the muggleborn/mudblood distinction is good or for purebloods saying they came from an old wizarding family world work.

** I have a rather rigid headcanon on what the various terms mean exactly and when they apply. However, I also consider it completely groundless in how things actually work "scientifically" and basically only used by blood purists.

But if you want to actually use the terms to clarify which background the person have, you're basically stuck. I think the best alternative in that case that doesn't require inventing new terms is "Muggle-raised". It's also more practical since Harry, while technically a halfblood, is for all intents and purposes a muggleborn.

*** good luck with that, because that's not how it works irl. Or we wouldn't STILL have a problem with racism across the entire planet.

Sure, I'd love for the world to work like that, and with continued efforts it may eventually look like that, but this kind of comment doesn't work and is counter productive. I don't know what you think, but people aren't all idiots except you - we know that it would be better, it just doesn't work.
