But instead it was Dudley. He teleported Harry onto the school roof when his gang wouldn't leave Harry alone. He turned a teacher's hair blue when she was being mean to Harry for low grades. It was him that made Harry's hair regrow over night. It was him, in a rush of excitement, that caused the boa's glass to vanish.

No one knew until the day of his eleventh birthday when a letter appeared address to :

Mr. Dudley Dursley

3rd Largest Bedroom

4 Privat Drive, Little Whining.


** Haha, this could be really cool. You'd have to make Dudley less of a bully or something for it to be believable, but otherwise it would be super cool to see Harry and Dudley go to Hogwarts together.

*** I think it's Dudley instead of Harry. Harry's perfectly normal, thank you very much. Dudley's accidental magic was always blamed on Harry, who's actually a squib.

**** Hmm, that could happen, but then wouldn't Dumbledore or the Potters have noticed his lack of magic? And how would The Prophesy and Harry surviving killing curse work?

***** Harry was one year old the last time his parents or Dumbledore paid any attention to him. It's common for accidental magic not to show up that early.

Surviving the killing curse had nothing to do with Harry's magic, that was all thanks to Lily's magic.

The prophecy doesn't require Harry to be a wizard.

****** Very true. That might even make the story better. A magic-less Harry having to beat Voldemort in some way. You could make Neville the chosen one (or just that everyone thinks he is) too.
