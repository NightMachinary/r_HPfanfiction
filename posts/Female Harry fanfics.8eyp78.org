Recently introduced to this type of fanfic, I would appreciate it if you could list your favourites

Thanks!


** I'm currently writing one and have 19 chapters posted so far. No pairings as of yet as it's mainly a gen fic and only in fourth year. Constructive criticism is welcome if it fits your criteria. Linkffn(11483591)

#+begin_quote
  When a magical backlash causes a rift in space and time, an unsuspecting girl is pulled back and forth, leaving her with knowledge of the future and a destiny that is too big to ignore. Unwilling to sit back and watch, she will do anything in her power to stop the Dark Lord's rise. But fate itself will fight her every step of the way. Fem!Harry. Summer before 3rd year and beyond.

** My favorite female!Harry fic definitely has to be linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and its sequels. Fem!Harry's portrayal is really good in my opinion and the supporting characters are also quite fleshed out with even OCs being really likable (and I usually hate ocs). The plot starts out pretty slow but it eventually picks up.

Also anything with fem!Harry by Tsume Yuki is a pretty good bet (anything by her in general if I'm being honest).

** I love female Harry fics so this list is gonna be super long (sorry, not sorry):

linkffn(11517506) The Light vs Dark with female Harry being an underdog third group. Neville is arrogant boy who lived. James Potter was a traitor so female Harry is an outcast. Great world building. Really good, recently updated too.

linkffn(12760426) I really like this author and this is the story that is most likely to be updated although the author seems to be burned out on Harry Potter so might be abandoned like the Long Game and To Reach Without (these two are good too).

linkffn(11309061) Percy Jackson crossover. This author has 3 different female Harrys with one of the Main Three as her father. This Hades one is my favorite of these since I didn't really like the direction the other two have taken in the second story.

linkffn(12457005) Antisocial female Harry with snakes for friends and Quirrelmort as a protecter/father figure.

linkffn(12828900) Almost everyone has switched genders. Female dominated witching world where the few wizards have coven/harems or are ostracized. Femslash. Hasn't gotten to Hogwarts yet though.

linkffn(11488630) female Harry with Greek mythos, Earth magic and pirates. It's pretty good.

linkffn(12507814) Trans Harry where she transitions into a girl.

linkffn(11437578) Fantastic so far 3 part series with some good world building and pagan religious magic and holiday ritual celebrations. Highly recommend.

linkffn(11827316) Pretty good female Harry who gathers follower/minion/friends. Femslash.

linkffn(11637611) This author specializes in cracky fluffy femslash with crazy female Harrys. This one and its sequel are probably my favorites from them.

linkffn(11024296) Another Percy Jackson crossover although knowledge of Percy Jackson not really required since the story has only taken place in Hogwarts so far. It's pretty unique considering there are a lot of variations of Harry Potter with a godly parent or two.

linkffn(10942056) Time travelling female Harry is Tom Riddle's caretaker and Gellert Grindelwald has taken an interest in her. Tom gets jealous and is an adorable pre-teen. Might get weird later though since Tom and Harry appears to be the pairing.

linkffn(11197701) The start of a 3 fic realistic soul bond. Femslash. Veelas and pagan love rituals are prevalent. Same author also has a pretty good series where female Harry is Black Widow linkffn(11221015). Also femslash.

linkffn(9081608) Master of Death Harry where Harry is reborn constantly, this time in a girl's body. Very nihilistic or cynical female Harry paired with Tom Riddle.

linkffn(12383390) Good female Harry with Eragon fic. It was abandoned briefly and there exists another story with the same first couple chapters that eventually diverge since it was adopted but this was the original and re-continued.

linkffn(11602420) Female Harry is like Moriarty, Hermione is Sherlock and Neville is Watson. Femslash. Pretty good from what I remember.

linkffn(11294952) Female Harry with Wesley from Daredevil season 1. Mostly fluff but some plot.

linkffn(12026760) Hermione's mother is Muslim and the Grangers adopt female Harry after she was abused by a foster family. Female Harry ends up in Gryffindor with Hermione in Slytherin. It's pretty good.

linkffn(10412141) Really good Slytherin female Harry that builds a network of informants and allies around her. House politics. Good basilisk encounter.

linkffn(10808765) Avengers crossover that so far has focused more on female Harry traveling the world and getting Defense and Transfiguration masterys with the occasional encounter to justify the Avengers crossover. Good but not nearly updated enough.

I should probably stop lol, I could keep going but I probably went overboard as it is.

**** Yeah I do but I tend to actively search for female Harry more often. If you search fanfiction.net for crazyclone as a writer, you can see the stories I have read since I tend to favorite stories I have read and enjoyed so I can keep track. If you press ctrl+f and type in "fem" you can find some that have fem!harry or female Harry in the descriptions, unfortunately (or fortunately lol) it also catches the stories with femslash or female characters from other fandoms as well that I have liked. Another good way to find female Harry stories is to go to the community tab on fanfiction.net and click general. About 20 down the list is a community for fem!characters and here you can find over 8000 stories that feature a normally male character that was born, turned into, or crossdresses as a girl. That is typically where I find all of the female Harry stories.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life.

** Here are a number of the ones I had bookmarked on FFnet/AO3. I remember them all to be fairly well-written. Some are complete, some are WIPs, some are abandoned (sorry).

linkao3(2757626) - Harry had a good relationship with the Dursleys & never went to Hogwarts. Story picks up when she's 17 or 18 and is kidnapped by the risen Dark Lord. (probably abandoned)

linkao3(3694820) - short little overview-type fic of Slytherin Harry

linkffn(9486886) - I LOVE this fic & recommend it whenever I can. Female Harry has an alter ego who develops+runs the criminal underground of Wizarding Britain.

linkffn(10412157) - quick little two-shot of post-war Harry needing to get married/getting married. Bad description but worth the read.

linkffn(3509002) - This is the first fem!Harry fic I ever read, so it has a special place in my heart. A 7-year re-write (in progress).

linkffn(8615605) - Very long; attempt at 7-year rewrite. Complete but with an incomplete sequel. Not bad, as far as I remember, if you can't forgive the pairing..

linkao3(3348758) - Harry has to deal with the unfortunate fact that her soulmate is Tom Riddle. (abandoned)

  'Avada Kedavra'.A six year old Hariel Potter traces the strange marks on her skin, wondering at the meaning of the words her soulmate will speak.An eleven year old Hariel Potter is appropriately horrified when she puts the pieces together. For the first eleven years of his life, Tom Marvolo Riddle, couldn't make heads or tails of his markings. He's even more confused when the Chamber of Secrets Incident of '43 fails to bring 'Tom? Tom, we have to go, there's a Basilisk,' to him.It's not until a little black book makes its way back to Hogwarts that everything falls into place.
