A lot of stories advertise bashing on their story summary, as if it's an attraction. But on this subreddit, all I've seen is people bashing Bashing. Personally I find bashing a turn off for a story. Does anybody find it an attraction?


** Eh, sometimes I get fed up reading about how some character is ~so~ perfect and bashing helps. It's not something I'd read if I wasn't done with the fanon charaterization of someone, but even then it's only occasionally.

** I've only found bashing appropriate in a crack fic. Any serious writing, I've never been able to see it worked well.

I must caveat though, I've seen characters written in a way that they become bad people, they are criticized, go through hard times, “bashed” for lack of a better word. But it's actually developed in the story, there are events that organically lead to that development. To me, “bashing” is inherently bad writing because I think of bashing as ridiculing and ruining a character without proper development. If it's done with good writing, it's no longer bashing, it's just diverting from canon.

** Most of the time it just reads as edgy teens going through their 'UGH U DONT UNDERSTAND ME MOM' phase - so they project all their angsty nonsense onto fictional characters, so that they can live vicariously through the MC.

I mean, people can read what they want to read. It's hardly my place to tell people what they can or can't read or write. I'm just saying, the minute I hear that Dumbledore is secretly siphoning funds from Harry's bank account, or that Ginny is spiking Harry's Fruit Loops with wizard roofies. Or god forbid, James and Lily live and end up being abusive for no reason (??????), I close the tap so fast my index finger starts smoking. Just because Kevin stuck gum in your hair during third period, doesn't give you free reign to irrationally mudsling innocent wizards, Bethany. Go listen to some Papa Roach and chill out.

And don't even get me started on shit like calling Dumbledore, 'Dumblefuck' or something. My god. I'm not saying people who unironically say 'Moldyshorts' should be send to Guantanamo Bay - I'm just saying I wouldn't oppose the decision.

**** I was Brain storming a Idea on how to change the WBWL trope and what if James and Lily stayed alive they believe Charles Potter is the BWL but Harry is still their favorite subconsciously, like Harry is the one that enjoys slightly pranks, runes, Transfiguration and Charm, Playing Music, he and James share a favorite Quidditch team and playing Seekers duels against each other, Lily and Harry both play instruments and reading Muggle fiction, but Friction comes from the fact that Charles allows the adoring fans go to his head or the fact that every time they get mail he gets amazing and rare gifts from his fans and admirers and Harry gets nothing.

James and Lily have to work and that means that which ever is home at the time have to pay attention to security risk to protect Charlie and by extention Harry. Charlie gets tickets to the Appleby Arrows Game his favorite team, the family goes and Charlie is happy, later that month James comes home with tickets for the Puddlemere United game his and Harry's favorite team, but oh no Charlie's security protocol is upgraded due to a threat, looks like They can't go to the game, but hey they can listen to it on the wireless together right? Charles chooses that time to go practice flying and James needs to be there to guard him. Harry and Charlie get to study certain subjects early Lily teaches what she can and what she deems exceptable, Charles is dead set on learning jinxes and other fighting spells, while Harry is more well rounded which means Lily is forced to leave Harry alone to study in order to keep Charlie from cutting his leg off and it getting out that they abuse the Boy Who Lived.

You get small glimpse into what life would of been if Voldemort hadn't attacked Canon Harry that night when he gets that time alone with his parents but its also juxtaposed against the over selfish and self absorbed Charles who by having a twin who isn't as lauded feels he is extra special, there is one person in the world who is JUST like him and Charlie 'knows' he is better that him.

*** When I'm writing out notes, I use a kind of weird shorthand, so Dumbledore = Dumbles, Hermione = He/Herm, Harry = Ha/Haz/Hazza, Ron = R, Snape = Sev, Draco = Dr/Dra/Drac, Lucius = Luc/Lucy and Minerva = Min/Minnie. Those are the main ones I use from Canon, but I also have nicknames and shorthand for my OCs, so reading my initial notes would probably be confusing AF. Of course, I go through and write them up properly after I finish each section, otherwise I would forget all my shorthand and struggle to understand it.

And I'm Aussie (with a pommy editor) so everything has a nickname that ends with ‘-o' or ‘-a'. Occasionally there are ‘-ie' or ‘-y's. For example, Hazza (Harry), Bazza (Barry), Wazza (Warren), Jobbo (Jobson), Robbo (Robert/Robertson), Servo (Service/petrol station, Avo (Avocado), Arvo (Afternoon, and my editor's least favourite word ever), Maccas (McDonalds), Durry/Duzza (Cigarette), Derro (Drunkard/Junkie/Low-life), Bottle-O (Liquor store), Dunny (Toilet).

She told Harry that she cared but then actually never did so (like I said earlier, sending him food was accomplice to child abuse, not some grand act of rescue). Even if she never formulated a clear promise, she claimed that she cared but then did very little. Admittedly, the presents were a nice touch, but a good deed does not wash away a bad one.

There was a recent [[/r/AskReddit]] thread about foster parents, and one of the most lamented things from the foster children were empty words. People who were promised care but then were sent back to the system after a couple of months. I am not just pulling at straws to find some base for disliking a character, my points have a backing in reality.

The series is called Harry Potter, so the two best ways to judge a character is either a completely neutral view using the law (which, outside of purely magical areas like Hogwarts or Diagon, is the British legal code and international standards like the universal human rights or the Geneva and Hague converntions) or how they treated the main character since he is the most detailed narrator, even if obviously biased or not accurate (for example when it comes to female emotions).

Yet I am not wrong. Dumbledore's "ten dark years" were an honest-to-god confession, any Death Eater is guilty of war crimes, Snape's obsession with a woman long dead was more than just a little creepy and Molly, however you want to judge her parenting (there are some theories about why her sons all flee home as soon as they graduate; once is a coincidence, but 5 times?), was not a good person to Harry. She openly insulted his last real family member in fron of Harry. She never really followed up on her words. That is enough for me to judge her (and that's not even taking her treatment of Fleur into account).

************* It's all very nice but you aren't going to get anything logical by judging a children's book series using real law as a basis for it. But that's your choice. Moly only considered taking Harry away because he hadn't answered Ron's letters, not because she knew/suspected abuse. She knew there was something going on, but you can't say she knew Harry was abused. And as I've said, there was no direct promise. It would have been far worse if she had promised to take him away but hadn't done that. And she isn't his foster parent, it's the Dursleys who are responsible for this. Those complaints are from foster children who had legal guardians, so I think it's quite different.

*************** This happens after they rescue Harry. And logically she should have reported this, but then the question is whether she knows anything about muggle law. I believe when the child is born his birth is registered and so he becomes the citizen of that country. I doubt that Molly's family, as a family of purebloods, does this because according to the statute of secrecy they are supposed to be hidden from the muggle world. Since the muggle authorities don't know about the existance of the Weasleys or the Potters, do muggle laws apply to them? JK didn't say anything about it,so we don't know. So Molly can only know about the wizarding law, she doesn't seem to know that things such as social security or laws against child abuse exist. Arthur knows very little about muggles too, so he can't help much. If we use this logic everywhere, Cinderella's stepmother should be punished for restricting her stepdaughter's freedom. I've analyzed many books, but we never were asked to apply the British law in our analysis. That's strange.

Nah, it isn't just because of that. Harry deserves a lot of slack for his shortcomings, because he's constantly faced with life threatening situations and has an insane mass murderer after him. How goes the saying? "It's not paranoia if they're really out to get you."

To be honest it would be completely ridiculous if among all the shit that happens to Harry in canon he'd also be a really insightful person with a flourishing social life who is always available for help and advise. That's how fanfics with completely shitty Garry Stu MCs come about.

IMHO a decent Harry bashing story could only occur post Hogwarts.

I want to read hundreds of pages about Harry and Hermione being domestic together, but there are pretty much just two oneshots (Definitions of romance, home making dilemma) which got that covered.

And then that writer followed up with a sequel with each chapter being a one-shot describing various everyday moments in the pair's life. This format ensures that the writer is under far less pressure and can update the fic after long delays without the headache of annoyed readers. And the readers get the opportunity to revisit characters they like and see what they are doing after x number of years.

We had this argument before, but I don't think you would be happy if he had left her when he knocked her up even though they weren't married (from your comment I get the impression you are criticising him for leaving her when they were married). I don't know how long it's been since you've read DH, but JK puts sevral clues that let the readers see that pregnancy was the culmination of a bad situation. First Tonks and Remus leave Harry's birthday party because Tonks says' the ministry is pretty anti-werewolf at the moment'. We don't know what consequences this had for them, but if they can't even stay because their presense 'would not do Hary any favours', I bet it's not all that nice. Later Tonks tells that Bellatrix tried 'very hard to kill me'. Remus can put two and two together, and knows it's likely because of [[https://him.So][him.So]] as I've said, the pregnancy is just a final straw. You don't like Remus, but try reading that scene and notice the way he behaves-he is even described as 'looking quite'derranged'.This is not simply a reaction to a pregnancy. No man looks like that just for this reason. Besides, it's only your headcanon that Tonks was all responsible and so on. Maybe one of them made a mistake.

********* Kids should be discussed before marriage, if you are not on the same page, don't get married. If you can't handle the responsibility, don't get married.

Nowadays, people marry out of love (and I am pretty sure Tonks didn't marry Lupin to strengthen her alliance with the Polish-Lithuanian Crown). Marriage is basically a declaration that you care for a person and want to spend the rest of your life with them (and raise children together if you want them). Or that you want tax benefits, but that's a different story.

If he felt like throwing a pity party due to his disease or even committing suicide, fine, I don't care. But he shouldn't drag other people down with him. Because if you use "He ran because he cared for her" as the excuse, he is still a dick since he never should have married Tonks in the first place because he was just doing her a disservice.

Or you say that the marriage was not a mistake, in which case Lupin was a dick for running.

Rowling could have even made them a good example of parents who didn't work out together and still both care for their children, but that would require admitting that the marriage was a mistake (well, and not killing them off).

What kind of person you would have to be to give up something you fought so hard to obtain?

** Bashing is a symptom of lazy writing. If an author who does not care for a particular character is still thinking deeply about logical characterization, story influences on their personalities, and other factors that contribute to plot development, most less-than-favorable outlooks don't even qualify as what we know as bashing even if the intent is to critically undermine a character or set of characters from the start. If it can be called 'bashing', it's probably just a sore, outspoken author with Lots of Opinions. Some people like this blunt, overt slamming. These people and these authors are made for each other.

Also, just like the word 'slash', when someone reads 'bashing' it is assumed this is the main focus of a story even when it's not. That speaks more to the overall quality of writers in this niche than to the niche itself. There should be a term for good bashing to set it apart. I like reading critical character analyses, though calling it that every time I want to reference what I like would get tiresome after a while.

Anyway, I don't look for bashing, but for certain characters (Hermione and Remus, even though I like them well enough aha) it is interesting to me when I find it. Vitriol in narrative form can be a hoot to skim.

** Bashing is what a result of when you give your story voice and personality... and take it to far. Of course, how much is too far is a matter of taste. I'm more permissive than most, so stories I like for their voice, others hate for their bashing.

​

Edit: Ok, having read the thread it's clear that my views are much more pro-bashing than most of y'all.

Bashing isn't about purposefully misrepresenting characters. Some people on this thread have said it is, but it isn't. People say a story bashes if the story consistently casts that character in a negative light, especially if canon didn't. People say a story bashes even if the character's characterization is completely consistent with canon.

Sometimes it's important to cast a character in a negative light. If your view point character hates jocks, then they will probably hate ron. If they hate condescension, hermoine. If they hate manipulation, dumbledore. And if they hate those people then it's a good chance that all their interactions with them will be negative. Canon does this for the first five books with Draco Malfoy. For all we know Draco likes butterflies and is a kind and dependable friend. Of course we never see that because why the hell would we?

And doing this is perfectly fine. Was canon bad because Draco was only shown as a cowardly, racist bastard? No! Sometimes bashing is important. There are tons of stories I can think of where this happens, and the world is a better place for them. It's important not to constrain the space of stories you can make just because certain characters are beloved by the fandom. Sometimes bashing is the right choice for the story. (I'd also argue that it's important to be able to characterize differently than canon, but that's a whole 'nother screed)

Ultimately, the biggest problem with bashing is that it's correlated with bad writing. Not because it makes for bad writing, but because fanfiction in general is correlated with bad writing. For many writers, fanfiction is their first work. So they characterize poorly, and their world is unrealistic. Antigonists receive a good chunk of the narrative and thus a good chunk of the bad decisions. Some people see this and call it bashing and say that it caused all the bad decisions. They're wrong.

Edit Edit:

Tying it back to my original comment, casting people in a negative light is a part of giving your story voice. Voice is taking the world that JKR and to some extent, the fanfiction writer, created and putting a spin on it. To paint the dull atoms and matter with shades of brilliant white and grungy black and good and bad and everything in between. Imagine a story without that. You get the silmarillion, except even the silmarillion didn't completely leave that out. And sometimes, the voice will paint ron bad and draco good and that's ok. The voice doesn't represent some sort of omniscient judging deity. I, for one, don't mandate all my fiction be about the exact same system of morality I have.

*** The problem with bashing is that it is never so complex as to just shine a light on their negative characteristics-that's not actually bashing in my opinon. Bashing takes every scene, every characteristic and turns it into a negative. Bashing is evil Dumbledore, Abusive/Death Eater Ron, Love potion dosing Ginny.

So you can have a character interact with a canon character and view them negatively-I have seen this done really well in many stories-that's not bashing. Bashing is when they are irredeemable or it's not consistent with their character and their purely to bash (having Hermione actually having cheated all along or something is bashing).

Canon hints at Draco being a coward not evil. You can have a character viewed negatively, but still make the situation more complex than it might appear.

I disagree that you necessarily need to hint at it or show it, that's a stylistic choice and up to the story you're trying to tell.

I definitely disagree that bashing is never so complex. Bad bashing isn't complex, or at least the author never models it as complex behind the scenes (whether they show that is up to them). But bashing is what people call bashing. And people call bashing even when the character is redeemable and consistent. Take HPMOR, people called that Ron bashing despite the fact that he was in all of, like, five scenes. But of those scenes only one of them was in a good light. The rest of them he came across as a jock (consistent with canon) or an eleven year old (consistent).

By your definition this isn't bashing. But I'm old and weary and don't want to battle the constant semantic landslide. If people call something bashing then I'll just go with how they use it.

** Sure. I love it. A well written harridan!Molly who huffes and puffes and throws pans at the wall while calling someone a scarlet woman, while also presuming to be Harry's adoptive mother and constantly overstepping her bounds is a guilty pleasure of mine. Dumbledore can be similarly entertaining.

I think it really depends what someone wants out of fanfiction. Some people exclusively want well written and imaginative stories with their favorite characters. I enjoy those too. But I can also dig a bit of breaking of the 4th wall and mockery. I like fics that solely exist to explore the ridiculousness of Ron/Hermione and bring that to its most absurd conclusions.

** A good story that also includes bashing of select characters can be enticing. Many times these characters closely represent or have character traits in common with people we know in real life. For example I prefer Snape/Draco/Ron Bashing, Snape is because of a teacher I knew from a different Highschool than mine, being involved with extracurricular activities that put me in contact with other schools and students outside my own also put me in contact with other teachers, this teacher much like Snape couldn't accept the thought that his students weren't as good as he thought they were, that he was biased or that he saw nothing wrong with blatantly breaking rules to get his kids a upper hand in competition. Draco reminds me of a asshole from school, who would go to any length and any level to get the upper hand, a mediocre student who is touted as smart because of who (Draco) or what (My classmate) they are. Ron reminds me of a family member, the slovenly attitude (even worst that normal Teen Boys at the time I read the books), his eating habits and manners, his flaky attitude to promises or plans.

Bashing these characters is cathartic and when blended into the story well and effectively, like Ron doesn't go and become Death Eater evil but is a drain on fun or unintentionally ruins things, Draco while not becoming a new Death Eater big bad, although that is occasionally fun, does become the thorn in Harry's side not dueling Harry every week and raping his friends but rather ruins the best times Harry has by getting him booted from the Quidditch team, getting Harry detention and then in turn being smacked down even harder each time eventually being booted from the game neutered and without praise. Have Draco be expelled after a long drawn out feud due to him attempting to go out of bounds and failing. Snape is more seeing him Slam his head into the wall in trying to do Harry in and failing, him trying to double cross Dumbledore and failing each time barely hanging on by his nails and trying again.

** I used to...and everytime I see one I cringe becasue I now know that 9 out of 10 bash fics are based on character hate for the sake of hate. It also made me realize that vast majority of ff readers just love bashing. I can count only a few writers who can criticize characters without bashing, like Lomonaaeren.

** I suspect I wouldn't like it if the characters I like would be the ones who would be bashed. I do like, however, when another character asks those characters why they did what they did and they have to give their reasons. So then I can understand them better. I wonder whether those authors who bash certain characters would say they actually like them. I'd rather read discussions which analyze various characters, including their flaws, than a bashing fic.

** Well... I can't quite say that I /like/ bashing, but I usually don't mind bashing much. Fics that are pure bashing ("Ron's Hogwarts" is the only one that comes to mind atm) are at best mildly amusing, but bashing does not detract much from the rest of the story for me. edit: Actually, come to think of it, there were a few bits of bashing in "Chunin Exam Day" that were awesomely hilarious, though there was a lot of things wrong with that fic too. But it's very rare for bashing to be awesome.

And some bashing arises from some reinterpretation of some aspect of canon or fanon that I think is... more valid in some ways than the original. In which case, even if the bashing doesn't directly contribute to the story quality, I might still appreciate it in a kind of "Yeah! You tell them!" agreement kind of way. Like, in the Naruto fic "Destiny Is A Hazy Thing" linkffn(7421841), it's not the main focus but each chapter reinterprets a different minor aspect of canon (like, say, Lee's determination to keep fighting Gaara in the exam) in a manner that bashes some of the characters involved, as a kind of deconstruction. And I often appreciated the reinterpretations and thus the bashing. Actually, come to think of it, I think all deconstructions are kind of inherently bashing, even if the better ones are usually quite subtle about it.
