What are your thoughts on OC stories?

Personally I stumbled across a good Sirius Black / OC Maraurders Era story a while back and I've been obsessed ever since.

If you have an good ones (edit: Sirius Black/OC) please link them to me. I think I've done most of the rotation on FF.net but any will do.


** If the author can make a good oc that fits the story well, I don't really care which character theyre paired with

** The issue with OC is they can end up being thinly veiled SI which leads to wish fulfillment. I've read well done OC and SI, but I stay away from romantic pairings for them (especially with major characters) simply because they usually are just wish fulfillment. I mean, read some of the descriptions; "smart, powerful and irresistibly beautiful," totally not a Mary Sue or anything LOL.

*** Let's be honest here, most authors don't need an OC for their thinly veiled SI, they just modify an existing main character like Harry or Hermione.

** I asked the same question a while back. I was concerned a lot of people might skip over something I was planning which involved an OC, just because the OC existed. Unfortunately, there are so many bad ones that some people do just avoid them altogether. I know my OCs are well balanced, with good reasons for their existence and most things about them. But I don't know about anybody else's until I read their work. Because I write them myself, it would be hypocritical of me not to read them too. - But if it they turn out to be OP or an SI or similar, I tend to drop them unless there's something else in the story that really interests me. Part of this has to do with my lack of spare time, though. Otherwise, I might persevere with a few more of them.
