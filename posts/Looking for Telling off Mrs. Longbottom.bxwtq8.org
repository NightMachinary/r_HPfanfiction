I've read a few but wonder if you know more and would recommend, someone telling off Mrs. Longbottom for the way she treats and lets Neville be treated by his family. Whether it is Harry, Prof McGonagall or even Neville himself. Doesn't have to be only focused on that, but can be part of a longer fic, but a fic to make her realize what she's done and how bad she's screwed up.


** There is one. . . damn I'm not at my other computer. Dumbledore in a multi-verse where he didn't bungle the Riddle situation dies peacefully and gets an option to fix the canon-Dumbledore's screwups. Highly enjoyable. . . Anyone got the fic?

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

** I believe linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) has Neville telling her off, but it's a LOT of story before it happens

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Sinyk's linkffn(Harry Potter and the Daft Morons) has something along those lines if I'm not mistaken.

** Neville tells her off in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17186567][Mistakes]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/felix_atticus/pseuds/sebastianL][sebastianL (felix_atticus)]], and hers and Neville's relationship doesn't improve, but I like how the situation is handled and how Neville's childhood and character is explored. I'd recommend this fic even if you're wary of first person POV or the Neville/Original Male Character tag.
