I have run out of fan fics featuring my favorite pair, and now I need a new one to read. I'm looking for well written, long, emotional, angsty, and amazing fan fics featuring Snape and hermione. I don't care the time period (although I don't usually like ones where they are already together and look over their lives) or if she's still in school (if its like 6th or 7th year, not any younger) I just need a good, meaty, emotional story. Thanks!!


** I'm so glad i stumbled upon this thread, cos this ship is my fav and all these rec's will keep me busy! Anything by Loten without a shadow of a doubt. I read everything by her over Christmas again and it was glorious. Enjoyed Pet Project by Caeria. Bound To Him has been a great, interesting read by georgesgirl117, although she takes a long time to update and currently still waiting on some more! I'd love to get my teeth into a story written by someone that wasn't written 10 years ago. I do sometimes feel i'm the inly sshg around when i look at some of the dates on these fics! So, glad to meet you all!!

** I see someone has already suggested "Chasing the sun" by Loten, her other great work "Post Tenebras Lux" is also well worth a look.

The Art of Brewing by Note-A-Flat is wonderful and definitely worth a read.

The Savage by Magpie is... patchy but still worth a look.

The Unspeakable Files is really well done, can't remember who writes that one.

** Here are a couple of my favorites. I think 2 of them have already been mentioned.

Post Tenebras, Lux by Loten - linkffn(6578435); Chasing the Sun is also excellent but I prefer this one

Pride of Time by Anubis Ankh - linkffn(7453087)

The Gilded Cage by ApollinaV - linked below by Mythic_Hue

Into the North by Kailin - linkffn(2743356)

Looking for Magic by HypnoBarb - linkffn(2737071) - technically incomplete but the last chapter posted is a good "end"

Also, I have 2 that are not on ffn as far as I know. They are on "The Petulant Poetess" site.

The Witches of Gilford by pyjamapants : [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=11338]]

The Marriage Benefit by mia madwyn (this is shorter and perhaps not as angsty as you want but still a favorite of mine) : [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=17655]]

** Dude, please, PLEASE check out Self Slain Gods on Strange Altars (warning, it's on hiatus). I am forever recommending this hoping to turn someone else into a fan as well lol. Hands down the best canon-compliant, angsty, emotional fic I've read between these two. Everyone constantly recommends The Professor's Discretion (good in its own way) but this blows it out of the water for heart wrenching and disturbingly hot. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8869173/1/Self-Slain-Gods-on-Strange-Altars]])

**** Tough one! It depends; I'm more of a "journey" than "destination" person, so I don't mind starting a WIP as long as the going is good. I care mainly about seeing how their relationship unfolds at Hogwarts and this fic is already over 150k words--so the meat of the story has already been written and it continues on to follow Hermione post-DH. To me, anything beyond Hogwarts is just icing on the cake.

But as it stands presently there is no ending and--it does leaves you in a keyed up kind of way lol. I look at it as part of the beautiful agony of the story but I totally get if you prefer closure. Not sure if any of that was helpful!

**** Not to mention that the ending was so cliché and predictable that it actually made me angry. Seriously, I had called it by chapter 20, and there were like 40 chapters after that, so I was pretty annoyed that it played out exactly like I thought it would.

What I /did/ like about it was that, despite other flaws, Hermione is genuinely wrong a couple of times, with no excuses. I don't come across that often.

**** Livejournal is horrible, but if you scroll all the way down to the bottom, there is a link to go to the next chapter. The story was unfinished for a long time so I made the effort to read it. I felt the author skipped over a lot of things just to get that epilogue out there. Still, I read it several times in its "unfinished" state and liked it then. It also appears on adult fanfiction.net though the last additions aren't on there.
