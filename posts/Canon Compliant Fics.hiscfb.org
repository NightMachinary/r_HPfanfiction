  It did not occur to Harry Potter to wonder why his Snowy Hedwig was so much more affectionate than the other owls. It did not occur to him he would ever need to care. That's why she waited to tell him. (Canon compliant)

*** I read that fic a year ago and I genuinely don't think I've ever been hit harder in the feels. I thought it would just be fluff then all of the sudden I'm feeling feels and wondering what happened.

** I'm pretty sure Northumbrian's fics are canon compliant (and also awesome)

** My default suggestion is linkffn(The Snape Chronicles), which is quite long but a good starting point for anyone who wants a different perspective on canon events. From Severus' limited perspective, Harry did actually look like an inconsiderate, impetuous, violent troublemaker.

There are several good fics that give the in-Hogwarts perspective on seventh year; you've mentioned Not From Others. I don't recall exactly how linkffn(A Call to Arms) went, but I liked it enough to bookmark it. If you want sixth year, there's linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince), which has lots of snark-to-snark combat by the Weasleys.

#+begin_quote
  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

#+begin_quote
  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.
