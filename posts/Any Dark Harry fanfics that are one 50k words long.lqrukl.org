:END:
I've just finished reading Prince of the Dark Kingdom (which I highly recommend) and reminded me of other fanfics where Harry and Voldemort aren't soft and weird but cold and play political games with each other. I don't care if Voldemorts immortal or anything just want to have some recommendations. I would prefer it to be OVER 50K words long

** The Darkness Within trilogy by Kurinoone. I love it
