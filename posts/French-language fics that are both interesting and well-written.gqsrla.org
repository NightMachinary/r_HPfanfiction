Hi,

I'm currently studying French and looking into French fanfiction as a way to passively include more French into my day to day life.

So far, most stories I've found have either been of the Lord Slytherin-Potter-Peverell-Hufflepuff-Emrys-... variety, that I just can't stomach or were completely riddled with grammar and spelling mistakes.

In English it's rather easy to judge a story based on the description and the first chapter, a process that still takes me a while in French.

French-speaking redditors of Reddit, help me out with this and recommend your favourite fics. Thanks in advance!


** I'm French but I only read fanfictions in English. I have a friend who tried to recommend me some in French though so here they are (haven't read them myself because there is so much to explore in English...)

This one is a trilogy, quite additive, according to my friend: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7007114/1/Les-Cicatrices-du-Temps][Les Cicatrices du Temps]]

This one is funny, according to my friend: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3645228/1/Une-%C3%A9trange-association][Un étrange association]]

Edit: now that I think about it, to be honest, I don't read in French because I can't find well-written ones... And you can feel the community is actually reading in English, because they use literal translations for terms from fanfictions (Lord Noir for Dark Lord is actually horrifying for me. Even "le côté de la Lumière" for the "Light Side" is terrible...) So, yeah, to read in French, you do need to be somewhat tolerant of this, I'm afraid... I would actually recommend reading French-translated canon books instead. Those are a great way to rediscover it and it's well-written.

*** Well fellow french, I too am ashamed to only read English fanfiction (or fiction in general), I cannot bear to read in french anymore because author|editor and Translator tend to translate everything, even the Family name, Like Newt Scamander is Norbert Dragonneau in French (Hogwart = Poudlard and it's the fucking official translation) , For fuck's sake it's bad it doesn't work! Stop translating the proper nouns or anything else that's matter honestly.

It's strange because The Toubon Law does not concern thing like books, and translating Name, Cities, Place or Organizations doesn't make it more appealing to me, it's like they are "Francizating" (Excuse-me for this horrible word) the British culture (or any culture being concerned by this phenomenon) and it's not making the translation better, that's just insulting.

Another Exemple *Tom Marvolo Riddle* was switched to *Tom Elvis Jedusor*, because they really really needed to get /"I am Lord Voldemort"/ translated so we could read /"Je suis Voldemort"/ and honestly, by doing this, they removed the connection to The Gaunt family, it fucking removes the connection to his Father's name that he really hated, and this is fucking insulting toward the source material, just put some fucking subtittles or a note in the book at the page concerned.

**** Hello, fellow French-speaking person. I actually... don't quite agree with you (sorry).

I actually love the adaptation they did in canon books. It's always clever wordplays and it's part of the magic. Don't forget that Harry Potter is child litterature. I don't believe I would have understand the wordplay done with "Hogwarts" if it wasn't "Poudlard" when I was 7 years old (so when I first read them). "Serdaigle" for "Ravenclaw" is awesome, even if it's not the same animal. "Serpentard" for "Slytherin" is really cool. I agree it's not the same as the original, that you lose some stuff (the Gaunt link with Marvolo, indeed) but it does adapt well the magic of it so I love it. Translation notes are a great way to preserve the original, that's true, but it does bring a fourth wall in your reading and kind of bring you back in reality, which is not fun when reading fantasy, I believe... Anyway, French-translated canon books are great, imo, which why I advise OP to read it in French as a way to rediscover them. For me, the original books are well-written and well-adapted.

But that's my problem with French-written fanfictions, actually. I don't feel this creativity in the adaptation of the concepts borrowed from English-written fanfictions. So I find that sad and just don't read it, that's all. Well, I'm also much more difficult to please in my mother-tongue that in any other languages, so maybe there's that also...

*** I'm going to second the recommendation for Les Cicatrices du Temps because I read it in English via Google Translate, and even with the horrible translation it was an excellent story. I can't imagine it would be a bad story in the original language, without the horrible translation errors.

Maybe I should brush off my French (and pull out my French-English dictionary) and try it in the original language.

*** I'll take a look at them, thanks.

I can totally understand that, and it makes sense since I don't read in any of the other languages I speak either, exclusively in English.

** I did the same 8 years ago with Spanish. I noticed really quickly that the translations of the big English fics were my best bet, so maybe it is the same with French. Many of the all time greats have well done translations into various languages, and are usually mentioned/linked by the author themselves.

Sorry I don't have any specific links for you since I don't speak French, but thought I would drop the advice in case you hadn't thought about that.

** I'm afraid I don't know French, but seeing as you can search FFN by language and sort by # of favorites, you might want to start [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&lan=3&r=10][*/here/*]].

*** Yeah I already tried that but that's how I ended up finding the popular stories that were so cliché they made me want to tear my eyes out. Thanks for the advice though!

** Hello. I am a French reader. Here is one of my favorite fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10776037/1/Survivre-sans-magie]].\\
This fanfiction follows an SI that was thrown into the world of Harry Potter. Unlike most fanfiction, the SI remains a muggle. The plot is original. Unfortunately, the fanfiction was never finished.

I also recommend you this fanfiction:\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13413840/1/Un-journal-%C3%A0-Poudlard][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13413840/1/Un-journal-à-Poudlard]].\\
It takes place at the time of the marauders. Through the diary, a young Tom Riddle takes Serverus under his wing.

** As your standard English speaking, no second language USAian, I've long wondered:

How did the French editions of the Potter books (and I suppose by extension the French Language Fan Fiction) deal with the Pepe LePew version of French the English editions had Fleur and company speaking?

With everyone already speaking French, what set Fleur and her classmates/staff apart?

*** Fleur has the "'Arry" thing. But that's all I remember. The French version didn't translate the accents much, as we generally have our books written in a written way of speaking instead of an oral one: even Hagrid didn't get his accent transcripted; I learned he had one while reading English fanfiction.
