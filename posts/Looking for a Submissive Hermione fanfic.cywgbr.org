:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic I started reading awhile back about Hermione discovering she was submissive. She ends up going home and a librarian gives her books on the subject when she guesses what's going on with Hermione. Hermione decides she wants Harry to be her Dom and gives him his own book to read. Harry finally agrees with her after offering some stipulations. Any help finding it is appreciated.

** Whole BSDM subplotline is (in my opinion, mistakenly) part of linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao), where the dominant partner is Snape. But that's yet another can of worms on this story, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cxy9ok/which_tropes_died_and_were_replaced_by_something/eyp214f/]] for more.
