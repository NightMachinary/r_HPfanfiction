** linkffn(Vox Corporis). My personal favorite and the second HHr I read. It's slow and sweet, though it was written before Half Blood Prince and thus the final act and downfall of Voldemort is quite different (no horcruxes).

linkffn(Unlike a Sister). Another very popular recommendation on this sub. I didn't like it but it's a common rec.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry told Ron he saw Hermione as his sister. Now Hermione is in danger and Harry's feelings for her begin to change dramatically, jeopardizing everything he once knew. An Epilogue compliant fic. Rated M for sex and language.
