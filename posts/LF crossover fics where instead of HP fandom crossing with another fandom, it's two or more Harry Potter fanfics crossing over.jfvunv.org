I got the idea while reading a fate/stay night fanfic where the main characters from different famous fate fanfics are all summoned togethor. I was wondering if there were any similar good fanfics in this fandom.


** No, sadly . I'm thinking of writing a crossover between HPMOR and The Arithmancer, though.

  From across Time/Space, legends from the age of Fanfiction Net come together to engage once more in the Fifth Holy Grail War. All is not as it seems as the Shirous of various works must band together to stop a force beyond their current means. But let it be known they are not alone. For they hail from the nexus above and beyond, the Throne of Shirou!
