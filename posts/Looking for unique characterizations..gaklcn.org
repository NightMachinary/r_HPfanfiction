Have you read any fics with different takes on a character's personality (AU) or which give an interesting personality to a side or OC character? I'm thinking along the lines of Petunia in Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider or Aurora Sinistra in The King's Indian Attack, but any sort of well-handled and complex changed or reimagined characterizations would be appreciated. Thanks!


** Don't remember the name of the fic or if it was any good, but I once read a fic where Blaise Zabini had a rather aloof personality. Only for Harry to later find out that Blaise was always so silent because he was observing how purebloods were behaving. He grew up on the muggle side of things and had no idea how to behave in wizarding culture without outing himself. He was kind of a nerd with extensive videogame and movie knowledge and introduced Harry to lot of it ( with Harry having missed out because he was raised by the Dursleys ).

It's the only time I encountered that particular characterisation for Blaise, or any outside of the basic Blaise at all so it stuck with me. Can't say anything about the rest of the fic other than that Harry was sorted in Slytherin.
