The longer I'm in the fandom the more it seems I've read all of the "good" stuff (by which I mean the specific plot lines and pairings that interest me). I've decided to try branching out in to crossovers, except I've never really managed to get interested in fan fiction for any other fandom.

I'd prefer post-DH and it absolutely had to be complete - I can't stand getting invested in a story to find it's been abandoned or the author updates sporadically and I can't figure out when to check back. Ideally the crossover should be written in a way that I don't need to be 100% familiar with the characters or plot of the other fandom (or at least not as familiar as I am with HP for instance), or it includes some sort of back story/introduction to help set the stage.

An example of the sort of thing I'd be looking for more of... just recently read one that was recco'd here about Master of Death Harry (one of my recent favourite plot lines) that was a Sherlock cross over where he was in an alternate universe working as a medium, and I really enjoyed it as being a hardcore fan of Sherlock was not necessary to enjoy the story.

Thanks :)


** Can I get a link to the MoD!Harry/Sherlock crossover?

Wand and Shield, The Shadow of Angmar and The Black Prince are all great but still works in progress.

** Tangentially related: everyone talks about checking back into fics that are currently updating. Do you all just not have accounts or is there some issue with the follow functionality for some people that I don't have. As I see it, you follow any fic that you want to know when it updates and you get an email every time there's a new chapter. No unnecessary checking, and you never miss an update.

*** On ff.net? I think I might have had an account once but I don't remember it. The checking in issue is for all of my fics I read/used to read elsewhere (archive of our own, or livejournal... remember livejournal? ) My fear is really more around abandonment. I've been burned too many times by a great story that's not finished but updating regularly until close to the end and then they just disappear.

**** You can follow on AO3 as well. And I hate abandonment too, but I tend to forget about stories, once I've hit the favourite/follow, until the next chapter appears in my inbox (truly exceptional ones are an exception) so I don't really get too hung up on abandonment

***** I forget stories too. Sometimes I get updates on stories I gave up for dead years ago, and I no longer remember what the story was about.

Nowadays though I tend not to start stories where the last update was over two years ago.

*** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/940292][*/Through the Eyes of Minerva's Owl/*]] by [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Morena_Evensong/pseuds/Morena_Evensong][/Morena_Evensong/]]

#+begin_quote
  When Albion calls Merlin, he returns to puzzle out why. Meanwhile, two years of peace are shattered when Harry Potter is attacked and left badly beaten, the Elder Wand stolen from his grasp. Then a sword appears in front of Buckingham Palace and a dragon escapes from Wales. As the Ministry of Magic and the Order of the Phoenix scramble for answers, Merlin gathers his allies (both old, new and unexpected) as he prepares to greet Albion's Darkest Hour. Morgana declares war in a single, devastating blow that leaves England's wizards stunned beyond words, making it clear that the time of the Once and Future King is upon them... if only they knew where he was. Will wisdom learnt through the eyes of Minerva's owl be enough to prevent disaster? Mostly cannon-compliant for both series.

  #+begin_example
      Before I get to the story, I'd like to send out huge thanks to LittleBouce for betaing and britpicking this story for me\! And for her cheerleading and help along the way, not to mention the endless supply of patience with my inability to spell Kingsley Shacklebolt's name right\. Also thanks to theGlaistig for betaing and catching everything the two of us missed\. And, of course to the\_muppet on LJ for organizing this year's Big Bang\. It's my first Big Bang and it's been tons of fun and quite the learning experience for me as a writer \(most notably, that I do really well with a deadline \- who knew?\)\.Make sure you check out the fanvid made by xcuri0sity for this story  on Tumblr

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

*** awesome, thanks! the synopsis for the Merlin one was a little confusing as I have no clue who any of the Merlin characters are... is it easy to pick up contextual clues or do you need a primer on the plot of the series to know what's going on?

Luckily I've got a Marvel fan for a boyfriend so I've seen all of the Avenger movies and should be gtg with the other one :) Thanks!

**** I'm a Merlin fan, and I didn't remember a third of the people who showed up in the fic haha. I don't think it matters that much, it's still Potterverse, only with a new big bad.
