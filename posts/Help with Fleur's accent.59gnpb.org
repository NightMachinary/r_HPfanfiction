After being unable to find a fic with Fleur's POV I'd like to read, I've decided to write one.

I'm starting with her exams back at Beauxbatons, so writing dialogue with her classmates can't be problematic. What should I do when she comes to Hogwarts, though? That... /accent/ is driving me crazy.

Of course, I can relax with later chapters, when she eemproves her eenglish, but I can't have my readers /cringe cringe cringe/ at the very beginning.

Does it put people off as it does me? It should,  if she's the main character, I theenk. Does anyone have any examples where it's overdone or even done right?

/Merci/ in advance.


** If it's from her POV you can go with the unreliable narrator route - she wouldn't notice her accent. You could always show others struggling to understand her, or her internal frustration at not being able to articulate something to show the accent and language barrier is there, but you don't necessarily have to write in the accent.

*** You've just made me realize that one of the reasons I chose to write this is that I understand what it feels like when you're living in a foreign country and you're constantly afraid that you'll sound silly. The difference is - she doesn't let it show - I do, and I'd like to become more like her, in a way.

Thanks Floreat.

** Yes, I think depicting the full accent would get quickly tiresome with her as the protagonist. What I would do is retain some mild clues in her dialogue - drop the H at the start of words, insert the occasional French word - and augment that with having there be occasional confusion over what she has said on the basis of pronunciation or word choice.

*** That's great advice, as always. You reminded me of /Modern Family/ and Gloria: "Phil, she said /Phil/, not /feel/." I wouldn't use it often, though.

** You could always just change it a bit and have her speak without much of an accent. It's not really an integral part of her character.

** Just indicate that she's talking with an accent, like:

She responded in heavily accented english, "Blah blah blah."

Then proceed with the usual english dialogue. I think readers would understand if you went that route.

** You can switch POV for a bit if you want to show she has some difficulties with English.

** I just wrote one, and I agree if she's the main character, you aren't going to want to use her accent. So what I did was make a point of not using contractions, as though she is still considering what she will say in French before she says it in English. And a couple of times I gave her a rather formal construction for a sentence as opposed to something more idiomatic. But I was careful to not go overboard on that either; as long as you make it neutral, people already know her as a character and will cast your words in her voice.

** Yes you can, just don't do the accent (or say that her english doesn't sound great without actually writing it that way...also: I think Fleur does her utmost to improve her English, she probably hates sounding like an imbecil - especially if you stick with the canon romance (which I myself don't actually like...sorry, but Bill IMHO is much too old for her, he's what? 25? 30?)...I mean who wouldn't improve his or her language skills if they have a foreign GF/BF? I surely would...ok, unless it's English (which is a foreign language for a German guy like me!))...it's frankly one of the things I dislike about people who include her in a story:

The exaggerated accent (I mean sure: Her English isn't great at first, but after a year talking to British people (hell even if she'd only listen!) it will get better - rapidly! I myself learned English this way (with a good grounding from having English classes at school of course!): I watched American TV-Shows and read English books! (For example Harry Potter...haven't ever tried it in German and I don't really want to either!)...school alone wouldn't have given me enough become fluent (the school way of learning - any - languages just doesn't work for me...it works for grammar, but not for becoming fluent and knowing tons of words, expressions, idioms etc.))

ps: That's why school failed so dismally at teaching me Spanish (I didn't have any Spanish books to read or movies to watch so my Spanish is still pretty bad!)

*** Hm, first, it's really not that uncommon for girls to go after older boys, I guess (especially at that age, speaking from experience).

And you've hit a nerve with this comment, because I've moved to Germany two years ago and it's just so /hard/. I don't know if it's because I speak three other languages, or is it German. /crawls into a hole/

But I see your point. It's a matter of good writing and knowing when it's too much.

** I don't think you have to make it very strong. If she's the speaker, she would be aware of her own accent but not to the same extent that someone like Harry would be aware.

Maybe just substituting z for th and dropping H's at the beginning of sentences would work.

You can also just make her constructions somewhat awkward/simple. Maybe not all of the time, just when she's nervous or upset or trying to express a complicated thought.

You might even want to get someone French as a beta, they might have a few suggestions for ways to make the accent seem more natural and for Fleur to feel more authentically French. JKR did a good job because she's somewhat fluent and spent time there, but it's not easy.
