** Doesn't exist... A few months ago, my requirement was that he be apathetic to everyone and power hungry like Leylin Farlier but these kinds of fics don't exist(not at all what you were looking for but quite similar, I think).For good reason too, since usually a story needs multiple central characters to progress.

On that note, I have noticed that when I wanted to read stories with this premise, I was going through a tough period of life(addiction to anime, fanfics etc; isolation from people). This may be totally unrelated but if you are too then I wish you the best of luck :)

** /Probably/ not what you're wanting really, but to me when I think of "dark, Harry-centric, warfic" I think of linkffn(7539141)

In case the bot gets fucky, that's Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma, by Matt Silver.

So to clarify, he's not dark really but the fic itself is pretty dark in tone from what I remember.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.
