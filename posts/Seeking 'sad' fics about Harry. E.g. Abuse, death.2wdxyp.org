** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2006636/1/Catechism][Saw this in a thread a few days ago.]] You want sad? It's got it. You want abuse? Oh my god it's got it. This is a heart-wrenching story. The comments on the thread said they couldn't get past the first chapter, but I actually liked this story, despite the sad theme.

Basically, the Dursley's have brainwashed Harry into believing that magic is evil, and the Dursley's are perfect and loving, and the abuse he suffers is because he's bad and needs correction. And he loves them for it because it's all he's ever known. It's quite fucked up.

It's not complete. Updates are.... slow.... 15 chapters in 10 years? But it was last updated in September, so maybe we'll get one in the next few months.

*** Started this the other day and oh wow, it is sad. It's driving me insane that none of the adults have questioned him! You run a physical health scan but not a psych one!? Especially once they get used to his personality somebody needed to say "Heeeey. Maybe something isn't right."

Also not looking forward to the the "end" as I don't really wait around for authors who only update once a year.

**** Ha, once a year. That's cute. There was a note on one of the chapters apologizing for a three year hiatus. But yeah, as a teacher that got me the most, that none of the adults questioned him. So many red flags! I think that was the biggest reason I kept reading, somebody had to care about poor Harry!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal-Harry][Brutal Harry]] is the only one I've read that really fits that description. It's certainly sad and depressing, and the abuse is...over the top in the extreme.

That said...it's not really one I'd "recommend" as such. It's not one I look back on and am happy I read, and I certainly don't think I'll ever re-read it. The abuse was over the top in a massive way, there were quite a few cliche's in evidence, including a big helping of bashing, IIRC.

*** If you haven't read Restoring Hope, please do. It is way too good of a story for how little it gets recommended around here. There is a minor bit of squick but if you don't think about it too much it won't detract from the story.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8966727/1/Vengeance-from-the-grave]] was the only one I could think of, although it's really only "sad" for the first chapter

** There's the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/406888/Celebony][Recnac Transaerso series by Celbony]]. It's a bit farfetched in some places, but the general plot is Harry meets a new neighbor who finds out he has cancer, so he finds a spell that transfers the disease to himself. It has a sequel and an epilogue that stands alone.
