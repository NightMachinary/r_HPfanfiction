** Harry/Ginny postwar smut is one of my guilty pleasures:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7448513/1/Dealing-With-Demons-And-Prats][Dealing with Demons and Prats]], linkffn(7448513)

"In Case of Emergency" has already been mentioned. This one actually has a decent plot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11567591/1/It-s-Complicated][It's Complicated]], linkffn(11567591): This one is pretty hardcore, containing several BDSM and roleplaying scenes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4291790/1/Polyjuice-Memory-Charms-and-More][Polyjuice, Memory Charms, and More]], linkffn(4291790): is by far the best story in this category

--------------

Other great H/G fics with some smut:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5648259/1/Elemental-Harry][Elemental Harry]], linkffn(5648259): Well written super elemental Harry/Ginny

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]], linkffn(11922116): Harry never went to Hogwarts. After the War, he hired Ginny to accompany him on some adventures.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): Harry and Ginny vs the rest of the world. Almost everyone else, including Arthur, Dora, and Sprout, was bashed. This fic contains some serious sex and violence.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345): Short, but a fun romp. They liked to have rough sex after killing or capturing Death Eaters.

**** Ghost of You, Seeking Ginny and In Case of Emergency are all great stories provided you can get past the fact they are all based on premises that probably would not be consistent with canon.

Ghost of You revolves around a Ginny who has a nervous breakdown and is a bit weak in many respects throughout the story. She is not the strong woman we know from the books. Also, Neville is OOC by the end. The story works though so it doesn't seem too crazy for both Ginny and Neville to act that way.

Seeking Ginny was written way before the series ended, so Ginny does seem a bit OOC, essentially running away from Harry instead of going after what she wants. It also has the same issue as Ghost of You in that it is often difficult to like Ginny in the fics.

In Case of Emergency is a good story even though I try not to read racy fics (it's just weird for me to view character's from a children's story that way, but that's my own thing, no judgement). But I suppose I don't believe that Harry and Ginny would break it off, especially over something as simple as work schedules in a world where one can travel hundreds of miles in a second.

***** Yup, fair disclaimer! At this point I have little to no issue with canon consistency (as I'm sure can be noted by my recs- AtE is obviously wildly AU too, though because it was written during the three year summer). For my first (coughs) ten years or so of reading fic I refused to read any AU/OOC stuff, but I eventually gave that up and at this point, my favorite fics are generally at least somewhat AU.

****** I'm the same way. Some of my favorite stories are AU "Harry and Ginny never met" or AU "Harry and Ginny never got back together or broke up" where it seems like they are destined for each other, but not in a sappy way. I guess I just really like the idea that they were meant for only each other and no obstacle would keep them apart rather than a more realistic version of them being two compatible people.
