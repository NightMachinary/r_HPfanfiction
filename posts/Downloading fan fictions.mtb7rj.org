I can't use ff2books anymore. Each time I copy and paste an url from fanfiction.net there's some error. Any alternative?


** If you use Windows you can use Calibre program with FanFicFare. I always use this one.

*** If you are not afraid of using command line programs, then Calibre just runs [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare]] in the background.

** I honestly try to find the fic in AO3 and download from there. It's so much more user friendly.

** Looks like ficsave.xyz is still available, and I have used that successfully. And, I don't know what the etiquette rules are around this, but you can use sub's bot to get a comment with download links, right?

** Calibre with FanFicFare plugin is best for long term but for short term ( you're unsure about a fic but like to download and check it out) [[https://fanfictiondownloader.net/#/download][FanFictionDownloader]] is better. It's much faster than FFF.

By the way, FFDL requires Calibre for conversion (to epub for example), so if you're on Windows and don't have Calibre installed then download the following version. It has everything necessary.

  FFDL (Zip, All-In-One): [[https://fanfictiondownloader.net/ffdl-win-port.zip][0.9.4]]

*** Problem is: I mostly download fics on my phone and then send them on my kindle. My laptop is garbage, the less I use it, the better

But thanks! I've got calibre on my laptop, will download the plugin anyway
