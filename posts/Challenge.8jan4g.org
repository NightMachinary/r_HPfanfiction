Hey everyone. So this is my first post on this thread and i wasn't able to find rules on what could and couldnt be posted.

However, i wanted to see if anyone would be willing to write a story for me and have made a challenge to see if it peaks any authors interest.

ChallengeHarry gets bitten by a vampire during the department of mysteries rescueSirius still dies and Harry has to live with the after affects along with the differences of being a vampireRon becomes really stupid and becomes terrible to Harry and Hermione breaking the friendshipHarry finds a vampire tutor.Can have harry in a relationship prefer Harmony and Hr-LL fics but will read any non slash pairingDue to becoming a vampire harry can now sense the other horcruxes. Prefer new areas and defenses around remaining horcruxes.

Prefer Novel length story and the longer the better. 90% of FF I've read have been over 100k long

Thats about all i have. I recently read a story called Immortally Yours by Mondeas on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] that made me remember this challenge i had thought up years ago. I would love to start writing myself but being a college student along with the fact i don't really have a muse for fiction that has appeared yet has kinda slowed me down in beginning my own ideas and stories. feel free to message me though if you have any questions or any advice on how to get the muse started so i can begin to make my own creations.

Also don't mind new story recommendations although chances are if they aren't slash and over 100k words long I've probably already read them. i think my Fanfiction reader app has over 1800 stories in it so far...not sure if thats good or bad XD Anyways would love to see if i can find some amazing new stories too. I plan this weekend coming to dive into this reddit and look for myself.

Anyways have a good day everyone!


** Best I can do is link you to one of my incomplete fics that /somewhat/ hit the mark on a few points of yours.

Otherwise, I almost never see challenges be well received here. As in: few to no responses. Challenges seem to be more of a FFN thing, especially when they leave the realm of prompts and become these comission-type things.

  Voldemort not only sent his Death Eaters to the Ministry, but vampires as well. Hermione and Harry fall to them and find themselves in new, undead lives. While Harry struggles to remain human, Hermione becomes what was believed dead long ago. She becomes a Countess, an heir to Dracula. Unfortunately, there are no books on that. /Abandoned

** Popularly it's called a prompt but I suppose challenge is fine. If you have any skill with writing then I would tell you to not wait for the elusive muse and just start writing.

Besides I have seen this done before so you'll probably get a recommendation. I don't remember it's name right now.

Sorry for being generally unhelpful.

For anyone picking up this prompt I would suggest making Ron go bad because of the brains. I hate Ron Bashing.

*** Ahh ok. I wasn't sure whether different places called it different. Like I've read paladeus's challenge response along with reptilia's.

Most authors that responded and answered called them challenges so there it goes lol.

As for writing I have a feeling I'm a fairly good writer. However that's usually for college essays which is a completely different affair. I can easily write a 3 page essay in about 1-2 hours and have never received under an A but that's completely different then fiction

**** Yeah, in fanfiction sites they are called challenges usually so its all good. More people call them challenge perhaps but I have never seen the word used in this subrreddit.

Yes, writing an essay and a story are different things but you should still give it a try when you can. In my experience you will never get that free month to do it so you have to steal some time and give it a try.

***** I'll just steal that time from reading other people's I guess. I have enough ideas in my head and when I start writing it just flows out. Thanks for the advice. I'm on break so I'll see what I can manag.
