I am searching for a fanfic of which I only read its summary. Young Harry after being beaten by Dudley at school or by Vernon wished for parents and found himself in the past and met James and Lily. This is Harry before Hogwarts.. I recently saw this in the Harry Potter fanfic search but now I cant seem to find it.

#+begin_quote
  A lonely four year old Harry Potter falls into the Marauders life and they can't help but fall in love with the baby Prongs, how will they react to his relation to James, and his abusive home life? He must go home, and 12 years later, a lonely Harry Potter falls into a war he ended- to a time when his parents are alive. Time Travel fix it, Young!Harry, master of death!Harry.
