Hello,

As mentioned, looking for a story about Snape not being killed by Voldemort during the battle. Instead, Snape needs to work to keep Harry alive and convince him that he is a horcrux, etc. I prefer as close to canon as possible.

Thanks!

Follows canon to the tee it is the AU continuation of linkffn(A Difference in Families: the Snape Chronicles)

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

  This story is AU. What would have happened if Voldemort had understood that defeat, not death, conferred mastery of the Elder Wand and did not kill Snape? And what of all the stray Death Eaters that JKR forgot to mention? Like Bella Lestrange's husband?

** Doesn't really fit the subrequirements, but there's this timetravel HarryxSnape fic where Dumbledore gives Snape a Time Turner to save Harry's life, which he does repeatedly over the first six years. Sticks pretty close, Snape still survives the final battle.

*** linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/670548]]), The Boy Who Died A Lot, is what you're talking about, I think. It's rather entertaining.

  Harry's always been known as The Boy Who Lived. Only Severus knows that this is a lie. (Or: a portrait of Severus Snape, in seven acts.)
