:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Around 2011, I read a full length The Deathly Hallows nobel but it was completely fanfiction. (I read it believing that it was the original story and made a fool of myself when I vehemently claimed the same talking to another guy about the same)

Anyway, iirc the story was something like that the trio, Ginny and Draco escape to a far away island and then later discover that Dudley possesses magical blood too and was not taught magic but now Harry is tasked to do so.

It has been a decade since I read it, so the details may be a little incorrect but it was a whole novel of around 600 pages and the escape part and teaching part is correct. If anyone can help me find it, I will be very grateful.

Thanks.


** > Dudley possesses magical blood too

I've read some crazy not_cannon shit, but that right there would 100P ruin a fic for me. Hard no on Dudley having magic.
