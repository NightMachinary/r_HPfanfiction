I want to find a fic where Draco is still in school at the time and he helps the order in some way. He maybe attends the meetings and the other kids are curious cause they are not allowed to. It can be where he feeds them information or maybe is really powerful or really smart and he helps them to take down Voldemort and the Death Eaters. This has been rolling around in my head for a while and I have read some fics with a similar idea but not quite what I'm looking for. Thank you!


** I literally read this so recently and can't exactly remember if I'm right. 85%. Uncharted is the sequel to Continuum where basically Hermione fucks up when they're on their broom (her and Draco) trying to escape the Fiendfyre but instead of getting out they go through a door that takes them to Hogwarts 1944 where they encounter Tom Riddle (Dramione/Tomione - Dramione is endgame) and then they have to figure out how to go back. THE PLOT IS OUT OF THIS WORLD so I can't even begin to explain it BUT in the sequel Draco ends up being the head of the Order trying to create strategies to take down the empire that Tom created after conquering half of Europe after the war. It's really really really really really really amazing. The author is a genius. mayghaen17
