:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Sorry I can't remember anything super specific. This would have been prior to 2014 and possibly a good bit earlier than that.

All I remember is that Snape becomes Harry's guardian and Harry is a first or second year. Someone gives Harry a photo of James and Lily and he keeps it under his pillow. He has nightmares and sometimes says "Dad" in his sleep which Snape takes to be Harry missing James but Minerva points out at some point that Harry is actually asking for Snape.

Harry lands in the hospital wing seriously hurt but I can't remember why. Mrs. Weasley gives Snape something that belonged to Lily.

EDIT: I found it. It's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11726831/1/][Remembering Me]] by Trucklesinthetree


** I know that fic! Mrs. Weasley gives him a sweater that Lily wore and left at the Weasleys at some point. She kept it in stasis after they died and it still smelled of her and Harry remembers her when he smelled it. I also think that the story is a sequel to a one-shot. Lemme see if I can find it, don't remember the name.

EDIT: Found it! I think? I am almost sure this is the one you mean.

*** Okay, this may not be what OP was looking for, but thank you for the great read. I mean, it seems like it drags on for far too long though. I'm on chapter 19 and it seems to be at a point where it could end nicely. Yet there are 64 chapters. Do you know if it's worth finishing?

But I havent encountered a fic that made me both laugh out loud and cry in a pretty long time so I'm happy I read up to this point.

**** I think I read it sometime around 2010, it was actually finished in October 2009, don't know why it says that it got updated in 2016. Maybe some edits to fix spelling or grammar.

But from what I remember from that long ago, I enjoyed it till the end. That being said, I recently tried re-reading another fic that I loved in the late 2000s and found that my tastes were very different back then :D So take that with a grain of salt. Maybe keep reading for a few more chapters to see if it stays interesting for you. For me it did, because Harry's years at Hogwarts go very different from canon and I found it interesting how Snape handles a teenaged Harry. Also can't remember having any issues with the pacing, but again, that could be due to not knowing any better back then.

  One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FIVE MILLION HITS!

*** You know that is definitely the one with the sweater because I am re-reading this right now! However I should have been more specific. The fic I'm thinking of Mrs. Weasley gave him something and she asks "oh were you special to each other" or something like that.

And in Harry's New Home the thing with the photo doesn't happen...I'm pretty sure. I'll have to update once I finish it again.

**** Mhh, ok. That's some coincidence then, that both have such similar stuff happening. I mean, even the hospital wing happens in "Harry's New Home" because he gets attacked by the son of a death eater iirc.
