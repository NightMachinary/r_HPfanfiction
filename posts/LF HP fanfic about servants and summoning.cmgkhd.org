Hey,

I'm looking for a hp fanfic where Harry is summoned to another world as a servant or serves a muggle in his world.

I had no luck looking for one like that apart from the familiar of zero which doesn't really count.

Thanks in advance and have a nice day!


** There's a whole "Ain't never had a friend like me" challenge by Tsume Yuki, where Harry is a genie, with a lamp and all, and found by Naruto. Several authors picked it up that. If you want more just type Tsume Yuki in the search bar and select Naruto.

  Harry had never allowed anyone to have control over him, despite his circumstances, and he wasn't about to start now. However, he has a powerful urge to help that blond boy out, and more than enough magic to spare. So, 'Whatchu wish, I really wanna know' Tsume Yuki Prompt Response. Don't own. Probably Gen. Swearing.

  Willow Potter was starting to realise that she had a talent for tripping into the most absurd situations. After all, what wasn't insane about Death popping up every few minutes, muttering nonsense about "his master," or getting sucked into a lamp, and bound to a 12-year-old Ninja Wannabe who thought she was a magical Genie? Prompt By: Tsume Yuki. FEM!Harry
