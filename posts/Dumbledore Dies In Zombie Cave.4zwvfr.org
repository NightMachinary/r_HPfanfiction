I'm looking for stories where Dumbledore, not Harry, dies in Voldemort's Evil Zombie Cave.

The one with the fake Horcrux.


** /Are/ there any fics where Harry dies in the Evil Zombie Cave?

*** Yes! I read a HP/TMR fic (I'm pretty sure it was a slash fic. The whole thing was kind of weird) where Harry dies in the cave and becomes a zombie himself.

I tried to find it, but the author I thought wrote it definitely did not. It was sort of a dark, angsty romance fic, I think. Now I want to read it again.

**** Was that the one where Harry's zombieness was an issue between them, where Tom tries his hardest to pretend it isn't and it totally is?

That was definitely a weird one. I can't think what possessed me to read it. It's definitely original though, for a Harry Potter fic, maybe that was why.

I can't remember what it was called, sadly.

**** Thanks... I'd be more interested in an exploration of the consequences of such an event for people other than Harry, I think. With Harry devoured by the inferi, would Dumbledore still want to commit Suicide by Snape, or would he try to resurrect Harry before he dies? (Voldemort, by taking Harr's blood, anchors Harry to this world, remember.) Are there non-Dark ways to do that? Or would Dumbledore come up with a different plan, that doesn't involve Harry?

*** To whomever downvoted: I am honestly curious. The OP wrote "where Dumbledore, not Harry dies", which makes it sound like there are many fics where Harry dies, but I don't think I've ever seen a single fic where /either/ of them dies.

** linkffn(A Soulless Solace) has Dumbledore die in the cave. It's unfinished and hasn't been updated for a while, but I remember the scene vividly, and I think it's definitely worth trying!

** I believe it happens in A Cademan Victory, or at least relatively near it, but it isn't from the Inferi.
