Preferably no Harry x Daphne. OCs are welcomed too. Thanks in advance.


** I think it would be like that one I read where he gets in with that ballerina girl, the selwyn grandaughter OC whos parents are in the mafia that are ancient enemies of the Delacours and fluer fights for him. I wish that shit was complete.

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. Story contains more detailed magic, politics, and more. It is a story of growth and maturation.
