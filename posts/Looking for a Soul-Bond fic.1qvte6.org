I have already read bonds of time and meaning of one and i was wondering if there are any fics similar to these.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Soul-Bond-Fics/75918/][This community]] has several.

Darth Marrs wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/The-Bonds-of-Blood][this one]] that's Harry/Ginny.

Also, Perspicacity wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][one]], though it may not be to everyone's tastes. (Among other things, it has a multi-way bond with Harry/Molly/Ginny/Riddle.)
