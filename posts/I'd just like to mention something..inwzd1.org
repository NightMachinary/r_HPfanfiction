It's not at all uncommon for parents to ask questions of their children that they already know the answer to. I point to animals all the time and ask my daugher what it is even though I know damn well it's cat. So it's not a big surprise that Molly Weasley might ask her youngest/only daughter what platform they were going to even though she knew full well. It's how you raise children. It's far more believable than the Weasley conspiracy theory that the first meeting was planned in advance.

It's just, one fanfiction I could write off as a fluke, but there's hundreds that claim Molly asking Ginny the platform number is totally unreasonable? Do people really think that?


** Yeah, back when I was little, my parents kept asking me which direction they should drive to when driving home. I used to think that my parents had short term memory loss, but they were just doing it to keep me sharp and to make sure I know my way home. Sometimes they did it to distract me when I was upset.

**** This is exactly how I feel about it. Talking out loud to yourself as you're passing a bunch of identical brick walls between platforms, since 9-3/4 is just a platform you go to once a year (and the platform number itself really isn't a big deal unless you're Muggleborn). As an adult you have other things and numbers in your head, and it's Ginny that responds not one of the older kids (implying both that Ginny is extremely excited and wants to be included in the journey/destination, and also maybe that the platform number is just a humdrum number to the older kids too).

It's just a good character-building moment.

#+begin_quote
  Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten.At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.

  "-- packed with Muggles, of course--"

  Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry's in front of him -- and they had an owl. Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.

  "Now, what's the platform number?" said the boys' mother.

  "Nine and three-quarters!" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, "Mom, can't I go..."

With babies/toddlers, you can probably just grab tight and apparate or floo successfully, assuming you have a 1:1 baby:grown up ratio. Older kids can likely be trusted to floo on their own, but obviously one grown up shouldn't be bringing more than 1 or 2 kids by side-along for safety reasons.

Then, for Hogwarts, add in all their luggage. With animals and trunks and such, that seems complicated. And, in this case, Molly is the sole grown up for 5 kids, including a 9/10 year old and 2 mischievous twins.... plus all their stuff... yikes.

What you said about cherry picking, if they didn't how would their story work. I rarely see the level of hate on any old AU fic than I do the bashing ones. Personally I like them because I like to see how people can make the light side bad, how they can find small inconsistencies in the original work and interpret them to their own desire. A lot of ideas only work with certain changes. Idk, just confuses me the hate. If you don't like a certain trope or fic type then just don't read it, most fics have bashing in the warnings, and if they don't then maybe msg the author and ask them to put one in.

*** Problem with bashing is not that it makes characters different from the canon (although, it still makes me wonder: if you want to write about different character, why do you use the existent one, not some OC?), but it is usually signal of the bad or missing plot. In 99.9% it just an effort to create some antagonist for the main character(s) and laziness to create your original plot.

Take “A Different Halloween by RobSt“ linkffn(6439871). OK, it is RobSt, so for him the bashing is as natural as breathing for others, but until the middle of the third chapter (when Tom missed the fine print) it is a reasonable story. Yes, ultra-super teeth rotting sweet with the frosted icing on the top, but it made sense if you are for that kind of sugar overload. But then I see RobSt sitting there in front of his computer and swearing “Shoot, I just killed my whole story. There is no plot, dramatic tension, nothing. What will I do?”

What should he do? It seems to me the answer is simple: shut down the computer, take the paper, pen, and sit in the garden and create new plot, new drama, new crisis, everything, and write new outline of the new story. Then, and only then, return to the computer, start completely new story and write (and perhaps salvage some parts of the original story, when needed). Or perhaps just to cut the story there: it would actually work pretty well as a three-chapters short story without much any modification. He took the easy way: bashing. Create completely absurd caricature of Dumbledore and pretend that the story continues.

**** You say that this writer bashes all the time then switch and say they copped out and took a lazy root midstory? Which is it? Do they always do bashing or did they cop out in this story? (Not trying to be rude or anything, just confused) And sure bashing can be seen as an easy plot or cliche, that doesn't make it bad, just makes it that, easy or cliche. Also the point of why not just make a new character, they use the character as a base for their version. Or maybe that is their interpretation of the character with the bad qualities turned up to eleven. Making a whole new character might be what you would want to do but that doesn't mean they want to do it that way. You may see all this as laziness, maybe sometimes it is, but what if that person is lacking in creativity but still wants to give writing a go. I can tell you now my creativity is so shot that no matter how hard I would try whatever stuff I tried to write it would end up looking lazy and cliche because I can't write to save my life. My big thing with all this is not trying to say bashing is good and everyone should do it but to say the hate is not okay. As I've stated before, these are not pro writers, they are people who could have no real skill or experience that are just having fun and trying their best. I actually doubt that many, if any, fanfic writers are actually lazy.

There is lazy and lazy. Certainly not lazy to write hundred thousand words, but lazy to sit down and make that seventh rewrite even they know the story requires it. I know, because I was there many times.

  Books aren't written - they're rewritten. Including your own. It is one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh rewrite hasn't quite done it. (Michael Crichton, alluding to Steele MacKaye (1889) article where he said this about theatre plays)

****** Yeah, a lot of fanfic writers stick to one or two general points. I love this fanfic writer Elvirakitties. She is a bashing writer and a lot of her stories are very similar which means as she switches between them to write and eventually finish she sometimes forgets an important point for a specific story (ie, one story Harry has no scar but later on he does have it and vice versa) I realise it's not everyone's cup of tea but that's how she writes. But most of her stories centre around Harry/(Voldemort, Snape and/or Lucius) and bashing the light. It's what she likes and I happen to like it too so I read them. If I didn't like it I wouldn't read them, simple. The hate is what baffles me...

#+end_quote

When you add that to all of the other inconsistencies, plotholes, and other weird issues? You get a pretty good foundation for an AU fic.

My main issue with that whole thing was why wasn't there someone from the DMLE/Obliviators there to keep watch as hundreds of kids walk through a wall? This is a crowded train station, and Harry could hear Molly? Yeah, the statute of secrecy doesn't need that. Then you have the events there in book2.

There are people that like Harry/Draco, Snape/Hermione, Draco/Hermione, and many others. Then you have the people who paint Snape as the Mother Teresa. Why allow those, but not this one?

** It's mostly just the kind who will latch onto any reason to bash the Weasleys.

They forget what their parents did - I guarantee that nearly any parent will do the same "quiz your kid on something you already know, so you're sure the kid knows it as well".\\
I still remember my parents quizzing me on what was first and last on the grocery list (which was inevitably the vegetable for dinner that night and something to reward me for not complaining, respectively) nearly every time we went grocery shopping.

I think one fanfic author would have forgotten that was a thing (or willfully ignored it for the sake of bashing), and then several others latched onto it because they also disliked the Weasleys and any excuse to bash was a good one.\\
Friendly reminder that people will believe almost anything if it fits their narrative of the world.

** My favorite HC is that every year one family offers to arrive late at KC's screaming (under muggle repealing charm) about the platform number and saying keywords like muggle preferably with an owl in full view to attract the attention of all the muggleborns that for one reason or another didn't yet go to the platform (maybe they didn't know how -like Harry; maybe they were sceptic of running into a solid wall; maybe they were being held up somehow) and help however they can. That year the Weasley's volunteered, nothing more.

** It's more the fact that she yells it out and talks of muggles without any concern at all. Sure she's with her kid but she should still keep to the statute and not pull attention towards herself more than necessary.

I personally don't think it's planned per se but if it was, that part can be used to add credibility but not to prove anything. Several "coincidences" makes you see a pattern.

** I mean I get your point. The suspicious part is saying that /so/ loudly in a place with /tons/ of muggles. That was just stupid, IMO. It's so important not to let muggles know about the Wizarding world but let's loudly shout things about the Wizarding world. Best case a muggle ignores them. Worst case a muggle gets curious and follows the family and watches them disappear into a wall... and promptly freaks the heck out and probably gets admitted into an insane asylum (best case). Worst case they become obsessed and go back to said wall again and again until they get it on video or stumble their way onto the station.

Sure, anti muggle wards exist, but I dunno. It's not canon but I would kinda think anti muggle warding only goes so far (or perhaps some muggles are more easily gullible than others kinda like how some wizards/witches can throw off imperius curse and others cannot) but obviously that's a theory and not canon. Either way molly wealey was probably close to breaking statue of secrecy talking as loudly as she was and whether she was just teaching Ginny or just including Ginny is irrelevant when muggles finding out about magic is so detrimental.

I mean it's just dumb. It was probably just a stupid little plot to get Harry to meet the Weasley's as soon as possible. Like a little, I dunno, “treat” for Harry Potter fans to enjoy “oh look! Harry met the Weasley's BEFORE he was friends with Ron! It's like he was able to go to the train station with his FAMILY because the Weasley's practically adopted Harry (then he married his so called adoptive family's daughter) isn't that so cool?!” Kinda thing. We can all agree JK didn't always make the best moves when it came to Harry Potter but that's where fan fiction comes from (still love the FF I read once where this canon scene played out but Harry already knew about the Wizarding world and thought that Molly was insane for risking the statue of secrecy shouting about the Wizarding world. Pretty sure he ended up flagging her for it but can't quiet remember how, haha)

  Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten.At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.

  "-- packed with Muggles, of course--"

  Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry's in front of him -- and they had an owl.Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.

  "Now, what's the platform number?" said the boys' mother.

  "Nine and three-quarters!" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, "Mom, can't I go..."

I think the ambiguity of wether or not it was premeditated is a, probably unintended, quality of the original story. It left a lot of things in limbo. Just like real life it doesn't give all the answers. Not everything is nicely explained. There isn't allways a neat linear history to deduce.
