**** time to rec a bunch of crossovers lmao. You mentioned "aren't shipping focused," but I'm probably gonna fail and rec something entirely romance based on accident. Oops!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12881601/1/Swords-and-Sorcery-No-Route-Back][Swords and Sorcery]] is a Fate/stay night cross, featuring Shirou being close friends with fem!Harry (Iris). Iris' character is intriguing, and the story itself is very enjoyable.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10793290/1/The-Unrelenting-Frozen-Seas-The-Journey][The Unrelenting Frozen Seas]] is a Percy Jackson crossover, which, while I haven't personally read, looks quite fine. Also apparently there's a PJO fanfic wiki with almost /nine thousand/ entries. [[https://percyjacksonfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Rhode_Evans_(The_Unrelenting_Frozen_Seas][Here is fem!Harry's page if you want it.]])

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11525673/1/Harry-Potter-the-Girl-Who-Lived][Harry Potter & The Girl Who Lived]] - bit trope filled, but it's a fun romp, from what I remember of it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12446118/1/Intersecting-Realities][Intersecting Realities]] - yet another one I haven't read, but the grammar is readable, and premise is fine. Also, 32K word chapters LMAO.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12768475/1/Mistakes-and-Second-Chances][Mistakes and Second Chances]] been a while since I read any of this, but it's garnered a good following. Notably though, this is femslash between fem!Harry and Fleur.

I'll be honest I thought I had a few more, but most of them are either heavy shipping, incest, or just bad. I hope that you enjoy some of these!
