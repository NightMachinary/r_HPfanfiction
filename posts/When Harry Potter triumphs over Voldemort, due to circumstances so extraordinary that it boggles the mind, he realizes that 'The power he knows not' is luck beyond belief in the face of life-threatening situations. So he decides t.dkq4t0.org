** "Right - that's enough hanging around. Time to get to work!" Harry put on an upbeat expression as he stood up, dusted his robes, and strolled off towards the gaping mouth of a newly discovered Egyptian tomb. Behind him, he could hear immediate protests - already being addressed by Bill, who was by now /used/ to the spiel.

"Yes, he's serious. No, it will be fine. Yes, he knows what he's doing..."

You'd think that by now, his reputation would have preceded him - but news traveled slowly abroad. Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, Savior of Magical Britain, the Charmed. Curse-breaking was the perfect occupation for him - after all, whatever he did...

Out of the corner of his gaze, Harry spotted his shoelace - undone. With a sigh, he knelt down to retie it - not even blinking as a nasty looking red glyph activated ahead, sending a twisted black and red bolt right where his head had been.

After this tomb, he'd have to take some time off - maybe go visit Ron and Hermione again. That'd be nice - it'd been a long few months away from home, traveling to and from these new discoveries. But it /did/ allow him to get away from his fame...

As Harry thought of home, he came across a closed, smooth stone door, with a recessed set of dull carved buttons. Casually, without even giving it a second thought, he pulled his wand out and hit a few of them at random. A second passed, and then the thick stone door ground open, a rush of stale air coming to greet him.

--------------

/An hour later/

Harry strode back out of the tomb - to the shock of the international group of curse-breakers, and Bill's muttered 'Told you so', interrupting their work on runic arrays. With a shrug, he tossed out the one item he'd grabbed from the heart of the tomb - at random, of course. "There's more where that came from - all clear and open now." he called out casually. Ahead the researchers swarmed to examine the object - muttering in excited, hushed tones about the ancient magical artifact.

Life, Harry reflected after having requisitioned a glass of water, was certainly rather boring as a tomb raider. Maybe he should consider a career change - something a bit more lively. Hadn't Ron mentioned once that his family had an accountant in it?

** And then he dies in the first ancient tomb because the actual power was the prophecy nudging things to make sure it gets fulfilled, and that stopped working after he killed Voldemort.

*** Death is much like the Death in Final Destination, except instead of killing people, it causes contrived situations that keep Harry alive.

It's not because he's the Master of Death or any of that rot: Harry just amuses it/her and livens up its/her unlife.

Oh, and it's very jealous.

After the fifth, near-fatal freak broom-riding accident (involving a muggle toaster and a chicken) in a row, caution overrode the infamous Weasley Temper and Stubbornness and Ginny decided to call their relationship quits.

**** Harry/Death as an actual pairing is one of my guilty pleasures but it's super hard to find decent fics that have this.

Could someone please write this or link fics that are Harry/Death?
