I'm looking for long, preferably complete fics with not that many requisites. I have read:

HPMOR Significant Digits Prince of Slytherin et all Third Key Alexandra Quick Started Albus Potter and the Global Revelation et all, had trouble staying invested

I especially loved Prince of Slytherin's alternate-reality style of fun. I'd love to see an alternate sorting for Harry or someone that goes through all years, or some other detail that makes for a different experience. Don't really care about pairings. Romance in a story is fine so long as it's done well, but if it's the main point of a fic it's probably not for me.

Any big ones I need to check out?


** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

Very long, scientific oriented alt history fic of how the muggle world reacts to the existence of magic. If you liked the "could we transfigure carbon nanotubes?" stuff from HPMoR you'll like the "let's use magic to duplicate this uranium!" nuclear war storyline in this one.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again.

** I love long fics!

Blindness is usually my go-to recommendation if you haven't read it, that one was astoundingly long but had an incredible system of magic.

Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider is also decently long, and I found the sequel a bit longer of a read as well, but just as good if not better.

Teddy Lupin and the Forest Guard is part of a four part series, each are long, and even though there's a bit of romance, I think it's done well in the sense that realistically, teenagers don't quite know much about romance or love and so Teddy's clearly trying to figure it out as he grows up. It's messy romances (but not very mature since they're kids for most of the series), wholesome friendships, and the kind of magical adventures that made me fall in love with Harry Potter to begin with.

The last one is my personal favourite, but might be the one that least fits the kind of fics you seem to like. The Changeling by annerb is an alternative sorting, but for Ginny Weasley instead, and focuses on her as she becomes quite a different character than from canon. The sequels have quite a bit of romance, but this first fic in the series doesn't have any more than touch and go romances, mostly as Ginny is growing up and then embroiled in the war. I'd still recommend it because it's one of the most immersive fics that has me so invested even as the sequels are slowly updating.

Have fun reading!

  It's been eleven years since Harry Potter brought an end to Voldemort; eleven years of peace, eleven years of recovery.But not every wound can be healed. Teddy Lupin is loved and wanted by his family, adored by his grandfather, welcomed in the extended Weasley clan, and happy that he's about to start at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but he still feels the loss of his parents and the last lingering traces of the war.As he begins his Hogwarts life, he finds connections to his past that he never suspected... and manages a bit of mischief as well!

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.
