  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** There's no loneliness any more in [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][The Meaning of One]]; Harry and Ginny share their minds and senses and memories. I initially thought that the soul-bond premise threatened to be too saccharine, but the author actually did quite a good job of making it two-edged. For example, Mr and Mrs Weasley struggle for a long time with the idea that their ten-year-old daughter is essentially married (since her entire life is shared with Harry now), and it puts a lot of strain on their relationship with both Ginny and Harry. Not to mention that the children have /too much magic/ when they hold hands, putting them in danger of seriously hurting or even killing someone if they lose their temper; they come within a hair's breadth of unintentionally reducing Draco to a pile of ash.

Also, I lied; they can still feel isolated if magic knocks one of them unconscious... (BIG spoiler alert) or petrifies one of them.
