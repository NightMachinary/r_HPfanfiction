Hi, please suggest your best long dramione fics. Also ideally they should be completed or regularly updated.

Many thanks.

Simply Irresistible

Lady of the Lake

The Bracelet

Parenting Class

Bus Stop

** An older comment shamelessly copied from another thread:

linkffn(The Die by colubrina; Rebuilding by colubrina) are two of my absolute favourites. I think colubrina might write the best Draco I've ever read. The Die has an alternate ending, After the Sea, but it's Draco/Hermione/Theo so might not be your cup of tea. Colubrina's got another brilliant Dramione on the go right now, linkffn(The Wrong Strain by colubrina) but if you don't like WIPs you can always wait till she's done.

linkao3(As Certain Dark Things are to be Loved by somuchcloser) is great, but as implied, pretty dark.

linkffn(Broken by inadaze22) is also pretty dark, but excellent as well.

linkffn(The Request by redhead14) has a great plot, and I love watching the way Draco and Hermione grow together despite pretty challenging circumstances!

linkao3(Aurelian by bittyblueeyes) is one of my absolute favourite Dramione+child+mystery-ish fics, I've reread it more times than I could count.

If you're looking for more PWP/pure smut, I have to recommend linkao3(The Grotto by bunney; Ardent Bonds by musyc)!

Some more classics: linkao3(Seven for a Secret by musyc; A Pale and Pointed Mirror by musyc) and the already mentioned Isolation by bex-chan. I couldn't get into The Fallout by everythursday but I know it's a very popular one!

If you're okay with interesting formats, I also really loved linkao3(Letters from Everyone by jadepresley), and if you're okay with weirder fics I really enjoyed linkao3(Mind Pop by riptey). Provocative_envy also writes some great shorter fics, usually non-magical. I would highly recommend linkao3(Universally Speaking by provocative_envy; Bite Marks by provocative_envy).

Also, I know you'd prefer no WIPs, but if you like nontraditional/muggle AUs, linkao3(Ride or Die by olivieblake) is INCREDIBLE!

And, a tiny bit of self promotion - it's a WIP but only another two weeks or so from completion: linkao3(Don't Take This Sinner by hexmionegranger).

PHEW alright I hope that at least gets you started, let me know if you read any and your thoughts!!!
