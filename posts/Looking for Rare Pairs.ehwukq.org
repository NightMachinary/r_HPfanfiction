Your favorite rare pairs in stories? Stories you really enjoyed that had rare pairs?

I'd rather not have character bashing, if possible, since that tends to take me out of the story.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

It can be on any site, not just fanfiction.net.

Can be any ERA.

Can be threesome, pairs, or whatever

*** Most bashing tends to be with either Snape, or Malfoy or on the other side the Weasley's, that's why I said no bashing, because yeah, it tends to take me out of the story.

Characters hating each other is fine, but if a author goes out of the way to bash a character, yes even a bad guy, it just takes me out of it.

** The rarest I've seen is Harry/Fem Harry. And that rarity is because the story usually ends up abandoned.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  When Dumbledore's plans for the Dursleys go awry, he is forced to give young Harry to Kingsley Shacklebolt to raise. Little did he know how this change would mess up everything.(Or, Dumbledore is a manipulative bastard, Kingsley is an awesome parent, and Sirius just wants a happy family.)
