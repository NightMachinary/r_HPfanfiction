:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello ! I am looking for a fic I read on FFnet a while back. From what I remember it was well written and progressed past first year and had a fair number of reviews/favorites/follows.

I'm pretty sure Harry is a Slytherin and has somehow charmed the Slytherin Quidditch team into liking him, as well as getting along with the Weasley twins and Gryffindor Quidditch Team. There is a seventh year female prefect/head girl that Hermione looks up to, and I can't remember her name, potentially Nyssa or I could be making that up. Anyway, the only thing I can remember outside of this scene is that she is very influential in Slytherin despite being a half blood, I think, and she is dark skinned. Her and Marcus Flint often end up working together to protect Harry and Hermione. Dumbledore is also reluctant to expel the boys until Snape gets Amelia Bones involved bc one of the boys casted Crucio on one of the younger years?

The biggest scene I can remember is that Harry is walking to the Great Hall or something and he gets attacked by three upper year Ravenclaw boys who are mad at him for something (I think they/their parents are death eaters or something to that effect) and he usually doesn't walk alone but this time he did. And I remember that the Gryffindor quidditch team was friends with Harry and the Weasley twins saw what was happening and they grabbed the team for backup and then Marcus Flint and maybe the Slytherin Quidditch team (and I think Cedric) tries to help as well and Hermione is able to help Harry, and one of the Slytherin prefects/head girl is proud of Hermione and almost hows her a castrating curse. One of the boys wands gets snapped by Hermione purposefully stepping on it and playing off as being an ignorant muggleborn, just to rub it in their faces. Draco also helps out, and Harry is surprised. It turns into a standoff outside the Great Hall between the Ravenclaws, who have no idea why their house members are being attacked, and literally all of the other houses who are protecting Harry and their own. I believe this takes place in his first few years at Hogwarts, if not his first year.

As you can see I'm pretty fuzzy on some of the details haha and I've word-vomited on this post quite a bit in order to recall all the details, but I'm hoping someone will be able to help me ! I've been trying to find this fic for the past few hours and it's been driving me nuts. Thanks in advance !

  One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FIVE MILLION HITS!
