I don't exactly know why, but i'm craving this crossover which has an experienced, and powerful Harry that helps out.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Honestly I'd love this, but I've spent hours searching for something exactly like this and I've come to find very minimal results.

There are two massive problems however with this

1) Demigods dont live for long, this is cannon especially as they cant use technology and to work you need to use technology (high paying jobs) so... rip. Also they are dyslexic and have ADHD which limits them, which again will limit their life span. After CHB there isnt much to do.

2) This ties in with one, it depends on who is Harry's godly parent, if one of the big three than Harry should not be even alive with the scent he has. If it's not one of the big three, which is very rare than Harry will just be someone who knows about demigods.

Again, I love this idea but i really cannot find any, and those that i Hve found are bad on those two reasons.

Dissapointing since this could be amazing!

*** Yeah. That's what sucks too me. I don't think i've ever read a PJ story period that has the MC be an older, powerful demigod in control of their powers. I want that. I've read so many fics that follow the story that I could probably quote it word-for-word at this point.

**** Yes and I hate it.

It's well written but not for me, I dislike stories with Harry as a younger. It just makes me bored.

** We need more crossovers like that in general. I'm pretty tired of a little kid going to war in the galaxy or whatever.

*** Yeah. I'd actually enjoy crossovers where people from the PJ universe go to another universe. Imagine a fully powered PJ with the achilles curse in the DC universe. He'd be a more powerful Aquaman with the ability to create storms, and earthquakes. Maybe not Superman strong, but still interesting.
