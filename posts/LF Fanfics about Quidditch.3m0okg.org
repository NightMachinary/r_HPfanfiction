** Well there's Hope, by Jeconais. It's mostly a romance but with a heavy emphasis on Quidditch:

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/]]

#+begin_quote
  A man who is lost in his own country. A girl who needs her mate to survive. A tale of Quidditch and romance, of anger and betrayal, of friendship and enmity. A story of the power of hope.

*** I'll offer a second vote for this. It's the only fic I can think of where Quidditch is actually made interesting. A big reason for this is that the Seeker position is given a lot more to do than just catch the snitch. There's... /gasp/... actual strategy that the Seeker has to use to help the team! It almost makes sense!

I'll also confess to just liking the fic in general. I've gotten the impression that many here regard it as an unacceptably cheesy romance, but I enjoyed it. Harry gets too angry about something (which I won't reveal) without sufficient justification and that seriously weakens the story for me, but I try to overlook that.

**** Agreed on pretty much all counts. Honestly it's one of my favorite fics. Very feel good. Will you PM me about the thing that you think he gets too angry about? I'm curious.

** linkffn(7711029)

I don't really remember much about this story, but it's certainly about Quidditch and it's probably decently written.

  From Hogwarts' historic pitch to the famous stadiums of Europe, Harry fights to earn his place amongst the all-time greats. The stakes are high, and sheer talent is never enough. It's more than just a game. A Quidditch story.

** On the same note as /Hope/, both linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb) and Linkffn(After the End) have Quidditch related arcs, though it isn't the major focus of either fic. The latter has the best Quidditch scene I've ever read.

** Harry Potter and the Veela, and A Game of style and brutality are both good and mentioned here. But there is another good hogwarts one. I'm not 100% sure of the title, I think it might be "My Angel". Basically during fourth year the three schools have a quidditch tournament and Harry ends up on the team with Roger Davies. It's mostly a Harry/Fleur romance, but the quidditch is a big focus and it also has some inter-house friendship.
