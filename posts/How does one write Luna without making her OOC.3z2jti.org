It's weird, I know what Luna's personality is like, yet the idea of writing about her in any way feels impossible. She's probably the hardest character to get right. Any ideas?


** You're certainly correct that authors often do a poor job with her character. I had some thoughts [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3xtmhe/luna_as_a_seer_misses_the_point_of_her_character/cy7nvqs][in the Luna-as-seer thread.]].

Use her strangeness as a vehicle to drive growth in the protagonist(s), not to foreshadow or overly complicate plot points. Having a character act strangely just for the sake of being different will bore the reader unless there's an underlying reason: a moral to be learned, a way to test the protagonist's patience, etc.

*** I remember reading your other post and agreeing wholeheartedly. I'm curious what you thoughts and recommendations are if you were to use Luna as a main character, perhaps if the OP or other interested party wanted to write a believable hp/ll ship (of which there aren't many).

**** When the reader is first introduced to Luna in the original series the only things we know about her are from her reputation around school. In these early chapters of OOtP, she tells us practically nothing about herself. Rowling waited around 250K words to bother giving Luna any qualities other than 'extremely strange.'

Too many fanfiction authors overwhelm the reader with /thorough/ descriptions of Luna's personality as soon as she appears in their story. They force her to display her very best qualities /immediately/ and this condemns her to Mary-Sue status. Her extreme oddness is only ever briefly mentioned by writers who are trying to move her to the forefront from her regular place in the background. If Luna is likeable too quickly, then the reader gets bored because the inherent mystery of her character is solved right away.

I think the best way to fix this problem is for the writer to take bold steps to flesh out the rest of her character. If I have to make an OC, then I make a separate document that answers several questions about them. I think the same thing could work for Luna. How do they behave in a crisis? What is their greatest fear/hope? What causes them to grow as a person or, conversely, to stagnate? If the writer puts a lot of effort in their characterizations before the first chapter is written, the reader reaps the rewards.

It would be extremely challenging to draft a believable HP/LL romance. Most of the time it's poorly executed because writers try to pare down Luna's rough edges to make her a better fit for Harry. There are probably several ways to avoid this, but the only way I can think of off the top of my head is to make Luna's oddness an initial turn-off for her potential love interest. Her better qualities that invariably provide the foundation for believable romance - profound empathy, love of her friends, etc - should be prevalent much later.

***** I would agree with most of this. However; I'd argue that if it is going to be a romance, the oddness CANNOT be a turnoff. It should make her something along the lines of endearing yet embarrassing.

Such an important aspect of a person being a turnoff would lead major problems in a relationship. If you can't handle how someone acts regularly, it doesn't matter how much you like/love them, you won't want to marry them.

Endearing yet embarrassing could easily lead to a slow build romance where Harry would avoid her at first because of peer pressure, but every little interaction would bring out more reasons he likes her. Eventually, he would screw peer pressure, ask her to hogsmeade, and they'd live happily ever after once the stories conflict is resolved.

Also, the author will need to address the wrackspurts, at least for their own character profile. As you said, she needs to be fleshed out beforehand since there is a lot of leeway for her character. As a main character of any reasonable length fic, Luna's odd creatures and odd behavior will be questioned. The handling of this would be imperative. Regardless of the ffn authors given (or withheld) reasoning behind them, to change/remove the odd aspects of Luna would immediately make her ooc.

****** I think you're both OOC-ing Harry a bit. Luna is strange, but Harry's not exactly the type to bow to peer pressure. Look at the chemistry Dan and Evanna had in the film. She reminds me in many ways of Dobby, another slightly (incredibly) odd character who Harry didn't understand at first but was patient with where many might not have been, and developed empathy for.

******* True, harry is stubborn, but harry also doesn't like to be talked about. so he may still avoid luna before getting to know her. Note he is uncomfortable around her on the train ride to Hogwarts, another indication that he would avoid her at first. Without a reason like knowing her somewhat, harry won't start to think about ignoring peer pressure. He wouldn't just "not bow to peer pressure" to be contrary

** You can believe in things no one else does without being crazy. You can behave differently than others without being in a separate world. You can use uncommon references for advice and still make sense. you can choose to ignore people bullying you while still being aware of it happening.

Basically, you can make her a social outcast that sticks to her beliefs in spite of peer pressure and bullying to change, without making her act like she's high on every drug at the same time.

But if you want her as a side character, not main, than use her as a marker or mechanism of character or plot growth as others more eloquent than I mentioned, not just because "luna was in the books so she must be in my story too"

*** That is a great luna, but I would argue that isn't the only way to write a great luna. If you choose to use this example, keep in mind that luna's personality doesn't need to be an act or a coping mechanism. she was raised by a very open minded father who believes many odd things. What we get may be what we see, not what we dig to find

** It's kinda like talking to someone who is watching TV and not really listening to you. But they somehow still get the conversation right, or close enough.

It doesn't matter what she is distracted by (the future, fake animals, imaginary friends) but write her as though she isn't exactly always in the moment, and save her lucid moments for big scenes.

I've written her as both "just odd" and as a seeress of sorts, I think the one that makes more sense depends on why you are including her in your story. But the best way is probably to remember her mother died when she was young, her father went crazier than he was before and she believes every word her father says or writes. Therefore she thinks she's the normal one and everyone else is just a bit off. Why would she change who she is if she's the one that is right?

She is intelligent, she is odd, and most of what she says could be imagined as being a conspiratorial whisper.

This. Fics that have a memorable luna keep her 100% lucidity to a minimum. Stages of Hope (see other post in this thread) does this very well. Luna can shift from mostly gone to mostly there, but only when it's absolutely necessary should she leave her animals and theories behind. Some fics it won't be needed. If you do need it, be sure to have laid groundwork for her to breach into the "real world", or for her to return to her "normal" ways

** Personally, I think it's better to go about writing Luna from others' perspectives. To that end, the best I've ever seen is /Faith and Understanding./ The writer wisely keeps the story mostly "Missing Moments," and we basically see Luna just be herself, through the lens of her friendship with Ginny.

** i think in cannon her strangeness is meant as a distraction and her only real personality is that she's a nice girl. since there isn't much in the books people can do whatever they like i suppose. i prefer it explained away as grief over her mother rather than her being a seer, which are the two things i usually see.

** You can keep her as a girl who believes in hitherto undiscovered magical creatures and conspiracies - in short, an eccentric. If you don't use her POV, you don't even have to decide whether or not she's correct, a seer, or delusional.
