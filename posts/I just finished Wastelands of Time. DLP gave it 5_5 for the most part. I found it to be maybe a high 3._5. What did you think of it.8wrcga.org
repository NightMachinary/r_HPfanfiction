** I remember when this story was still being actively updated, and it was a lot different than anything else that was out there. That being said, the first time I read the story, I couldn't even read all the published chapters. It has it's moments. It got some chapters I enjoy a ton (such as the vatican basement scene) while others just go on and on. My issue is kinda the issue I have with all of Joe's fics, where he doesn't really write the MC as Harry, he writes it as himself. No offense to him really, since it works out decently in a lot of his work, but after a point, it all feels the same. And it feels kinda outdated these days, since it follows the quintessentially ye olde DLP formula of massive fight scenes, epic magic, Harry getting the hot chick, a bad ass Dumbledore, questionable dark magic, and a more sinister Voldemort.

*** The last part is what ruined the story for me. Massive fight scenes with epic magic wielded by Harry just isn't Harry Potter IMO.

** Back in 2008, when it came out, it was an excellent fic. After 10 years worth of fanfiction following it, its understandable it doesn't hold up as well. It's sitting at 4.5 on DLP right now.

** When I first came across it it took me on a rollercoaster binge-read session that I absolutely adored. Upon attempting to re-read more recently, it struggled to hold my interest in the same way. I'm unsure if that's due to myself or the writing, to be honest. If it /is/ the writing, my theory is that I got hooked on its breadcrumb trail of cool, new ideas the first time around enough to blind me to any flaws. Upon re-reading, the ideas are no longer new and more is needed to keep me going. This was definitely the case with JBern's work - I'm not actually particularly a fan of his writing style or his approach to social/relationship stuff, but the first time around I could happily ignore those things to bask in the action scenes and the cool cursebreaking stuff.

I do plan to give it another shot at some point, in case I just had an off day. But I suspect you might be right with your 3.*/5 rating.

** For fics that are a decade old, it's good. Didn't age too well, but not many do.

** I dropped it a few chapters in because that iteration of Harry wasn't my cup of tea and I didn't find the general concept very intriguing. The technical side was not bad, but since the plot did not catch my attention, I'd give it maybe a 1/5.

*** If Wastelands of Time is 1/5, then to rate majority of FFN fics we'd have to go into fractions.

**** Yes, and no. I mean, let's be honest here, most fanfics have glaring issues. I went through the first two pages of FFN sorted by "updated" and the only decent one there was "Lady Thief" by Starfox. I am not a huge fan of it, but it's alright and I'd rate it better than "Wastelands". About a third wasn't even properly tagged and the only way I'd click on any of the others would be by accident. All of those would simply be 0/5.

And I am a lot more forgiving for flaws if the plot is interesting, but Wastelands was not very enrapturing for me. The description was too esoteric IMO and it did not get better from there on.

GG Reddit, never change.

****** Yup. Got downvoted to hell in the survey thread when someone asked how people can consider the movies canon because there are some supposed contradictions and I answered that question with "I find the Weasleys boring and didn't mind Hermione getting some of their lines." Someone then asked why I hated the Weasleys and Ron in particular and I replied that I simply find them boring and unrelateble. You can guess how that went over.
