So I was reading a HP Fanfiction where Harry went into hiding in Non-Magical Britain and choose the alias James Black. While reading this i'm wondering why the writer did not simply use the name of the actor, Daniel RadCliffe?


** Because it's a fast way to break immersion. I wouldn't continue a fic doing that

** Because Harry would have no real reason for picking that name. James Black is just his middle name and Sirius' last name, so it makes sense as to how he would pick it. Picking Daniel Radcliffe would just be seen as the author making a lame reference.

** It's lazy, it's pandering, breaks immersion.

I'm surprised that we don't see more of it.

** I guess the better question to ask is why should the author choose the actor's name? I can think of a couple good reasons not to, but not a single good reason why an author would.

** Well, for one, a lot of fans don't actually picture the characters as the movies portrayed them.

*** They were all perfectly cast for Philosophers Stone and Chamber of Secrets. Then puberty hit and combined with makeup artists they no longer matched my vision of the characters.

** Yeah, any fic that does that is terrible by default, and I would close it immediately.

** Y not use 'Why' instead of weird abbreviations in your titles? The actual question has already been answered, but I felt like this one also needed to be addressed.

** Also, at least on FFN, it might be a violation of ToS (don't remember for sure) to use actual real people in your fanfic. Why pour gasoline on a stack of paper?

*** From what I can see from reading through FFN's ToS, they don't explicitly say anything about not using real people. However, they do say that

If you go to the Community Guidelines, it gives the following list

#+begin_quote
  Entries not allowed:

  1. Non-stories: lists, bloopers, polls, previews, challenges, author notes, and etc.

  2. One or two liners.

  3. MST: comments inserted in between the flow of a copied story.

  4. Stories with non-historical and non-fictional characters: actors, musicians, and etc.

  5. Any form of interactive entry: choose your adventure, second person/you based, Q&As, and etc.

  6. Chat/script format and keyboard dialogue based entries.
#+end_quote

Use of real people would fall under item 4 and would not be allowed, though I think it could potentially be possible to argue that you are using them in the historical sense of them having in the past been the actor/actress for the character, and have it as an Easter Egg. I wouldn't try it. Though I think it's kinda asshole-y that they buried it that far. Plus the guidelines haven't been updated since Nov 2008.

Interestingly enough, Bungle in the Jungle and Turn Me Loose fall afoul of item 5.

**** As I understand it, the second person thing has something to do with underage readers being "inserted" into certain situations, but don't quote me on that.
