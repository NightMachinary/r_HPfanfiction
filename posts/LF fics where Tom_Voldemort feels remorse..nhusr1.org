The classic Redemption, or not...

Give me all the recs you're got. (Wow, that rhymes!)


** Basically the only proper redemption fic I've been able to find: linkao3(Seven Devils)

Linkffn(Imposter Complex) Also appears to be headed in that direction.

  “Are you implying that I am responsible for Voldemort's actions?” Dumbledore's voice had finally turned cold.“No, I'm saying you're responsible for neglecting a young boy! You treated him with nothing but suspicion and coldness, and when he grew up suspicious and cold you took that as confirmation that you were always right about him.”“I assume you have a reason for laying these heavy charges at my feet,” said Dumbledore quietly.She sighed. “I just think... maybe you should take your own advice and try to solve this problem with love, not destruction. You don't have to destroy a Horcrux. You can heal it.”“You speak of remorse,” Dumbledore didn't sound impressed. “If I may, I see very little chance of convincing Voldemort to feel empathy for the things he has done --”“Not Voldemort,” she interrupted. “Tom.”“You are suggesting that we use Voldemort's first Horcrux to reanimate sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle.” Dumbledore's tone left much to be desired.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

** I wrote one that goes in-depth into the remorse-as-undoing Horcruxes thing, but it's ambiguous as to whether it's redemption. What do you mean by "redemption, or not?" That's a very interesting turn of phrase! :)

*** Do you mind linking your work? I would love to read it!

Also, let me clarify. In my head, when it comes to healing Voldemort, remorse ≠ full-on redemption. 1. It takes time. 2. Just because his Soul would be whole doesn't necessarily mean he wouldn't keep making mistakes - he'd also have to deal with the aftermath of well...everything. I'm looking for fics that explore these angles.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21211352/chapters/50496953][Custodarium]] comes to mind. It's Tom/Harry but I like it in that it's not the usual Harry becomes a murderer and is perfectly pliant under Tom's influence. I'd recommend even if it's not a ship you usually read.

** linkao3(saviour complex by reneehart) . To my greatest sorrow this is incomplete but I had to recommend it because it's such a good take on your request, even if it does come from left field and is probably not what you were expecting. To me it's one of the only plausible ways I could see Voldemort feeling remorse.

  An unexpected twist during the final battle has Harry trapped inside a magical artifact with only his greatest enemy for company. The Carcerem will release them, but the requirement for freedom is an impossible one, for neither Harry Potter nor Tom Riddle will ever forgive the other. --- Spanish Translation (Thank you DraInu!) can be found here.
