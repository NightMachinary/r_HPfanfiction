:END:
In this fanfic, Harry goes down to Snape's office in a huff all pissed off because he exposed Lupin. Snape lets him rant and rave and then he lays down the facts.

Snape tells Harry that Lupin is a werewolf, so in many ways he acts like a pack wolf. Wolves' first loyalty is to their alpha and their pack ALWAYS - even over Harry himself. So Lupin - allegedly a close friend of James Potter - let James Potter's son be exposed to danger out of loyalty to his pack mate Sirius. There was no loyalty to Harry. There was no loyalty to Dumbledore. There was no loyalty to JAMES. If they had been right about Sirius and Lupin remained in place, Harry would have been dead (or infected).

I found out about this fanfic from an answer on Quora, but the OA doesn't remember the name or the author of the fic.

EDIT: The Quora user replied to my comment and told me the fanfiction is called “Why?” on FanFiction.net.

Thank you guys so much for the help!

** Tbh the whole not telling anyone about sirius's animagus form, only telling Harry that he is a friend of his father because he has to, and never sending Harry a single letter afterwards should prove pretty simple overall that Lupin is not loyal to Harry (and commitment issues with Tonks)

Would want to read this story too tbh, though i am curius about what the in-story reason is for Harry going to Snape and actually expecting a response. And for Snape actually telling Harry instead of giving him detention for beeing a dunderhead.

(And is Snape right about Lupin, and not just lying to punish the marauders?)

*** I always hated Remus even in the books. I thought him a pathetic coward who would rather blame his issues on his disabilities than actually own up to his mistakes.

1) He allowed his friends to let him out of the Shrieking Shack as a wolf. He could've forbid it or gone to a teacher as a kid but instead he let them release him every full moon

2) He allowed his friends to accompany his as a wolf (at a time when he didn't have Wolfsbane I believe). Even if his friends were stubborn gits he shouldn't have allowed them to accompany him as animagi. They were young, what if they slipped? Also just cause animagi can't become werewolves doesn't mean they can't get injured.

3) James Potter risked his life to spend time with you every full moon and then you practically ignore his son? He didn't even tell Harry he knew until it slipped out accidentally. What a shit friend. I would check up on my friends orphaned kid even if I hadn't spoken to that friend in years. And I would send them whatever pictures and share every story I could.

4) He never told anyone about the animagi forms. He thought Sirius was after Harry, he should've told. Despite my love for Sirius, at the time he was thought to be a mass murderer! Like really?

5) I never forgave him for that crap he spewed to Harry when he confiscated the map. I can't remember exactly but I think it had something to do with dishonoring his parents or something. Lupin has no right to bring that up to Harry, and it was a very very low blow.

6) This man is obsessed with his “condition” and how it holds him back yet he forgets to drink his potion on the night of a full moon? Completely irresponsible. You could literally have a house elf remind you. He's a teacher, and a deadly beast. That kind of slip in unacceptable.

7) He resigned like a coward, he didn't even search for Harry to say good bye, Harry found him.

8) He bonded with Harry but didn't bother to keep in touch and provide advice during the Triwizard Fiasco? He was a DADA teacher. He should have and could have helped. Sirius are rats to help Harry.

9) What sort of teacher makes 13 year olds face their greatest fear in front of all their classmates? It's humiliating and incredibly invasive to show ones innermost fears like that. I never approved.

10) Harry kept calling him Lupin in books 5 and 6, and that says it all to me. I think he switched to Remus in book 7 but still.

11) Lets be real the age difference with Tonks is significant. But that can be excused because they were both adults. What can't be excused is a coward running away from his pregnant wife. He thought his kid may be born with a disability and instead of helping his wife he decided to run away and play father to a boy he ignored for 13 years, a boy he barely knew.

12) Notice the only time he tried to help Harry after book 3 was when he wanted to escape his marriage. Selfish bastard.

13) Did he ever defend Sirius from Molly? I don't recall.

14) I also hate his overall character. I assume Lycanthropy was a thinly veiled metaphor for AIDS. There is a massive difference though. Lycanthropy only affects you a few days each month. He could have easily held a job in the muggle world or even worked part time in the WW.

Anyway to stop there since it's 3AM. I genuinely hate him and the only flaw I don't blame him for is not controlling his friends. Because I understand peer pressure so I don't blame him for that. I do blame him for all the above and for his complete avoidance of his friends son

*** In canon none of the professors (Mcgonagall, Flitwick, or Hagrid) tell many stories about Harry's Parents even after they hear that he was told that his parents were drunks and died in a car crash. So even Lupin's conduct is not so surprising.

And I think all of their conduct is what helps create the justification of the manipulative Dumbledore trope. Eg why do none of them tell Harry more about his parents then he looks like james with lily's eyes and they were good in transformation and charms? So those stories take the story arc that Dumbledore tells them not to talk to Harry about Harry's parents.

And with Snape's behavior up to that point I'm not sure why Harry would even listen to Snape at all let alone believe any explanation that Snape gives.

And Lupin not telling about Sirius' animagus form is easily explained by two words "plot reasons". If he had told then Sirius wouldn't have escaped and you wouldn't have had the third book.

***** It happens. The colors for "Prompt" and "What's That Fic" tags are very similar, not to mention if you have subreddit-style off it's barely visible at all.
