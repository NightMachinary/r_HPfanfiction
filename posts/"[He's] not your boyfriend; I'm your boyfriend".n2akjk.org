So, I came across this clip on YouTube where Lola Bunny basically uses reverse psychology on Bugs to get the poor sod to admit he's her boyfriend.

I dunno why, but I'm imagining Harry as Bugs and maybe Katie, Lavender, or a dopey Daphne pulling this trick on him in the Great Hall.

For added context, here's a highlight of Lola's characterization (creatively post-Space Jam, where she was more mature/serious... huh, maybe that could apply to Harry's girlfriend when she's older, and the post-Space Jam Lola-like characterization as her when she's young/in Hogwarts).

Snape haven't to try to (covertly) protect Harry because Daphne is a walking disaster area (e.g. Lola with the tanker truck/Daphne in Potions) would be hilarious and amusingly torturous to him.


** So that's how harry/ginny and romione came to be... I always wondered.

*** For that to work in this scenario, Harry/Hermione would have to be emotionally attached/attracted enough to Ginny/Ron in order to say what Bugs says, so you've just made a pro canon ship post
