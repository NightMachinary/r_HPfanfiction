*So I was wondering how this ball of yarn can be spun, preferably without giving birth to another Merlin. Just one Flower Wanker was enough. Here's my take, and you know how it goes. I showed you mine, you show me yours. :p*

School really didn't prepare you for life, thought Gilderoy as he watched scenery pass by in the window of Hogwarts Express. His last ride. With the seventh year over, he'd be on his own. He'd not been the best student, sure, but even then he expected something more. Even running a muggle repair shop would be an alright occupation he supposed, but it would only take one muggle wandering in with a mobile phone, and Gilderoy would be in Azkaban for breaking the Statute of Secrecy. Even if he created a specifically warded room to abuse basic charms in, it would just lead to the Ministry detecting an unusual amount of magic in a muggle neighbourhood (because such a place would need to be in a place with a large client base to be profitable) and then someone else would steal the idea, while he would be fined.

No, he could not make his fortune by using magic for muggles, and he could not make his fortune by selling magic to wizards. As a muggleborn he'd have trouble landing a job if there was even a single qualified candidate of proper blood status.... And he was not sure he'd have stamina to cast spells all day. But what if he didn't actually cast any spells? There were other things that he learned at Hogwarts, were there not?

He was first visited by Aurors a month after the "Naming a Nundu" was published. It told a story of a daring explorer and adventurer, Gilderoy Lockhart, who in his travels across the continent of Zebrica came across a village harassed by Nundu - a large, magical cat with disease breath and a taste for cattle. Approached for help by desperate villagers, Gilderoy led a hunting party to kill or drive off the beast, one of the most ferocious in the world. Swift! Brutal! Capable of killing hundreds with a single graze! The tension was high as the hunters found the cat. What followed was one of the best fight scenes the critics had seen in years - and a surprising ending. Apparently, the big cat was trying to feed it's cub, born barely a few days previous. Now that it was dead, the villagers decided to adopt the small one and Gilderoy, as one whocontributed the most and ensured that no one died, was allowed to name it. Following that was a rather generic ending, with the hero setting out once again into the world. Generic, but excellent for the purposes of a long series.

The book had been a big success, and that led to the visit by the Aurors. After all, the nundu was taken straight from his Hogwarts texts, and Gilderoy made no effort to conceal that the main character had been a wizard. It took quite a bit of fast talking about the book being actually good for Secrecy - since it was marked as fiction, if a muggle were to hear anything about magic, wizards or Nundu... They would assume someone was taling about a story. Gilderoy was not sure how that spiralled out of control, but it did.

Sales were great, but soon grew beyond his ability to manage, but by then he had enough funds to hire the services of a Gringotts goblin. Unorthodox, but since the goblin was paid a percentage of the profit, it worked well enough. Never try to get between a goblin and his payday, folks!

â€‹

Anyway, it only took one moment of inattention, and he'd signed a distribution contract with Flourish and Blott's... His books, meant for muggles, appreared in a wizarding bookstore. And they did not put the books in the fiction section, nor were the books marked... And what's worse, people read his books. They liked them. They believed.

And just like that, the British Wizarding World had a new hero. (Why me?) Gilderoy was not happy, not at all. But heroes sold, and his goblin would not be cheated out of gold.
