They are /all/ impulsive (teenagers!), though on varying levels. I'd put my money on Ron because at least he doesn't set people on fire. Thoughts?


** Hermione. She doesn't set people on fire just off the cuff, she /decides/ to set people on fire after carefully considering it very quickly.

Really? Were other options worse than setting on fire a human? What was her next one? Crucio? Or just make some noise without endangering anyone?

**** I think people do tend exaggerate the fire a bit. She specifically used Bluebell Flames. Bluebell Flames are not particularly dangerous in canon-the flame is safe to hold, so the danger to Snape was simply superficial.

** The best example of this is the Sirius vision in OOTP. Who was yelling about getting to the Ministry ASAP? Harry.

Who wanted to make sure that it wasn't a trap? Hermione.

Who was to scared to take a position? Ron.

** I'd still say Hermione. She can be impulsive, but she does at least tend to think things through (most of the time). Ron and Harry are more inclined to do stuff without thinking.

***** I can see the big deal with his DH and GoF outbursts, but the thing with Scabbers in PoA? I think it's understandable. It was his beloved pet's life on the line (as far as he was concerned) and Hermione was being irresponsible about the whole affair.

****** His beloved pet, for which he didn't even have a cage (and transfiguration is a thing) while it was an unsanctioned animal and the prey for two official pets. Bringing Scrabbers to Hogwarts was a stupid decision, allowing him to roam freely was a stupid thing to do and Crookshanks was definitely not the only cat who'd eat him.

I can see how much Ron cared about his rat from that alone. And, lets not forget that he never apologised for wrongly giving Hermione shit the entire year.

***** He was 14 in GoF. It took him a while to figure out that Harry had been shanghai'd into something seriously dangerous (as opposed to getting the exciting adventure dropped in his lap like every single year).

And in PoA, he was entirely correct about Crookshanks trying to kill his beloved family pet. Said pet being a disguised traitor came as a shock to literally everyone except Sirius Black.

********* She denied it purely on the emotional denial. There was no objective reason to believe it. She was right in the same sense that she was "right" about the halfblood prince. (She was so proud of that)

No she was wrong that cat was hunting that rat the whole year. And by denying that her predatory cat tried to eat another persons animal she created the rift. She would have been wise to use her brain but no she lets her emotions run her decisions.

** I'd say Goyle, Crabbe resorted to using Fiendfyre despite not being able to control it

Draco did a lot of quite stupid things over the series like "You'll be next Mudbloods!", which while quite humorous it's probably the worst thing you can say when there's blood on the wall saying Enemies of the Heir beware.

So yeah I don't really remember Goyle doing anything that impulsive. So Greg's my choice.

Also before anyone says they aren't the trio, they were the trio before Harry and Ron even befriended Hermione. On the train.

*** My favorite moment of him was after the events of OotP when he gave that amazing monologue about teamwork and believing in each other. That really pulled on my heartstrings.

I still can't believe JKR just killed him off in the last two lines of the epilogue. He was such a great friend to everyone. RIP Mr. Poopy Butthole. What a sham: "All was well. Except Mr. Poopy Butthole: He's dead." What was she thinking?
