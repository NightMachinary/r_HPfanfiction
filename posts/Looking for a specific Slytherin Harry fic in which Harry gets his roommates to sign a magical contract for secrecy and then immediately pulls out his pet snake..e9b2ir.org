  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

*** Linkffn(Again and Again by Athy) might work. Or it might not. If it's on FanFiction.Net you do “linkffn”, if on Ao3 it's “linkao3” with the parenthesis around the name, with author if you know it.

**** I completely get that, it usually bothers me too, but honestly this is one of the only ones I've ever read where there's a logical backstory and character development that eventually turn canon Harry and canon Voldemort into two people I can actually see getting together.

** Might it be linkffn(11762850)? There's a scene kinda like what you described, although the snake was actually conjured with serpensortia, rather than being Harry's pet, and while I can't remember whether Harry makes his roommates sign a contract, he's very interested in magical contacts in general, and he definitely makes it very clear that they aren't to tell anybody that he's a parselmouth.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

*** It was Again and Again, sorry, I forgot to say when I found it. I see someone here also got it, though I was just rereading the entire fic. I'll look into that on too, though.
