As the title states.

I've had an idea for a fic brewing for a long time now. It needs a LOT of fleshing out, but the very core idea is to make those cute hats witches and wizards so enjoy functional. Hair has magical properties and very young magical folk cannot learn to control their abilities without wearing it up/short and in a hat (the original books called for hats as part of the uniform). Fully developed magicals end up with a personal preference for how they like their hair and head to feel, Dumbledore for instance likes to have long hair to preserve his early childlike whimsy but cover the top with a hat to add some mature focus, McGonagall has long hair bound up inside a hat like a child because she likes strict focus, Rowena Ravenclaw way back in the day liked to be totally unshielded AND add a crown to further amplify... and so on. Hair color and texture/behavior will factor in also, with some Pureblood lines having dominant genes for particular hair-related magic: the Weasleys having an affinity for fire magic, the Potters for “wild magic” (about the sticking up everywhere rather than the color), the Malfoys for soul magic, the Blacks for Dark magic, etc.

Obviously there will be much much much more to the completed fic, but that's the little idea that has stuck with me for years. I've never seen anything like it done before, maybe the occasional mention of Hermione's hair standing on end from static charge when she's channeling a lot of magic or something, that's it.

Is this a dumb idea? If it's not, is there a good resource site to get started (I haven't read the originals in ages)? Where can I get feedback as I develop the core ideas and plot? I might discard using any of the canon characters at all and set it back in history instead, for example, and I'd love to chat with people as I work that stuff out.


** Read a lot by good writers and try to emulate them. Don't get discouraged, you're going to suck right off the bat that's how everyone starts very few people first put pen paper and find that they're f****** amazing. Try to focus on your basics good grammar proper paragraphs and spacing and know that the first thing you write is probably not going to be the first thing that goes on the internet.

**** It's not a bad idea. It's not my reading preference but just in general magic having it's qualities come out in physical characteristics is a good idea.

I would say that it works better as a world building thing rather than the core point of the story though.

Yes, I understand that lol, although I am planning to make the hair-concept very important to the main character(s) and plot, rather like creature fics and whatnot. Thank you for the feedback!

** Your idea seems pretty unique to me!

My initial thoughts: Be careful on “balancing.” How much does the affinity for types of magic affect the overall magic of the person? Does this affect some of the laws in the wizarding world? Does this create new classes of people who are looked down on? Does this elevate some families? How does hair affect the adults (can someone with black hair have an equal affinity/strength in fire as a red head?)? How does aging affect your magic? What happens to metamorphs? Does having curls impact your magic? Haircuts (like mohawks)?

Put a LOT of thought into this. Maybe answer all of these questions, and ask yourself more. This is a super unique idea IMO, and could elevate an otherwise mediocre story.

Wish you future success :)

*** Thank you so much for asking those questions!!! I am copying them over into Notepad and working on answering each right now. Some I had considered already, like the haircuts, but others are totally new, like I had not thought of how Metamorphaguses would factor in!

** This could go two ways:

1. “magical research paper” oneshot on this topic: basically what you have written here, slightly embellished and elaborated upon. If you want something longer, than

2. you need real story with a hero [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][going from A to B]]. This is just [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/dudley-has-a-witch-as-a-daughter.html][a tiny funny idea]], not a plot. And even if you try this, write it short, don't plan a novel.

Consider this joke:

#+begin_quote
  A man once asked Mozart how to write a symphony. Mozart told him to study at the conservatory for six or eight years, then apprentice with a composer for four or five more years, then begin writing a few sonatas, pieces for string quartets, piano concertos, etc. and in another four or five years he would be ready to try a full symphony. The man said, “But Mozart, didn't you write a symphony at age eight?” Mozart replied, “Yes, but I didn't have to ask how.”

*** I have written it before as one-shots (my first try was just Hermione Granger alone on Christmas Morning at age 9 before knowing she was a witch, figuring out she could do wandless magic to see inside the wrapped presents if she jammed her hair up into a Santa hat) and that is how I ended up deciding I would like to make it a full-length fic, I'm never satisfied with the short versions! Although I had not considered writing it as a magical research paper, that might actually have done the trick lol.

I understand that it's only an idea, not a plot.

Thank you for your response!!!

**** I love the idea of Hermione‘s hair being important. Maybe it's so bushy because she has a ton of magical potential, or because she's so unrestrained with her approach to learning magic. I wonder how her school mates will react to it. And the teachers.

Will Muggleborns have any serious consequences to not knowing about this? I can't wait to see the culture clash! Big hair was The Thing in the 80s and very early 90s, so I wonder how that'll play into it, or if it will at all.

What about Black students with their protective hairstyles? Come to think of it, if you aren't Black you should find a Black collab writer because Black hair works much much differently from white people's. The care of it, the cultural meaning of it and styles. Especially locs and braids have a lot of meaning. It would be interesting to see how this plays out against the very white backdrop of an elitist school in a pureblood-dominated world. It's just really important to do it right. :) If you're going to do anything with Mrs. Zabini you should definitely absolutely have a Black collab. Black students seem rare enough in canon that there's an excellent chance for some plot friction there. Do they have additional classes? A mentor system? Are they mocked? In a hair-based magic system, are their hairstyles more controlled by the authorities in the school? The first question comes up in the real world with regards to cosmetology school, and the latter two already come up in all schools. I can't imagine how much bigger a deal it would be in a world where hair is so integral to magic!

Ohhhhh I wonder how this will tie into Voldemort's resurrection with him being completely bald - not even any eyelashes! Would people be less afraid of him? Or maybe they would be even more terrified because he's so very powerful without a single strand of hair on him? Maybe he did it intentionally as a power move!

***** OMG thanks so much, all excellent aspects to consider. The whole idea came from noticing how often Hermione's unruly hair becomes manageable as a sign of her coming of age/becoming mature.

I hadn't thought much about black hair, it's still hair after all, but I had put a good deal of thought into how cultural headcovering would work in this context (hijabs and the like), even going as far as to consider setting the fic in India, where Hindu, Sikhs, and Muslims live side by side with very different hair/head covering practices, but I discarded that because I am American and have not even visited India in person, it would just be too much research to probably still end up with a mediocre result.

Re: Voldemort, inspired by Buddhist monks who shave bald, being totally hairless is actually a sign of his intense power. He is not restrained to any area of magic, he does not have to prepare in any way before performing powerful works.

****** Hair is hair, but Black hair acts much differently and needs much different care. If Black hair was washed as often as white hair it would become brittle and strands would start breaking. It needs to be moisturized and washed once a day. Locs and braids especially have a lot of cultural significance (at least here in the States) whereas they don't have that meaning for white people. There's a lot more but that's a lot of education I don't think you're looking for atm. The point is that there's a lot more than it just being hair, and you'd be doing the subject a huge disservice, as well as any potential Black readers, by treating Black hair as just hair. :)

I love that Hermione's hair is where you got the idea! I could absolutely see that happening. :D

Oh the part about Voldemort. I love that. :D

******* I actually know a fair amount about black hair care due to following the curly hair subreddit for years :) as well as protective styling. After working on the idea all morning I think I am probably going to set the fic in 1800s England and there probably will not be many or any black characters present. Perhaps I will create an exception though, or have the main characters visit other counties (I'm thinking Egypt, Easstern Russia, and India) so I can show some concepts of how the hair element of magic would work in other cultures. You've given me a lot to think about, thanks again!

** If you want lots of positive, empty reviews and followers, write the generic tropes and you'll have a temporarily popular, if after quickly forgotten, story. If you want something unique that people will remember, enjoy, and talk about, avoid writing or plain old subvert the tropes.

Character depth is key. If you have money to spare, I highly recommend books written by Nancy Kress about plot, setting, characterization, and the like (Dynamic Characters is a favourite of mine, personally).

Write flawed, very human characters, not caricatures.

If your story organically outgrows the outline, don't try to force it back on track: an infamous example is the HP books themselves, with JKR on the last few books.

Remember, you're not a puppeteer with the characters being marionettes on strings, but someone who's trying to herd a group of cats from A, to B, to C, to D, et cetera. They'll go off wandering on their own and exploring and the like.
