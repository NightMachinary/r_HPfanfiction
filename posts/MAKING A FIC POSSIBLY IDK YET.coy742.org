Ok so i found this idea for a fanfic from discord where after natural disasters, newborn babies (possibly including Harry) appear at the sites of the storms

So then i had the great idea to have the babies have abilities according to the disaster that happened. So a baby appearing at a thunder storm could possibly use lightning in ways other's couldn't or a baby found after an inferno could maybe have powers with using fire or being able to control fiend fyre easily at like 15 years old or something, you get the idea

Also maybe animagus forms could somehow translate to that. Using the same examples as before would have a thunderbird and a phoenix

Yes i know animagus forms can't normally be magical so maybe that could be a side effect of being storm born... idk yet but please comment and give me ideas that could maybe fit this idea

Oh and for the pairing it would probably be either Haphne or Harmony (Harry/Daphne and Harry/Hermione)

Still don't know how i would go about making a fanfic... it would be on fanfiction.net though, maybe you can tell me about that too

Thanks!


** That discord idea got ripped form the top post on [[/r/writingprompts][r/writingprompts]] a few days ago

*** Still would like your opinion on if i wrote the fic, what would you think of it? Would you read it? Would you like it?

I would also add some of my own ideas and some ideas i may have seen and improved on but yeah

Thanks if you do tell me your opinion

** I think it's a great idea. Harry should obviously be with lightning or Thunderbird. But the problem is having a power scale. What can overpower lightning completely? The key to having elemental ppl in fics is not to make them exclusive, just work better for some than others. It should give the characters a constant drive to improve in their weaker elements and not make them useless in a fight.

*** Yes i agree with that, im right now readibg a fic called ‚Äùthe rune stone path‚Äù And damn it made harry so op with runes and so useless with anything else like he was utterly useless in fighting (although it was a true chimera) without his runes, but on the flipside he has a rune that makes a 3 meter wide and high ball of energy that destroys anything in it's path.

Okay i was rambling there it's a good fic but harry is useless without his runes and that's not what i intended to make of it and i didn't want to copy the start of ‚Äùthe lightning lord‚Äù but more like take inspiration from it with a phoenix... idk why but i like phoenixes...phoenixs????idk but yeah if i took the start like in ‚Äùthe lightning lord‚Äù i wouldn't have much space to make anything too interesting except for a few things... but that would need to be after like atleast two years at hogwarts... idk it might become too much like the general OP harry stories ehhh

So to clear things up in the start of the lightning lord harry is going to get beat up by vernon but then a thunder bird destroys the roof with a bolt of lightning and takes harry to potter manor where he trains with his many times grand grandfathers ghost... and the thubderbird so harry has the same abilities as a thunderbird... in human form. But yeah thats the start of lightning lord and i don't have many ideas on ehat to do at potter manor other than train or to just skip the whole thing to like harry's birthday or something

I wanted to do a phoenix because that isn't the obvious or the thing that everybody would expect after lily found harry after an inferno during a thunderstorm... üòÖ yeah butlike nobody would know that yeah that's somewhat of an explanation of some ideas wothout telling the ideas
