You shouldn't have to mention it...

So, do you mind time-travel? Does it have to be all of them, say Sirius, Remus, and Snape patch up their relationship?

** linkffn(A MODern Man) has a very small bit of this I think, but I'm not sure it's enough to really fulfill your search.

Edit: linkffn(Stages of Hope) may also qualify, but it is heavily divergent.

  Harry takes advice he shouldn't, to do something he really should have known better than to try. Still, all's well that ends well, right?

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/42579][The Accidental Gryffindor]] is a short series that features Severus as a friend and fifth Marauder. "It Falls to the Young" linkffn(2713360 ) is a very AU story where Severus becomes friends with the Marauders and is about some of the stuff they get up to and so on too. Then, I'll throw out "They Didn't Know We Were Seeds" linkffn(12386916 ) there isn't a focus on them and Severus being friends and it's mostly Sirius he's particularly friendly with, but there are moments throughout with him and the Marauders.

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody---' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

** I've read several Snape centric fics where Snape goes back to the body of his younger self to redo his life. But those stories always put him back in Slytherin... I think a Snape with his adult mind and experiences would have a very good chance of ending up in Gryffindor instead.

  When Snape brushes off James Potter's attempt to make amends, James makes a game out of winning the Slytherin's forgiveness. Instead of giving him some peace of mind, however, the game causes his feelings toward his once rival to spiral out of control in a direction he never anticipated.
