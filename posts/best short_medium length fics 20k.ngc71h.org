looking for some short and or medium length fics or series :D preferably <20k


** Even though I'm generally bored of Harry/Hermione fics by now, this one is well done and features a post Battle of Hogwarts romance that doesn't do ridiculous Weasley bashing.

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.
