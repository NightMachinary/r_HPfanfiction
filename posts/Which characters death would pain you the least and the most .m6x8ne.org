Hey there, I'm writing a story set in 2006, there was no final battle and the war is still on 8 years later. Not always an open and bloody war, but there had to be at least a few casualties over the years, and I can't seem to decide who to kill. For now, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Dumbledore and Voldemort are alive, + Snape, Bellatrix, Remus, Arthur, Molly, that can't change. I need to kill off both adults and characters from Harry's generation, but I need to find the right balance. If I only kill off random adults and unimportant characters, it won't be impactful enough, but I'm also attached to a lot of characters and I'd love to write them in a few scenes (Luna and Neville, for example, or Barty Crouch Jr). I kinda want to kill off a Weasley to have one very impactful death, but it's so sad :'(

So yeah, I'd love to see what you guys think. Who are characters you don't really care about, and who would you be really sad to see dead ? Any additional advice for my question is very welcome, thanks !


** Hagrid, maybe? I think I've only ever seen him get killed once, in the Dangerverse series. He's basically Harry's first magical friend in canon, so if he died that'd have impact.\\
Or, for a change...what about Tom the barman/landlord, at the Leaky Cauldron? The Leaky Cauldron is one of the main ways into Diagon Alley aside from Floo powder, so if the Cauldron were attacked and/or Tom violently murdered, that'd affect everyone in magical Britain a little bit.\\
Or, what about one of the house-elves, Dobby, Kreacher or Winky? Maybe play with the super-house-elf trope a bit before they get killed trying to carry out one of Harry's orders, for extra angst.

*** Oooh those are really good ideas, thanks ! Now that you say it I don't think I've read many stories where Hagrid dies, it'll definitely have an impact, and Tom the barman is a great idea too. I hadn't thought of background characters like that, the ones we don't see much but who populate the world and make it feel lived in. Now I'll also have to think of when theses characters die, I was thinking of off screen, already established death when I posted this thread, but Hagrid's death could certainly have a huge impact on the characters if I write it in the story. You've given me a lot to think of, thanks !

** The next-gen characters deaths will be the least impactful because I know nothing about them and killing off a member of the Golden Trio ( especially Harry) is quite fun to read.

*** Thanks ! There won't be many next gen characters since because of the war, our heroes don't have kids yet, but I might find a way to include a few kids and maybe kill of one parent ðŸ¤”
