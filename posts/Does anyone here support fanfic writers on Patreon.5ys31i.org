** I hope not. Fanfic is already a grey area, don't make it murkier.

*** I love doing it. I gave 300 dollars to an author's patreon just cos he wrote a Dean/Dumbledore smut one shot I wanted to read. Love supporting the content creators on the website. If you make one let me know. I'll donate to you too. Must be sad getting little to no attention with your stories.

**** Well, we can agree to disagree then. Our views on this matter are fundamentally different.

** I'd like to chip in a no to go with all the others.

In the beginning I may have considered it when it was a new thing,it sounds nice sure. After how 1800-rent-a-hero went I can see all the flaws quite clearly now. If you want to kill fanfiction, Patreon is how to do it.
