I have this idea for a fic where the statute of secrecy was completely broken during Voldemorts first reign of terror. Or maybe when Harry is like seven and lives with the dursleys. Maybe he has to survive on his own in a now hostile muggle world?

I think it would shake up the events of the books and the setting in an interesting way.

I'm looking for more ideas though. How do you guys think it would affect the story, what would it mean for the muggle and the magical world?


** I think there'd be a lot of attempted attacks on wizards, the vast majority of which end up just being muggles killing each other. Most wizards would just hide behind their magical protections which the muggle mind can't even comprehend.

** Muggles would try to figure out how magic works and if it can be weaponised/used for their gain. Evil corporations and terrorist groups would hunt for vulnerable children like Harry (an orphan with neglectful guardians), kidnap them and do tests on them to figure out magic.

Wizards would probably go deeper into hiding. I think that the Ministry and other magical governments would be more strict about wizards doing magic in the muggle world, what clothes they wear, etc. Stricter laws would probably lead to someone like Grindelwald rising up and trying to talk wizards into a war with muggles.

And then corporations start exploding. Blame JKR for even coming up with Obscurials.

** I think the wizards would pretty much just remain doing all the things they used to do in relative secrecy, except they maybe wouldn't care about being seen doing magic around muggles. So like they wouldn't apparate secretly, they wouldn't keep hiding dragons or whatever, but they probably would continue hiding their towns and villages, schools and so on, because why wouldn't they?

The muggles would go crazy, and probably start killing each other over accusations of witchcraft and whatnot, depending on where in the world we're talking about. Muggle governments would try to "figure out" magic, maybe they would try to intercept muggleborn children or whatever, but I imagine the wizards would just carry on doing what they were doing before. Maybe they would even just kidnap muggleborns and remove them into the magical world as soon as they became aware of them.

I think things would go really badly for muggles, but wizards would probably experience a net benefit from the situation. The reason I think that is unless the statute is broken because, idk, magical concealments fail en masse, wizards can now interact with muggles when they want and benefit however they see fit, but they can still just hide away when they don't want muggles to contact them. So muggles might be able access magical treatments and products, but they would have to deal with the crushing existential crisis brought on by being the objectively inferior variant of human.

** If you know the Shadowrun games, I think it would go like that : nations collapse and the world is a mess for a long time while trying to get up again.

** After a short period of violence (wizard against muggle as Voldemort continues his reign of terror and the Ministry/rest of the world tries to wrangle the cat back into the bag) I think it would quickly result in corporations/governments harnessing magic for their own use.

If the muggle world's first view of magic was through Voldemort and his followers, they certainly would not be endeared to it. Some wizarding families may be able to hide out behind protective enchantments and fidelius charms, and Hogwarts might stand as a safe haven, but I don't think Diagon Alley, St Mungos, or the Ministry would be able to hide effectively- nor any similarly located wizarding centres around the world. Magical people, whether they be halfbloods or muggleborns with split loyalties, a pureblood in need of money, or someone like Pettigrew who wants to give information to (and buy safety from) the side they think is going to win, would give up their fellow witches and wizards and their secrets. So any place that, by necessity, has a lot of people "in the know" about its location/security would not last long.

Then it would be a matter of catch and use/kill, with a fair amount of lip service from muggle politicians regardless of how aware they were of magic previously. There would be all sorts of accusations between the political dissidents and the government (had they contracted a wizard to take down a member of the opposition while in power? were all those attacks wizards and not the IRA or were the IRA working with wizards? etc) and between countries.

Basically I think that best case scenario it would end with the magical world completely subsumed by the muggle world- there'd be a huge market for highly-regulated magical items, plus a demand for magical security, and a lot of questions asked about where the magic people were when this pandemic or that disaster happened. It'd probably lead to a fair amount of magical innovation, as there'd now be a million more scientists asking 'can magic do this?' and a million more mathematicians cranking out arithmancy equations, a million chemists screaming about the properties of all these potions ingredients, etc.

Worst case scenario, near genocide of the magical population across the globe, with future muggle-borns inducted into government training programs upon their discovery. In an actual drawn out war between muggles and magicals, muggles would win. Magicals have a few thousand people in each country and a couple of powerhouses each generation (Voldemort, Grindelwald, Dumbledore). Muggles have billions of people plus more sophisticated and horrible tools of warfare.

I think the most difficult part of a fic like this would be capturing the global nature of this conflict. Every country would have to come to terms with this internal population- and some of them (I think?) have different borders than their muggle counterparts. Depending on where we are in the Cold War's timeline, this could have crazy implications for both sides of the Iron Curtain. And how do even more repressive regimes deal with their magical population? And that's not even mentioning the religious movements that would spring from it.

(Also I'm imagining the shared groans of every history major and physicist as they realize that everything they thought they knew was wrong; countered with the absolute delight as readers of the Quibbler and The Sun finally have their long destined meeting of minds.)

** Oh that's easy. The wizards go into deep hiding and the muggles hunt down young muggleborn.

They won't be able to find any wizards because of the magical protection but they would be able to find young kids who can't control their powers. The kids would know they're magical and possibly try to find others of their kinds. So probably a rise in runaways or parents trying to get rid of children they can't handle.

The government would want to weaponise magic but once again would be stuck picking on the small prey. The muggle born children. They'll experiment on them but it wouldn't do anything because their magic would fry the technology and they'd become obscurals.

So shit would end up getting blown up.

** I can see the muggles being very very very pissed off that the wizards sat out and avoided so many global catastrophes. They'd want magical cures for everything and then eventually want to work out give to make everyone magical
