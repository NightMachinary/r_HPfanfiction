** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3255466/1/The-List][The List]] is pretty great.

In my own head, though, whenever I think of a list-style story it's something like this:

*Harry inherits ten billion Galleons

*Harry becomes Earl of Southwick

*Harry kills TMR with a casual flick of his fingers

*Harry establishes a harem with every female character in canon

Your idea is /much/ better.

*** Pretty sure all those cliche's have devolved from actual plot or amusement devices into which author can give him the most money and power without literally having god select him as his replacement.

Well phrased! Yeah I may may mock those plot devices, but at one time were they considered a new and valuable addition to the fandom? I should probably try to not be so judgmental of those kinds of fics.

** Thanks for the recommendation, I enjoyed it. I have read three really good list style stories in this style but they are all from a different fandom.
