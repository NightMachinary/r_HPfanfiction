Besides the wonderful "More Things Than Are Dreamt Of" series, what are your favorite crossovers with bbc sherlock? Thank you!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/1/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic]] linkffn(7578572). The usual Sherlock adopted Harry fanfiction, but this one makes sense. Harry and the Dursleys are involved during one of Moriarty's stunt. The Dursleys are dead but Harry saved Watson with accidental magic. Feeling grateful, Sherlock and Watson adopted him. It has fem!Watson though, and Sherlock and Watson are married.

Basically a canon rehash, but worth reading just to see the interaction between characters in Sherlock and Potterverse. How Sherlock interact and verbally abusing Snape is so satisfying, of course Snape also give as good as he gets. It has a bunch of OC, so you might avoid it if you're not into it.

What I liked is how Harry isn't suddenly become mini Sherlock. He admire Sherlock and is learning to be like him, but 11 year old Harry doesn't suddenly figure out that Quirrel is possesed by Voldemort, Snape is a spy, or Voldemort used horcrux to avoid death. However, by the end of the series he's actually become pretty good. Sherlock also doesn't suddenly solved all of wizarding world's problem. He solved it, and know what the problem is, but since he's a muggle, even with the 'help' of Mycroft, he can't actually do anything.

  When Professor McGonagall went to visit Harry Watson, son of Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, to deliver his Hogwarts letter, she was in the mindset of performing a familiar if stressful annual routine. Consequently, she was not prepared to find Harry Potter at 221B Baker Street. BBC Sherlock HP crossover AU
