** linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation) may not be exactly what you're looking for, because it's Hermione/Draco/Neville in a weird perverted way, but it's brilliantly written and definitely angsty.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

  She had buttermilk-pale skin. The exhaustion was plain as pumpkin juice on her face. Her hair was lit from behind by the paling window, the red filaments mixed in with the brown flaring to life. She lurked in my periphery just like that---improbably, infuriatingly---and I could have sworn she was divine if I wasn't so sure she was a Mudblood.

  After years of captivity, Hermione Granger fights her way onto the streets of Voldemort's London with only the knife in her pocket and the blood on her hands. There's a checkpoint on every corner, a curfew enforced by Voldemort's most trusted followers, and the only way back to the Boy Who Lived is through the Death Eater responsible for her capture in the first place. COMPLETE.

** The first one, Two Words Remix, is short, but good, and the second, The Risk-Reward Ratio, is very dark, angsty, but a great fic. (Warning, the series isn't completed yet, though there is a complete sequel).

  He felt something close to pity for the woman in front of him. And while that disturbed Draco to no end, what really disgusted him most of all was the harrowing fact that someone or something had broken Hermione Granger's spirit beyond recognition.
