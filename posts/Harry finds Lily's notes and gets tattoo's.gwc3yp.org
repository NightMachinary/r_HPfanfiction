:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, I once started a fic, but after a diskfailure on my pc lost the link and progress had made in the story. I just remembered a few parts of it and would like to continue it.

Main things I remember: Harry finds a trunk, in his relatives' house, with her notes from her research. It involves old lore. Can't remember if it was something she stumbled upon or old family magic of hers. In order to use it, he needs to inscribe it on his body. To cover it up, he gets a few other tattoos. This causes a spike his capabilities. At the start there are a few remarks about his increase in capabilities and molly thinks it was a bad idea to get tattoo's.


** I think Runic Animagi by Kassien matches what you are looking for.
