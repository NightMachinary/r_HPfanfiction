:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello all,

First post ever! That outta the way, I just want to know if anyone's heard of this really short harry potter fanfic making fun of tropes parody. Basically, premise is this HP gets all inheritance things, named goblin friend for remembering a name etc. Is basically about to start his modern day crusade against Dumbledore and his machinations in his life, and he gets hit by a transport vehicle and it ends. It was honestly incredibly funny. It reminded me of similar parodies like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7191459/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Something-Something]].

I'd also appreciate if anyone has a bit of spare time pointing me in the direction of more like the above style. Though, really I'm just following my desire to find the fic I outlined above, it's driving me up the wall I can't seem to find it. Hopefully, someone recognises any of what I've written up there and will provide a link. Much appreciation and thanks for reading this post.


** I don't know this fic you mentioned, but on a side note, make sure to change your flair to â€˜What's That Fic?' instead!

  You know those stories where Harry discovers he's super rich, super powerful, and all the good guys are evil and the bad guys are good and he's related Merlin? This story is nothing like that.
