Could also include the love potion birth = feel no love (I know its fanon) or just have harry love his mother and hate purebloods as much as purebloods hate muggleborns (for being entitled ect). Could make for an interesting Dark Harry story- he would reject Ron ect.


** A subversion would be better, IMHO.

James did truly move on from her in his last two or so years.

Unfortunately for her, as he stopped being such a tw*t and started being more responsible/mature, it only made Lily realize what she missed out on and, to her horror, she found herself falling for this new James hard and fast.

When they finally hooked up, even Sirius, Peter, and Remus just thought he'd relapsed and Lily had 'wizened up' to how much of a great catch he was.

In reality, it was more sinister.

She was an accomplished potioneer, after all.
