** I would like to find more stories with this pairing too. And honestly, he gets it on with Bellatrix and Narcissa in so many other stories, what's keeping him from Andromeda?

Aside from her husband.

*** I'm guessing that in a lot of minds, Andromeda is the housewife type. She got a husband, an adult daughter and doesn't exactly have the same "dark&dirty" vibe as Narcissa and Bellatrix.

** I'm not sure if they end up together in this fic (which is probably going to be a harem), but Andromeda plays a big role in it.

Since its such a niche pairing, I figured I post it as it is, at worst, a "better than nothing".
