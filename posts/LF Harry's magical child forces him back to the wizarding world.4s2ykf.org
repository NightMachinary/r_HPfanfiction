Hi all. I'm looking for any fic in which Harry had left the wizarding world for any reason, but comes back because his child is magical. Maybe he had amnesia and is finally found; maybe he left because he was exiled. Maybe he left by choice. Whatever the circumstances, he has to return. Any pairings accepted. Just...please...well-written stories only, please! Preferably ones with realistic characterizations, no character bashings (although it's ok if the characters don't all love each other for whatever reason...that's life.), and reasonably acceptable grammar. Thanks!


** I've seen a couple sort of like this. The only one I can remember the name of is linkffn(6943436) but it only happens at the end of the epilogue so the payoff isn't really worth it.

  Daphne Greengrass always had a plan. She liked being organized. But the Dark Lord's return at the end of her fifth year derailed everything, and now she must decide who will best help her find the life she always wanted.

*** Thanks for the response, but you're right. I'd prefer a story where a part of the main focus is Harry reintegrating into the wizarding world. Thanks again for responding, and if you know of any others that are a better fit, I'd love to hear them! :)

** Linkffn(1291535)

Rather depressing story overall. Technically decent, some of the plot points are absurd when you think about them. YMMV

*** I gave that one a look a while ago. You're right in that some of the plot points are absurd. I couldn't get past the first chapter. But thank you for the response anyway. :)

** There's one I read awhile ago that I enjoyed but can't remember what it's called. Harry was working as a bartender in like Muggle Alaska I think and his 17 year old daughter that resulted from a one night stand with Gabrielle Delacour during the war comes to find him after Gabrielle is kidnapped. Anyone know which one that is?
