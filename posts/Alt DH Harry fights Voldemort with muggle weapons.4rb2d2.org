** They need training somehow. I've read other fics where Harry was raised by James Bond and others where he was raised by mob bosses and he got his training through there.

Another one was about how muggle raised squibs enlisted in the armed forces and Harry is trained by them and has his own army

*** I've read that last one. Oh god it's cringy, cliche, and edgy. It was a guilty pleasure of mine a long while back. I would not recommend it to anyone personally.

But yeah, they definitely need training in order to actually use firearms effectively, especially if they want to use them against other people.

** Going full muggle when there are far better magical options for a variety of tasks seems not very smart. Combinging magic and technoogy seems to offer more.

** Obviously super!Potter but linkffn(The Lightsaber) fits your bill, technically.
