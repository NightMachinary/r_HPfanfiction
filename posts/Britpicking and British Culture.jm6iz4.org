So, we haven't had one of these threads in a while (that I've seen, anyway). Anyone got any new questions about British Language or Culture or have any fellow Brits got any interesting points or comments to help others learn?

I know not everyone wants to bother with this - and that's quite alright - but we have a resource to tap here. :)

*** I'm not sure about the 90s specifically, but pillock, tosspot, tosser, wanker, bell-end (maybe a bit anachronistic), bastard, git, twit and berk should work for insults; swear words should not be too different from America, but you might want to throw in bugger (as an exclamation and as 'bugger [that thing]'), bloody (as a description ('the bloody car'), intensifier ('I bloody love...') or 'bloody hell' as an exclamation). 'Buggered' can also mean broken or thoroughly worn out (like 'fucked'). If it is a more racy fic, you might want 'shag' as a fairly coarse word for 'have sex'.

**** I'm Scottish so I may have some more that may be useful due to hogwarts being set in Scotland. And how prolific we Scots are for our colourful language. But slag is another way of calling a girl a bitch or whore.

Then you have chav or N.E.D which translates to non educated delinquent normally used on a person that exhibits anti social behaviour such as bullying, petty theft, gang violence/activity, vandalism, drug use and minor distribution and generally disturbing the peace. Often characterised in wearing cheep tracksuits or cottons. (Dudley dusrley would be considered a chav or Ned)

You missed cunt which is very disrespectful and is considered worse than fuck also extremely sexist. The word itself describes the female genitalia in a very unpleasant way and is generally used as an insult to someone you particularly hate. It's also commonly paired after with “no wait, a cunt is useful for something” implying that the female genitalia is useful in acts of a sexual nature and that the insulted party is useless or unwanted by anyone. (Seriously nasty thing to say and is only really used by very unpleasant people too insult other seriously nasty people aka Umbridge or Dursley level unpleasant)

There is also the likes of arsewipe or shitstain which are fairly self explanatory along with skidmark which is another word for shit stain.

There's also scrote which is an insult calling a person a scrotum or ball bag, normally used instead of little shit for an annoying person. Also has negative connotations for a person's appearance and insinuates they are dirty/unclean in reference to sexual activity.

Another Scottish insult would be to call someone a tube insinuating they are an idiot. Can be most effectively used between friends or siblings in an exasperated way when one is doing or saying something stupid.

There are many many more but those are some of the most common ones that were used in the 90s chav especially due to tracksuits being popular among young people then.

***** I think you're seriously undervaluing the versatility of cunt. It's a wonderful word and is used as a term of endearment more often than as an insult. It's also really not very misogynistic, it has become very much like dick or prick, just sort of coarse.

****** Greetings! Australian here. I use this because this country has quite the reputation for using the word. We are quite close to our old friends in the United Kingdom, so I hope I am not veering off into the deep end. Either way, ‘cunt' is a bit of an extreme thing. It is either a one or a ten on the scale. Some people will laugh it off and slap you on the back, others may get a shocked expression and go deathly white, wobbling on their feet as if they are about to pass out. Do not come to Australia and start calling people cunts because the media has portrayed it as alright. It is not as commonly used as people think it is.

Now, my Nan is from Britain. She is very, very posh and well-spoken. Literally speaks like the Queen is the room and I love her for it. You never whisper the word ‘cunt' in her presence. Do not even think the word. It literally is considered one of the most aggressive and disrespectful swear words. I think it still holds that title. In the 90s and 2000s, I assume so. Again, she is very well-spoken and she never heard the word uttered as an insult before, especially not by children or teenagers.

I honestly cannot see any pure-blood children using the word, nor would I see anyone from a mid-wealth setting using the word. I think it would have to be the lower class and, even then, I cannot see it working. I would simply just go with ‘he swore' or whatever. Even Rowling did it. I think it would pull me out of a story if I saw the word cunt plastered on it.

******* That's a really good point to make about insults and swearing in British Culture, actually. There's a lot of context to the words - who you're saying them to and where you're saying them. Saying Cunt to your mother in a library would be a terrible faux pas, but saying Cunt to your mates in the school cafeteria would be tolerated far more often (assuming no teacher heard you, anyway).

******** There's a difference, dick is the informal word for penis. While it's used as an insult it isn't has harsh as cunt which has more negative connotations towards the female gender and is seen as being more vulgar in comparison to other slang for the female genitalia (pussy, fanny and so on). Prick is more comparable due to it being more emasculatory towards the recipient of the insult, insinuating they have a small penis but doesn't carry the same level of disrespect in my opinion. But you are right you wouldn't use this type of language around pleasant company. I didn't mean to insinuate any of this language is acceptable just that cunt stands a bit higher on the list so to speak.(to me at least)

*** I've got to admit, I've started finding that one funny. If I ever get a HP fic written, I totally intend someone to make that mistake and have the outcome be... Scottish. Very, very Scottish. :D

For anyone wondering, there's an odd mishmash of terms associated with the UK and each refer to a different thing.

- UK/United Kingdom - The political union of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland (ie. the whole thing, except the Republic of Ireland)
- Great Britain - The name of the big island that holds Scotland, England, and Wales. Before you ask, I have no idea if the 'Great British Bake Off' name is in reference to it being made in Great Britain or if the 'great' is a self-compliment. Either way, tru dat.
- Britain - Sometimes used as a slang synonym for the UK, other times just a shorter way of saying 'Great Britain'. Like all things British, context is important here.
- Scotland - the one at the top with the kilts and Hogwarts. If you ever get a chance to go to the Edinburgh Fringe, do so as it's a lovely time and a gorgeous city.
- England - the one at the bottom with the tea and Ministry.
- Ireland - Technically should be just 'Northern Ireland' when referring to the UK bit (and it'd always be referred to that way officially), but we often shorten it in conversation. The Republic of Ireland is the independent part at the bottom.
- Wales - the one at the side with the Dragon Flag and Torchwood.

*** I know Britain got very obsessed with football in '96, because that's the year I was born and football people keep making references to it when I mention that.

When you say TV shows, what age range do you mean for? Like, are you asking what Dudley would watch with his mates, or what Vernon and Petunia would watch?

Armed Police have always been the exception here. The initial idea was to have them not be armed so they'd bring up less memories of soldiers being used to keep order and people would be more cooperative - the mindset in policing is almost always 'police by consent' or 'community policing' here, meaning the police force encouraged the cooperation of the public rather than controlled them with force. We had some more arming-up moments in the late 1800s after some police shootings, but even then carrying the guns was voluntary on the part of the officers and the vast majority of police were never armed. Even now, we only have about 6000 gun-trained officers out of somewhere over 120,000 officers total.

Guns were formally retired for regular officers in the 30s, but there were always some kept in stations throughout and after the Second World War (army veterans from the World Wars). Still never a significant thing.

In terms of gun laws tightening, you're probably referring to the Dunblaine Massacre (also in '96), but that was just a handgun ban for civilians. For the police themselves, they got severely restricted after a series of civilian shootings in the 80s, but for the most part we've never been 'gun nuts' like the Americans so the police haven't really needed them (our police sometimes count gun use in 'bullets fired per year'). It's just not in our culture.

A great deal of pearl-clutching and "sassy" telling-off at men's use of swear words ("Excuse /you/, mister! Don't make come down on there and wash that mouth out with bleach!" -- Lavender to Ron).

Considerable prudery surrounding "rules of dating", interspersed with some slut-shaming. Very 80s Harlequin.

Poor Hermione's old man forever having rather threatening talks with her young men about their intimate relation.

Considerably more liberal use of "sir" and "ma'am".

*** This is a bit of a tricky one because the books don't really seem to line up with existing prime ministers.

John Major was prime minister at the time for most of the books (more on that below). He was a conservative, at the end of over ten years of conservative rule. The prior prime minister (Margaret Thatcher - and if you want a sense of how polarising a figure she was, she was very much the UK's Reagan, for worse or worse) hadn't left the job because of retirement or the other party - she was very much brought down deliberately by party infighting and Major was installed instead. This is surprisingly common in the UK system - people don't elect a prime minister directly, they elect a local member of parliament, and the party with enough to form a government wins. That party's leader becomes prime minister - and it's entirely possible for a party to change their leader in wahtever way that party happens to make that happen. Generally there's some polling of members of that party, but far fewer british people are affiliated with their parties of choice for various reasons I'm not going to get into here, because this comment is already tangent heavy.

My point is that it just doesn't really work if it's John Major. The Prime minister at the start of book six refers to his predecessor being a man, which he wasn't, and there's some general stuff about the timelines of when previous prime ministers/ministers for magic came in that just doesn't quite line up properly. Honestly, I'd suggest having a fictional prime minister anyway if they play any major role in your story - the baggage of real people and real politicians is a /lot/ and I can only imagine it interfering with most plots.

In May 1997, Tony Blair wins a landslide victory and the first Labour government for decades arrives on a message of hope and change. Obviously, this being politics, it doesn't quite pan out that way over the next few years. But this is as everything is going down in the wizarding world with the war, so it may be less relevant, in a lot of ways.

Sorry, this message goes on a lot of tangents, so I hope I've made some kind of sense. Let me know if you have any more questions or if I've done a bad job explaining anything.

*** John Major. Tory party. Coming off the back of Maggie Thatcher the Milk Snatcher. The number of MPs in the House of Commons has changed over the years but is ~650 and very heavily stacked in England's favour, for good or ill, as a Scotsman I can tell you that thats a heavy point of contention as essentially whatever way England votes pretty much categorically decides which party is elected. One MP gets selected as Speaker of the House of Commons and thats basically the moderator of the debates. MPs vote Aye or No by splitting off into different rooms and being counted as they go. When a party wins the election, the leader of the party goes before the Queen to ask permission to form a government, then selects a cabinet from there. It is customary but not necessarily essential that the Party leader becomes PM. The Leader of the Opposition, usually the second largest party in parliament and election runner up, forms the ‘Shadow Cabinet' and its roll its usually to hold the government to account and almost act like ‘this is what we'd do differently'. MPs that are not part of the government or opposition cabinets or frontbenchers, are known as ‘backbenchers'

When a bill is passed by the Commons it progresses to the House of Lords, where it can be blocked, or assented and then goes on to the Queen for Royal Assent. The lords have 797 unelected seats, consisting of lords spiritual (religious figures) and lords temporal (life and hereditary peers) Life peers served for life and hereditary seats are hereditary. The HoL follows a similar party structure to the commons, Conservative (Tory) Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru etc, although there are a significant proportion of Crossbench or independent Lords.

More info can be found on the parliament website.

It should be noted that the UK doesnt have a written, formal document for a constitution its more that there is an expectation of precedent and sort of good practice which makes ‘constitutional crises' really difficult to resolve, though flouting precedent is highly irregular and usually taken quite seriously, so if you base your stories heavily off parliament dont have characters just ‘shake things up' See Oct 2019 prorogation of parliament. Prorogation is the discontinuation of a parliamentary session, normally invoked by the Queen at elections and stuff but its really at the behest of the PM

** Is it a cliche for British people to be gloomy, or have a cynical world view? I read somewhere one stereotype Brits have regarding Americans is that they're cheerful and positive minded. (I wouldn't say that's the case now but this was ages ago.) Likewise, one stereotype I had about British people (specifically the English) is that they have an "Oh well, what can you do?" sort of attitude. Does that have any basis in fact? Or have I watched too many historical dramas with brooding types?

*** Stoicism is the national character across all of Britain. Sometimes it gets called ‘the stiff upper lip'. If you want an example, it used to be British Army doctrine that ‘British Officers don't duck' an officer was expected to maintain his cool under fire and always walk upright to be an inspiration to the man. If you show that you are unafraid, then the men are less likely to be afraid. For an officer to duck behind walls would be to show cowardice in fromt of the men.

Stoicism isnt really limited to the ‘stiff upper lip' of the upper classes. Growing up in the lower classes in Scotland, and having a relatively outdoorsy childhood, I could come home with all sorts of cuts and bruises and my mum would be like ‘Ach yer fine, whit ye whinging about?' And so on. Since you get taught that no-nonsense stoicism from an early age, it does end up making you more reserved. The thing is there are certain types of people who are and those who aren't. The stiff upper lip tends to just be a preserve of the upper classes, despite a sort of no-nonsense stoicism appearing in people around Britain.

It should be noted that Class, and the British class system is kind of complex, but be aware that ‘Wealth does not make you upper class' its a lot of things like, how you speak?, where you are from?, what jobs did your parents have? Etc. Upper class is bred, not made. To be upper class is to be born into a ‘wealthy' ‘old money' family, the nobility with large estates, being educated at schools like Eton, Harrow, Gordonstoun etc and then being an Oxbridge (Oxford and Cambridge candidate) and just typically being divorced from reality in some way.

** British Fashion in the 90s please! How did they dress up? I keep reading all these Fics about sleek well fit suits and dresses etc., Jerseys even! As a football player I recollect those jerseys well enough, it was big baggy t-shirts with collars, and tucked in. But I'm not sure about fashion for teenagers and adults in the 90s in UK.

*** I don't know specifics, but a friend is really into fashion, so I kind of osmosed a few things over the years. :D

I know the 90s was a very weird era for fashion. The whole 'model influence' thing was growing pretty rapidly and the international scenes were starting to meld together more, so a lot more variety was starting to develop.

I know that generally most people in the UK in the early 90s favoured grungy, baggy clothing and the late 90s (post-Kate Moss' 'Heroin Chic' intro into the fashion world) started to become more well-fitting. I'm not sure how that'd vary across the generations or social groups here though, my apologies. If you want ideas on how the rich would dress, I'd check out some of the fashion shows from the era you're trying to write in. The patterns and concepts demonstrated there tend to be what influences the 'high fashion' stuff the most. For regular people, I'd check TV shows made in the era. They'd probably mimic a slightly toned down version of what the 'typical person' might wear.

*** It depends. If you're talking about teenagers, a lot of grunge influences. Trousers were typically quite baggy, rather than skinny jeans like now. Acid wash denim was definitely in. Tops were typically cut quite high, too. Jumpers were also a big thing. They often had a logo on the front, and we're usually a cotton woven material, rather than a knitted wool jumper.

For office/ work fashion, skirts were short and typically above the knee. They were also quite fitted and worn with a blouse. I've also seen some truly awful outfits that included matching coloured tights and skirt. Shoes often had a square toe, rather than an almond or rounded toe.

Dungarees and pinafore dresses were quite a big thing too, usually worn with a high neck top underneath.

Basically spend a lot of time googling fashion in the right year.

For dressing up, satin was the thing in a big way. Look at Drew Barrymore in the 90s. She was the height of fashion.

** Funnily story from me, a brown girl who's lived in Britain her whole life. Because I'm brown I'm influenced mostly by my "home" culture I don't have that "British colloquial" so to speak. I hope that makes sense.

Anyways in HP fics I always read the insult "tosser" a lot- I kind of assumed it was common and I used it a lot in my head. Because of how the word sounds I always just thought it meant layabout or lazy or something.

So the other day, I said to a dude in my class (in a jokey way) "X you tosser!" And then my two friends starting laughing incredulously. "[[/u/browtfiwasboredokai][u/browtfiwasboredokai]] do you even know what that means?!" And they looked so comedicially scandalized at my innocent face. I asked her what it meant and she just said to Google it,which I didn't do until a couple days later.

...a person who masturbates a lot. That's what a tosser means. I called a classmate who I don't even know properly a masturbator!!! I know that it probably meant something different in the 90s but that's what it means now. :///

*** I admit, you should take this with a pinch of salt, since I wasn't alive then and only know this second-hand, but nobody seems to be still reading this post and I wanted to make sure you at least had AN answer. (Anyone who knows more, feel free to correct me!)

Britpop was big in an 'outside-the-scene' sense, but not as all consuming in the music world itself. Like, the regular news would report on how Blur and Oasis were releasing an album at the same time and clearly it's a war of the bands and all that, but there was a lot more awareness of variety in the actual music scene itself. Like, the people who bought music magasines and regularly followed band news and went to clubs and bars and concerts regularly would know about more. We had a particularly thriving dance music scene at the time, for example, that grew out of the Madchester lot in the 80s. Manchester was really, really big for music and variety, so there'd be a lot more casual awareness there too, because everything was just swimming in publicity for it.
