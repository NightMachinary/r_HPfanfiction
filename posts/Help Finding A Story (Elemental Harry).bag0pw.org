Hello, I'm having trouble finding a story that I read a while back.

It was about Harry being an elemental, and so was the other main character (OC). I think her name was Lily. but her nickname was Freckles. There's two or three versions, but I can't find the one I'm missing.

​

The version I'm looking for had Lily get really angry with Hermione for the firebolt gift incident, and she was generally more friendly with Harry from the start. If I remember correctly it also had Cedric making Cho upset at the Yule Ball. If you recognize it could you please link me to it?

Thank You

​

After running ten thousand books through calibre I finally managed to find it. If anybody is interested in reading it here you go: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8630467/4/Magical-Origins]]

*** Sadly not, that's the one I found too. Same characters, and similar plot though.
