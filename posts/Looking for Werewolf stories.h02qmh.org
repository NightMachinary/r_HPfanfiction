I've been reading some trashy werewolf novels recently (Ah, guilty pleasures.) and was hoping you guys could reccomend some Harry Potter fanfics that are similar. Thanks in advance!


** It's been a while since I read linkffn(Weres Harry) but I recall it being ok. Unfinished and abandoned though.

There's a fair bit about werewolves in linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7), although it's only one aspect of quite a long story. An excellent story in its own right, but only mildly werewolfish.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  Turned into a werewolf at fifteen, Harry, afraid of what he now is and the lack of control he has, runs from the wizarding world...right into the territory of unmated alpha werewolf Fenrir Greyback, who is overly eager to find the submissive wolf in the heart of his territory. Fenrir/Harry. Mpreg.
