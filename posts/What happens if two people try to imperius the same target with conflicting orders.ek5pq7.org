** My interpretation: The one with stronger intent wins.

Harry would beat a lot of people. And before people start arguing, he can throw off the Imperius of Riddle. AND, don't forget Priori Incantatem. The one with the strongest will/intent wins. he beat Riddle at that too.

** I think Seventh Horcrux had Harry imperiusing himself all the time so no one else could and ending up addicted to it? It was hilarious. It might be a different fic though.
