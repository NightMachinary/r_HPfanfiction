:END:
I remember a LOT about this fanfic, but have not been able to find it.

This was on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] about 10 years ago. It's a single chapter fic set during the Order of the Phoenix or there about.

Remus wakes up in the Ministry's werewolf containment center after a full moon and sets off to walk home. On the way, a woman pulls her daughter away from him as he walks down the street. When he gets to his apartment, his landlord has changed the charms that let him into the house and evicts him, keeping Remus' belongings. They have an argument that involves the landlord calling Remus a bloodsucker. As a parting line, Remus corrects him that it is vampires who suck blood.

Now without a wand (it had been left in his apartment), Remus lies down on a bench somewhere. He dreams about either his mother or Lily who comforts him. He wakes up running late for an Order meeting.

When he arrives at the Order meeting, Snape insults him about a report Remus was supposed to give, but doesn't have prepared. Sirius speaks up "I'd like to see you try getting all your bones rearranged and then give a report."

After the meeting, Remus is looking out the window feeling sad about not having a home and not wanting to ask Sirius if he can stay at Grimmauld Place. Tonks comes over and expresses excitement about the two of them working together on a mission for the Order. Remus says "You'll find I'm a poor partner for a mission since I can't even keep ahold of my wand." and explains about being evicted. Tonks responds "Swindely that old swindler? He's well known at the ministry for breaking the law and illegally evicting people. I'll get your belongings back to you tomorrow."

Has anyone read this? I think it was a reasonably popular fanfic. Thank you!


** This is /extremely/ late, but is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6075236/1/Remus-s-New-Hope][this]] the fic? It seems a bit different from what you described, but it's the only fanfiction I could find under “fanfiction.net remus lupin evicted from apartment tonks” that sounded similar
