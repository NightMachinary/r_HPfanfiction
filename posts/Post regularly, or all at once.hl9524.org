I was curious to get an opinion on what you all think as readers.

Would you prefer to see a finished fic uploaded all at once, or would you prefer regular updates?

I've never actually finished anything before, and oddly feel like I cant move on while it's unpublished. Personally I prefer to read finished fics all in one go, like I would a book, but I want to see if there are other opinions out there.


** I'm like you, I like to read a finished fic all at once. With fics that get updated, I tend to forget what I have already read and have to reread parts to remember what happened last in the story.

** Definitely prefer it posted in one go, I prefer a completed fic before a WIP (even if the author says it's finished) every time.

Although, if you want to gather a bigger audience it's advantageous posting the chapters one by one. (Simply because of more time on the front page rather than people liking your story more.)

Congratz on finishing your first fic btw!

*** Yeah, I knew the audience thing would be an issue. But if it's good, I feel like it'll get at least mentioned. If it's bad, then it wouldn't have gotten many views anyway. It's not going to become a pinnacle of the pairing or anything, but I also don't think it's bad.

Thanks! Took a break from my main ongoing one and hammered it out. Felt good!

** I actually quite enjoy the regular updates way. It's nice, having something to look forward to, getting into the anticipation and all that. But that enjoyment does sour, if the updates stop, so I can see the peril. Which is a really weird way of putting it, now I think about it - makes fic seem mildly like heroin, which is probably accurate - but I'll stick with the sentiment regardless.

Basically, so long as the eventual thing'll be complete, I don't really mind though. Unfinished fics are so very heartbreaking.

*** I get what you mean, heroin and all, lol.

It is finished, so that's not an issue. I dunno. I keep coming back to 'effective' which was my whole goal with this one. My ongoing one is long as hell, and could've been condensed significantly, so I wanted to put one together that did as much as it could with as little as I could manage. So now I wonder if it would be more effectively read all at once, though I suppose thats only an issue while I'm posting it.

What I'm actually doing is waaaay overthinking it. But that's my style.

**** That makes sense - and overthinking is practically a requirement of sapience, so it's a style you share with most of humanity. :D

I can see your point, though. It sounds like an issue of pacing and digestion, moreso than an issue of scheduling, then. I'd suggest maybe picking a short section of your work (an arc of events, so 'break into prison, get friend out of cell, escape from prison'-esque sequences) and reading through it all at once, then separately (at a later date) to see what difference it makes.

There are some fascinating tricks that come in so very handy - playing with perception or side-stepping writer's block both. For another example, I've quoted the 'if you're having difficulty with a specific scene, start it anew on a blank page' one on this subreddit before (or possibly the Fanfiction one, I do so often get them confused).

You can say on the first chapter that the fic is finished and that you will post a new chapter everyday/every two days/whenever you decide, so that people know and expect it.

On the other hand, posting the story in updates would probably help it reach a wider audience, due to it appearing at top of the list of fics sorted by update date.

I read so many fics it's impossible to keep track of the stories of ongoing ones. Every time I tried it just feels bad.

** Depends on what you mean by regular updates. Too slow and you risk readers losing investment in the story. Also depends on how much value you put in reviews and view count. I put 0 value in those, so I just posted a chapter a day until it was done, on the offchance that someone would catch a plothole that I could fix before it was all out - I also gave one final reread before posting each chapter, just in case.

As a writer (not that I do much writing) I'd prefer to upload each chapter with some delay, because then I'd likely get more comments that way, at least in the short term, which probably would help with discoverability.

** As a reader I like and am used to receiving regular updates. As long as updates aren't spread too far apart that it forces me to go back and re-read anything. Gives me something to look forward to and I find that for a fic probably helps with awareness instead of just putting it out all at once. There is nothing quite like the feeling of seeing one of your favorite fics updated. I've had days that were awful before and then I would get a notification about a fic I really liked being updated. Instantly cheered me up.

I've been writing one where I'm trying to stay 4-5 chapters ahead in my writing compared to the chapter I'm posting (in case shit comes up and I can't write), and I do a short paragraph at the beginning of every chapter that's like a “previously on...” kind of thing.

** I like to read fics all at once, but if it's regularly updated sometimes it's better. It's like watching episodes of tv shows. You can pull off cliffhangers, and you can make more suspense, and if I like a fic I look forward to the day it updates so it makes my day better knowing I'll have something to read when I get home.

Also, this is slightly off-topic, but do you ever read a chapter of something and wish it cut off at a certain place? One of my favorite fics, a hp/Creepypasta crossover fic called Brother in Arms, has a scene where the main character is kidnapped and the veiw point switches to his family, who are on the phone with whoever took the MC and Jeff is talking to him and this happens:

* "Alright, you piece of shit,"# Jeff said, #"You tell us where Isaac is, and I'll come meet your fuck-ugly face alone,"

This is copy pasted from the story. It doesn't stop, but it would have been such a perfect stopping point. I usually don't like cliffhangers, but I like to torture myself occasionally and it almost seems awkward how the chapter doesn't end there. It doesn't give us time to process anything.

** It depends in part on how frequent the updates are and how memorable the fic is. I generally won't even start into a WIP fic if it hasn't been updated in over a month or if it seems to average less than one chapter a month. A few fics are good enough to get me past that, but they tend to be the REALLY good stuff. Completed is definitely easiest, since I can just read it start to finish, and I'll sometimes read all the way through a completed fic where if I'd had to wait for chapters I would have lost interest.

As a writer, I'm of the type that posting regularly (every two weeks in this case) actually helped me finish my long-running fic: If I'd waited to start posting until it was finished, I'd have probably stopped writing partway through when I hit a long stretch of writer's block and RL craziness. By having stuff already posted and having people following the story it meant there was someone other than just myself I'd be letting down if I abandoned it, and that pushed me onward when I was struggling. This certainly isn't true for everyone (just look at the number of abandoned fics out there) and I have no idea if you're the same type as me, so I don't know if it'd work for you.

It also helped to not start posting until I had a good buffer of finished chapters, so that even +if+ when I went a couple of months without writing anything it didn't impact my posting schedule. I actually started with a year's worth of material ready to go beyond what I initially posted, but I was writing a /long/ fic; I was down to about 6 months of buffer when I finally finished writing. How much buffer you'd want would depend on how your writing speed compares to your posting speed and how long the story's going to be.
