Being followed by a crazy psycho and being the supposed only one who can defeat him couldn't be easy on a teenager's mind.

I'm reading /The weapon, revisited/ linkffn(5333171) and damn, poor kid.


** Strange Reflections linkffn(12307886)

Harry has serious PTSD. Nightmares every night, well on his way to becoming an alcoholic.

**** It's by Lequin.

Harry throws himself into rebuilding Hogwarts and drinks heavily to just be able to sleep. He had to do something during the cleanup of war that messed him up. He has not told anyone about it and is trying and failing to deal with it on his own.

Enter the Potter family from an alternate dimension who try to take over Harry's place in the wizarding world fame and wealth included.

The story is Harmony and pretty well written IIRC.

***** Oh, I remember now. Harry wasn't too fucked up by the end.

His "family" though... Ouch

** [[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Nightmares_of_Futures_Past/index/][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past]] has a Harry who has mild (? I have no idea how to quantify levels of it) PTSD from the war, but it mostly doesn't affect him.

Linkffn(Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian) has a Harry who is seriously fucked up by what he saw in the war, to the point where I don't want to go back and re-read it because it was too depressing (but it's really good from what I remember, great world-building)

** The fic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] features Harry with Hermione, Neville, and Luna accidentally traveling to another dimension.

They suffer from sever PTSD and it seems some sort of insanity that can be attributed to addiction to certain potions to keep them going and alive.

There's also [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][A Fine Spot of Trouble]] which is post war. Harry is a wasted drunk who is found one day by Draco who attempts to help him get rehabbed.
