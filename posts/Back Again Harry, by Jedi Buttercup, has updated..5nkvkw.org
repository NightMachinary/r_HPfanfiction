Just so you know.

Didn't think I would see this one get an update, despite the author saying so. The last instalment was 4 year old.


** I just saw the notification email myself. Aside from knowing that I enjoyed it, I don't really remember anything about the plot, so I'm going to have to set some time aside to read it again.

*** I would be happy if they'd just wrap it up. We don't even need all 7 years, just give us a satisfying ending point.

** Lovely to hear! My favourite time-travel story, even if it's a little short still. The transfiguration class scene always made me smile.
