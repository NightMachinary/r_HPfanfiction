:END:
I'm looking for a previous fix I read where Draco (and possibly Narcissa) switch sides during the war after Draco lost his hand under Voldemort's orders. I remember him being kept in the basement of an Order house and Hermione ends up as a big part of the story. Can anyone help?


** I loved this fic. It's The Risk-Reward Ratio by MissiAmphetamine
