In many stories Harry gets together with a girl during his schooldays. Both are sure, they *love* each other and stay together forever. /My problem with that is twofold: I think it's boring and unrealistic./

I would love to read a story which has Harry falling in love during his schooldays with someone he knows - preferably Hermione - they believe to *love* each other. After finishing school, they break up, then Harry gets together with someone else and learns the difference between crushing and loving somebody.

I don't care, who Harry finally gets together with, be it a boy, a girl, someone older, younger or an own character.


** In my story "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief", Harry has several relationships while he's at school (not at the same time, none of them Hermione, though), and all of them fail for various reasons. He grows up through this until he's ready for a lasting relationship after Hogwarts (with Hermione).

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

**** linkffn(modern romance) has both harry and hermione finding love with new people (although its an interesting read, and a little confusing, but 100% worth it!)

more traditional fics I like..

linkao3(four weddings and a dragon)

linkffn(post tenebras lux)

Any hermione x non-ron character tag should find you a ton of fics that qualify though!!

  When Charlie Weasley takes Hermione Granger to visit the recovering Gringott's dragon, something sparks. Years later, after disaster strikes her long engagement, she finds herself in Romania in search of dragon-care lore, manipulated by a mad old witch, and discovering that Charlie in his element is much more than a spark. Soft, sweet, snuggly, and fluffy. HEA. Complete

  "After Darkness, Light." A chance meeting ten years after the war may not be just a coincidence, and may prove to have very far-reaching consequences. A story of many things, but primarily of healing. SS/HG; rated M for later chapters. Complete.
