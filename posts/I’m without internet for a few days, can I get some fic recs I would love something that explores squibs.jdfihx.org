I've been thinking a lot about squibs lately and would love to read some fics with well-done Squib characters. Next gen would be ideal (Like Harry's kids) but I'm down for anything.


** This is a time travel type fic where Harry pretends to be a squib and it gets into squib rights. It's one of my favorites. Linkffn(the second string) ffnbot!refresh

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
