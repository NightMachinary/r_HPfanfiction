Cant remember the name but i know it wasnt finished and in it instead of Sirius ginny dies at the DoM and everyone blasts bellatrix apart. When harry runs into the atrium gabrielle and her father show up and harry ends up taking a curse for her. Later harry ends up with cho as a slave of her own free will as part of a plan to pay for her mothers medical bills and harry finds out he has marriage contracts with the patils and Su Li. Much appreciated if anyone can help me find it
