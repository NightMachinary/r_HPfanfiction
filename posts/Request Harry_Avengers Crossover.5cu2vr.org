Looking for some Potter/Avenger stories that actually have Harry's Actions have weight, not the "Harry is always there at all the plot points but, changes nothing" stories but rather Stories where Harry actually has a role

Prefer Het, will take Gen


** I love these crossovers but I'm going to be honest, you're setting yourself up for heartache if you look for good, long, completed fics. Even longer fics that are regularly updated are something of a rarity. One shots are the way to go, in my opinion. Or you can just grow accustomed to really good stories that may never get finished like I did.

Let me add a mini-rant about Wand and Shield. This is a story that I recommend with some hesitance. It starts off really strong, I think, but then I feel like it passed the natural ending point for the story and just rambles on, adding more characters and subplots than the author can handle and making it into a "Harry fixes everyone's problems" story. I usually check out at around chapter 15 myself because after that the story becomes something of a chore for me to read.

Edit: bot may not be working, so I edited in the links.

*** I have to tentatively agree about Wand and Shield. On the other hand, though, the Hogwarts trek was delightfully creepy.

**** I feel like it would have been better as several stories in the same universe.

***** I don't know about “few” right now, but I think it definitely would have looked better if it at least got split into major arcs (of which we seem to have two now, the initial one and the one with the poncy guy).

That said, there's quite a lot of ... shuffling between various Marvel universes (like the Hulk being a completely different one from the one in the movies), which can confuse those not prepared for it and thus make them enjoy the story less once that happens.

** linkffn(11515212) Moderately good. Not too bad but I feel the story and characters are a bit under-developed

linkffn(3933832) A good one - though with more "Iron man" than actual Avengers (some characters still appear with active role)

I also remember reading a story with a Girl-Who-Lived, Harry was casted out and changed his name to "Kyle Tech". When he was over 20, he came back and... Just say things got /really interesting/. Check out the TV trope page for HP fanfic, I remember this story is up there

** I hope I've remembered the name correctly enough for the bot to find, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the invincible technomage) or something similar involves Harry being adopted by Tony Stark while young and then events spiralling out from there. Some things change, some do not, and afaik it's still ongoing (but slow)

**** Probably because the other side of the crossover, including the main character, does not seem to struggle with anything as far as the plot is concerned. So there isn't really much tension.
