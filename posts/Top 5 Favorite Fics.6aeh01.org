Someone made a post along these lines a few days ago, but I thought it didn't get enough attention, so I'm trying again.


** Tough question, despite its simplicity.

linkffn(Resistance by Lorien829) Dystopic but thrilling and it has a truly epic ending.

linkffn(Betrayed by kateydidnt) old fic but written so well that I can excuse some of its shortcomings, like the SuperHarry epilogue.

linkffn(Stages of Hope) struggling to hopeful ending must be a thing for me.

linkffn(A Long Journey Home by rakeesh) the only incomplete story on this list, I always get excited by an update and I appreciate that it's told in complete sections, almost like an Arabian nights collection.

linkffn(Make a Wish by Rorschach's Blot) - flawed, ridiculous, meandering and sorely in need of an editor, it nonetheless has some of the most enduring and funny moments that I've read.

And yet I had to skip numerous high-quality works by nonjon, BajaB, Inverarity, Ruskbyte, Northumbrian, Vera Rozalsky...

Agreed.

I'm glad you put Make a Wish because that is probably #6-7 for me. I re-read it about 6 months ago and I couldn't stop laughing hysterically, and it's pretty rare that fanfiction is able to even eek out an honest giggle from me. BajaB is a genius as well. Harry the Hufflepuff is a winner.

** 1. The Sacrifices Arc (first book is Saving Connor). Despite all its (many) flaws and tendency to drag on, it's still, in my opinion, the most "epic" fanfiction of all time, all 3 million words. It manages to use every cliché I thought I'd hate (bashing, evil Dumbledore, redeemed Death Eaters) and give everything a fresh twist. My favorite in the series is the 5th book for the sheer scale of the battles. I'd say this series is my favorite piece of literature, both inside and outside fanfiction. linkffn(2580283)

2. Ruthless. This fic is basically a nine-part oneshot, but it presses all of my buttons. The story of a ruthless, sociopath, powerful Harry taking down the world intermixed with poetic, dreamy writing is something I didn't know I needed in my life until I read it. And let's not mention that two guys sharing a girl while additionally being possessive over her (The pairing is HP/Hr/Theodore Nott) is also something that pushes the right /cough/... "buttons" for me. Why can't there be more stuff like this instead of the millionth harem? linkffn(10493620)

3. Hauntingly. Hear me out here. I used to think Voldemort/Harry was icky, and often I still do, but this fic portrayed their twisted, screwed up "romance" (that never overshadowed the main plot and was overall quite minor) as a tragedy, and it's somehow the one of the most canon fanfics I've ever read. Nobody's OOC: Voldemort is never redeemed, nor does Harry lose his goodness. This writer has some serious talent. linkffn(11685657)

4. Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived. Need I explain? Cool magical ideas and somehow it never felt like I was reading a textbook. Watching Harry being a nerd for 100k+ words got me hyped up to do my homework, and that's saying something. linkffn(5353809)

5. The Art of Self-Fashioning. I don't know why, but this fic presses all the right buttons. It's the story of how a ruthless, sociopath Harry detaches himself from humanity. The idea of Harry LITERALLY turning into a monster due to his obsession with wild Transfiguration is so unique. Overall the magic in this fic is intriguing. linkffn(11585823)

** linkffn(Brutal Harry) I like the premise and the grittiness of it. The fact that it's relatively short and is action packed is another plus. I don't like how it ended and the sequel leaves a lot to be desired but still makes top five.

linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) On the other end of the spectrum lengthwise but I love the world building, and what the author has done with the relationships. Some of my favourites characters are Luna, Greyback and Snape. They may not be canon but I'll be damned if I didn't enjoy them. Must be noted this is story is most likely abandoned.

linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) Again the action and the world building is excellent. I have reread this story three times now and it keeps me interested every time.

linkffa(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) and its sequel are so great another story which I reread every once in a while. I love the whimsical and funny nature. I wish there was more.

And now probably my most controversial opinion, on this sub at least, is HPMOR. I haven't read this since I first stumbled on it back in 2012 but this was the story that introduced me to fanfiction and I will always look at it with rose tinted glasses.

/Resurrexit/ suffers from this too and probably more so. Only ~50 reviews on 75k words over 21 chapters. The author literally dumped it all on FF.net in a day though, so it's not really surprising.

As for /Twelve Signs,/ I'm not really sure why it gets so little attention. Maybe only having 5 chapters hurts?

**** I guess you'll just have to read it yourself to find out :p

But seriously, it is very well written. Maybe I might have put it below /Unforgiving Minute/ if I'd've read that more recently, but it definitely earns a spot.

It /does/ help that it plays into almost exactly what I'm looking for in a story at the moment, but that hasn't really changed in a while and could probably be said of most of my favourites list.

linkffn(9911469) Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus: unique and absurdist fem!Harry, the side-fics are also great.

linkffn(12388283) The many Deaths of Harry Potter: Harry becomes progressively more cynical/insane as he comes back to life every time he dies.

linkffn(12132374) Six Pomegranate Seeds: time-travel Hermione as a Slytherin OC.

** [[/bookfortshy-r][]] [[/sp][]] Crossovers only! Because I can't be bothered to sort through the HP non-cross I have read. Sorted roughly in descending favorite-ness.

^{Knowledge requirements approximate. No guarantees.}

^{I don't think I've read/watched/played /any/ of the original material. Besides HP, of course.}

linkffn(Fair Lady by kideaxl)

- Sandman cross.* No knowledge needed. It's very sedate. I love it.

  ^{Barely a crossover.}

linkffn(Harry Five-0 by mjimeyg)

- Hawaii Five-0, Lilo and Stitch, NCIS, maybe more?

- Minimal knowledge, got lost a bit, rolled with it and loved it. I remember this as Feel-Good Slice of Life.*

  ^{My memory /might/ be fallible.}

linkffn(Something Wicked This Way Comes by The Mad Mad Reviewer)

- Disgaea. And a couple chapters of Slient Hill that I didn't like.*

  ^{I do not like /any/ horror.}

- I did this with no knowledge and I was fine. I think.

linkffn(Reinforced Magic by Lupine Horror)

- Minimal knowledge of Lyrical Nanoha needed. An incomplete series.

  ^{I lied, I like Lupine Horror.}

linkffn(Stories of the Lone Traveler by dunuelos)

- Minimal knowledge, various crosses, but mostly alt!Potter. Gets a bit theological in later installments.

- I have to recommend against the story* this was based on because of its poor quality.

** My top 2: 1. Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past Harry successfully defeated Voldemort but everyone he knows and loves is dead. So he tries to go back to the past and make things better, but things seemingly follow how events unfolded the first time, like fate wasn't to be deterred. I love this cause it's 10,000 words per chapter! And it is very well written.

1. The Dark Prince Trilogy Instead of Voldemort going to Godric's Hollow, Peter decides to bring Harry to Voldemort instead. Rather than killing Harry, he decided to raise him as his son. One of my favorite Dark!Harry stories. I love Voldemort's characterization in this story too.

** ffnbot!slim Some of my favorites are:

linkffn(Gabriel by Shikatanai) -- unfortunately hasn't been updated in over a year, but so well-written!

linkffn(A Sorting Like No Other by Stargon1) -- absolutely hilarious one-shot

linkffn(Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness) -- the only fan fic I've completely cried over

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) -- lots of scheming wonderfulness

The King's Indian Attack by Nectare [the link never works, so here's the summary.] Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy.

However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon) - It's the standard for the AU to me. Completely silly yet so much fun! 1. No Dumbledore bashing and 2. No shit bashing on marauders. 3. No silly plot regarding Lily and Snape. 4. No Hermione this and Hermione that. I would have pick Stages of Hope if it didn't have a jerk James and all almighty Hermione or A Riddled Universe if not for Snape-Lily subplot.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë by enembee) - Always love stories when Sorting Hat gets a bigger role. And I can't believe there's so few decent stories regarding sorting hat.

Linkffn(Path of Decision by lulu42) - the Slytherin Harry story I like most.

Linkffn(The Last Enemy by Luolang) - A toss between this and The Unforgiven Minutes for Dark Harry category

Linkffn(Mystery Tour by dungeonwonk) - The War effect on personal level. I believe who suffered like Sirius or Harry would definitely suffer PTSD.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

Others...

- linkffn(The Life and Times) - unfinished and probably abandoned forever, but wonderful Maurauder-era story. The best Jily I've read (and I've tried to read a lot...)
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?chapterid=485960&i=1][A Lightness]] - Lavender-centric oneshot, but beautifully written
- linkffn(Innocent) and sequels - a bit more run of the mill, and not super fast plot-wise, but a nice (mostly) feel-good-ish fic about Harry being raised by Sirius. I believe its sequels are still ongoing
- linkffn(A Call to Arms) - one of the best Hogwarts-during-DH fics I've read; more realistic imo than DAYD
- aaaand cheating in a sixth, linkffn(Cauterize) - beautiful oneshot about scars from the war. rec'd often here, and for good reason
