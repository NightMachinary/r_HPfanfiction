I genuinely don't get this unholy combination of tropes, even if it contains Dumbledore bashing. Hufflepuff Harry is supposed to take over the world via the power of his hugs, not join up with Voldemort to torture people.

Also, can someone suggest some nice, long Hufflepuff!Harry fics where (I can't believe this needs to be a qualifier) Harry isn't evil or sympathetic to Voldemort or whatever? Slash is fine, preferably Dumbledore and Snape critical, not necessarily Slytherin critical (because I don't think Hufflepuff!Harry would believe in evil eleven year olds).


** Well I mean Hufflepuffs tend to come into power in magical Britain a lot and I wouldn't be surprised if more dark lords came from Hufflepuff than Ravenclaw but.... I'm sorry can you suggest some evil Hufflepuff Harry stories? I've never seen one

*** Take a look at the Hufflepuff!Harry tag in ao3, most of them are Tomarry, and not in the 'Harry literally defeats the dark lord with the power of his love for Tom' way.

**** AO3 is pretty much a slash fest and one of the most popular slash pairings is Harry with Voldie... It is one of the reasons why I tend to stay away from that site

***** I don't mind slash. I just don't understand how Harry being a Hufflepuff translates to losing his moral compass.

** I have absolutely no idea where you saw this combination of tropes, but to be honest I must have read like 2 fics with "Hufflepuff Harry. Concerning the question"Why do these tropes coincide so often?", I have a few theories:

- Hufflepuff is the house of Loyalty and Hard Work. These guys are like born minions and I have no idea why Voldemort took the trouble to recruit among the Ambitious/ Back Stabbers Slytherin when he had the human version of House Elves availiable.
- Hufflepuff is often the forgotten house, the house seen as the one of the rejects. I guess it's the perfect house for a Dark Harry who want to stay low while at school (though it means your read a fic with a 11 years old kid already planning to become a Dark Lord in his 1st year).

I've always had trouble understanding the rationale behind this idea. How does loyalty + hard work equal being born minions/the human version of house elves?

**** I think it's a cliche born from their trait pushed to the limit. It's like saying that the "noble" and "brave" Gryffindor are a bunch of moron without an ounce of survival instinct. Or how all the Ravenclaw are a bunch of nerd who can't live with a question unanswered. Even if whole "pureblood nobility" Slytherin fit I guess.

â€‹

Hufflepuff characteristic are loyalty and hard work, 2 excellent qualities for a minion (loyal to the boss and never try to cut corner when working for him). These 2 characteristics also seem to fit House Elves (who LOVE to work, and seem physically incapable to disobey a direct order), even if these characteristics go way farther than humans with them.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
