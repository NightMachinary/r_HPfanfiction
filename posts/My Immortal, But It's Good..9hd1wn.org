Someone re-write [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6829556/1/My-Immortal][My Immortal]], but make it good.

Like Draco, Harry, Ebony and whoever all suffer from some sort of mental illness and they form a mental health support group at Hogwarts and do group stuff together, like go to concerts in Hogsmeade. Ebony falls in love with Draco and he starts going out with her, but it's all an act because he's in denial about being gay and loving Harry. Draco and Harry give in to their attraction to each other. When Ebony finds out about Draco cheating on her, her depression gets worse. Have serious scenes about cutting/self harm and suicide attempts. Also set it in the sixth year so the whole "Voldemort forcing a student to kill someone" bit can be in there too,... except that it's Draco having to kill Dumbledore rather than Ebony killing Draco. Have Snape be revealed as a legitimate pedophile, like him taking pictures of younger students or spying on them.

It would be a super dark story, but it could be /good/.

Oh, the avid writer in me is so tempted right now.

**** Not really. If you want a challenge, write a decent Harry/Lily time travel fic. Conditions:

Harry does not replace James

Harry tells Lily everything

Harry and Lily do not join the Marauders, the Death Eaters or Snape's self help group for dark art boners.

****** Ship them? Perhaps not, but I definitely want to read a decent fic that does it. It's about the only pairing with popular characters that I haven't actually read. At least, that isn't smut or involving a harem.

******* Right? I'm always confused when people assume Harry wouldn't be attracted to his mother on a subconscious level, even if he'd be uncomfortable with it consciously.

If the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westermarck_effect][Westermarck Effect]] is accurate, he's missing that early period of contact with her to desensitize him. If he met her via time traveling, she'd just be another pretty girl aside from his knowledge of the future.

******** Yeah, neither have built those mental barriers. At least, not fully. There would definitely be a lot of hesitance and undoubtedly some disgust, but those issues would be part of the pairing's premise. Part of why I want to read a Harry/Lily fic is to see how they deal with that kind of thing.

******** *Westermarck effect*

The Westermarck effect, or reverse sexual imprinting, is a hypothetical psychological effect through which people who live in close domestic proximity during the first few years of their lives become desensitized to sexual attraction. This phenomenon was first hypothesized by Finnish anthropologist Edvard Westermarck in his book The History of Human Marriage (1891) as one explanation for the incest taboo. Observations interpreted as evidence for the Westermarck effect have since been made in many places and cultures, including in the Israeli kibbutz system, and the Chinese Shim-pua marriage customs, as well as in biologically-related families.

In the case of the Israeli kibbutzim (collective farms), children were reared somewhat communally in peer groups, based on age, not biological relation.

****** Alcohol would be the obvious solution there. Like, Harry just wants to get pissed, Lily has the same idea, they sleep together while drunk and Harry only connects the dots on the next morning. And a 17-year-old Lily would not be the same person who stood up to Voldemort.
