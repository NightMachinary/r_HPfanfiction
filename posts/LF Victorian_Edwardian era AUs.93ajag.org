As stated, I'm looking for AUs set in the Victorian and Edwardian era, similar to [[https://fanfiction.net/s/11791951/1/The-Marriage-Market][The Marriage Market]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12875735/1/All-The-Important-Words-Unspoken][All the Important Words Unspoken]]

No particular preferences otherwise, everything fitting the bill is of interest, though nothing /too/ dark and preferably light hearted and slice of life as the two examples above. It can also be AUs set in other eras, important part is that it puts the main characters in another time period "naturally" and not through, say, time travel.


** Not from either era, it's set in WWII Blitz times, but I like A Petal in the Rain- It's a Lily/James romance fic with some dark themes

*** Much appreciated. Yeah like I said I'm interested in all AUs set in another time period, I just happen to love the Victorian and Edwardian eras extra much for some reason.
