I love reading Keira Marcos and the stories she writes, but I'm looking for stories inspired by her writing. Just read one on ao3 called “trichromatic” which was Harry/Neville/Draco soul bonded and traveling back in time to first year to fix everything before a magical illness started. Anyone else know of stories inspired by Keira Marcos? At least 100k wording, don't mind slash as long as it's not the main focus, no Snape/Lucius/Voldemort/Ginny paired with Harry or Hermione please.

Thank you!
