I really really really want to find out if someone has read a fanfic where McGonagall was a Death Eater. And a Death Eater with capital letters, not the lover of Tom Riddle or something like that.


** I have. I don't remember the title.

It was a parody of all the cliches in Harry Potter fandom.

She became a death eater because nobody ever describes the clothes she wears on. The fic goes to talk about how other characters have detailed description of their clothing but never Minerva.

Give me a moment, lemme search.
