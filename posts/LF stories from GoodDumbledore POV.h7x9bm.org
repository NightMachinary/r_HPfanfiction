** I remember one where a Dumbledore from a more optimistic AU is shunted into canon Dumbledore's body and starts fixing the local Albus's blunders.

The new Dumbledore has fond memories of being an actual (surrogate) Grandfather to both Harry and Neville and has to abstain from sherbet lemon's (American's don't @ me) because his new body is bit to pudgy for his liking.

I'll try to remember it and post it.

*** I think it's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9824342/1/Dumbledore-s-Next-Great-Adventure-Part-1]], but it always felt too much like a bashing story veiled behind a facade of "fixing mistakes of another Dumbledore" for my tastes.

**** Yeah that's the one, and you're right about the bashing. It does however show us a Dumbledore committed to Harry's well being.

*** I started reading this one maybe two weeks ago and I just can't continue. It's a great fic for someone who likes alternate universes and Dumbledore fixing his mistakes but it's just... too much 'Un-dumbledorish' to do the things he did. Well, I don't really know how this ends or what happens after where I stopped, so I can't be totally sure if I'll like it. I always liked that Dumbledore is not a completely light Character and I really enjoy ff where he is more of the good-grey (does it make sense ?)

**** Absolutely, conflicted characters offer a lot to any narrative!

Some stories are deliberately archetypal; the good guys are good, the bad guys, the worst, like in star wars... And that works for certain stories. But not for Harry Potter.

Incidentally I believe one of the reasons the new SW trilogy doesn't work is that it's trying to be nuanced in a way that is antithetical to the OT. Maybe it's the same thing in reverse here?
