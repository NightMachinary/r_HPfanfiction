Unbeknownst to him, he had just been summoned to another reality by their Dumbledore to deal with the Voldemort problem there. Lily, James, Sirius and more were alive there, but Dumbledore deemed the Girl-Who-Lived unfit for the task of Vanquishing Voldemort.

Harry, upon waking up there, decided to go along with everything, playing the part of the wide-eyed and awed hero. But inside, he was analyzing the situation, scenarios and schemes flashing through his mind.

This Dumbledore's greatest weakness, he realized, was his underestimation and alienation of the Girl-Who-Lived. She would in the end turn out as powerful as Harry himself, he knew.

With the right push, of course...

So Harry decided that the first order of business would be capitalizing on this. /Turning/ his counterpart would be a very rewarding task indeed.

The people of that reality did not know what was about to hit it.

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Post inspired by the one from today, about an old and world-weary Harry being summoned. I thought it would be interesting to look at a pragmatic, Dark-ish or Gray Harry in this situation.

Would he even have a quarrel with that Voldemort in the first place?


** "So since Dumbledore went through so much effort to summon you, a 'prophecied hero' who has defeated Voldemort, why aren't you going and destroying him?" Rose Potter asked him with a frown.

"...Because I have fulfilled the prophecy in /my world/ corresponding to me and defeated Voldemort. /Your world/'s prophecy corresponds to you... only you can kill Voldemort." Harry didn't expect her to beam like this - Dumbledore summoning him must have really alienated her.

"The way I defeated Voldemort probably won't help you - in my world, my mother Lily Potter left me the Power He Knows Not." At Harry's statement, Rose sighed and shook her head.

As it turned out, Lily and James Potter were alive in this world. And that meant that Sirius Black had sacrificed himself to save Rose.

Unfortunately, this meant that Voldemort's usage of Rose's blood at the conclusion of the Triwizard Tournament gave him more benefits. The reborn Voldemort wasn't the pale shadow he originally had to deal with, cornered by Dumbledore's schemes into a pig even Harry could slaughter.

Of course, currently Harry was strong enough to crush Voldemort himself. But that was a different matter.

"So, you can't defeat Voldemort. I definitely can't defeat Voldemort. Dumbledore can't defeat Voldemort, or he wouldn't have summoned you. Are we all doomed to die?" Rose said with a sarcastic tone.

"...Not quite. I can teach you some things that should get you strong enough to fight Voldemort. For example..."

Harry waved his wand and conjured a live parrot which loudly squawked. With another wave, he stunned it.

Rose was going to ask how conjuring parrots would help her when Harry pointed his wand and vocalized a spell.

"Avada Kedavra." A green jet of light killed the parrot.

With a wave, Harry vanished the dead parrot and conjured another one. "Voldemort's signature spell, the Killing Curse. I showed you the wand motions and the spell pronunciation. Now, use it on this parrot."

Rose gasped. But she didn't ask any questions, simply pointing her wand at the squawking parrot.

"Avada Kedavra." A green jet of light struck the parrot, causing it to loudly squawk and fly at the astonished girl.

Before it could touch her though, Harry waved his wand and vanished the conjured bird. "So there, you saw it. The Killing Curse. Voldemort can mow through crowds with this spell, while you can't kill a parrot. Do you know why?"

"Moody says that it requires genuine desire to kill. Moody also said that even if my entire class attacked him with that spell, he wouldn't even get a nosebleed." Rose said after a pause.

That's true. Voldemort can cast it as he pleases because he is a psychotic maniac who shattered his soul to remove the few inhibitions that remained. Yet you, the Girl-Who-Lived, managed to survive the spell. Why is that?"

"...Sirius. Sirius sacrificed himself before Voldemort, protecting me with the Power of Love. That's what Dumbledore said." Rose said haltingly, probably not even able to remember the man who gave his life to save hers.

"Yeah. I can teach you a bit about the Power He Knows Not, the probable Power of Love. I can also teach you about the powers Voldemort /does/ know. It will take time and effort for you to master the knowledge I teach you, but it will definitely help you. So, want to learn?"

** This kinda reminds me of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/790488][World in Pieces]] one of my fav Gen fics. Summary Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse

**** I would say so though he isn't super overpowered and more close to canon Harry. It's probably not quite what you are looking for. He resents most of the ppl of the other world for bringing him here and forms a sort of alliance with the AU Snape. In the AU world the AU Harry was said to have commited suicide but AU Draco doesn't believe it and ropes Harry into investigating. Turns out he was killed by Dumbledore in an attempt to take his place in the prophecy

After finding out Harry builds his own side of sorts

#+end_quote

Probably, yeah. Not because of any personal or moral qualms, mind.

It's just that Voldemort, in most forms we see across the multiverse, is an insane megalomaniac.

He doesn't share. He doesn't negotiate. He doesn't keep any deals made.

And is quite obsessed with Da Prophecy, so he'd be a threat regardless of what Harry did. How much of a threat is debatable, but still a problem needing a permanent solution.

This makes diplomacy and seeking any kind of equitable settlement mostly a waste of time, but using him to cause chaos and devastation so that people who would oppose DL Harry die fighting Voldemort and the rest are cowed... Now that's a thought.

Additionally, defeating him later would mean Harry would be able to benefit more when time came to finally remove 'Ol Snake Face.

I love this plot point.

Normally, the WBWL fics are all about WBWL, and the MC is edgier than a monofilament wire. This, however, introduces a secondary protagonist that is easy to sympathize with.

Rejected, lost... There is no Deus ex machina, there is no white knight here. The one 'saving' the Girl Who Lived has ulterior motives. And it's interesting!

Because we see the moral contrast: Dark Harry is this terrible warlord, conqueror and tyrant... But at the same time he's the one helping the downtrodden GWL we have come to like. He's using her... But he's also making her happier, safer and more aware than she had been before...

Yes, I absolutely adore the concept.
