A prime example is self-transfiguration. Canon Transfiguration is permanent, Transfiguration allows you to change the human body.

2 and 2 equals un-aging for all of time for any Transfiguration master.

Enchant jewelry with feather-light charm and you're suddenly Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon all over the place.

Aqua Eructo (Canon version of the fanon aquamanti spell) let's you send out a jet of water powerful enough to destroy stuff with no kickback. It's OP without any tweaks.

Refilling Charm is so broken it's not even funny. It refills a liquid in a container with what was last in it. The actual spell hints at being drinks but doesn't say anything about it actually having to be.

Just a few ideas to kick it off. The feather-light combo is one of my favorites just for the sheer fun of it.

What's you favorite OP or fun canon magic?


** Yeah, the refilling charm as it stands makes the whole 'you can't conjure food' thing really irrelevant for someone using a dram of foresight. Buy one bag of beef jerky; feed an army. Even if it's limited to liquids, you could refill a thermos of protein shake ad infinitum. Same thing using the duplicating charm/curse Geminio.

***** It is a toss up as Gamp's law says you can't conjure what it labels 'good food'. Sauces, wine and similar are allowed. To me that means they are conjuring food like things. It is lacking the appropriate nutrients and calories so it's not 'good food'.

So when you conjure food it's edible, and delicious, just not nutritious. At least that's my take on it.

** That water spell. Let's say you have a bottle of water that's always full, and see just how crazy you can go from there.

Take a pump, pump water out of the bottle as fast as possible, run it through a heater and let the steam come out of a nozzle, and you have a rocket engine that doesn't need fuel.

If you know a bit about rocketry, this is a complete game changer.

Attach it to the ISS, equip it for a long duration mission, and you can fly to Mars in a few months.

If you have lots of always-full bottles with multiple tons of water per second creation rate, you can use them to power lots of large spaceships. With constant acceleration, you can get quite far. Moon in 12 hours. Mars in 3 days. Asteroid belt in 4. Jupiter in a week. you can go anywhere in the universe in about 30 years of experienced time. You could easily visit another galaxy in your lifetime.

And that's just with magic water bottles, because they break conservation of mass.

Why learn the laws of aerodynamics when you can make a broom fly?

What's the point in learning how atoms heat or cool things when you can cast heating and cooling charms?

Wow, you learned material sciences to mine better and build more stable stuff. Yeah we just transfigured a stick into a perfectly decorated marble column. Which we enlarged and used magical support to ensure it won't collapse.

Cool life sciences studies you got going on there. We have crop charms to make it grow faster, healthier and easier wherever we want. Oh, we can also duplicate it as much as we want for free while keeping it edible and nutritious.

Everything muggles needed science to learn about magic users just waved a wand and made it all better. Why explore the secrets of the universe when magic makes everything you want a flick of your wand away?

Those rare few that don't fall into the laziness trap likely become unspeakables and spell researchers.

**** I kinda doubt portkeys would work that well. In canon it takes a short time (seconds) of spinning around to get from one end of the country to another. Hundreds of miles per second is fast, but you can go way faster if you just accelerate for a day. Constant acceleration is preferable to high but constant speed whenever you want to go really far. For 100 miles per second, one g of acceleration is preferable at about the distance to the moon which takes about half a day either way, but I'd prefer a comfortable spaceship to spinning around like crazy for multiple hours.

What's real interesting is the feather-light charm. It reduces weight not mass, it a goddamn gravity control spell! Also they have asecndo and descendo spells to make things raise or lower. Badass magical air ships without all the hassle of providing real lift or ballast as per physics.

Transfiguration and expansion charms means their house could have just as easily been a mansion.

Clothes, quills, parchment (would be solid money that's a real common spell), and most non book materials are covered with Transfiguration.

Food, hold it under preservation charms. Copy it, allowed under canon, and you only need to purchase food once a decade at most.

Transfiguration again covers housing extremely easily. Expansion charms make it even more amazing for cheap.

For an adult wizard there is little that they actually need to ever actually purchase outside a wand, potions/potion ingredients, and books. Almost everything else is a luxury good for them.

A poor magical family just makes no sense at all. Even if they are magically weak or something like that they can still do the same just in steps and slower.

****** I agree and disagree. Wizards and witches live in a post scarcity society, or at least they should, and have for a very VERY long time. The only reason I can think of for why the Weasleys would be poor by wizard standards is that they either can't or won't do certain things.

Their clothes are considered “cheap hand me downs” precisely because they have been transfigured and magically repaired so many times that they show signs of being transfigured/repaired.

Duplicating books (and other class materials), while possible, could be considered stealing, as well as (I assume) magical duplicates are A: not perfect, and B: can be detected and dispelled. Though quills, parchment, and ink aren't even on the Hogwarts equipment required list, so maybe they're an exception.

Not to mention that items that are inherently magical or are enchanted to be magical cannot be duplicated by a simple spell (or at least, you can make a physical duplicate with none of the magical properties). Otherwise, the economy would be unsustainable. I buy a top of the line racing broom, duplicate it 30 times and sell the duplicates for a fraction of the cost.

So, while the Weasleys aren't a poor family by Muggle standards - they never have to worry about basic needs like food or shelter - they can't afford to buy the latest and greatest magical nick nacks and assorted artifacts that people like the Malfoys can afford.

The Weasely family are poor because she needed a poor family and because they were horrible with money.

*** I'm not sure if canon transfiguration is really stated to be permanent one way or the other. My headcanon is it depends on skill - 'good' transfigurations will last longer than 'bad' ones. Basically, the more flawless a transfiguration, the longer it'll last.

There's some aspects to that in canon that might support it - for instance, conjuration (a subset of transfiguration) is explicitly not permanent, and bad transfigurations seem to revert on their own. But it's the type of thing where it's not stated outright either way, and people will read into it what they will. I personally think that if it's /easy/ to make transfiguration permanent (or last months/years), wizarding society seems like it'd be very different than it is.

Hagrid's highly flawed, failed transfiguration on Dudley (pig's tail) had to be surgically removed because it didn't go away.

The Ministry of Magic (who presumably know whether transfiguration is permanent or not) also sent wizards to attempt to Untransfigure Quintapeds, a magical species said to have been transfigured from humans centuries ago, so the Ministry at least appears to believe that transfiguration is permanent.

As for the Quintapeds, the story of their creation is a legend, and so it's not exactly clear what it can tell us about transfiguration in general. If we take it to be competent and knowledgeable about magic (and its capabilities), then a bunch of other worldbuilding questions pop up about transfiguration and the impact of it on the wider wizarding world.

**** It is heavily implied though you are right it is never stated strictly. Seeing as how a finite does not work on transfigured items and the only way to change transfigured items back is a few specialized spells I would say it is permanent.

***** Well, it's different than enchantments, yes - but I think the case could be made that just because you need different spells to force an end to transfiguration doesn't mean it won't happen 'naturally'. Just that it's a specialized enough change (eg, there are specific countercurses for certain jinxes that finite won't work on) that the general countercharm does nothing.

I think it's vague enough that it's heavily based on the reader - for instance, I'd say 'heavily implied' is too strong a wording

*** Legit, add in some shrinking charms and you could have an obscene amount of liquid in that jar. Shrink a tub full of ANFO into an unbreakable vial and have fun.

Maybe get really stupid with it and make some magically stabilized C2N14! by the swimming pool size batch at a time!

On another note a thin riot shield of unbreakable glass would be fairly wicked.

That unbreakable glass could be so heavily abused. Excellent idea, thank for sharing!

In others it was just a reverse bubble-head that blocked air (or new air) from getting in.

** This doesn't matter but I'm throwing it out there: aguamenti is canon (taught in sixth year charms) whereas aqua eructo is, I'm pretty sure, fanon, being (as far as I can tell) invented by The Santi in HPatBWL as the only way to (relatively) safely learn fiendfyre.

*** Aqua Erecto was in GoF game, which JK approved, as a spell taught to 4th years by Moody. The game came out around the same time the HBP came out. HBP was the first time the spell name was given. Aguamenti is less powerful than Aqua Erecto from the spell descriptions as well. In the book GoF Fleur used a non-verbal water spell, this was the attempt to name it as far as I can tell.

Canon aguamenti is either used as a stream or wave of water. Canon Aqua Erecto is described as 'thin fountain to an immense, powerful and destructive jet.'

Aguamenti is used to fill cups or fight fires. Aqua Erecto does that and knocks down walls.

Haven't read HPatBWL, link please I have no idea what that means lol.

**** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)

Fair warning that it's abandoned, most of it is only available on DLP, and I the last time I tried to read it on that site, I got some error message about my account not having proper clearance, or some such. As for the aqua eructo/aguamenti thing, fair enough, then. Personally, the only thing I really think of as canon is the original series of novels, so I tend to forget that there even are other sources to draw from. (That, and I actually only played the first three games.)

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** Withering curse and gemino curse on a grain of sand.

Obliviate (a la Lockhart) plus Confundus/love potions to make an army of mindless minions.

Fidellius chain of 3 or more locations, each person is a secret keeper for the next person and the last person is the secret keeper for the first.

Unbreakable charm on a blade transfigured to be about three atoms thick. Basically invisible to the naked eye and cuts through anything.

Drink Felix to brew Felix.

Make your Phoenix into a Horcrux. Make your best friend into a Horcrux, and have them make you and your Phoenix into a Horcrux.

Enchant an object to shrink and expand continuously, attach one side to a piston, enchant the entire thing to be unbreakable. Infinite power forever!

Transfiguration at the atomic level in general.

*** Yeah Felix is by and far broken beyond belief. A vial with about 2oz is enough to give you a perfect day. Not 8hrs or anything, a perfect day. The size of the container is crazy amounts of it. Sure overuse causes recklessness but who cares. Use felix to make a recipe that don't have that side effect. Each batch is brewed faster and easier with more common ingredients. It's a self sustaining loop of broken. Within months at the most, weeks more likely, you're a living god of luck.
