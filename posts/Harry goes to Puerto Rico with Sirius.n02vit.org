:END:
I don't remember a lot about this fic other than the fact that Harry goes to Puerto Rico with Sirius. He learns how to fight and gets better at magic. He also makes friends, some muggle some magical, and has a fling-type situation going on with a boy there (I think called Alex?). I'd be very grateful if somebody could find this, thank you.


** I'm pretty sure it's this!

  After the complete catastrophe that was fourth year - you know, triwizard tournament, death of a friend, the general fickle loyalties of the wizarding world - it's safe to say that Harry is nowhere close to being okay. Trapped and alone in a house that had never been his home, our favorite boy hero simply cannot resist opening the package his godfather gave him.What follows is a series of events including, but not limited to: the revelation of a long lasting crush, several parties, therapy, and one strangely happy goblin - not exactly in that order.Whatever the matter, Hogwarts, and the rest of the wizarding world, could never have prepared itself for a Harry Potter who embraced every facet of his personality - including the Slytherin bit.
