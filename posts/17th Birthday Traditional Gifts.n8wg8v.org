  ‘It's traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age,' said Mrs Weasley
#+end_quote

Mrs. Weasley specifies that it is traditional to give a *wizard* a watch. Do you think that this is just because she's currently handing one over to a wizard and Rowling never established a gender neutral term for magical people in her story, or do you think there is a gender divide for a traditional coming of age gift? If it's the second, what do you think a good comparable gift for a witch would be, or what is the best you've seen in a fic?

(I think I've seen a bottle of some sort of Amortentia scented perfume as the traditional gift in multiple fics. Is this fanon or backed up somewhere in canon? Because I'm not super into that as a concept.)

She most certainly did. The gender neutral term is "wizard". Either intentionally or completely by accident, Rowling made the masculine term double as the neutral, which is how English has worked for centuries.

*** Then why is the school called Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry? If wizard were gender neutral wouldn't wizardry suffice?

**** Because Hogwarts is a thousand years old, dating back to the times when the lingua franca was old English, which unlike modern English, didn't include the masculine as part of the feminine.

Alternatively, it could be because witchcraft and wizardry are separate and distinct things, but nothing in canon really supports this explanation.

**** Technically speaking, witchcraft and wizardry used to be two separate aspects of magic. Witchcraft was more the magic using a wand such as Charms and Transfiguration. While wizardry would be more Potions and Herbology magic along with rituals, somewhat like the "witches" at the Salem Witch Trials. It is only after each meant separate things that they now have been gendered.

Edit - fixed because I had them mixed up at first

***** You have those mixed up, which is understandable because of how the two are portrayed in modern times.

Witchcraft was hexes, curses, spells - which in HP would be things like Charms and Transfiguration. Every man and woman ever tried for witchcraft was accused of something like that.

Wizardry was alchemy and similar magical arts. At Hogwarts, that would be Potions, Herbology, and flying. John Damian was a famous alchemist in the court of King IV of Scotland. He became famous when he attempted to fly in a homemade chicken suit by leaping from the parapets. It did not work, but he survived, so... yeah. Mixed results.

**** Even when masculine terms can be used as gender neutral, there's nothing stopping you using both terms. "Actors" can mean both men and women, but sometimes you say "actors and actresses". Like they're not paying by the letter on the Hogwarts sign, they don't have to keep it as short as possible

**** If you go by folklore... witchcraft is a gender-neutral term. It refers to the act of practicing magic. Like witch and craft. Wizardry I think it has to do more with cultural aspects because we often hear terms such as wizard money, wizarding world, etc. So I don't think they were intended to be gender based. In fact it's only the HP lore that establishes witches and wizards as based on their gender. In classic folklore a witch is anyone that practices magic regardless on their gender, while wizards are the ones that have surpassed basic spells and rituals and rely more on conceptual magic and they are usually depicted as elderly men with long white beards and pointy blue hats with stars on them. However by the classic definition Lily should have been a wizard as well.

***** She was/is very good at worldbuilding, considering the succes and the interest of the world she's built. What you must understand is that - even though it doesn't feel like it - the harry potter world is soft worldbuilding, where the rules aren't hard and fixed and everything is mapped out, unlike hard worldbuilding, where it is. everything is made or written in service of the plot and Harry's experiences en viewpoint. And that's not a wrong approach. It just isn't hard worldbuilding, but it gets treated like that and under that kind of scrutiny it'll always fall short.

A good example of very soft worldbuilding are the worlds from the studio ghibli movies. A good example of hard worldbuilding are the Lord of the Rings books.

***** I mean we're on a sub of almost 70,000 members and there are dozens of other subs (some with even more members), her work has become universally known and there is a section in some theme parks based on her world.

** If there's a gender divide, then jewellery seems a likely traditional gift for witches. So maybe a pair of nice earrings/bracelet/necklace?

And yeah, pretty sure the Amortentia thing's fanon.

** I've looked into this sort of thing before, and as I recall, women started wearing wristwatches while men were still using pocket watches. And before that, they wore watches as pendants.

So depending on what time period you want to say the tradition started, it would make sense to give a witch what would essentially be a pocket watch on a longer chain.

Alternatively, you could look at it as "it's traditional to give children a piece of jewelry when they come of age," and watches are the only piece of jewelry that most men wear, so that's what they usually get. Women, meanwhile, could get any number of other pieces of jewelry.

*** I knew that wristwatches didn't start getting used by men until they started using them to sync up for military campaigns (with a huge surge in popularity during WWI) but I never realized that they were popular with women first. Thanks for that info!

** I think "wizard" is an acceptable neutral term (just my opinion) and besides Mrs Weasley was speaking in reference to Harry. And I think that a lady's watch is as good a gift, valuable and practical and symbolic, to a witch as well as a wizard.

However, IF fanon wants to consider another kind of gift for a lady, I think a necklace or bracelet with a kind of magical pendant such as found in Dresden Files would be a good gift.

I do not like the implications of anything related to Amortentia.

** Wizards probably receive a watch or something as significant because of their coming of age, if it's not just a Weasley thing: Witches... I'm not sure. What would a woman from a few centuries ago get from her parents upon reaching eighteen?

That's the sort of cultural norm you should look into for ideas.

Now, if they didn't give anything to daughters reaching that age (quite possible -- I know very little about that time period, honestly), I suppose something like a family pendant, ring, or heirloom would work for the story? Hair pins passed down from mother to eldest daughter, maybe?

You gotta remember that this "gender neutral" viewpoint is actually quite modern (being a few decades old at most) and not everyone subscribes to it (in this context, I doubt that everyone out there would give their daughter something the same they would give their son, if they still followed this tradition in the first place).

** It's not a traditional female gift, but in linkffn(The Peace Not Promised), Lily gives Severus a watch for his seventeenth birthday, and he gives her a crystal bottle containing a silvery substance charmed to form into the shape of a doe if left to settle. It's actually a portion of her own memories that she has forgotten, waiting for the right time to restore them to her.
