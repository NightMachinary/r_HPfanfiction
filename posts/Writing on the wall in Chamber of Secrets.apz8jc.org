I somehow got this headcanon that when the diary-possessed Ginny was writing threatening messages on the walls in Chamber of Secrets, she was writing in rooster blood. I mean, she was killing roosters anyway, and Molly's daughter must know a spell for keeping poultry fresh, and have a waste-not-want-not attitude, so it makes sense. However, when I checked the book, it didn't specify what she wrote with. I'm wondering what she had to write with, since it's not like she could conveniently go shopping for vandalism materials.

The book says the messages were “daubed” on the walls, which rules out, say, spray paint or (as would be appropriate for a wizarding school) magic marker. Would she have used just the normal ink for quills?

In a story I'm writing, which takes place years later, I want to make a brief reference to the messages being written in rooster blood, but would this be too jarring to people without this headcanon? Should I just say the messages were written on the walls and leave out what they were written with?


** Pretty sure that the book says it's paint. Movies is blood.

Edit: Yeah, books mention paint. When Voldemort is talking with Harry he mockingly recites some of Ginny's diary entries. One of those is about her being covered in paint and not remembering anything.

*** Yeah, but in that context, isn't it possible she only thought/hoped it was paint but it was actually blood ?

**** It's possible, but blood and paint are very different. And if you are covered in the stuff I reckon an 11 year old could at least recognise that difference.

***** Plus it's Riddle who mentions it, isn't it? Even if Ginny wasn't sure what it was, he would know.

** Chapter 17, Chamber of Secrets:

"Haven't you guessed yet, Harry Potter?" said Riddle softly. "Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib's cat."

Looks like rooster blood to me, not paint.

** I don't think that's head canon. I think that's canon.
