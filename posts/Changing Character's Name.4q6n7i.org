I took a long, long sabbatical from reading and writing fanfic. I'm now back and in the process of polishing some of the things I wrote, finishing the unfinished, and adding a couple more to fill the gaps in the saga of my OC called Alexandra Sutton - the stores all have HP-ish tiles along the lines of /Alexandra Sutton and the X/.

However, while I've been away, Alexandra Quick has come along and seems to have become HP fan-fiction's 800lb gorilla. There is no similarity in the characters other than the name (my Alexandra is British, a Slytherin and in the same year as the Twins). But the fact remains I now feel a little uncomfortable with her name and the story titles - I'm worried it might look like I'm doing the fic equivalent of an off-brand Chinese Lego knock-off called Lugo Blocks.

I do like the name a lot, and half-think I should keep it and not give a damn. But I still have a nagging feeling that doing a global search and replace with a new one would be quick and might be for the best. Any opinions?


** I would change it. Even if your story is good, people might write it off as a cheap knockoff. Or they might go into it thinking that it's that one story about the American they've heard, and then be super confused. Changing the name from Alexandra to a completely different name would probably be the safest option.

** If it's good, it wont matter. What does your synopsis say? That will be most readers first point of contact. So long as they read yours and can see how different it will be to AQ then you should be all set.

As a point of reference, here's the synopsis for AQ book one:

#+begin_quote
  */The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?/*

** Changing the name to a similar yet different name is what I would do. I would go for Alex. For readers who reread your fic it wouldn't throw them off entirely, and to new readers it isn't too weird a name and the name will probably flow with what is already written. And while yes Alex isn't too British a name, more of an american name, it isn't an impossibility.

*** That does seem to be best compromise.

*** No I haven't. I'll be honest and say that from the synopses, it didn't really appeal.

Though saying that has given me pause for though. In that although the characters are outwardly different, there may be similarities in personality I don't know about, and I really should sit down and have a read through.

**** Honestly, I think it best if you don't read it before you decide what to do about the name. That way you can at least claim that no, you have not read it, so people who have problems (because there always are people who have problems) can go away.

**** The synopses /are/ somewhat bland; they really don't do the stories justice at all. All four (to date) are incredible works of fiction, and I think you should read them just for the writing quality. I'm not joking when I say they're the best fanfiction I've ever seen.
