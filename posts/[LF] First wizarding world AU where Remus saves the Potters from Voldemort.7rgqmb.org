There's a fic where I think Remus gets a tip off from where he's spying in a werewolf pack and makes it back to the Potters on Oct 31. He sends James and Lily out the back and fights off Voldemort and barely survives. And then later on he realizes he got a look into Voldemort's memories, realizing the truth about horcruxes. WHAT IS THIS FIC??????? I know it exists but by god I can't find it!
