** It is not because of JKR, she is really cool with fanfic stories. There used to be an author who did try to sue for something which she claimed was copy of her work. I forgot the name.

And yes, I believe those disclaimers are pure [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult][Cargo Cult]] ... I believe, for the breach of copyright, you have to actively claim you own Harry Potter. If you say nothing, nothing happens, and JKR could be OK, and you own only rights to your own work.

*** Jim Hines did a [[http://www.jimchines.com/2010/05/mzb-vs-fanfiction/][decent rundown]] of the infamous fan fiction "lawsuit" that made everyone so paranoid.

**** Oooffff. Marion Zimmer Bradley was a real piece of work. She was an awful person, who turned a blind eye to her husband's paedophilia and was accused of sexually assaulting her own daughter.

*** No, it's trademark that has to be actively defended. Which made the EFF's idiocy during the Victoria's Secret/Consent thing extra infuriating.

There is, at least in the US, a fair use exemption to copyright for transformative works which is claimed as a legal justification allowing fan fics and porn parodies.

** They're a lot less common on AO3, possibly because the site itself has pages explaining legalities and ownership.

*** this indeed. Coming from a copyright specialised jurist, a fanfic either qualifies for a copyright exception or it does not. Most often it doesn't and as such is automatically a copyright infringement. Quite simple basically.

** If you use someone else's copyrighted intellectual property without their permission, that's copyright infringement. There are fair use exceptions for news, analysis, criticism, and the like. A judge will look at whether the new work transforms the old work, whether the new work is made for commercial purposes, whether the new work discourages people from buying the old work, and how much the new work copies from the old work.

Disclaimers, as far as legality is concerned, don't help you. Copyright infringement doesn't look at your intent. In fact, writing a disclaimer proves that you were aware that your new work could be seen as copyright infringement and you did it anyway. No way you can pretend ignorance when you're aware of the term â€˜copyright infringement'.

JKR can sue any and all fanfic authors for copyright infringement, disclaimer or not. On a practical level, published authors aren't in the habit of suing noncommercial fanfic authors. On a more practical level, I remember an FFN fic complaining about how FFN required a disclaimer and putting in a gibberish disclaimer.

So, disclaimers aren't worth much, don't bother unless someone like the hosting website insists.

*** Uh... depends how you're defining it. The intent behind a copyright infringement is very important as educational or critical intents are indeed some of the few exceptions where copyrighted material can be used without any consent of the creator and in direct opposition to the copyright holder's wishes.

Fanfiction doesn't fall under that generally, so JKR can take it down at any point.

** Way back in the day, yeah. It was a bit of a culture shock when I returned to the scene a few years ago and saw they weren't needed on Ao3. My mind was blown. I'm writing fic for fun again and it feels very weird to not need them and I end up still sticking them in out of habit.
