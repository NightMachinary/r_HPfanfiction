***** I hate finding an interesting looking fic with a good pairing and seeing it's a harem one. I've yet to read a harem fic where the relationships are actually good

****** Give [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12104688/1/Whispers-in-the-Night][Whispers in the Night]] a read. It has a rather realistic take on the harem fic. Relationships are reasonably deep. It starts off slow, but becomes Harry/Daphne/Susan after a lot of difficulties, then goes on to include Fleur. There is also talk of including Tonks.

** It's too early for me to agree and say that the Half-Blood Romantic is good. It's the best new Harry/Fleur fic, not that it has much competition. One thing that this story /did/ do correctly, is reignite some interest in the pairing, for which I applaud the author. I can't wait for Steelbadger's H/F, though.

From your list, I'll recommend older decent Harry/Fleur fics that you haven't read. They're either obscure or don't seem to warrant a read on first glance.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11825585/1/Gods-Amongst-Men][Gods Amongst Men]] -- It has all the failures that most H/F fics have, but it does manage to put unique spins on most of them. There's action, politics, vikings and much more. linkffn(11825585)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger-and-Rose][Dagger and Rose]] -- Perspicacity is a great writer. Give this a shot. People pointed out some elements, so I'm editing in that this gets very dark. As in people may drop the fic dark. I enjoyed it immensely regardless, but I can definitely see how many readers would be horrified. linkffn(4152930)

"Great" is a stretch, esp. with this, my rookie novel.

I'm doing a rewrite and appending the sequel so if folks have a bit of patience, well...

**** I humbly request that you remove THAT scene. You know the one, the one that everyone complains about. I feel like if THAT scene would be removed, then it is easier to consider the story as one of the best of the pairing, but it's really hard to say when THAT happens to Fleur.

**** Jeconais has his style, for better or worse, without much deviation: he reuses the same cliches, sets up largely the same villains, describes a similarly well-meaning-but-flawed Dumbledore, Harry tends to be implausibly effective, etc.

His strength is writing well, and adding some variety within them: Dumbledore ranges from clueless to antagonistic, the cliches are mostly well executed, and at worst his fics tend toward guilty pleasure, at best they're quite good. If you can stomache the cliches, I highly recommend him.
