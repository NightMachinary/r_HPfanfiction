Does the core of a wand have to be from a magical creature? Or could one use a magical item (or a regular item embued with magic) as a wand core?

First comment answered. Thanks

*** Well all that destiny stuff is fairly repugnant. People with short wands lack character. An people with blackthorn wands and dragon heartstring cores are drawn to the dark arts. Just like one is born a prophesied saviour and also already evil at 11. Meh.

**** replace destiny with personality traits and the conversation looks different. people have flaws. working to overcome them makes an interesting person... you get some free life advice with your wand. great deal, isn't it? of course the advice is given to eleven year olds... would be nice if there was a proper head of house at hogwarts who has the same insights as ollivander helping them along in their personal development.

***** Blackthorn is combative, but not necessarily evil. An Auror could probably be found with a Blackthorn Wand, and Harry was able to use the one Ron had gotten of the Snatcher reasonably well, if not as strong as usual from not having the allegiance of the wand.

Remember, Ginny used a Yew Wand, so the wood itself isn't evil.

****** Agree on the Yew/Ginny thing, but Harry can't use the Blackthorn Wand well enough, Harry didn't like it and had enough trouble with it that he quickly switched to Draco's wand once he won that one

** Yeah, I was wondering too because [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wand_core][the Wikia]] lists stuff like coral as a wand core, also.

*** If you click on the link that is the name, you will find out that /obviously/ wizards have their own fancy magical animal called “Koralle”, which is written as “Coral” on the wiki page for some inexplicable reason (most likely because their level of quality control is not that high).

**** Ooh; thanks for actually bothering to read that, unlike me, who just looked at that in confusion. But dammit, I was totally gonna go make a coral wand, lol.

** Part of a magical animal, or part of a magical plant. Basically, a part of something magical that lived.
