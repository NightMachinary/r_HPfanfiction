A while back I had just finished reading HP and was desperate for more content, so I pretty much spent the entire summer just reading the best fanfics I could find, and this one fact bothered me a lot.

Like in some Harry×Hermione fics they were 12 and already confessing their undying love for each other. It feels super unrealistic and is a bit disturbing tbh.

Don't even get me started on soulbond fanfiction. Hell in some Hermione was pregnant at 15!

I feel like there's just a lot of oversexualising in general in the fandom. I can hardly find good romance fics, and the romance in canon was horrible too.

I'm a part of multiple fandoms and it seems like there are more good gen fics (or just good romance) than in the HP fandom. What do you think?

(Sorry for any english mistakes and sorry if this has been posted before)


** Because the majority of fanfiction is written by teenagers who don't really have a solid grasp on how a healthy relationship actually works.

**** Despite me disliking Hermione as a character, linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution) will always hold a special place in my heart for crapping on that trope.

The Nazis didn't even try to implement anything anywhere near that degree.

Yes the Nazis are more sympathetic than the lawmakers in marriage law fics. Thanks deluded fic writers.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** First, I remember reading a rule on this reddit, about how 90% (or 95%) of fanfics are trash, and that there was some hidden gems among them. Harry Potter is the series with the most fanfics, so it has more trash than most (but also more "good quality" fics).

For the forced romance, I think it's due to 2 main reasons :

- a lack of understanding of how relations work by some authors. We all remember the "We we will together forever ever" couple that lasted 2 month from high school, you can imagine what happen when this people write romance.
- a lack of time/ interest : fanfic author are not professional authors, some of them may write fanfic as a form of training before writing their own books, but most only do it as a hobby. So these people write about what they want, except they may not be willing to do the pre work of these romances.

​

For example, let's take someone who wants to write about Daphne Greengrass, except he wants to write a teenage romance (so 5/6th year) without having to change canon before the divergence point. Well, throw in a little marriage law into the fic (no matter how horrendous it seem, or how CHILDREN should not be concerned even if it went to pass), and poof, you have 2 character already together without having to write about how their relations formed and you can jump to the frisky stuff.

​

Another example would be how to put together 2 characters that have NOTHING to do with each other (the 2 most obvious being Harry/ Voldemort and Hermione/ Bellatrix though any of the Hero/ Death Eater would follow the same path).\\
In some case (like Draco), when the character is not unredemnable ,you could try to plant the seed of a relationship when they are still young and write about how they are troubled with their feeling for the enemy and how it make them thing about their convictions for later abandoning them (or not if you want drama), basically a cursed lover plot.

But with some other character like Bellatrix, you can put a soul bond or any plot device to force them together and go straight to the smut. It's as the author prefer I guess.

*** linkffn(Potter Ever After)

Anyone who writes a relationship should read this.

Personally I think it's a form of wish fulfillment (there's that ironic echo). Some people are suckers for the bad boy getting redeemed. Some want a harem, or the bookworm is secretly hot.

It all bores me personally. I'd rather read a fic on friendship than anything.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

** Something to consider is the filtering on FFN. The other replies have good points with regards to average age of the writer but in my opinion the filtering system deserves some of the blame. If you don't have a paring, your fic can't be found. Therefore to get your fic seen you want a pairing of some sort in the same way people on AO3 over-tag.

*** Keep in mind how the FFN filtering system has been revised over the years (!)

For a long time there was no pairing checkbox, and the summary was solely responsible for the pairing. This wasn't anything like a standard, so there's not a good technical way to set the new characters and pairings on behalf of authors who haven't logged on since then. That brings us to the current state, where most new fics are tagged properly, but if you go far enough back in the archive the /lack/-of-checkbox doesn't mean anything.

Crowdsourcing the problem doesn't seem right either. There are cases where the right setting is obvious, but some where the pairing is a spoiler or just not that important to the story.

The community mechanism /is/ a mechanism for discovering stories of many stripes, but I couldn't say how it compares as a way of driving clicks.

** Eh, people write about what catched their fancy, whether it is an interesting concept or a romance between their favorite characters. That second one is a popular section.

And fanfic writers are not professionals. Most don't do a stellar job. And a good romance using established characters does take some skill.

Anyway, I would differentiate between 'kinda forced' like soul bonds, love potions, or memory alteration vs 'writer forcing a romance on characters who don't pair'. Two veeeeeery different things

**** I've always assumed the lack of implications was the attractive (and interesting) part. If you lived in a world where you could magically control feeling, what is the ethics of that?

What about the difference between "real feelings are still there but potion keeps a replacement overlayed on it" vs "magic actually changes what you feel permanently"

What are the implications of self medication (if you have the (pretty common) "You are a good girl, we are good friends, and I don't want to crush your feelings, but I just don't find you sexually interesting", and there is now an option of modifying your feelings rather than giving a rejection)

** I think a lot of it is due to writers (and reviewers) being in a hurry.

If you're setting out to write a story of how Harry meets Hermione (purely by way of example) on the train, gradually fall in love and live happily together ever after, you've got about three years to get through before they're of an age where any kind of sensible relationship is likely, and five before they're at the age of consent in the UK. Plus then two more before we can talk about it on Reddit. 🙄

Rather than put in the graft to fill those years up with interesting stuff, a lot of stories simply cram in loads of stuff about destiny and blushing and hands brushing against each other and then just go for the sex when they run out of things to say. Plus you often get reviewers pushing the author to move faster. It's one reason why stories about pairings and nothing else aren't worth the bandwidth they consume.

There's a reason why JKR didn't have any romance stuff in canon before book four.

*** Yea this is definetly a valid reason. It's a problem with a lot of HP fics. A lot of them aren't even finished past like year 3. You have to be really dedicated and have lots of time to make an AU that covers the entire series will all 7 years at Hogwarts.

My biggest problem is that the parents never end up saying anything and just kinda acept it.

*** Ok, wait a minute. Kids get in romantic relationships when they are twelve years old. By that age they aren't children anymore - they are going through puberty, getting bombarded by hormones and hit by an awakening sexuality. Most kids that age aren't yet having sex (let alone getting into life-long marriages with The One True Love), but kissing and desire are happening at that point.

If anything, Rowling slowed Harry's puberty. I'd say Stranger Things, specially during season 2, did it right.

** FFN and Ao3 have separate ways to specify in metadata what 'era' contains the events of a story, but I think we could get a more interesting answer to your question with a breakdown by individual book(s) covered. Or year(s), but this is complicated by authors who 'move the entire plot forward in time'.

The earlier books hooked the world on the series. There's a large possibility space, the principle characters aren't busy fighting something like a war, and the tone is rather light. This influences which books people remember best and where they want to set their stores. When else to a story that completely ignores the thread of Voldemort? (Although many do even in stories set vaguely after year four.) But to write a romance, they work with the characters they have...

Some stores are entirely made of their romance, and others have something else going on. Canon put very little weight on the romance, which also provided a lot of fuel for the community to write about 'romance'. One way to think about writing is to notice how many different things are being advanced at once by a scene. In some of the stories you mention, the number of things is not always /more than zero/. The words are just /there/.

(Of course, this criticism works for stories set after Hogwarts too. If the focus is still the main characters in an established relationship settling down and starting a family, that's... not what I want to read.)

Fortunately for us, there are a good number of fanfics, some but not all matching the original's 'flavor', that don't have the failure modes you've described. Some of them are completely free of romance, others hint at the beginning of one, and a good number develop a romantic relationship.

They're just hard to find. Ah, well.
