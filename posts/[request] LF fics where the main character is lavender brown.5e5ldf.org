** The definitive Lavender Brown story to me is tehtarik's /[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?chapterid=485960&i=1][A Lightness]]./

It's a canon-compliant character piece taking a look at Lavender Brown from her childhood all the way up to the Battle of Hogwarts. In canon, Lavender is principally portrayed as a ditzy, fairly shallow sort of individual.

However, the author is able to take various details we know of Lavender (she was in Gryffindor, she's friends with Parvati and adores Professor Trelawney, she joined the D.A., and she stayed to fight against Voldemort and the Death Eaters and other bits) to create a complex, three-dimensional character. Lavender has her own hopes, dreams, fears, and insecurities and the author does a good job of teasing it out. Lavender reads like a person here, and that's a difficult thing to do.

In addition, the relationships throughout the story are well-characterized, especially her close friendship with Parvati. It was particularly interesting to see the romance she tried to develop with Ron from her side of things. Lavender's character in this story feels a logical extension of canon, because there's enough evidence to suggest that she isn't simply some ditzy, shallow bimbo as /Half-Blood Prince/ almost seemed wont to suggest, and the piece overall is an excellent examination of her character.

I'm not aware of any other comparable pieces where Lavender Brown serves as the main character, but I think you'll enjoy this one.

** Northumbrian has a few Lavender focused stories that tie into the others which often feature lavender as a supporting character. I think Moon and Brown are the main two but I haven't read through the whole list in a while.

**** Seconding that guy. Northumbrian's arc for Lavender Brown is great. However, her story is kind of interwoven throughout quite a few stories, only a few of which she's the main character in. Those are linkffn(Bare by Northumbrian), linkffn(Moon by Northumbrian), linkffn(Brown by Northumbrian), and linkffn(Troth by Northumbrian). I think that's all of them.

The problem is, though, like I said, there are a number of other stories he's written which greatly inform the reader about her personality and circumstances. At the very least I would recommend reading linkffn(Hunters and Prey by Northumbrian) in addition, but she pops up in a lot of his stories.
