Just what it says on the title. Harry does not need to be the main character. What I'm looking for is Bad ass grandpa Harry. He does not need to have any family either. Just old Harry who is feared by almost everybody as the Big Good. Make Harry the boogieman of the story. crossovers are welcome.


** So you're looking for some mash of Albus Dumbledore Madeye Moody harry? I would love to read something like that

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

** If you like Firefly and don't mind crossovers, try linkffn(2857962) Brown Coat, Green Eyes. Harry is 150 or so (tho he spends most of his time looking younger with cosmetic magic), very powerful and eccentric. It's very well written as well.

** Here is a story where Harry is not only a pretty badass grandfather, his grandchildren play a fairly large role in the story:

[[http://archive.hpfanfictalk.com/viewstory.php?sid=330][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]]

PS - Ron is also a fairly badass grandpa. So is Draco Malfoy, although they are definitely not friends.

** There was a one-shot, but I can't remember the title.

It was a family reunion with the Potters discussing if the grandchildren would go to war or something like that. If I remember correctly, it was on the premisse that the Potter family is always involved with conflicts and the story was the new generation clashing with the older, less idealistic, one.

If someone knows the title, I would appreciate.
