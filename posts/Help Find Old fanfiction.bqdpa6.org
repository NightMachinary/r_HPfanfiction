:END:
I need help finding an old fanfiction where Ron is wheelchair bound. He is dating hermione but he discovers her with Harry in bed while she is comforting him. Due to that misunderstanding ron breaks up with hermione. Later hermione dates harry. Somehow hermione has to leave to go back in time through stones? Harry and ron end up together. In the end they are h[[/r/hr]]. Its a pretty old story.


** Sounds kinda whack, but I do hope you find it. Sorry I can't really be of help.
