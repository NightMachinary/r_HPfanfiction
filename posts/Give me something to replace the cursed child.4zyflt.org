I'm looking for some good next generation fanfiction with a decent plot and a Scorpius Albus pairing. Because I just didn't find the cursed child up to par and I can't believe they set up Scorbus and didn't follow through. Thanks!

Also technically it's Cursed Child compliant, but it doesn't affect anything that happens, aside from an off reference here or there.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

** I second Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time. And its sequel that's in progress, extremely long chapter (averaging 15k), a very very accurate depiction of all characters involved and a switch between Albus and Ginny POV (or Harry and Scorpius in the sequel) that makes it even better. Frankly one of the most well-written fic I've read in a long time ! Oh and the Cursed Child compliance does not impact the story (although I don't mind it at all, but some of you still do ;) ), it gives a really deep background for character interactions !
