  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

  What would happen if a neglected blade, broken in anger, was reforged by someone else? Someone who connected with the spirit it contained, but who was not its original owner. Not a yaoi pairing, sorry if that's what you like.

Oh my god yes. This was maybe the third or fourth fic I followed back in 2010 or so. He stopped updating for like 3 years, and then went massively nuts with it. it takes creature fic to a whole new extreme.

******* Not really immortal or serpent things - they are recreating a hybrid bloodline, of sorts, that was used in Romania in the medieval ages before it died out. The accidental recreation is nicely set up, with biology sciency-babble to explain it, and a few "Chekov's guns". Not really crazy as fuck. And it's not really that powerful either. The Story also lacks the "adults are useless" trope, and the characters learn that they are not the biggest players around.

Also, it's 4th year, not second. The reason for the changes starts in 2nd year, but the story starts in 4th.

All in all a solid "Powerful Harry" story without going all-powerful.
