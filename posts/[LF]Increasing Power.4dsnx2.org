So I was wondering if there are any fics where Harry gets continuously more powerful, BUT he meets newer and newer enemies that can still challenge him/her?

If there are any Fem!Harry with this, thats extra good :)


** linkffn(8233291) fits what you want to a T. Silently Watches has done a great job of making the protagonist strong but also having strong enemies. It really picks up in book #2 as book #1 has her walking over people a fair bit early on.

Only downside imho is her terrible childhood. To the author's credit she does not get explicit about anything... /thank god/. But there are plenty of allusions to some pretty terrible stuff. The upside is after the first few chapters it stops being shoved in your face as the author develops other parts of the story.

--------------

As an aside, if you are gonna write OP protagonists, you need OP enemies to have a meaningful story. Otherwise it just turns into the hero roflstomping over everyone. :/

** I guess the Hero trilogy by joe6991 meets this requirement.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero) and its sequels.

*** This series is a fucking ride if you stick it out. I enjoyed the first book, LOVED the second, and just kinda liked the last one.

*** This was one of the first fics that I ever read and I loved the first book of the series. The latter 2 books I liked significantly less so but that could be because at the time a lot of it went right over my head being new to the fandom having seen nothing but canon basically. One day I will get around to rereading it and seeing how much I really like the series.

** linkffn(A Butterfly Effect by SlyGoddess) is fairly close to this, sadly the author is dealing with health issues currently so hasn't updated in a long time. Well worth a read imo, although it definitely isn't everyone's cup of tea.

That said no matter how you feel about the summary or anything, read the first chapter. The Sirius/Peter canon moment is written out here, and is without a doubt my favorite interpretation of that point.
