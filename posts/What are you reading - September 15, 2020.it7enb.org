** Because it's been many years since I last read it, it feels like it's the first time I'm reading this story: linkffn(Gabriel by Shikatanai)

Harry has been found and adopted by a rich, traditional Wizarding family with mixed ancestral roots (French, Indian, Russian). He grew up away from England and thus, didn't attend Hogwarts when he was eleven. He underwent a ritual that made him look more like his adopted family; only his green eyes have remained. He becomes heavily involved in the head of the family's (his uncle's) business, which involves dark lord-ing.

Harry grew up in France and spent most of his time training in his uncle's military but also received schooling from Beauxbatons. He eventually comes to Hogwarts in sixth year due to an exchange student program which started after the Triwizard tournament was reinstated. His uncle convinced him to do so their family could keep a closer eye on Voldemort's resurrection and activities.

As I write this summary, I feel like I am not giving the story much justice. I found it interesting and the first 30 chapters have not been annoying to read. I admittedly skipped parts of chapters 30-36 because of a major event in the story but then again, I tend to skip chapters that cause discomfort for the main character. (i.e. I always skip the chapter in Philosopher's Stone where Harry was shunned by his fellow students for getting caught sneaking Norbert out.)

** Love is a 4 Letter Word by Philo [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4267422]]

SS/KS/HP but the beauty is the plot. Twenty years after Hogwarts, Ginny is brutally murdered and Harry dedicates himself to solving the case. There's a lot of really amazing details and world-building (Harry works as a magical carpenter/furniture maker) and the twists are truly unexpected without being unbelievable. The characters are true to who they are in the story (they may not be true to the books, but this is set two decades later, so I give the author a pass there). All of the actions and dialogue really make sense and there's not a lot of "wand waving" important plot points. The slash relationship really is part of the story, and there's a long subplot of Harry and his friends/family coming to terms with his sexual identity. The only thing I eyeroll is the amount of power Harry has, but it really doesn't help fix anything because it's a mystery story.

I have pretty high expectations for fics and I can firmly rec this (and Philo's other work) if you can handle the slash.

** Alastor Moody and the Methods of Engineering, linkffn(12810590). I'll abbreviate the title as AMMoE.

This is an alternate ending to HPMOR and won't make sense unless you've read HPMOR. Without going into spoilers, HPMOR has a "final boss fight" near the end, that was very suspenseful but disappointed some readers, as they thought Harry's "solution" to the scene's big predicament came out of nowhere. AMMoE has that scene come out differently, which takes the whole story in a new direction.

In the HPMOR AU, Petunia marries a biology professor (Michael Verres) instead of Vernon Dursley, so Harry is brought up as a science nerd. In HPMOR, Michael and Petunia are mostly background characters, but in AMMoE, Michael is a major character who does a lot. Petunia does less than Michael, but she is in it too.

I like it. It is in a "science fantasy" style, unlike HPMOR which is more like hard SF. AMMoE involves using a combination of magic and muggle science to fight (of course) you-know-who. Rather than being painstakingly detailed or else drenched in techno-gibberish, the science is simply handwaved as if it were like magic. This works because the story is quite intense and the sciencey devices don't pretend to be more than scaffolding to keep the plot going, and that in turn is ok because the story outshines the gadgets.

The fic is pretty well written (vivid descriptions, good turns of phrase, not too many grammatical errors) so it's strange that the thing is completely loaded with spelling errors. It says "Voldermort" all the way through, "plack" instead of "plaque" (this word is used many times since there is a significant plaque in the story), etc. It's possible that the author is a non-native English speaker who has a good ear for the spoken language, but not that much exposure to how the words are usually written. My other main gripe is that the very end (last page or so) is quite abrupt and makes no sense to me.

So: minuses for the ending and the spelling errors, but pretty good in other regards. Worthwhile for HPMOR fans who want to keep exploring that universe. There are some other HPMOR side stories that can work ok for non-HPMOR readers, but I'd say this isn't one of them.

** I've just finished linkao3(14041326) The Harry Potter characters read canon. It isn't something that I ever thought I'd like but I loved it, and am now reading the sequel. It's like Gogglebox (a show I also thought I'd hate but actually love) or like some of the really good discussions on this sub.

The author does a really good job of dialogue and the characters ( the reader characters) seem very alike their canon selves. It's all satisfyingly seamless.

** - “A Switched Chance by LunaStorm” linkffn(6685668) ... one more representative of “[[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/dudley-has-a-witch-as-a-daughter.html][good setup, but missing plot]]” category: original idea (switched Harry/Hermione) is nice, but the author didn't have some original plot, so he didn't know much what to do next and just basically followed The Stations of Canon and thus the result is quite boring (with some lovely small scenes in between ... Leia terrorizing Peeves is great).

- “Perilous Journey by sbmcneil“ linkffn(8281675) ... nice story, and when something is going on, very well written. Except. There are long and long passages (whole chapters sometimes) which are completely useless and forgettable. Zillionth chapter of Harry-unpacks-his-first-Christmas-gifts (sob, sob!), fifty times repeated dialogue of older wizards and witches how Dursleys were awful, gratuitous chapter of wizard duels and training, complete guided visit of the Warwick Castle, and that kind of stuff. Whole story (255k words) could be cut easily /to/ a quarter of its size (not /by/ quarter) and the result would be much better. The second thing, and I am really not certain whether it is wrong or just very original is how sudden dramatic scenes are. Harry and Ginny go to visit Hagrid's hut, and ... two paragraphs later, he fights for his life; Harry happily finishes his OWLs and .... I know it is kind of realistic, because disasters in the real life don't have build-up, but in the literary form it feels kind of distressing (which perhaps is the right thing; not sure). Also, slightly unnecessary Hermione bashing (her close-mindedness and insensitivity is just played too many times). Three stars out of five (and that's ignoring the need to skip a lot). Small recognition award for Emma Charles ... I just love this kind of character (see also, Bobbie Beadle from “Friends and Foes by Northumbrian” linkao3(3068435) or Kim Hunter from “One World by Stellar Magic“ linkffn(8993792)).

  Harry and his friends finally know who killed Ginny and Luna's classmate, Colin Creevey. It is 2001, and the search has been ongoing for a year. Will those final few foes who escaped justice at the end of The Battle ever be brought to justice?

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.

**** I am afraid The Accidental Animagus is a way better. One World starts really well, but then it quickly spills into Harry-knows-everything and yes-he-is-super-Hero, and yes Voldemort is super-anti-Hero, and I stopped caring at that point (except for Kim Hunter killing the Albanian demon, that was cool).

  AU: Who is Hermione? No one knows her real name or where she came from. Her handler has always been Severus Snape, who has trained her since she was a small child to be the perfect agent to keep Harry Potter alive despite all the things and people working against him. The greatest mystery of all, however, is one even Hermione doesn't know: her own past. [Eventual H/Loki]
