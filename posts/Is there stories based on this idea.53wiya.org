I've seen shit ton of fix-it sort of time traveling story. Or Harry going to 70s/40s & either joined Dumbledore, became lover of Snape/befriended with Marauders or apodted/joined Voldemort. Or this type of common cliches. Please don't suggest this type of fictions.

Is there any fiction where Harry went to past(let's say before Voldemort's rise) & became a Dark Lord/Gray Lord? And he didn't associate either of Voldemort/Dumbledore/Grindelwald. He simply became a Dark/Gray Lord of his own right? Perhaps became the most feared person in Europe, not only Britain? So feared that even Dumbledore wouldn't dare to meet him? Harry's reputation would be so that Voldemort would acknowledge any type of offer to become a follower would be synonymous to insult?

*** Thanks for the suggestion. I was looking for different type of story where Harry antagonize both Dumbledore and Voldemort & Harry definitely not evil, also limited bashing or no basing. This story far too cocky for my taste.

**** Ah, ok. I think I see what you mean; the Harry in this fic is way OP and the narrative emphasises on it a lot. It was the only fic I could think of that kind of suited what you were looking for though, so :/ Good luck finding the fic you want!

***** Honestly, I don't think there's any good story written based on that idea. I was thinking about a plot for a new story.

So wanted to know if there's some stories comes closer to that.

****** Hmm... yeah, I don't think you'd find that many. In fact, Harry becoming a Grey/Dark Lord independent of Dumbledore and Voldemort is something of a rarity. I mean, I've seen plenty of independent!Harry fics, or Grey!Harry fics, but Harry ruling the world? Not very often.

If you do write a fic like what you've described above, link me? I'd love to read it.

** Might not be what you want but in circular reasoning Harry is hella dark from fighting against Voldemort & Co. He travels back to canon timeline (year 5 IIRC). He's definitely is not on no one's side and makes many changes. may be a bit to oc/au though. linkffn(2680093)

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.
