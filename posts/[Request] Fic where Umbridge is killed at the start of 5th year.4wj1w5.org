Either by a student or a teacher fed up with her. I'd love to see a fic that explores the ramifications.


** Not at the start of the year, but linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has someone murder her later in the year, and it has serious consequences. (It's not the main PoD, which is that Fudge, rather than disbelieving in Voldemort's return, decides to appease him instead.)

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11933512/1/The-House-of-Potter-Rebuilt]])

Excellent fic to me. I'm partial to disobedience writer though. Still, one of his best I reckon.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.
