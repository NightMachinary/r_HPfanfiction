I remember Harry being the one to bring the letter from Hogwarts and Petunia walking out once she finds out.


** There is a zillion stories like that (after all, it was originally planned in DH Epilogue and JKR mentioned it somewhere), most of them limited just to the arrival of the Hogwarts letter and frantic Dudley's call to Harry for help. There are few worthy of reading though:

- linkao3(Holly at Hogwarts: Now and Forever by Forest_of_Holly) with its many sequels is head and shoulders above all others, but it is very different from what you expect
- linkffn(Dudley's Memories by paganaidd) with some sequels
- linkao3(Dursley's Daughter by writerer) conspicuous by its normalcy: this is not an adventure story, but (well written) more teenage high school story, where the high school is Hogwarts (plenty of nice Qudditch, she is the Hufflepuf Keeper). There is WIP (almost dead) [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/51279347-dursley%27s-dilemma-sequel-to-dursley%27s-daughter][sequel on Wattpad]].

#+begin_quote
  In an interview, JK Rowling once said that she thought about writing Dudley Dursley into the Epilogue with a magical child. What if she had? This is the story of Dudley's daughter, Esther.Entering her sixth year at Hogwarts, Esther is becoming sick of stereotypes. Sorted into Hufflepuff as a first year, she feels destined to be only loyal and diligent: qualities of a sidekick, not a leader. And it's her last name, Dursley, that causes the uncomfortable disconnect between her and the Potter-Weasleys without them getting to know each other at all. But as she slowly befriends the Slytherin Scorpius Malfoy and captains her house's Quidditch team, Esther has the chance to prove to Hogwarts that not only is there more substance to Hufflepuffs than meets the eye, but that all stereotypes - of houses and last names - can, and should, be crushed.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

**** Uncle Harry is one of my favourites. It's kind of interesting to see a mentally damaged Daphne (I know, I know it's just for comedic purposes, but she really looks like she's actually not all there in the head).
