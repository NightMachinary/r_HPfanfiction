I've had some ideas rattling about in my head for a while and I have finally got up to doing something about it.

Mainly, in this case Harry Potter was never born and we got a girl insead. A girl that looks just like her mother, but she has her father's smile. ( I thought his smile would be more of a defining trait for James rather that just giving the girl his eyes.)

Couple that with the idea that strict parents (or relatives) create sneaky kids and there goes my first fanfic.

English is not my first language and I've never written anything before so advice is welcome on all areas, grammar, British vocabulary, plotting and characters included.


** Send me a pm when you have time :) I'm not a native English speaker so British slang is definitely not my area, but I could help in other areas (at least I hope I can - I've only published a couple of stories so far, and people seem to like them, but I have several things in the works and tons of raw ideas)
