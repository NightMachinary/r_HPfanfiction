I dislike most of /Cursed Child/, but Delphini has grown on me because “Voldemort has an infant daughter” opens the door to some really beautiful and thematically-resonant possibilities.

If Harry, an unwanted orphan, makes another orphan, then he's got a choice he can make---and nobody's going to blame him if ignores Delphini or drops her off at ye olde wizarding orphanage or whatever. But if people know who Delphini's parents are, or if there's a chance they could find out, or if Harry just feels overly responsible for the situation, he could take her in himself, closing this tiny loop of orphans making orphans and raise Voldemort's daughter because it doesn't matter whose kid you are or where you came from, nobody should grow up the way Tom Riddle or Harry Potter did.

(I know that the epilogue gets a lot of flack, but I'd've loved it if the purpose of the epilogue was to show, not how terrible Harry is at naming children, but that Delphini had grown up into a perfectly well-adjusted eleven-year-old girl. It reinforces the power of love, it reinforces how we are not defined by our parents or background, and it reinforces that Tom Riddle, too, hadn't always been a monster.)

Anyway, “Harry adopts Delphini” is something I just can't get out of my head. I'll take anything, even badly-written stuff.


** After watching the mandalorian I always had this headcannon where Harry discovers who she is during his early auror career and goes on a dangerous chase around the world to save her. And then raise her as his own, of course.

It would just be so poetic for him to just think of leaving her to someone else at first but then remembering his own childhood and deciding to be a better man than Dumbledore/Voldemort.

** So in Harry Potter and the Language of Serpents, book two of The Problemverse, Snape survives the final battle and adopts Delphini, pretending to be her biological father so there's no "Voldemort's heir!" bullshit. Harry is Snape's apprentice (this is an AU where Harry is less quick to anger and more interested in chemistry and potions than canon) and lives with him, so is a major part of taking care of baby Delphini. It's really not long enough but does definitely give some good Harry caretaking the baby feels.

  Harry Potter, recent vanquisher of the Dark Lord and potions apprentice to one Severus Snape, is absolutely certain he is going to have a peaceful year learning the secrets of the most elegant magical art. The mysterious baby girl Snape declared his daughter after the Battle of Hogwarts can't possibly cause any trouble, surely? She's a baby. Babies are easy.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

But I was desperate for a "Harry adopts Delphi" fic so I binged it anyway, lmao.

I'm sorely tempted to do that rewrite, actually, but, I've already got a bigass fic I'm writing, so...probably not for some time to come.

****** =[Ctrl]+[Shift]+r= ... you have still old cached version. Otherwise, you would see:

I saw a week or so ago [[https://youtu.be/BaN78rXX6Lc][this comment]] on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally][the riots in Charlottesville]] by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The thing which particularly impressed me was his memory of growing up amongst bitter and depressed former Nazis, who knew they were fighting for the horrible cause, and what's even worse, they've lost. “They lived the rest of their lives in shame. And now they're resting in hell.”

I would love to read some novel about this environment, but I would love to see the parallel in the Harry Potter world as well. That's the world where this Delphini would grew up, and where Harry would be searching for her.

And yes, of course, I have to mention [[https://youtu.be/hn1VxaMEjRU][this clip]].

** I liked Cursed Child more than any of the films. It was apparently really good as a stage show. A lot of the parts people disliked make sense when you realize it was written to be a stage show not adapted into one. I dont consider it canon per se but canon adjacent. ( same with Fantastic Beasts) I think it would be neat if someone wrote a similar story but more within the rules of the HP verse. delphini was super interesting as an antagonist.
