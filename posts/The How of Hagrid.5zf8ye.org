I can't have been the only one to have wondered about this. I mean, from a purely practical perspective, the fact that Hagrid exists at all is at least a little fucked up. He's only a half-giant and he is clocking in at [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid][11 foot]]. [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Grawp][Grawp]] is described as being 'small' for a giant at 16 feet. I don't think it's at all unreasonable to assume that [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Fridwulfa][Fridwulfa]] would be on the order of 20, particularly since giants can get up to about [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Giant][25 foot]]. Think about that. Really think about that. Then think about how Mr Hagrid was apparently short enough that Rubeus could pick him up and put him on top of a dresser at age 6. This guy has to be barely brushing 5 foot, and he did the frick-a-frack with a 20-25 foot woman?

How, physically, was Hargid even /conceived/? The average male in the US is about 6 inches or so, little less usually. Scaling up for a giant, we should be looking at something more in the range of 20+ inches at least, and a comparable girth. How would Fridwulfa even know something was happening? Talk about 'is it in yet', Mr Hagrid would probably need to use his entire forearm to finish her off.

Now obviously, magic probably helped. There are engorgement charms and swelling solutions, so perhaps temporary massive size increases are doable. But that's still weird! Giants are sentient and no two ways about it, but they are also demonstrably /dumb/. Not troll dumb; they have a (limited) culture, and can make clothes and things, but they have a demonstrated decision making ability somewhere on par with an 8 year old. Nothing against the mentally handicapped, but this is almost predatory here. And it still doesn't add up!

Fridwulfa apparently abandoned Grawp because of his short stature, same as she had Rubeus. Mr Hagrid was besotted with her, enough to be very emotionally distressed when she left, even though from all appearances she was an apathetic mother at best who likely only became interested in Mr Hagrid because... she thought that really short people would rebound with their kids?

This is all very fishy...

*** That is a not unreasonable line of thinking; Hagrid is apparently fully able to use magic despite being only half-human and yet still retains at least some measure of his giant magic immunity. It would also explain why half breeds are /so/ rare, despite their being maybe half a dozen known semi-humanoid species: normally it wouldn't work, but if you throw in some dark magic...

I mean seriously; non-human fetishes are pretty darn common, so why aren't there more half-centaurs? Because the only way to make such is by dark magic.

**** We do know in the books that Giants are patrilineal however. Or at least there exist tribes that are ruled by men. So sexual dimorphism doesn't seem like a valid interpretation.

Perhaps Giant tribes are like bees and ants in that the "leaders" are biologically different from the "subjects"?

******* It is somewhat unlikely, but not unheard of, particularly in fiction. You ever read anything by Larry Niven? The Kzin females are non-sentient.

Something almost like that already exists in nature too: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglerfish][Anglerfish]] males are vestigial; they burrow into the side of the female and fuse there, only providing sperm while their brains and other organs dissolve.

Though, yeah, admittedly it does seem unlikely.

If you like classic sci-fi, yes, actually. I don't know if I would describe any of his stuff as 'groundbreaking' but it is definitely pretty solid. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringworld][Ringworld]] in particular is probably worth a read. His aliens are even /alien/, with weird thought processes and so on.

** From one of my unpublished fics:

#+begin_quote
  She walked Harry close to it so that he could see the yellow-violet color with the square-bubbles forming and popping on the surface. “See that? Its a Draught of most-likely Improbability. Its a close relative to Felix Felicis, if that tells you anything - and it should, by the way. Its used for... uhm...” she looked at the one-year old body of Harry and had to remind herself that in large parts she was talking to a seventeen year old. “Its used for... well, do you know Hagrid?”

  Harry nodded.

  “Well, his father must have drank the potion in order to... make Hagrid. You understand?”
#+end_quote

But yeah, I agree... halflings like Hagrid are kinda weird.

Though I seriously doubt that Fridwulfa had anything done to her against her will. Intelligence of an 8 year old or not, I'd guess that the answer to unwanted advances from a single wizard would be a tree-trunk to the face.

I also like the idea that someone already proposed, in which Hagrid was an illegal experiment. Its even the right timing to connect it with Grindelwald's mania for strong, destructive magicals.

In the same vein, whats up with Flitwick? Though, I have to admit that my headcanon there prominently features the words "You don't understand, Dad! He loves me and I don't care about my future in Gringotts!"

*** Flitwick isn't a half-goblin, though. He's quarter- or even eighth-goblin, according to Rowling. Other than that, my headcanon for how half-goblins arise is that by virtue of being half-wizards, half-goblins are allowed to have wands, and some goblins rule that allowing their children to have wands and attend Hogwarts is worth diluting Goblin blood.

** My understanding is that giants are /not/ naturally dumb like trolls --- they just have a caveman-level type of civilization, and wizards, idiots that they are, have made no effort at all to do anything about it, content with just keeping them contained in a reserve. As for the physical side of things, I do think a temporary Shrinking Charm was put on Fridulfa (or the other way around).
