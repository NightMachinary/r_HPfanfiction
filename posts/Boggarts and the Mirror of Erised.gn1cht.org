I remember seeing a meme that mused on how disturbing an idea it would be if the Mirror of Erised(which shows the deepest desires of your heart) and boggarts(who show your deepest fears) showed the same person.

I then realized that probably exactly describes Molly Weasley. The Mirror would show her family, alive, healthy, happy. The boggarts would show her family as well, but miserable, suffering, dead.


** Dumbledore might see Grindelwald.

** This kind of fucked me up because I know for a fact that my boggart would show the same woman who would show up in the mirror. She would be healthy in each. I know for a fact she is the worst possible thing that ever happened to me yet I also love her more than anyone else in the world. It's fucked.

**** Lol don't feel bad. I have been very honest with myself about her lately. I know the score.

** What if you keep them both facing each other and they have some sort of silent battle with the boggart showing the mirror's deepest fears and the mirror showing the boggart's desire.

I think the boggart's deepest desire would be to stop being laughed at, and the mirror's deepest fear would be the Queen from snow white and the seven dwarves.

*** Nah. The boggart would just be staring at the Mirror and muttering to itself, “That's what I look like? No wonder I have an instinctive need to shapeshift whenever someone sees me.”

**** Turns out an untransformed Boggart looks like a realistic version of Missingno from Pokémon. Just a blob of pure glitched reality. It transforms because the human mind is unable to comprehend the Boggart's true form.
