While reading a (admittedly terrible) fic featuring a "Manipulative Dumbledore", I just had a thought about how his character bashing seem different from the others bashed characters (at least for the HP fandom).

For most of the other characters, their bashing seem to at least take root into their canon faults, which are turned to 100 : Ron goes from a fairly normal teenager with his imperfections to a representation of Sloth, Envy and Glutony. Ginny goes from a girl with a Heros Crush to the Queen of Loves Potions. Hermione from a good and polite students to a worshipper of adult authority. And the list goes on.

But in the case of Dumbledore, he seems different since when bashed, his motivations are always the complete opposite of what we are said in canon :

- "/Dumbledore is keeping Harry in the Dark about everything because he is a lamb for slaughter/". In canon, Dumbledore clearly say to Harry that he kept him in the dark not only because of his connection to Voldemort (anything said to Harry could potentially be learnt by Voldemort), but also because he loved him too much and didn't want to put such a burden on him.
- "/Dumbledore want Harry under his thumb because he is following the prophecy/". Dumbledore does not believe into prophecies, he is "training" Harry because he knows Voldemort does (or at least has a grudge to settle with Harry) and because Harry would never accept to leave Brittain behind and flee without trying to stop him.
- "/Dumbledore is plotting to controle Magical Brittain/". Before OotP and Fudge's slander campaign, Dumbledore just had to show an interest into the MfM position to be elected. The only reason why he is only the Headmaster of a School is because he does not believe himself with power after his youth with Grindelwald. Even his power positions (Supreme Mugwump and others) seem to be more honorary than with any actual power.

I just find it interesting how fanfic authors try to justify Dumbledore plots by making him the complete opposite of what canon said about him. It would be like justifying Snape hate toward Harry by making him some kind of Lockart ("/Of course I gave him a detention for breathing too loudly, have you seen his hairs? There is no way I'll let such a birdnest go unpunished/".)


** LiathGray's response is really well written and summarizes things much the same way I would, so I'd like to address instead something that you said in your post.

This is the problem. People that bash Dumbledores character are not flanderizing and radicalizing his canon characterization, but his canon actions. In canon, his words, motivations, and characterization as seen through the lens of other characters is mostly positive, flawed still yes, but mostly positive.

His actions however are inconsistent with that characterization. When someone seeks to reconcile the characterization of Dumbledore with his actions (leaving the school by broom when he knew Voldemort was after the stone, letting Snape bully students for years, sending Harry to the Dursleys without any safeguards or explanation to Harry, not figuring out the Basilisk or Chamber, etc etc) something has to give.

For some authors that comes through the crafting of explanations, contrivances that explain away most of the issues, that tie Dumbledore's hands so he couldn't act better, that make the bad decisions he made the better of two bad choices, and so on.

For other authors the explanations come easier when not portraying Dumbledore in a positive light. Why did Dumbledore leave the stone behind protections that seem particularly suited to the experiences and talents of Harry Potter, Ron Weasely, Hermione Granger, and Neville Longbottom and then leave the school by broom? For these authors (and supported by JK herself via Dumbledore's words and Harry's conclusion at the end of the book) the only explanation is that Dumbledore specifically chose to engineer a situation in which an eleven year old boy would confront his parents murderer in a scenario that the child believed to be life or death. Even if there were a million safeguards in place, including an invisible Dumbledore actually standing between Harry and Voldemort at all times, placing a child in that situation is fucked up. Creating the situation by letting the child figure out clues and "[doing] things the right way" before making it seem like the fate of the world was in their hands so they would rush into what could have been their doom is manipulative.

Those explanations for Dumbledore are what get expounded on, and blown up, and exaggerated to give the Dumbledore of bashing infamy, not his canon characterization.

**** A big one where he completely fails to walk the walk is his remark on his unsuitability to hold power with regards to turning down the ministry. While he may have not been using his position as headmaster to plot evil plots in canon, having power over the youth of the country and what they are taught is a huge position of authority. Not to mention that he is also the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot.

Some fics turn those positions into mostly ceremonial ones with no real power in order to close the plotholes, but otherwise Dumbledore is in a position of power over foreign delegates, the judicial system, and the education system. Not so afraid of power as he claims.

***** Even if we assume that all the other positions of power are ceremonial and all Dumbledore is is a teacher and guide, he still continously misuses that power.

He puts the whole school at risk in his plan to draw out voldemort in philosophers stone. We know he knew or suspected Quirrel at least, even if he may not have known that Voldemort was possessing it.

In goblet of fire he essentially allows Fudge to use extra-judicial powers to kill Barty Crouch, in the same school that he had promised a year ago that he would never allow a dementor to enter.

Most tellingly for me, in half blood prince while knowing that Draco Malfoy is trying to kill him he puts the whole school at risk yet again - Katie and Ron both could have died because Dumbledore does not do anything about a serious plot of murder that he knows about. Malfoy is able to bring dangerous and sadistic death eaters like Bellatrix Lestrange and Fenrir Greyback (who we are told 'likes them young') into the school and only Harry distributing Felix Felices and great luck saves children from being killed. At best we can say he was protecting Snape's position as a spy, but once again he compromises the safety of the students to do so. Dumbledore is a terrible headmaster.

****** Throughout canon Dumbledore consistently shows that he cares more about the possibility of redeeming one "bad" guy than all of the innocents they harm. That also bleeds into how the OOTP initially engages with the Deatheaters. Why in the world would you start an engagement against known murderers, rapists, and terrorists with stunners etc instead of more damaging curses to put them down.

Hell he knows that lucius was responsible for the diary entering the school and then lucius is stopped in mid killing curse and is allowed to leave with no consequences. Harry's memory could have been used to give the DMLE enough justification to pour Veritserum down lucius' throat.

Even that is a terrible argument.

Harry openly accuses Malfoy of being the one to attack Katie. He also has attacked Harry at the very start of the term. Even if Harry has no proof, he can use that excuse to "investigate" Malfoy and get rid of him. Or at least neutralize him by forcing him into an Order safehouse to keep him away from Voldemort.

Snape is an Occlumens; he can /lie/ to Voldemort, if needed. As long as Malfoy is alive and well, and Snape intends to kill Dumbledore, he remains safe from his stupid decision to give an Unbreakable Vow to a woman who had no power or influence to compel it.

******* But does he stand up for the underdog? Let's look at two cases:

1. Hagrid was expelled and his wand snapped for something he didn't do. Okay, so Dumbledore wasn't the headmaster then so he couldn't stop it, but he did get Hagrid hired as the groundskeeper. That is the ONLY thing Dumbledore did for Hagrid: he got him a job (as a thirteen-year-old, but that wasn't all that unusual back then). He didn't clear his name, doesn't give him any way to continue his education, and when Fudge comes to cart Hagrid off to Azkaban in Harry's second year, Dumbledore is unable to stop his arrest. It's only after the events in the Chamber of Secrets that Hagrid is exonerated (with no apparent input from Dumbledore). THEN, I guess Dumbledore could be said to "stand up" for him by making him an instructor... a person who never finished their third year, didn't take OWLS much less NEWTS, isn't an accredited teacher (not that that seems to be an issue in JKR's world) and hasn't legally been able to use a wand for 50 years. That's not an underdog, that's a disaster waiting to happen (and it did).
2. Remus Lupin was allowed to attend even though his is a werewolf, but only by hiding that fact from the entire school. Is that standing up for an underdog (no pun intended)? Only if it was not an isolated case. How many other werewolves are out there, denied an education? Remus is proof that they can safely be educated with other children, but does he use that example to allow other werewolves in? Well, we don't know for sure, but the fact that Remus is still a SECRET werewolf when he comes in to teach indicates otherwise.

It can be argued that both of these cases are outside Dumbledore's scope. So let's talk inside his scope: NOT ONCE does Dumbledore do anything about the rampant bullying in his school. Not even lip service. There's no greater underdog than a bullying victim, and Dumbledore does nothing but condone it by his silence.

******** I believe our differences of interpretations are not so much about Dumbledore, but our broader differences in how we read literature in general, specifically children's fantasy literature. It's not a problem to have different frameworks, it is just a way to understand how we read and understand texts and it helps us understand how others do too. But literary theory is expensive, dense, time-consuming, confusing, and therefore useless. I loved these books and I loved talking about them so much that I wanted to do it better. I'm four years into an essay about Dumbledore, even. I keep changing it because I keep learning more about literary theory and how to apply it to understanding his characterization, I'm still a long way off, but I'm trying my best. It reminds me that meme where people tell big HP fans to "read another book!", but I think re-reading is the best way to truly understand a book, and even better if we truly truly love it, because we can more easliy make thematic connections that are harder to make if we didn't actually /feel/ the story through enjoyment. These books inspired me to explore literary theory in a way no other book would have done. I love HP more than ever, so I think it was a good thing overall, but this thread made me cry the other day because I realized everything I've done in the last four years is useless and will never be useful. This is not towards you, but I can't help feel like the general online fandom hates these books. Most aren't interested in exploring why they think the things they do; for example, Aberforth is taken as an unbiased source of information. Why do we see him as unbiased? I find that most people are not interested in exploring that question. I know fans can't actually hate the thing they love, but every time someone posts something they like about the books, the comments are always negative, almost belittling the poster for not realizing that the thing they love is actually problematic or even evil. As if growing up is realizing the books are bad and we should feel bad for taking so long to realize it. As a writer myself, fanfiction and otherwise, I cannot imagine writing anything as good as the HP books, so I am okay accepting that it has flaws without being negative about it. At least, I hope I am. I'm not out here trying to say JKR is a genius or anything ridiculous like that, but I also want to enjoy the stories again, enjoy them as inherently unrealistic fair- tale-like stories, not a reflection of our reality. I want to talk about the books without getting depressed for days. I did not fall in love with a realistic world, I fell in love with a fictional whimsical one. I'm interested in theme and character which are inherently things that don't exist in real life. We can never know real people the way we can understand fictional ones, they are designed for that very purpose, to feel real when they actually aren't. But I feel so alone in this fandom for that. What does theme matter in discussion like this? World-building is obviously important, and I'm not going to say the HP one is perfect, but it's more humorous than realistic, and I think that is what it set out to be. But it feels like if there's not an explanation of what, for example, the Wizengamot actually does, then it's filled in however most damages Dumbledore, rinse and repeat for every world-building gap. On top of this, I just get confused about what people in general actually want Dumbledore to be. There are so many mixed messages. Here I was thinking people wanted Dumbledore to share information to delegates so they can do things instead of himself, but then someone in this thread gets upvoted for saying Dumbledore should have become a dictator. I just get exhausted. I was a grown ass adult crying over an online discussion about a children's book the other day and then had to explain why to my spouse and my mother. Obviously that reflects my own flaws, but nevertheless, I've got to take a break from the internet fandom.

Cheers, and thank you for your interest in talking about Dumbledore. I'm sorry I can't carry on the conversation.

Do you know where the term "dictator" comes from? It was a Roman office, an office with vast emergency powers only bestowed upon for the resolution of a crisis or after 6 months.

The knights then provide a military service to the barons, which the king can demand to use if necessary. At least in feudal England, calling someone a "lord" was a relative term to indicate one's specific superior (overlord, landlord, lord of the manor, etc). The term is used differently in different situations and evolved over time (which is of course why Voldemort can call himself a Lord, for example), but that is my understanding of its use during feudal England. There's more to feudalism, obviously, but regardless, I don't think this is the type of system used in 1990s magical Britain. There is no indication of royalty, barons, or knights.

There is an Old English word spelled the same "mugwump". Which means “Mugwump is a derogatory word for somebody in charge who affects to be above petty squabbles and factions. So when your boss tries to make peace at the meeting table like an impartial angel, he is being a mugwump.”

And it is a title for someone at the head of the ICW, kind of odd how such a title can be removed by a national government though.

As for Chief Warlock, this is noted:

There were three successive heads of the Wizengamot who possessed chestnut and unicorn wands, the combination, as Garrick Ollivander noted, showing a predilection for those concerned with matters of justice and law.

Which suggests that they are indeed the head of a law court.

Just saying "So and so is the head of X" says literally nothing about how much power they actually wield, both in terms of what they can actually /do/ in that position and in terms of how strongly they can hold on to that position.

Take a real world president for example: there are clearly known/laid out powers of each country's president /and/ it's very difficult to (legally) remove a president from their seat regardless of how much they're pissing off the other powers that be. So we can call "president" a powerful position because a president can do and influence a lot and push a lot of boundaries during their term without retaliation.

Or take Elizabeth II, as another example, she is technically Canada's head of state but has pretty much zero real-world influence on the way the country is run. However she is pretty much set for life (literally) in her position and it comes with a lot of known, huge benefits so you can still call it a powerful position because she exerts a sort of meta-influence due to the wealth and respect she commands.

Then contrast that with the Supreme Mugwump position, where 1) we know literally nothing about what executive powers the holder has, 2) we don't know of any extra benefits to the position like wealth or artefacts, and 3) it's apparently very easy to get kicked out of the position, to the point that the British Ministry could do it just because they didn't like what Dumbledore was merely /saying/. What then is the power in such a position?

***** Sure, but as a witness to Dumbledore's general character, you can't just write him off. Without knowing the detailed situation, he pretty shrewdly has worked out the general nature of what Dumbledore has asked Harry to do, and something of the character of how Dumbledore asked him to do it.

That doesn't mean Dumbledore was wrong, or that Aberforth is right, but it does tell us something about Dumbledore's general character as seen by his brother who has stayed in touch his entire life.

If you combine that with Dombledore's canon actions as seen through more adult eyes, along with even how Dumbledore himself explains his actions, and Snape's memories of Dumbledore explaining things, it gives a less wise, more arrogant, more utilitarian, picture.

And I think that's great! The books grow up with Harry. Harry loses all his mentor/father figures over the course of the books, either because they die or because he can no longer see them in that role. The seventh book is a long, slow process of Harry starting to see Dumbledore as a human who may have made some bad choices and can be questioned, not a mysterious, wise, elderly sage. It is that hard part of growing up in which even the most loving parents let us down.

  Sure, but as a witness to Dumbledore's general character, you can't just write him off.
#+end_quote

I certainly don't write him off. I am genuinely frustrated that this is apparently such a controversial idea. Aberforth is /clearly/ biased about his brother, /and he should be/, but that does not change the fact he is biased. Albus has never been open with his brother /about anything/, so of course Aberforth will not understand the situation. Aberforth think Albus was /happy/ when Ariana died. That is the height of misunderstanding Albus!!

But readers have an advantage over Aberforth, /we/ have access to more information than he does. We have thre knowledge that books are designed to be known, they are not chaotic like real like, so we understand that when Albus picks a grave marker, it has meaning, and there is so much meaning in Ariana's gravestone. "For where your treasure is, there will be your heart also". The wiki has this to say about what this means in the context of the Bible,

#+begin_quote
  In the previous two verses Jesus explained why one should store one's treasure in heaven rather than on earth. This verse states that if one places one's treasure in heaven that is where one's heart or attention will be. This is an implicit warning, which is made clear later in the chapter, that if one's treasure is on earth, one's heart and attention will also be on earthly matters, to the exclusion of God. While the previous verses stated that placing one's treasures in heaven was wise, this one shifts to warning that not doing so might lead to a life of futility seeking treasures that will not matter in light of eternity. Matthew 6:24 makes this explicit. This verse also makes clear that treasure is not some specific collection of objects, but is rather anything that one values in life.
#+end_quote

Isn't there any meaning in this? Doesn't this show us where Dumbledore's mind was at the moment Ariana died? Doesn't this reveal that Aberforth is uninformed about the inner-workings of his brother's mind?

Then there's the Elder Wand. Dumbledore spend years /avoiding/ doing the right thing, avoiding going after Grindelwald, because he was scared that Grindelwald just might know the actual spell which killed Ariana, and that it just might have been Dumbledore's own spell that did it, and the fear and terror of that truth paralized him. His defeat of Grindelwald does not prove he is brave like his contemporaries believe, because the reader is privileged with more information on him than Dumbledore's contemporaries have. We can see that Dumbledore's defeat of Grindelwald reveal he is actually a huge coward. And it was this cowardice that delayed him, he feared the death of his sister so much that it was stronger than his desire for the Elder Wand. The manner in which he wont he wand (the symbol for desiring power) shows us that he had conquered that particular trait, but it also shows us how little he conquered his fear of others' death.

Dumbledore's own death by the Resurrection Stone is another example of how little Aberforth understands his brother. Dumbledore never learned to accept the deaths of his family, he never grieved in a healthy way, or moved past his own shame and culpability about his sister dying, and this "weakness" (though I would probably fail here too) lead to him losing all rationality and picking up the Stone. The madness of his reaction reveals his character, reveals his weakness, reveals that Aberforth does not understand his brother when he thinks Aberforth is happy to be "free" that Ariana and the rest of their family is dead. Harry and the reader is privileged with understanding the fuller context.

Aberforth is a fantastic clue to understanding Dumbledore's character, but it doesn't mean his information is accurate. Same with Rita Skeeter, Aunt Muriel, Doge, Bagshot, and even Snape in the pig for slaughter scene serve the same function in the story as Aberforth, they make us doubt Dumbledore. It is up to the reader to use their information and compare it to what Dumbledore's says in King's Cross and in all the other times he's sat down and explained his thoughts. That way we find the reality, and it does not paint Dumbledore as a perfect character, because that is /not/ what I'm trying to say. But it does show us that Aberforth is biased and misinformed. It's not his fault, but he still is.

I am not a child who can't look at Dumbledore as flawed. I am an adult who tries very hard to understand those flaws. He is interesting to me because of why he is flawed, because of what I've learned about him and the books through exploring these flaws in extreme detail. He is interesting to me because of the mystery techniques used in revealing his flawed character to the reader, he is interesting to me because nobody knows him entirely and only Harry and the reader are privileged to have access to that information, so discovering who he is becomes a journey. And part of that journey is realizing, among other things, that Aberforth is biased and misinformed. I do not feel like this is radical thing to say based on his presentation in the books, and based on his insistence that Albus is happy that Ariana died.

Even if we as readers of the first book didn't know of Dumbeldores ability to apparate at the time, when taken as a whole he does have that ability. Peoples issues with Dumbledore is an in universe examination of actions and motives, not a literary stance. The in universe nature of the examination by nature precludes any hand waving regarding tone changes in the books or ideas Rowling hadn't had yet. In universe , apparation exists, Dumbledore can do it, and he chose to fly to London, giving Quirrel the opportunity he had been waiting for.

*** It's true that Dumbledore's actions are the result of plot necessity in many ways. That being said, most people that write fanfiction aren't looking at it from the perspective of plot devices. They aren't bashing the actions of JK Rowling the Plot Device Creator, they are examining actions and decisions of an in universe character and bashing the actions and decisions of the character.

In other words, the actions of Dumbledore the Plot Device are justifiable, the actions of Dumbledore the character are not.

An example that highlights the opposite is the Eagles in Lord of the Rings. As Plot Devices, they only show up as deus ex machina to rescue characters from impossible to escape situations. This seems unjustifiable to many viewers as they could be so much more helpful if they took a greater role rather than staying deus ex machina. As Characters though, they are little defined except in the Simarillion which explains their nature, their role in the world, their motivations, and their actions. (Also a little critical thinking explains why they didn't just fly the eagles to Mt Doom but that's another post)

Someone writing LOTR fanfiction involving the eagles is addressing the perceived failure of Tolkein. Whereas someone writing Dumbledore bashing is addressing the failures of Dumbledore, not Rowling.

******** Alright, I'll explain to you how small words can impact a person. You seem pretty firm on your position, but for anyone else who is interested, I'll paint a picture for you.

Imagine that you're depressed. Your life drags on, you have no motivation, and you have no energy. You wonder what you're living for and don't have an answer other than simply saying that you have to keep going. When you finally go to the doctor to seek help, they diagnose you with depression. All of the emotions you've felt - the misery, the emptiness, the numb and cold reality that you endured - are now associated with that word. When you hear someone say the word "depression", your mind recalls the associations that you feel with that word, which would be the cold empty world you had come to hate.

Same thing with rape. You remember vividly how your body had been forced to endure pain that you'd never wanted simply because someone else wanted to derive pleasure from your suffering. When the police and first responders found you, you heard then saying that you were raped. The doctors say you were raped. Your new counselor says that you were raped. If you ever mention what you went through, you use the word rape. When you hear the word rape in any context, you immediately think back on how alone and afraid you felt as you screamed and begged for help and nobody came to help you until it was already over and you were crying in the aftermath.

The word "rape" was used in this comedy skit. For a majority of people, this doesn't mean anything. But for rape victims, many of them associate the word with the shame and pain they had felt. Rape is a "trigger" word, which activates a post traumatic response - PTSD . Just like how a veteran may be triggered by loud sounds that may sound similar to gunfire or explosions, words can also trigger PTSD. To prevent the victims of these events from having to endure that suffering, simply mentioning that words associated with trauma like "rape" and "suicide" are involved in a material can allow these people to avoid it and thus keep them mentally healthy without having to censor content to prevent these words from being you. It allows them to roam freely without being concerned that they might have to deal with their emotions going haywire and for everyone else to enjoy the comedy skit without having words that may be a trigger being omitted or censored. It's a healthy balance between censorship and freedom. This isn't very different than the warnings at the beginning of a movie stating that there is sexual content, gore, or violence. It helps people.

Hopefully this made things more clear for anyone interested.

***** Doesn't Vernon's speech in chapter four of Philosopher's Stone imply that he never beat Harry in the first place? As for the rampant manhandling, as someone who grew up in the late 80s, being dragged around or tossed out of rooms if you're being unruly wasn't that uncommon. The passage you quoted from Order of the Phoenix is easily the worst offender, but I don't think that constitutes repeated physical abuse.

Vernon's actions strike me more as being born from impotent anger. Harry mentioning ducking a couple times in regards to him seems to imply that if he avoided the blow, Vernon wouldn't pursue any more physical action in retaliation. It seems to act more as a warning than a desire to inflict irreparable harm.

Vernon isn't a good person, and I'll argue that he was an awful parent to my dying day, but even if he tried I don't think he was successful in his physical abuse.

That's because they are Dahl-esque, and in my opinion a large part of the fandom's dissonance is because they don't have the context from reading Dahl.

***** I'm definitely of the mind that books should be understood internally, that characters are fictional texts and not real psychological people, and that the rules of the book are not necessarily the rules of reality. That's the case for all books, not just genre books, but certainly there are different conventions in certain genres than in others. I do not think most HP readers would agree, though, hence the feelings on Dumbledore.

** In the Hobbit, Gandalf is a wise figure who calls the protagonist into the adventure partly by being somewhat manipulative. He doesn't give anyone all of the available information and often acts according to his own motivations that the protagonist and the reader are not always aware of. However, both Bilbo and Frodo are adult characters that Gandalf is not responsible for in any meaningful way. Gandalf is wise and powerful, but the relationship between him and the other characters is on a much more equal footing - wise mentor and friend, /not/ teacher or guardian.

Dumbledore is something else. He serves a similar purpose in the narrative to Gandalf, but it doesn't work out quite the same. Harry is a child who Dumbledore has very real power over, and how he uses that power is problematic.

The Potter fandom is an interesting place. Many fans (myself included) started reading the books as children, but are now of an age to have children ourselves, and our perspectives on the narrative have changed as we've grown with the stories.

Dumbledore was responsible for Harry's placement with the Dursleys initially, as well as his return there during summers. The canon-level treatment of Harry is abusive and abuse has lifelong consequences. The idea of keeping a child safe, but unhappy, is untenable to me. Any reasonable person could come up with dozens of ways to make the situation more bearable - something as simple as regular welfare checks on the child could have made a real difference. Like, you know, not going ten years before noticing that the kid doesn't even get to sleep in a bedroom. There's a real cognitive dissonance created when you try to ascribe a character's motivations to love, but also show that he didn't check on a small child for ten years. It just doesn't wash. Dumbledore's relationship with Harry is more notional than actual for much of the story - he says that he cares but his actions tell a different story.

Dumbledore is not Harry's friend. He's Harry's school headmaster. He has a duty to care for the children in his school, and that duty should /not/ include placing children in abusive homes, hiring irresponsible and/or abusive teachers, or exposing children to life-threatening situations.

The HP series uses a number of common children's fiction tropes - the abused orphan, the wise old mentor, etc. Part of the problem with Dumbledore though is that the style of his portrayal in the books changes. The books grow with the protagonist in maturity - characters that are somewhat formulaic and one-dimensional in earlier books are given complexity in later ones. Dumbledore is wise and knowing in the first books, and his actions make sense in context of the children's book style of his portrayal, but later we discover that he had a relationship with Grindelwald, was partially responsible for the death of his own sister, etc. This added complexity and fallibility in his portrayal opens things up for the reader to reexamine their understanding of his character and actions in previous books, and to find him wanting.

The later books in the series are /not/ children's books in any meaningful sense, and a large part of the fandom are adults, and Dumbledore's character suffers significantly from that change in perspective.

This is the core of it, it the end. In the books, we're told that Dumbledore's way was the only way available - that any other choice would have very likely resulted in a dead Harry.

Some readers take the canon position as presented. Others question it.

Ultimately, whether or not you consider the "manipulative Dumbledore" characterisation reasonable comes down to whether or not you believe the reader knows more than Dumbledore about what is magically, politically, and practically possible.

#+end_quote

I would say it actually comes down to whether you view the books through an in-universe or real life lens. In-universe we can clearly see that Dumbledore's actions were at the very least morally questionable and that he cannot possibly have been as kindhearted as he appeared. At the very least he would have had to be purposefully setting Harry up to defeat Voldemort by putting him through terrible situations his entire life.

Through the lens of real life, though, it's a children's book series that later became a young adult's book series written by an author very bad at writing an internally consistent world. A lot of the issues with Dumbledore's character as it relates to Harry stems from the first couple books when the series is very clearly written for young children and essentially no effort to make the adult characters act reasonably is made. It's nonsensical from this perspective to try to align the actions of characters like Dumbledore from these books to the last few.

In fact, I think this is ultimately the answer to a lot of the questions people bring up about the world of Harry Potter. The answer is basically "J.K. Rowling put very little thought into writing a consistent world" and any in-universe answer is just trying to squeeze something halfway sensible into it.

It's not about suspecting Ginny specifically. It's knowing that someone is going around entering the chamber of secrets and setting a basilisk (which Dumbledore had to know about, if Hermione was able to figure it out Dumbledore would have put two and two together) and somehow not being able to figure out who was going where. Four children fifteen years before mapped the castle and made it tell where everyone in the castle was but Dumbledore couldn't do this?

Secondly, you expect me to believe that a second double agent defense professor was able to enter the castle in three years after Voldemort literally came in on the back of someone's head and Dumbledore is doing nothing to vet people? It's not like things like Polyjuice potion or even the Imperius would be unexpected.

Also, I'm not saying you're wrong, but I don't remember anyone that had reason to have seen it but Voldemort suggesting anything about what the monster looked like.

Dumbledore is responsible for his return there during the summers, yes, but I've always found the idea in the fandom that Dumbledore was /responsible/ for his /placement/ with the Dursleys to be very weird indeed.

Dumbledore gave him to his closest known living relatives in part because that's literally what you do with an orphaned toddler (or child of any kind). It would be overstepping bounds in the extreme to do pretty much anything else, yet a good chunk of the fandom seems to think that kidnapping a child and giving them to some random person to raise (I've seen /Snape/ used here, ffs) would have been a more just thing to do and not an abuse of power at all.

No it isn't. I mean, it /is/ but it's not that simplistic

I know for a fact that, had I been orphaned as a minor, I was supposed to go to a family friend rather than either of my uncles. Why? Because it would have meant I stayed in the same town, at the same school and with people I knew - all of which were more important to my wellbeing than simple biological relation. One of my uncles was in New Zealand, the other one moved around a lot. Neither of them would have been in a good position to take me in. And the next closest chunk of family were something like my second-cousins-once-removed that I've only ever seen at weddings, funerals and on Facebook.

More importantly, in the normal course of things you can /decline/ to take the toddler/child regardless of how you're related to them. There might be pressure put on you to take the kid but you are allowed to refuse regardless of how good or bad your current situation is.

The Dursleys don't get much of a choice. Harry is left on their doorstep, not handed over to them. Could they have turned him over to the local authorities? Possibly. But then there might have been some investigation as to how the hell a child managed to get from a Godric's Hollow murder scene to a Surrey doorstep. That's assuming Harry is actually a legal entity in the muggle world - with a birth certificate and paperwork and whatnot. If he's not then that's an entirely different mess.

**** Dumbledore placed Harry at the Dursleys by putting him in a basket on a doorstep in the middle of the night, over the objections of at least two people (McGonagall and Hagrid) who were both present when he did it.

He appears to have done this without any legal authority, probably before Sirius was arrested. Someone brought up the assumption that godparents are the same as guardians, but that's not actually an assumption anyone is making. It's in the text:

PoA Ch. 20:

“*But I'm also - I don't know if anyone ever told you - I'm your godfather.”

“Yeah, I knew that,” said Harry.

“Well... your parents appointed me your guardian,” said Sirius stiffly. “If anything ever happened to them...”*

Now, Dumbledore's motivations are open for debate on the topic, obviously. We don't see inside his head. But it seems clear to me that he took action as a political leader of a faction that Harry's parents had been a part of in securing the surviving child with guardians of his choosing, without reference to whether he had the legal authority to do so.

Now, sure, it's entirely possible that Harry would have ended up with his nearest relatives anyway, but that's not actually an inevitable placement for a child. Children may end up with a family friend, in a foster home, or with less closely related family members - and usually a legal placement involves at least some investigation into whether or not the family is somewhat suitable and also /willing/ to take the children in.

Now, this doesn't necessarily make him manipulative, but it does make Dumbledore /responsible./ However, the manipulative subtext /does/ exist in the text. Dumbledore's own stated motivation for keeping Harry there is not for his safety, but for the psychological value of having Harry not grow up knowing he's famous.

In the first chapter of the first book, Dumbledore talks to McGonagall, who is only present at number 4 because Hagrid told her where Dumbledore was going to be (and Hagrid knowing Harry's location undermines any argument about Harry's placement being super secret, btw).

Dumbledore: “/I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family he has left now.”/

[McGonagall objects, Dumbledore says it's the best place for him, McGonagall says Harry will be famous...]

“*Exactly,” said Dumbledore [...]. “It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember! Can't you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?” *

They then leave Harry on the doorstep, where he's woken up “/in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles.”/

There is no good evidence in canon that his location growing up was super secure and secret - the opposite, in fact. People from the wizarding world appear to have encountered Harry almost routinely.

PS, Ch. 2: /Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers on the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet too hat [...] A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green [...] A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word./

Book 5, Ch. 37, Dumbledore emphasizes his concern for Harry's safety... but he's talking /to Harry/, he's had more than a decade to build up a justification for his actions, and even here he cannot help but to mention the psychological aspect of his decision.

*”Five years ago, then,” continued Dumbledore, as though he had not paused in his story, “you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was working well.”

Dumbledore tells Harry first that he knew that he was “condemning [Harry] to ten dark and difficult years”, but then that the flaw in his plans for Harry was that he cared /too much/ for Harry's happiness. Honestly, re-reading that chapter just now makes me eyeroll so hard I almost hurt myself.

Taking Dumbledore's actions at face value, crediting him with his own stated motivations, he is a character that acts according to his own counsel and without ever seeking the advice of people with different viewpoints who might disagree with him. Dumbledore thinks that what he is doing is right, and feels entirely justified when other people suffer while bearing the consequences of his choices.

Dumbledore has and exercises a lot of power in canon. Disclaiming his actions as inevitable, saying he didn't have any other choices, IMO does not jive with what the books actually say. That doesn't mean he's an evil, manipulative, mastermind chessmaster, necessarily, but his actions aren't above reproach either.

Dumbledore is a complex character who had a great deal of agency in the text. Exploring his actions and motivations is interesting precisely because he has so much influence on the other characters and the overall story.

**** OBJECTION!

Dumbledore decided immediately to place Harry with the Dursleys, even if at that time, Sirius Black should have had priority as godfather (dibs on custody is one part of that duty). Given that McG spent the next day observing them, he must have decided on that placement even before the Pettigrew incident.

Dumbledore might have known about the Fidelius, but that does not mean that Sirius betrayed them. Someone could have tricked him into revealing information, or could have tortured/coerced him. And given that the "unblockable" killing curse failed to kill Harry, the infallibility of the Fidelius was in no way guaranteed. He dismissed Sirius even if Hagrid had a friendly encounter with him and Harry was handed over without protest. That does not sound like a traitor's doing.

And even canon shows us that there are other magical defences which can repel Voldemort and his cronies. The Tonks house manages to stop their entire force, and when Voldemort takes over, all Order defences fail (presumably also the Fidelius charms, or otherwise every Order member was an idiot).

I'm sorry, but I honestly think that you're letting the fact that Sirius is known to be innocent to colour your perception of Halloween '81. Per actual canon (both hints in the book, and [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/secret-keeper][WoG from Rowling]]) you /can't/ torture a Secret out of a Secret Keeper (frankly, what would be the point of the spell then?). They have to volunteer the information /willingly/. It's not at all a leap to interpret the secret leaking as Sirius betraying the Potters, especially considering that he was completely hale and hearty to all observation.

The Order defences fail because they were supplemented by Ministry defences, and /those/ defences failed. In case you didn't pay any attention, the Fidelius charm on Grimmauld Place did not fail and neither did e.g. the charm on Shell Cottage. I'm not sure how you can call the entire Order idiots considering that the Fidelius is something you use when you want to /hide people/, and going into hiding forever is shockingly enough not the greatest tactic to prevent a megalomaniac from seizing power and doing whatever he wants with the general population.

There were two sorts of protections. One around Number 4 (that one could easily be replaced with a fidelius) and one which protected Harry, somewhat. That one was obsolete after the graveyard though. And, as Pettigrew demonstrated, it was useless against Death Eaters and therefore only the static, easily replaceable component was of any use.

This conversation is surprisingly heated, so I really don't mean anything by asking, but, is there any indication the Fidelius Charm is just like the protection Harry had at the Dursleys? The freedom of movement would be severely restricted, I imagine. Harry can walk to the beach at Bill and Fleur's, and Lily visited Bathilda Bagshot, so we don't really know where the edge of the spell is in those cases (or if Lily was able to visit for some other reason other than a boundary, for example, if Sirius told Bathilda the secret on purpose for the purposes of their visiting), and with Grimmauld place, the edge of the spell was the end of the doorstep. The love/blood protection, whatever its other faults, allows Harry to go to school, to the zoo, etc, and he remains equally protected from Voldemort (and Voldemort associates). The spells are described differently enough for me to feel they are different. I see no indication to adjust one or the other to make them more similar.

I mean, if the Fidelius Charm and Lily's sacrifice are /genuinely/ the same, then why would Dumbledore place Harry at the Dursleys in the first place? It means he's lying straight to Harry's face, and there'd have to be a second, unknown, reason why he placed Harry there.

That is the same with either the blood protection or the fidelius. Because as canon shows, the Number 4 protection is closely limited as well, with death eaters waiting at the perimeter. And Pettigrew being able to harm Harry shows that the blood protection is also very limited in application.

*********** I was ready to say good job for convincing me that your argument is stronger than mine when I took a walk to put something in the post box, and on my walk I kept thinking how this was just such poor writing, why would JKR make the two magics work the same way? I thought we /must/ be forgetting something. Then I remembered that the love/blood magic isn't tied to a perimeter like the Secret Keeper one is, it hinges instead on the combined mindset of Petunia and Harry calling it their home. Petunia must accept Harry into her home, and Harry must consider it his home. The magic is bound by this mindset. It breaks when Harry is 17 /or/ when he no longer considers it home.

#+begin_quote
  “Now, your mother's charm will only break under two conditions: when you come of age, or” --- Moody gestured around the pristine kitchen --- “*/you no longer call this place home. You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full understanding that you're never going to live together again, correct?”/*

  Harry nodded.

  “*/So this time, when you leave, there'll be no going back, and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range/*. We're choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen."
#+end_quote

I would argue this is a fundamental difference between the two spells. It also suggest there /is/ a range to the Number 4 protection, but it only becomes relevant when Harry no longer considers the place home. Perhaps the Fidelius Charm can still be argued to be more suitable, but in terms of the two spells being similar or different, I would say this shows they are different.

#+begin_quote
  And Pettigrew being able to harm Harry shows that the blood protection is also very limited in application.
#+end_quote

Lily's sacrificial protection stopped Voldemort from killing Harry, not Voldemort's associates, so Peter can freely harm or kill Harry. This magic never expires (although it does change when Voldemort takes Harry's blood, obviously, but Peter would still be able to harm and kill Harry just the same, Peter's abily to harm and kill Harry is unaffected by Lily's sacrifice). Dumbledore's additional protections had nothing to do with Voldemort or his associates being able to /kill/ Harry, they had to do with being able to find him while he lived at Number 4. This one is the one that expires. And this one /might/ include Voldemort's associates, but that is left unspecified.

But that's just it, it would be a downgrade. Perhaps the downgrade is worth it for the other benefits, but the downgrade still exists. Harry would be stuck within a perimeter, unable to (for example) go the park that he is able to go to in the beginning of OotP, where he sees Dudley and his gang from a distance. That was only weeks after Voldemort returned and his protection at Number 4 was strong enough that a Squib and Mungungus Fletcher were considered suitable to watch over him. Umbridge could find him because she is (or was) unconnected to Voldemort, so Harry's protection didn't apply to her, because the protection did all the heavy lifting (and arguably, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus were not there to be protectors, but for intelligence purposes). Perhaps that alone suggests that a Fidelius charm is better because not only would he (probably) have more loving guardians in that scenario, but he would also be protected from other attackers too. That view is valid. But nevertheless, Harry's physical life would be more restricted in that scenario.

If the spells are the same, then why /didn't/ Dumbledore just use a Secret Keeper? What motivated him to do something else?

*********** According to the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/event/circa-november-1-1981-peter-pettigrew-fakes-his/][HP Lexicon timeline]], Pettigrew faked is death on either the 1st or the 2nd, with a note saying they are 90% sure it was on the first. Harry is picked up by Hagrid the night of the 31st, and not delivered to the Dursleys until the night of the 1st. This accounts for Hagrid borrowing the bike from an as-yet unsuspected Sirius Black and also accounts for Sirius being unfit to parent 24 hours later.

But even if Peter faked his death on the 2nd, after Harry is placed at the Dursleys, this does not make Sirius present or fit to parent on the 1st, because that day he was missing, going mad with grief, and hunting down Peter, so he wasn't present to claim Harry or to clear his name, and Dumbledore and Lupin both believed their was a spy in the Order beforehand and both believed Sirius was the Potter's Secret Keeper and therefore must be the spy. So the natural conclusion is that the missing person is the guilty person, and therefore unfit to be a parent. They couldn't even find Sirius, and when he was discovered after murdering 13 people, whether on the first or the second, he confessed to the crime anyway.

edit: Obviously this was injustice, nobody accounted for Sirius's grief-stricken instability, and none of this is Sirius's fault, but the series of events is designed in such a way as it makes sense people would think Sirius guilty and therefore unfit to parent.

Dumbledore believed justice had been done concerning Sirius, he believed the right person was caught, Sirius even admitted to the crime, so Dumbledore had no reason to think the wrong guy was locked up and every reason to come up with a new home for the child. Having said that, I am familiar that many think Dumbledore secretly knew Sirius was innocent and wanted him out of the way for various reasons, so for those reasons, this question is obviously irrelevant.

I don't /always/ use Pottermore as canon, if I'm being honest, and in fact, very rarely do, but I feel in this case, the conclusion is the same with or without this information. That is to say, the books provide enough information to place the burden of Sirius's lack of justice on Barty Crouch Sr's shoulders, not Dumbledore's. Dumbledore holds impressive sounding titles, but the reader never sees these positions in action, and we have many significant examples of Barty Crouch Sr. handling the Death Eater's trials and in fact abusing his power doing so, and the only time we are even shown the Wizengamot is when Fudge deliberately corrupts it, so we are not privileged to see it in action uncorrupted. We also don't know when Dumbledore became its head, it may have been after Sirius's imprisonment, it may have been before, and we don't know how much power the head of the Wizengamot normally has either. The reader needs to imagine a significant amount here, which means there is nothing we can do with this information. Perhaps it is poor writing, or perhaps it is intentionally left out because it is irrelevant to understanding the story. I generally read books with the idea that the text gives us all the information we need.

This is one of my biggest gripes with the character to be honest (though it is more a gripe with Rowling). He supposedly has all of this power, but in the situations where wielding it would be an advantage, it's always someone else calling the shots. With Sirius' sentencing it's Crouch Sr, at Harry's trial it's Fudge and Umbridge, when he backs Harry in saying that Voldemort is back he's stripped of his titles, etc. It adds to the impression that he can and should be doing /something/ but is not doing it for some odd reason - it's certainly valid to interpret it as deliberate/manipulative, and I do enjoy fics like that when they don't go overboard and make the same mistake that Rowling did. You can't write such a powerful, intelligent character into your story and give him so little to do plot wise: whether Dumbledore is benevolent or malevolent, it still took way too long and too much luck for whatever his plans were to come to fruition.

i absolutely agree and feel this almost on a personal level. I feel like I have deconstructed the story to try to figure out it's "point" so to speak, to let the text itself guide me in the ways it /wants/ to be read, if that makes sense. For example, it's fantastical. nature, how many of the character are almost caricatures, but in delightful and interesting ways, how the names are all hyper-related to the character's attributes, etc. These are things that are decidedly /not/ realistic, so I feel a realistic approach to analyzing these books is not the right one. It might be for another book, though. Anyway, long story short, there are huge gaps of knowledge, and my feeling is that this is just not relevant, so it's not worth including. I've recently read a book called /The Rhetoric of Characters in Children's Literature/ by Maria Nikolajeva, and in it, she says that books only include what is important to understand them. I mean, people can of course not /agree/ with her on that if they want, but I do agree with that. For example, I do not think we need to know more about Hermione's parents to understand her. We know what we need to know to understand the important parts of the story. I feel like the desire to know more has nothing to do with our desire to understand Hermione or the story, but our desire to have encyclopedia knowledge of the world-building. But in terms of story and character, it is not important.

So from that standpoint, I'm fairly happy to accept that any "missing" information is not necessary for understanding. Having said that, I would also argue that a genre convention for fantasy is to have a detailed, extensive, consistent world-building, because if it does not, readers naturally start filling it in themselves, with sometimes catastrophic consequences to the characters. In this thread someone has suggested to me that Dumbledore is at fault for not preventing the feudal lords from creating suppressive laws against Muggleborns. People can and will fill in these holes in whatever way they want, and while that is usually encouraged for both readers and writers, I think in some cases it veers the readers totally off course, and in those cases, I think it's the author's fault. And that's what I think happened with Dumbledore. There is no reason he should be confusing for readers. Sure, in terms of fictional character, he's an intricate nuanced one, and readers need to put in /some/ effort I guess, but he's not hidden behind complicated dialogue and unexplained motives. But Aberforth gives us permission to assume his dialogue and explaination are lies, and that gives the reader /a lot/ of freedom. He can be anything the reader wants him to be at that point.

I don't know, when I'm actually reading the books, I think he is well written. It's only when I see what other people say about him that I decide he probably is poorly written after all. I go back and forth. Sometimes I go in the other extreme and think he's too well written, but I usually don't think that for very long.

#+begin_quote
  He supposedly has all of this power, but in the situations where wielding it would be an advantage, it's always someone else calling the shots.
#+end_quote

Another thing is, I don't think he ever /did/ have all this power. I think that is an assumption Harry and the reader intuit, but it's not necessarily accurate. We know that the Minister is the most powerful position in the government, and we know Dumbledore did not accept that position. Any other position he has is therefore necessarily less powerful. Any further information is relevant for those who read books for the world-building, but not necessarily relevant to those who read books for the characters. But also, like I said above, these gaps in knowledge invite way too much speculation that is counter-productive to the story, and therefore, a negative of the writing.

#+begin_quote
  when he backs Harry in saying that Voldemort is back he's stripped of his titles, etc. It adds to the impression that he can and should be doing something but is not doing it for some odd reason - t adds to the impression that he can and should be doing something but is not doing it for some odd reason - it's certainly valid to interpret it as deliberate/manipulative,
#+end_quote

I'm not sure I understand this point. Do you mean that Dumbledore losing his titles shows that he did not use them properly before he lost them? Because I would argue the opposite, he was punished for being too vocal. I"m sorry, I think I"m just confused on the point your making, and I don't want to assume.

I'm not sure where this idea comes from, being a godfather even traditionally is not meant to be someone's back-up guardian, they are meant to guide they child's faith in God.

All my siblings and I have different godparents, but that has no bearing on who we would have lived with if our parents died.

#+end_quote

I agree with this. The benefit of the Secret Keeper is that only /one/ person knows the secret (which I believe can be coerced out of them). This means, for example, Voldemort couldn't threaten Bathilda Bagshot because she literally cannot reveal the secret no matter what. The Secret Keeper can, though. The benefit of the Secret Keeper is not that the Secret Keeper position is infallible, but that it minimized the number of fallible people who could snitch to just one, rather than many.

[edit: For those who consider Pottermore canon, what I said above is not accurate,

#+begin_quote
  (although the secret cannot be forced, bewitched or tortured out of a Secret Keeper who does not wish to give up their secret; it must be given voluntarily).
#+end_quote

So torture would not work. I feel this makes Sirius's fear of being Secret Keeper slightly less credible and interesting, but there we go]

Having said that, I believe living that way is very restrictive and placing Harry at the Dursleys makes the most sense from all angles at the point Harry was placed there. Of course /over time/, things would get more compliated of course, but the initial decision to place him there makes sense to me.

But then if there were talks to move him, I feel like living in a Fidelius charm would be incredibly restrictive, especially in light of your comment about the Death Eaters outside Grimmauld Place. Neither Harry nor the family members could walk down the street much less live normal lives.

To quote the first paragraph of the Wikipedia article:

In the past, in some countries, the role carried some legal obligations as well as religious responsibilities. In both religious and civil views, a godparent tends to be an individual chosen by the parents to take an interest in the child's upbringing and personal development, to offer mentorship or claim legal guardianship of the child if anything should happen to the parents

I mean, that negates the entire point of saying torture doesn't work. Having said that, that information is from Pottermore, and I usually don't consider Pottermore canon anyway, and this addition to canon makes Sirius's fear that he is too obvious a little less dramatic and perhaps even slightly pointless, so personally I think the story is more interesting if torture /does/ work. But, at the same time, if you consider Pottermore canon, I really don't see how you can make the claim torture works when Pottermore unambiguously states that it doesn't. Where does torture stop and dismemberment start? I mean, how does dismemberment rest outside the arena of "torture" in the case of the Fidelius Charm? I'm all for you ignoring Pottermore if that's the angle you want to take, it's just your interpretation of the word 'torture' is a bit of a stretch for me.

If you follow the Wikipedia citation for that information, the citation includes the author's original wording,

#+begin_quote
  "In earlier times the role of godparent carried with it a legal responsibility for the child, should they become orphaned. Today, being a godparent is not legally binding and carries no legal rights, although godparents may also serve as legal guardians for children if this arrangement is documented in a valid will."
#+end_quote

Even that source says it's not legally binding and only a thing of the past. I looked up the book in my local library, but it isn't there, but I did some other digging and found this from a [[http://www.hamilllawoffice.com/godparent/][Christian website]] in an article titled /Are Godparents and Guardians The Same Thing?/

#+begin_quote
  These days, I'm often asked by people whether their selection of godparents for their children is the same as naming legal guardians for their children. The answer is “no.”

  A godparent is someone who sponsors the child's baptism. This is mainly a religious role, not a legal one.
#+end_quote

I also found and article from Forbes titled, [[https://www.forbes.com/sites/robclarfeld/2018/05/29/selecting-your-childrens-guardians-is-very-different-than-naming-their-godparents/#5cc456526d9e][/Selecting Your Children's Guardians Is Very Different Than Naming Their Godparents/]], and one on this estate planning website titled, [[https://albanislaw.com/the-godparent-myth-the-difference-between-godparents-and-guardians-in-estate-planning/][/The Godparent Myth: The Difference between Godparents and Guardians in Estate Planning/]]

Of course that is not to say it has never been the case that godparents are automatically legal guardians, but I find the evidence suggesting that Sirius /must be/ Harry's legal guardian a big stretch. It is not the norm in the Muggle world, so I see no reason why we should assume it is the norm in the Magical one. The books make no indication that being a godparent works differently in the Magical World. WIth fanfiction, of course, it can mean whatever we want it to mean, but as far as canon is concerned, I do not find that argument convincing.

  There's a real cognitive dissonance created when you try to ascribe a character's motivations to love, but also show that he didn't check on a small child for ten years. It just doesn't wash. Dumbledore's relationship with Harry is more notional than actual for much of the story - he says that he cares but his actions tell a different story.
#+end_quote

I feel like this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the role love plays in this story and Dumbledore's role in presenting a more nuanced theme, both in revealing that love alone is not enough, but how our acceptance of death relates to our ability to love properly. There's Harry's cookie cutter prefect version of love, which saves the day, because he accepts death in all its forms, and Dumbledore's horribly misguided love which ruins the day, because he is not honest with himself about his failure to accept death (other people's, not his own).

I am not here to argue that Dumbledore is perfect, but I do feel there's a lot more to Dumbledore than stopping at "he's imperfect because he let Harry suffer". There's a world of exploring the precise emotional hangups that led to it. I feel like exploring Dumbledore's characterization made me see the entire series in a whole new way, helped me understand its total design.

I also tend to think it is a mistake to remove the books from their fairytale beginnings. That is to say, just because the whole story exists in the same universe, the earlier plots still exist in a fairy tale universe and the later books still exist in a more realistic one. To judge the plot of the first book as if it exists in the more realistic plot of the last (which itself is not realistic either) feels wrong to me. I would also argue that characters in general (but especially Harry) should not be judged as real psychological studies, but that is a much bigger conversation about how to read and analyze books, and perhaps is beyond the scope of this post.

********* Thank you! I do feel that Grindelwald's function in the story is extremely crucial to not only understanding Dumbledore's characterization, but also the themes of love and death (and most particularly how our ability to love and accept death work together in a person).

I also realized that my essay did not specifically answer the question you originally wanted, how Dumbledore relates to theme (although perhaps my thoughts on that can be guessed after reading the essay). To give an extremely brief summary, I think the conflict between the main character and the main villain is the best way to discover the most prominent theme, which in the case of Harry and Voldemort is the ability to love and to accept death. The writer John Truby says in his book, /Anatomy of a Story/,

#+begin_quote
  Good writers express their moral vision slowly and subtly, primarily through the story structure and the way the hero deals with the particular situation. Your moral vision is communicated by how your hero pursues his goal while competing with one or more opponents and by what your hero learns, or fails to learn, over the course of his struggle.
#+end_quote

Through Harry, we learn that love is powerful and that accepting death is crucial to living a productive life. Through Voldemort we learn that fear of our own mortality can be catastrophically and possibly even eternally crippling (depending on your belief system as a reader), through Snape we learn that we can use our grief productively, and through Dumbledore we learn that /not/ grieving in healthy ways is almost as catastrophic as fear of our own deaths. We can extend this theme to "smaller" characters too, like Nearly Headless Nick (who shows sadness and almost regret that he chose to become a ghost, and admits that he was too scared to "go on"), Lily Evans, Barty Crouch Sr, and on and on. Some of these did the "right" thing and some did the "wrong" thing.

Dumbledore understands that love is powerful and eternally good, but he did not understand this innately as Harry does. Dumbledore had to learn this hard way. He was not inherently cruel or violent like Grindelwald, but his happiness at finding a friend in Grindelwald clouded his judgement. It is good to love, of course, but in Dumbledore's case, it clouded his judgement. While for Harry, love always cleared his head. I would even argue that Dumbledore's own death cleared his head, like Galadriel when she denies the ring when Frodo offers, Dumbledore "took the test", but unlike Galadriel, he fails. His test is not as black and white as Galadriel's was, but he nevertheless failed, and I think knowing the ordeal was over gave him some mental clarity. I am extrapolating enormously here, but that's where this thought process has taken me.

Anyway, I suspect that Dumbledore intentionally lived a life void of emotionally intimate love because he feared the damage he would cause. Then, of course, the prophecy is made and Harry comes along. Dumbledore is tested, he knows he can't come to love Harry, and he thinks, well, I've realized this, so I think probably if I just make sure to not love Harry, then I won't. Well, of course, he does just that, and it takes him years to realize it. Aberforth's anger and Ariana's death was the slap in the face to make Dumbledore realize this flaw in himself, and Harry's anger and Sirius's death was the slap in the face to make Dumbledore realize he succumbed once again, despite his belief that he was in control of himself.

The Deathly Hallows add to this theme in an even more direct way. The introduction of a fairy tale story in a book that already draws a lot from fairy tales is brilliant. It allows the text to explore the theme on a small scale, which creates a map that the reader can use to apply it to the larger main story. The three Hallows, the one that makes fool of those who seek power and tricks them into dying, the one who makes fools of those who do grieve in unhealthy ways and tricks them into dying, and the one that death cannot find, and can't trick. Death felt cheated by these Brothers, so he made the tools specifically to kill them, and it worked only for the first two brothers. But the Third Brother's wisdom can be applied to the other brother's gifts too. If you do not seek the wand for its power, and if you use it to protect others rather than to enrich yourself, then it cannot have power over you, and you will be able to wield it effectively, and if you do not attempt to "steal" the dead back from Death, then the Stone will have no power over you. Dumbledore masters the Elder Wand because he did not seek it. He knew Grindelwald had the Wand for years, but Dumbledore did not go. His inability to accept his sister's death prevented him. In short, Dumbledore's greatest weakness is not power, he masters that, the wand isn't the Hallow that kills him. The Resurrection Stone did. His biggest weakness is his inability to accept the deaths of others.

So does he raise Harry like a pig for slaughter? It seems almost radical to say he didn't, because there is so much explanation behind why I feel the answer is no, so much explanation about Dumbledore characterization that is usually just... ignored, overlooked? Considered lies? I don't think Dumbledore believed in the prophecy either (although, actually, lots of Dumbledore essayists agree with me on this, across the love/hate spectrum). I also think Dumbledore despised the greater good philosophy. Imagine starting a comment with that?! I think the only other person who agrees with me on that is hpboy13 from Mugglenet.

I'm sure I could say more, but it's getting late and I think I got the gist of it. I hope you find it interesting.

  ...

  If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will, truly, mean the end of Voldemort.'

  Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified.

  ‘You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?'

  ‘Don't be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?'

  ‘Lately, only those whom I could not save,' said Snape. He stood up. ‘You have used me.'

  ‘Meaning?'

  ‘I have spied for you, and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter's son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter --'

  ...

  Dumbledore's betrayal was almost nothing. ... he realised that now. He had never questioned his own assumption that Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now he saw that his lifespan had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. ...

Its unclear what Dumbledore's thoughts regarding the nature of the Hallows and the Master of Death truely are, as he both states that he thinks "it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death's own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations." implying that the unification of the Hallows gives no special power over death, while at the same time having intentionally introduced the idea of the Hallows to the trio in a specific manner: "

‘I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.'"

It's not clear exactly why Dumbledore wanted Harry to claim the Hallows then, given that he believed them to be masterful enchantments rather than works of Death himself. It wasn't about making sure Harry survived though as that was already covered

‘But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,' Harry started again, ‘and nobody died for me this time -- how can I be alive?' ‘I think you know,' said Dumbledore. ‘Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.' ‘He took my blood,' said Harry. ‘Precisely!' said Dumbledore. ‘He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it!

Dumbledore didn't want Harry to claim them all. The Elder Wand was supposed to end with his death. As Dumbledore said in the quote he thought Harry would take the wrong idea from the stories (as Harry nearly did in the middle of the book) and claim the Hallows for the wrong reason.

Dumbledore failed to master Death by being blinded by the Resurrection Stone and it cost him his life. He could let the Cloak and the Wand slip out of his hands but the power to bring back what he lost was too much temptation.

He gave Harry the Resurrection Stone only at the end when Harry knew what to do and wouldn't be tempted to do more than talk to those he lost.

******** Exactly my point. He can't test it, he can't plan for it, so it makes absolutely zero sense for him to plan it out like a chessmaster.

All the people saying "he raised harry to sacrifice himself!" are forgetting that Voldemort was unbeatable, immortal and would always resurrect in perpetuity until the scarcrux was destroyed. What else was he supposed to do? There are no prisons that can hold an immortal man, the walls will always crumble and the wardens will all die before he does.

Dumbledore made the best choice possible in his situation. I'd like to see the people who crticize that choice to be thrust into this situation and choose more wisely.

The reason I'm confused is because we can't fault him for not having the ability to test it, his world didn't offer him that convenience, but he also nevertheless /believed/ Harry would live, which is what is relevant when determining his motivation.

I think it may be argued, actually. There's lots of evidence that Dumbledore is lying to Snape. He closes his eyes to ensure Snape can't tell he's lying to him. The narrator mentions how his eyes remain closed through this conversation, then he opens his eyes after he finishes telling Snape that Harry must die. Snape being the story's premiere Occlumens, I would argue it's very relevant to consider why the story would bother mentioning someone's closed eyes three times in a conversation with this person.

I'm not sure he was. From infancy through year five, he planned for Harry to die/be sacrificed, but I don't think he thought throughout those years that Harry would actually defeat Voldemort (and the Horcruxes aspect of the project didn't come in until CoS also). What would make him think Harry has a chance? Dumbledore does not trust prophecies, which he states frequently, so he doesn't take for granted that Harry will have the skills to do it just because a prophecy says so. The only reason he would need /Harry/ to defeat Voldemort is if he believed in the prophecy or if he believed in Harry himself. I think he does believe in one or both of those eventually (the end of OotP, specifically), but it was not what Harry was /raised/ for.

We were specifically arguing about Dumbledore, not every other inconsistency, so when you bring up other ones that are mostly unrelated (in the sense that I have a developed understanding of the explanations commonly used for Dumbledore's actions, not Hermione's) I might not have an answer for you. This is part of the reason I prefer the real-life lens for Harry Potter. There's so much wrong with it that it just makes more sense from my perspective to admit that JKR is not a careful writer than it is to twist everything into knots trying to find a halfway sensible reason for things to have happened the way they did. Some things can be relatively easily explained away, but for others it would require such ridiculous lengths to explain in-universe that it just seems pointless to me. Inconsistencies will sometimes just tumble into an avalanche because they effect so many things which also need to be explained if you choose to try to explain the first one.

The problem with the in-universe lens is that there's always another inconsistency and one inconsistency existing doesn't justify another's existence or solve it. That is to say: Dumbledore not realizing something obvious is one inconsistency and Hermione not realizing that same obvious thing is another and the fact that they're both present doesn't mean the inconsistency isn't there. If you wish to use the in-universe and you want an answer, it's up to you to come up with some kind of sensible explanation.

I think that is the way most writers try to write and the way most books and stories work, and HP is no different. Consequently, Dumbledore's characterization and the plot surrounding his troubles are specifically designed to explore these ideas, so they absolutely must be the hardest decisions in order to explore it. His challenges are specifically designed to be the hardest challenges he can face, and his characterization is specifically designed to have trouble with these challenges. They work hand in hand, same with Harry and Voldemort. Their obstacles are specifically designed to be the hardest obastacles for them.

Still some would argue, and be justified, in calling Dumbledore evil for 'ten dark and difficult years.'

And last but not the least, he knew Sirius was capable of murder because of the Shrieking Shack incident with Snape in their fifth year. At that time, he gave him a pass for some reason (probably to protect Remus) but there was no reason for much leeway in the aftermath of the war. People wanted blood so death eaters were hunted and trials half-assed - I'm not sure Dumbledore could have stopped it even if he wanted to.

** The thing is, there are a /lot/ of things in the books that add up to Dumbledore being, at the very least, incredibly manipulative and misleading. For all that his words are those of someone who cares, sometimes I can't help but think he was lying when he said it.

-   Hagrid, on Dumbledore's orders, takes Harry Potter from Sirius Black at the wreckage of the Potter's house, before Sirius was arrested, effectively kidnapping him from his rightful guardian.

-   He repeatedly returned Harry to an environment he knew to be abusive, when there were other potential methods of keeping him safe.

-   He cut off Harry from emotional support after severe emotional trauma(I really don't blame Harry at all for being explosively moody throughout the 5th book. He's clearly suffering from untreated PTSD, having been tortured and witnessing someone being murdered in front of him).

-   He never got Sirius Black a trial, despite being head of what amounts to being Wizarding Britian's highest judiciary body.

-   Several times he should have traveled faster. I suppose it might be excusable to ride a broom from Hogwarts to the Ministry in the /Philosopher's Stone/ before we're introduced to faster modes of transport(portkey, floo, apparition), but in the 5th book, when we've been introduced to all of those, yet somehow, despite those, the kids flying thestrals still manage to beat the Order of the Phoenix to the Ministry of Magic, when the flight of at least 800 kilometers would have taken /hours/.\\
    To be fair, I suppose this could be down to Snape not realizing they went to the Ministry, when they disappeared with Umbridge in the Forbidden Forest).

-   Dumbledore's stated reasoning for distancing himself from Harry in Order of the Phoenix is utterly idiotic.\\
    He says that it would have made Harry Potter too tempting a target, but the thing is, every appearance of Voldemort in the books is marked by his obsession to beat The Boy Who Lived, even BEFORE the Prophecy is revealed to Harry(and through him, us).\\
  It has also been stated repeatedly that Dumbledore was the only wizard Voldemort ever feared.\\
    In essence, Dumbledore is either an idiot in this scene, or flat out lying about his reasons for distancing himself when Harry most needed the support of an authority figure.

Sorry, while I do ultimately like Dumbledore, especially when a fanfic does a good job of him fixing his mistakes or just not making them, there's a lot he does in canon that's counterproductive to his supposed goals.

Dumbledore - I care about you too much. I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth...

Right he cared so much he knew he was condeming harry to 10 dark years in a place that he hated and was abused (and canon is quite clear he was mentally and emotionally abused (IMO physically as well). He completely cuts off all contact with harry and his friends after both cedric's and sirius' death. Which is what every teenage boy needs to be left in a place he hates and is abused as he deals with the guilt of people dying in front of him.

What training? Dumbledore was not teaching him spells, he did not tell him what items he suspected might be Horcruxes or where they might be. He took a full year to show memories of riddle when he could have shown all of them on two weekends with time to discuss.

In second and fourth year Dumbledore could have easily made an announcement that Harry was not the heir of Slytherin, and had not entered the tournament and was being forced to compete against his will. Instead he did nothing and allowed Harry to be bullied and picked on.

And really after Voldemort appears in first year Dumbledore's focus should have been in preparing Harry rather than platitudes that he wanted him to have a normal childhood. But he did nothing to truly help or train harry. And he made it worse by condoning Snape's bullying of any non-slytherin and favoritism of Slytherin.

He was most definitely physically abused. Being locked in a cupboard does not help your development much. Especially when it is for days or even weeks at a time with barely a half hour out a day. Neither does starvation. Harry hunting was another. And there was at least one occasion where Dudley was encouraged by Vernon to hit him.

People discount the frying pan swipe Petunia took at him, but with how casually she seemed to do it, it reeked of familiarity.

Sure, they might not have beat him half to death all the time, but I can see Vernon or Dudley going too far one or two times.

****** He /probably/ suspects that Voldemort has split his soul since before Harry's parents are even born (I can expand on why I think this if there's interest). But he did not expect Voldemort to have made more than one until CoS when he saw the diary. At this point he delves into memories and research and discoveries that he think Voldemort made six, and he makes his guesses about what they are. He is not able to confirm his theories before he dies, but his guesses did all turn out to be accurate.

Dumbledore knowing that Voldemort can't die until Harry does doe snot mean that it sits right with Dumbledore either. Dumbledore himself is disgusted at the decision he must make, and he notably fails. He tries to prioritize the greater good, and fails at it, and ends up prioritizing Harry instead. It is only when he utterly and completely risks the lives of countless people that he realizes he has no power to protect Harry, except this one slimmer of hope that he can survive because of Voldemort using his blood. Dumbledore tried to be the villain that most people in this thread see him as, and he failed at it, he was too human to handle the burden, and it caused him to risk the lives of the greater good.

Thank you! I feel so confused why everyone thinks Dumbledore trained Harry. Where is this training happening before HBP? If Harry is being secretly trained his entire life, then why is he so average at everything? I mean, some people have pointed to Harry being good a DADA, but that doesn't prove that Dumbledore /designed/ Harry to be good at DADA, and if Dumbledore did want Harry trained, he could have easily just given him extra lessons, why hide it? None of this training stuff makes any sense to me.

  Right he cared so much he knew he was condeming harry to 10 dark years in a place that he hated and was abused

Dumbledore never says he loved Harry when Harry was a baby. He says he started to love Harry once Harry entered Hogwarts. So I would argue that Dumbledore's lack of love for Harry for those ten years does not disprove anything Dumbledore says in OotP. I would also argue that Dumbledore was trying very hard /not/ to love Harry, so it would inherently not appear as the loving intimate type of love a normal parent would have for a child. It would not make any sense based on the story for the love to appear the same.

Certainly it is not ideal, perfect love, but that is not the only type that exists. One can argue that Dumbledore didn't love Harry /very well/, but I don't think one can argue he didn't love Harry /at all/.

** Well in all fairness to JKR this series was created for kids/young adults. It had an interesting enough story line to pull in adults (and it ran long enough that those kids/young adults who were the Targetted audience grew up and had their own kids).

The hero of her story was a kid, and for an 11 year old to be the hero it means that the adults around him/her need to do stupid things. If they don't and actually step in doing what an adult should do there wouldn't be much of a story.

So the question becomes how do you justify the adults doing stupid things? There really is only a handful of reasons that can be used/believable.

1. Not enough information
2. Misunderstanding the information
3. Honest Mistake
4. Some level of Negligence
5. Some level of incompetence
6. Believing the adult knows best
7. Believing the is infallible
8. All part of a manipulative plan
9. All part of an evil plan

For the most part JKR has Dumbledore's actions be due to Believing the adult knows best, that he is infallible, and then finally part of a manipulative plan. (I know I could make a good argument on an evil plan for Dumbledore I don't think JKR ever intended him to be evil.)

Molly Weasley's actions easily fall into not enough information, misunderstanding the information, and the adult knows best rationales.

Of course, as another commenter mentioned this is fan fiction so authors are encouraged to look at canon and develop their own rationale for why the adults did stupid things. Which then often leads to a manipulative Molly or an evil Molly etc.

  But in the case of Dumbledore, he seems different since when bashed, his motivations are always the complete opposite of what we are said in canon :
#+end_quote

In the case of Dumbledore, his motivations in canon are... complicated. And more than that, they're hidden.

Let's take your first point for instance:

#+begin_quote
  "Dumbledore is keeping Harry in the Dark about everything because he is a lamb for slaughter". In canon, Dumbledore clearly say to Harry that he kept him in the dark not only because of his connection to Voldemort (anything said to Harry could potentially be learnt by Voldemort), but also because he loved him too much and didn't want to put such a burden on him.
#+end_quote

In canon, Dumbledore does say that, sure. But is that /convincing/? I don't know if I agree with Dumbles myself - after all, if I knew that someone I loved would have to essentially commit suicide to stop magical hitler, I wouldn't brush it off and have them only realize it at the last moment. Or if I knew they were already involved in something, I wouldn't keep them in the dark in an effort to keep them away from it.

So Dumbledore's canon motivation stem mostly from what /Dumbledore/ tells us - and that isn't always going to be convincing. Yes, the pushback against him goes to ridiculous extremes in a lot of fics, and in a really bad way - but I don't think it's any more extreme or weird than the Weasley bashing, or Hermione bashing, or any of the other aspects. It relies on turning up his duplicity and his schemes up to 11 - which then invalidates all of what he has to say to defend himself, because of /course/ Dumbledore is lying about it. It'd be like if we had a character who had blue as their favorite color - but the only time canon mentions it is when the character themselves says it, and they're also a chronic liar. I would understand readers that would then not view that as canon.

So of your 3 points, 1 & 2 can be explained that way (rejecting how Dumbledore presents himself) and 3 can be explained by a Manipulative!Dumbledore wanting to rule from the shadows - an author would have to explain it, but I think it's not difficult to reconcile with a darker, more secretive view of Dumbledore.

** Not sure why so many folks are missing the point of fanfiction. It is the discretion of the author to pick and choose what canonical information to highlight (or avoid) to support their story, and twisting canon to fit their needs as appropriate is commonplace.

I, personally, do not think many of Dumbledore's actions throughout the series are justifiable /in retrospect/. This is not a condemnation of the character himself, it's an inevitable by-product of the series starting as a children's book and becoming more mature as the series progresses. Decisions made earlier in the series seem silly and whimsical by the time we reach later books where we need more sufficient explanations for character choices.

At the time Harry is sent to the Dursleys, the Fidelius Charm had not yet been invented by J.K. Rowling so he could hardly be hidden under one could he? And what would the point be in introducing it, if it were not yet relevant to the story? It is only in retrospect as more of the world is revealed (read: invented by JKR) that prior character choices seem ridiculous and harmful.

That, I think, is quite forgivable. J.K. Rowling did not know she was drafting the first book of the best-selling series of all-time, and that hundreds of thousands of people would nit-pick character decisions and develop alternate interpretations of her characters, therefore she did not need to "defend" her character's actions early on. She included the information relevant that benefitted the narrative without over-complicating the world-building. We don't need to know about deep sacrificial magical enchantments in book 1, but knowing that you tap on a wall to enter Diagon Alley is funny.

-- fuck it, I'm going on a tangent --

Long story short - the earlier books are childrens books with few rules governing magic. By the end of the series, more of the wizarding rules and abilities are revealed. The fan fiction community then uses Book 7 knowledge to interpret Book 1 problems and are left desiring a more sufficient explanation for now-defunct character choices. Therefore the fandom reinterprets character motivations to justify the discrepancy.

I enjoy a bit of bashing here and there tbh. It can be a refreshing take on the series. The fandom wouldn't be as large as it is if it wasn't for imaginative character interpretations.

Inconsistencies are tremendous fodder for fanfiction. Harry Potter has so much room for what if stories.

That said, I firmly believe in death of the author and that works deserve to stand on their own. I actually really dislike this habit that JK Rowling has of adding trivia to the universe that isn't actually present in the work itself. As far as I'm concerned, the books stand on their own. And the great thing about fanfiction is that I am free to ignore other sources of info when they contradict the information that's in the actual books (Fantastic Beasts is a fun romp, for instance, so long as I don't have to take the movies seriously as some sort of prequel to the actual Harry Potter series. There are too many issues between the two series for me to be able to reconcile them as occurring in the same reality).

** First, I don't think it's so much that Dumbledore doesn't believe in prophecies /at all/ as he doesn't believe that Divination as a class has meaningful practical application, at least for those who don't have the natural gift, and those are rare even among wizards.

Otherwise, IMO it's also easy to make and believe the argument that Dumbledore at some point started to believe in his own legend to some extent, failing to trust others with information on an assumption such as he knows best, the burden is his to bear, or the others are too weak, unreliable, or untested to succeed at what needs to be done. Is he evil? I doubt that, but I would agree that some of his choices at least appear to those who don't know his thinking processes to be negligent or incompetent at best. Fact is, he isn't perfect, and while I can't think of a fic that plays a bash of him like your description of the more common bash trope off the top of my head I'm pretty sure there's been at least one I've read that did so (admittedly that's not a glowing review of Dumbledore bashes in general but still).

Also, never forget that this is fanfiction lol and people can write whatever they want.

** Dumbledore is weird. He's like a self insert after his fanfiction ends. It's not about him but he's the one with all the power. You would think he would know everything that happens in the school but he is consistently uninformed or intentionally neglectful. I read a fanfic where Dumbledore actually had a reason for arranging the philosopher stone scenario. He was expecting Quirrel to try and steal it. I really doubt possession is so common that he would think of that. But on the whole dumbledore is a badly written self insert with too much power and can't be allowed to be present when actual conflict occurs.

It is the same for good Draco/Snape: just because the authority (JKR in the canon) says they are bad, we must write how they are good.

** Dumbledore had a set of choices before him. One way led to ruin - Harry was dead, the world ends. The other, while worse for Harry, had a chance at defeating Voldemort.

That is the crux of his character.

Everyone here who says Manipulative Dumbledore is easily supported by canon seems too dumb to realize that this is the situation he was forced into. There were no better choices. Every other option would have led to ruin.

As for the manipulation? There's nothing of that in the books. Sure, he says he suspected Harry would sacrifice himself, but he didn't /groom/ him to do it. How the fuck do you do that anyway? Dumbledore doesn't talk with Harry all that often. Harry sacrifices himself out of love, not to make Dumbledore happy or some shit. I think people don't know what grooming means.

The other situations he supposedly "manipulated" into existence are based on so much random chance it's ludicrous.

*** It can be easily construed Dumbledore was grooming Harry to be self-sacrificing. Yes, you can explain that it`s a BOOK, but if you look into it as a character study.

He was completely irresponsible in leaving Harry at the Dursley`s with no supervision, Mrs. Figg was useless, Harry was still physically and emotionally abused, any decent CS would have removed him from that house.

That whole situation of the Philosopher Stone can`t be explained any other way. That obstacle course was laughable.

The guy is 100+ years old, super smart, access to lots of books, Hermione has to figure out it`s a Basilisk. He then proceeds to only send Fawkes to help him, instead of himself.

Doesn`t announce Harry is innocent in both the CoS and GoF situation, letting him be isolated.

After GoF, he pulls that whole thing where he tells Ron and Hermione to not contact him via letters, so he spends his whole time alone being verbally abused by the Dursleys in an environment that`s not good for him. Had he been a real person he wouldn`t have left that situation unscathed.

He then spends a whole year ignoring students being tortured, letting the Ministry lambast Harry and a whole slew of stuff, while leaving Harry confused, angry and alone, he also makes Ron prefect(who is a lazy teenager) when Harry was much more appropriate and doesn`t explain himself, then giving the shittiest reason I`ve ever heard.

Oh, and later spends a whole year to show Harry a handful of memories that could have been shown in three days. Also gives Harry zero training.

So yes, he talks the talk but doesn`t walk the walk.

** Part of it is people really exaggerate how bad the Dursleys are and how much Harry living there is Dumbledore's choice/fault.

The Dursleys are certainly emotionally abusive by modern standards, but the only one ever really indicated to be violent is Dudley, Harry doesn't actually suffer any lasting harm (seriously nowhere in canon is he some horribly malnourished cripple). And do realize this is a setting where a muggle school where children beat each other with sticks is considered a prestigious establishment and magical families do stuff like hang children out of windows.\\
And it's not as though there's actually a reasonable alternative, Harry has no other family at all. And not only is family needed for the blood protection (I'm of the opinion that it is necessary, it never came up in canon because it actually worked and kept people away) but leaving kids with family is normal and I really can't see anyone thinking shoving Harry in an orphanage is a good idea.

The fact that Harry suffered no lasting damage is a testament to how little JK Rowling understands the abuse she wrote for Harry and how little she understands children of abuse in general.

Also, Dumbledore dropping off a baby on a doorstep in the middle of the night with the rest of the magical world unaware of where their savior had been living for 11 years implies in the extreme that Dumbledore took sole control over the placement of the child.

JKR started a charity called Lumos that aims to return children in orphanages to their parents so they can get individual attemtion rather than being neglected (in these situations, parents are too poor to raise the kids, so they send the kids to orphanages in countries where orphanages still exist, the parents are alive and want to keep their children, but can't, her charity aims to discourage funding to these orphanages, because the money rarely goes to the kids anyway, and to instead redistribute the money to the parents so they can raise their own kids. I don't mean to paint her as perfect, but in this area, she does good). She started this charity in part as a result of her research while writing HBP, so after she started the series. However, I still disagree with your assertion. JKR's main character being an orphan in a horrible home, and then discovering a magical new land/world/home is an extremely common and long tradition in children's literature. Pippi Longstockings, Anne of Green Gables, Peter Pan, Lyra from His Dark Materials, Series of Unfortunate Events, and so many more. None of these characters are psychologically realistic. I've recently read a book called The Rhetoric of Characters in Children's LIterature by Maria Nikolajeva, and she suggests that books have no obligation to be psychologically realistic, she is not alone in feeling that way. She says especially literature that draws on such long-standing tropes and traditions, such as children's literature which draws on fairy tales and moral stories. Certainly they /can/, but it is a stylistic and valid choice to deviate from reality, and most do on purpose. The degree depends on a variety of things (which is what the book is about, so far to much to get into here). JKR"s characters are not psychologically realistic, which we both probably agree, but I disagree that this reflects anything about JKR's level of knowledge.

**** Abuse is unacceptable morally at all times, but in reality it's always been quite common. Harry's abuse was unusual in some of the specifics, but overall it's well within the scope of experiences that billions of children have gone through. "Civilisation" has gone centuries not merely tolerating abuse of that level or worse, but protecting or even praising it. The perspective that Harry must be this horribly damaged victim is a very sheltered and modern one.

That`s not true at all, even in the 40`s that would be considered appalling, specially when the family has the means to provide for them. Petunia tried to hit him with a frying pan, that`s not `Uh, it`s just a disciplinary beating` that could seriously hurt a child.

And that`s not counting the emotional abuse, no love, no care, no emotional support, THAT`S not common in a developed community. That`s criminal.

Any CS from the 80`s would`ve removed him from there and the Dursley`s would have faced legal problems.

The problem here is Dumbledore never checked on him, never did anything in those 10 or so years to show he cared.

Honestly if Harry was a normal teenager he would be a very different character and given the chance to retaliate, his bout of underage sorcery would probably have killed the Dursleys or hurt them severely.

Except that a large chunk of the characters are later revealed to be related to him because his grandma was a Black. Along with a bunch of other things that make this decision dubious.

Dursleys are the closest relatives I agree. But since Snape knew Petunia, and presumably Remus had at least met them, it wouldn't have been hard to ask about them.

Actually that's fanon. Charles and Dorea fall in his family tree somewhere but they aren't his grandparents. However, since Dumbledore just took Harry and sent him to the Dursleys despite the fact that it's never stated that he's in any way in charge of him other than being his headmaster 10 years later suggests that he was out of line. There's also the fact that the Potters appointed Sirius to be Harry's godfather, and they were all at war and could die, so it doesn't make sense for them to not have backup arrangements in case Sirius wasn't able to care for Harry. Sirius and Peter were out if the picture and since they suspected Remus (for some stupid reason) he probably wouldn't be an option. But that still leaves other Order members they trusted. Maybe they did leave his care to Dumbledore if they trusted him after Sirius, but if they did he just proved that he couldn't be relied on.

****** Who gave Dumbledore the right to put Harry into any home? It's pretty clear that the only reason in canon that he placed him there was to protect him using his mother's sacrifice since Petunia was related to her- nothing to actually do with him going to his closest relatives to care for him. There were other ways to protect him without those protections. Granted that they did end up saving him during a couple parts of the series- but we're also shown that he only needs to stay a few weeks out of a year to actually maintain the protections. Keep in mind that Dumbledore doesn't seem to be acting on the Ministry's behalf in placing Harry per the law, he seems to just take him from Godric's Hollow and placing him where he wants. At this point we only know him as his future headmaster, not a guardian.

As I said, unless Lily and James actually put Dumbledore in charge of Harry's care if anything happened to Sirius, it wasn't his place to choose where Harry was to go. Since we know they had made Sirius as his guardian, and that they were at war and would naturally know there was a risk that any of them could die, it's possible that they did give Dumbledore that permission. However, this is never brought up or hinted at in canon. What is stated in canon is that Petunia and Vernon hated all things magical, Petunia hated everything about her sister, Dumbledore knew this and knew Harry would be mistreated in that home, and Dumbledore had to threaten Petunia at least a couple of times to get her to let Harry stay at their house.

So, we have a few potential options. One, Dumbledore placed Harry at the Dursleys' on behalf of the Ministry as per the law due to all of Harry's guardians being dead or imprisoned. Dumbledore knew Harry would be abused there and did nothing to stop it. Two, Dumbledore legally placed him there due to being granted control of his guardianship by the Potters, and he still knew about the abuse and did nothing to stop it. Three, Dumbledore illegally placed him there outside of the law and against the Potters' wishes. He still knew about the abuse and did nothing to stop it. No matter how you want to put it, he majorly fucked up.

Really, the only way to write Dumbledore sending Harry to the Dursleys and not have him look like a bad guy would be to have him place Harry there due to the law having him go to his closest relatives, have him be completely ignorant of how the Dursleys would treat him, find a valid reason to never have anyone check up on him ever, then have him removed from the home (or provide some form of protection for him if you're going to keep up the blood-protection stuff) when Harry comes to Hogwarts and Dumbledore learns about the abuse.

So...step over the line of responsibility/duty despite not being in charge of him in any way other than being his headmaster ten years later and decide by himself who to give a /one year old child/ to? And somehow y'all think that would not be an abuse of power and position?

I don't know how or why we've gotten to the point that this actually has to be said but you can't just decide (as a headmaster, not even as a social worker!) to give a baby to someone to raise because they were friends with the child's parents in school. That would be quite egregious even in our modern world with functioning child protective services and all.

I'm perfectly fine with criticizing Dumbledore for not checking up on Harry more (or checking up on him but not doing anything about his home conditions) but to criticize him for giving a baby that he had no guardianship over to its aunt like a normal person is just silly in my opinion. Like, how far is this supposed to stretch? Was Dumbledore also supposed to proactively prevent Neville from going to the Longbottoms because they were ended up being so badly abusive to him that he ends up a nervous wreck with no self-confidence to speak of by the time he starts at Hogwarts? Or does only Harry deserve to be protected and Neville can fend for himself because he's not the /Boy who Lived/ - or maybe it's because the Longbottoms are magical and the Dursleys are Muggles?

***** The blood protection is only one form of protection though. There are others that could have kept Harry safe, had Dumbledore placed him elsewhere. Or you know, given the Dursley's an actual choice in the matter, instead of just leaving Harry at the Dursley's house with nothing more then a letter.

*** Neville's family hanging him out a window and attempting to drown him was laughed off because they thought he was a squib. The discrimination against squibs in the wizarding world is comparable to old fashioned and outdated beliefs about disabled people. IIRC, in extreme cases parents did kill children for being disabled, as well as disowning them (which we see in canon), and throwing them into the streets.

If Neville had been a normal magical child with accidental magic, this treatment would be seen as wrong by the rest of the family, and therefore isn't one of the best examples of normalised wizard abuse. I can't think of any other case of a wizard being abused like assumed-squib Neville is.

** I don't see Dumbledore as 100% evil but I see him as a manipulative person. For the first year we don't know what the full extent of the traps where. My headcannon is Voldemort took down most of the overly dangerous things down before Harry and co got there. If Harry never showed would Voldemort be able to get the stone? Maybe Dumbledore had something planned but Harry Potter screwed it up. The second year while he could mention that Harry isn't responsible for the attacks but as far as Dumbledore knew Tom Riddle was the heir but had no proof of Voldemorts survival. Should be say Harry isn't responsible but Voldemort is? As far as Dumbledore knew only Voldemort knew where the chamber was. Dumbledore knew Myrtle was the one killed and could have assumed that was the entrance but Dumbledore isn't a Parselmouth and can't do anything about it. Even if he grabs Harry to open the chamber how would Dumbledore know of the Diary when non of Ginny's brother noticed she had a extra book or even have Hermione look in at her. Year 3 is the first red flag year about Dumbledore. If Sirius is innocent and Dumbledore didn't know then he had no right to dump Harry at his aunt's.(I don't think it's confirmed that Dumbledore isn't anything more than headmaster at the time) if Dumbledore knew he was innocent he didn't say anything. The only 3 people knew where Harry was and 2 are Dumbledore supporters (McGonagall and Hagrid) Ms figg was a squib and could have been happy that someone like Dumbledore needed her help.(she was a squib who would have listened to her) At the end of the school year other than Dumbledore the trio, Lupin and Snape knew Sirius was innocent.(was Snape knocked out before the reveal?) Fudge beloved the kids where confounded and believed Snape and Dumbledore didn't push it (at least not shown) Lupin is a werewolf and not listened to. Year 4 is when the whole not noticing the Moody thing. (Where Moody and Dumbledore close?) Year 5 was handled bad but Dumbledore could have been busy trying to get support and limit Voldemorts support to worry about Harry. He also had to deal with the ministry at Hogwarts. Year 6 Dumbledore should have trained him yes but he knew of the connection to Voldemort. He planned that Hermione and Ron go with him. He could have told Hermione about his thoughts on the Horcrouxs.

I think around year 4 or 5 Dumbledore figured Harry had to die. I don't know if that was the only choice or easiest choice. 5 year could have been Dumbledore trying to rationalize killing Harry and year 6 could have been Dumbledore trying to clear his mind before he had to die. Basically a last show of compassion for Harry not to become like Riddle.

** The problem is that paternalism, as a moral philosophy, has way less prominence in real world society than utilitarianism. Frankly, a large part of this is because it's vastly less popular... I mean, it can easily veer towards compulsory euthanasia (it's for your own good). Thus, when people are confronted by a character whose actions are manipulative they're primed to think in terms of philosophies like utilitarianism (the ends justify the means) that are more familiar. If this character also exists in a book where the phrase the greater good comes up? Boom. Fanfic!Dumbledore in two easy steps.

Now... I'm sure there are plenty of people who'd willingly bash Dumbledore for being paternalistic (i.e. deciding that he knows Harry's best interests acting in pursuit of them). But when you're bashing paternalism the idea that you've got to grapple with is that paternalists actually do care about who they're manipulating. The whole point of paternalism is acting based on your idea of someone's best interests. It's a trick. It's not a lie. It's not secretly about serving someone's own ends. And the basher is now left with a tricky question... how to get the reader to decide a bad outcome is better because it was motivated by neglect, apathy, greed or whatever rather than legitimate concern?

The easiest answer, I think, is to say that Dumbledore doesn't go far enough or that he's not a utilitarian. But, of course, the problem people mostly have with Dumbledore is that he's manipulative or that he's utilitarian. And, frankly, I'm completely the wrong person to ask about why paternalism is bad.

That being said, I do think people are still trying to bash an exaggerated version of canon. It's just that they seize on the manipulation and in doing so tend to end up creating a character that manipulates others for totally different reasons than the canon one does.
