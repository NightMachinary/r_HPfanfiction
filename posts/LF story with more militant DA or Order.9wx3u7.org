I've just finished the Firebird series, which was fantastic, and I liked the way the author militarized the Order of the Phoenix. I've read a couple of other stories with a similar take on it, even if I can't remember which stories they were, and I'd like another to jump into now. Preferably rated M/R as I'm not a child, but no slash please.


** Dumbledore and his Order were utterly ruthless in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877). They pulled off some really nasty ops.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** It's kinda slow, but Harry works for a disabled veteran during the summers because Vernon wants him out of the house. Harry starts to hear and read about military strategies, and introduces it to the DA so that they can take on the death eaters in a new and devastating way. There's two parts, and it takes a little bit to get into, but its a badass story. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2345466/1/Dumbledore-s-Army]]

*** I'm trying to remember the name of another story though, where Harry and Hermione go to Sniper training. In the final battle, Harry is perched something like 600M away blowing Death Eaters, and eventually Voldemort away with a Barrett 50 cal. I remember it being totally badass.

  People rally to a just man, as Umbridge finds when the DA follows Harry to arrest her and demand that the Wizengamot try her for torture. When Dumbledore seeks atonement in battle against Voldemort Harry inherits his power and his responsibilities. Harry must learn to wield those powers in a world where law and justice have powerful enemies and many must atone for injustice done.
