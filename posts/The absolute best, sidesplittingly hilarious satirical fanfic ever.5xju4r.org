linkffn(12335841) This story is absolutely hilarious. Makes fun of all the cliched bad tropes. Give it a try.

  Something to note here is that the content in this particular step honestly doesn't matter. It's to make you feel better so that you can shit on the original version of Harry as much as you can so that by contrast your version of Harry will look good and not like a poorly cobbled together image of what you wanted to become but could never find the will or ambition in your entire life to do so.

** Haha I love it. "For those of you who don't know, putting wrong in italics just makes the person even more wrong"

If you're looking for other satirical fics that make fun of other fanfiction, linkffn(Potter Ever After) is my absolute favorite.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

**** I laughed so hard at Potter Ever After. The part where McGonagall turned into a Death Eater just to have her clothes described... I was so done.

** "[...] and has 90% of all dealable wizarding currency in his vault, which is located deep inside Gringotts because it was built the 'oldest'.

Because that's how building caves works. You start from the bottom and then dig your way up.

Definitely not the other way around."

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA Amazing!

** On the caves part:\\
The goblins could have been deep underground then dug up.\\

The goblins dug deep into the ground for their home, and then made vaults in the deeper sections.
