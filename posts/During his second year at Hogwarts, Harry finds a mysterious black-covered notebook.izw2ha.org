** Harry thinks for a second, and picks up the notebook. 'Voldemort', he writes.

Of course, nothing happens, as that is both not his real name and Harry didn't picture his face as he did it.

Alternatively, Harry does picture his face (after seeing it in year one), but it's still not his real name, and nothing happens.

Alternate alternative, as it is what he is most known by- and what he chooses to go by- the notebook actually kills Voldemort. Except, wait, no it doesn't. All volde-pieces are still horcruces.

Alternately, an alternative to the alternative, Ginny is killed as she is currently possessed by Voldemort.

Alternate (x4), all the horcruces are destroyed/killed. This includes Harry, who doesn't get to come back because Voldemort didn't use him in the resurrection ritual or kill Harry himself.

Alternafive, all the horcruces are destroyed/killed. Woohoo! The day is saved!

Sixternative, all the horcruces are destroyed/killed. This leaves room for the new villain of our series, _______.

As you can see, going off of this, there's a 1/6 chance (probably less than that, I doubt I thought of all the ways it could go) that this saves the day. 1/6 chance that this leads to a new story, 4/6 chance that it just leads to ruin or nothing. 3/6 if you don't count Ginny dying as ruin.

*** I'm going with the nothing happens theory since knowing the person's real name was a major plot point in the original work. After all, L was known worldwide using his pseudonym, which offered him protection. Light had to make convoluted plans just to find out what L's real name was.

** Harry looks at the book in his hand. Another diary? But as he turns it over, no name is scrawled on the inside or the cover. He hesitantly opens the book.

/The human whose name is written in this note shall die/

/Huh/ Harry thinks. He picks up his quill, and writes

/Tom Marvolo Riddle/

before flinching, and looking around wildly. It'd felt like someone had poked him in the forehead with a sewing needle really hard, but noone was around. Also, he was still covered in the Cloak.

Seeing nothing, he looks on the lone name in the book, and a lightbulb seems to go off in his head. He snaps the book closed, before running to the library and grabbing the Prophet from 1981, as well as /Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts/. Then, he returns to his room and throws the invisibility cloak over himself once more. Opening up the book again, he looks at the article detailing the Death Eater trials.

/Bellatrix Lestrange/ he writes.

/Rodolphus Lestrange/

/Rabastan Lestrange/

/Barty Crouch Jr./

/Lucius Malfoy/

...

He finishes several hours later. All convicted Death Eaters, as well as those who very obviously bribed themselves out of it, were now written in the note, as well as Voldemort himself and various major Dark Lords of the last centuries.

When he awakes the next day, everyone looks at the Prophet in shock.

/Mass Murder shakes the Wizarding World!/

/Early this morning, various prominent members of our society woke up dead! The Aurors are hot on the case.../

Harry smiles, but deep down he's disturbed. As soon as the meal finishes, he slips around a corner and veils himself in the invisibility cloak. Creeping into the second floor loo, he hisses the silibant tongue of serpents at a sink, then vanishes into the appearing passage.

Once down, he shudders as he beholds the dead Basilisk, which appears as fresh as when he'd killed it, and severs one of its teeth with a reductor charm that snaps it off at the base.

With one smooth motion, he brings it down on the notebook, which immediately bursts into blazing, white flames. They attempt to grab at him - but are repelled by the Cloak. He legs it, hissing at the inner chamber door to close, then quickly clambers up the slide's back wall, which has a crude ladder etched into it.

/"close"/ he hisses, and the sink slides into place, cutting off the acrid smoke coming from below.

** Harry's not really sure what to think. He's come across a multitude of little ominous things here and there in Hogwarts - it was part of the charm, really. People always talked about the strange charm of a skull that made a neat tune in the wind that they found in the hall, or how they found a map leading to the fabled Chamber of Secrets.

That last one was gaining lots of traction, really. It was annoying and heartbreaking at the same time, how everyone stared at him in the Hall when somebody said it.

This one didn't seem like those, though. It had to be a really stupid prank, because it was oddly detailed. Pages of rules, talks of /multiple,/ he just didn't really understand. Why would anyone go through the effort? It seemed dumb, and he couldn't even tell if there was anything magical in it.

He even asked Hermione - who he knew had been studying ahead for things like Ancient Runes and that sorta stuff - and she didn't find anything. It wouldn't hurt to try, though, would it? Well, of course it would. Harry didn't want to kill anyone, after all.

But who would he never miss? Well, Voldemort. But Harry didn't know his face, did he? He knew that warped thing on the back of Quirrel's head, but it wasn't a face, not with any recognizable features .. Just a twisted pair of lips and beady, red eyes not even like a snake.

He tried anyway. /'Voldemort'/ was scribbled down.

Then .. you know what? Harry had quite the thought. He knew a man he hated quite a bit, that he'd like to see in a grave. But it wouldn't be any skin off his back if he didn't die.

/'Vernon Dursley.'/

---

Harry wasn't allowed to go to the funeral, of course. Not that he wanted to. He was in a foul mood already, the rain pouring outside the Knight Bus, making an even more horrid racket. Heart disease finally claimed him, or so Petunia said, quietly. As if she was afraid. He didn't like the feeling that gave him much.

Of course, Harry didn't think it was because of the Death Note. Even if he kept it in his bag, it seemed ridiculous. Even in a world of magic, who could kill someone just by writing down their name? Not even Voldemort could do that.

He'd very well know. Last year had marked a confrontation with the younger Dark Lord, who went by Tom Riddle. The spirit was almost frustrated with him, with the way Harry was reluctant to speak to him at all. The odd black notebook had almost given him a sense of caution with those sorts of things.

Harry didn't know why it was so important, all of a sudden. But the bus stopped, and he was shot straight out of his thoughts. Quickly, he picked up all of his belongings and got going. He gripped the handle of his trunk, and quickly ran through the rain into the Leaky Cauldron.

But he was eager to know what had happened in the wizarding world since he had been locked away at the Dursley's, remembering harsher times where there wasn't any hope in a dark cupboard. The pub was oddly silent after his entering, as if preparing for something. He wasn't used to it, being Harry Potter.

He picked up the Daily Prophet quickly. The crazed face of Sirius Black greeted him. He read on and on, dread growing. The reason for the death of James and Lily Potter, the newspaper said. The columns went on and on, winding in his head. The death of innocent muggles, Voldemort's very right hand ..

In a dark corner of the Cauldron, Harry scribbled furiously into a notebook, making a name in inky script.

/'Sirius Black.'/

Out in the mild wilderness of Surrey, a black unkempt dog froze in place, and fell limp. It never woke up again, and no one would ever find its body until a few days later, when it stank of rot.

** How human would 'human' have to be? If Slytherin actually porked a snake-being to get Parseltongue, then Voldemort wouldn't be fully human. And that's not covering whatever his DNA would look like after his resurrection ritual.
