- In OotP, he is the suspicious ass who clearly doesn't believe Harry but still come to the DA.
- In HBP, he is the petty ex-boyfriend who is more concerned about mocking Harry's team than commenting a Quidditch match.
- In DH, he is the coward who hustled kids to flee faster.

He never had a good scene in the whole series.

From what I remember, while not being impartial, Lee Jordan biases was mainly calling the Slytherin cheaters, /after/ they cheated. While Smith was just attacking Harry from the start without any reason. I mean, he was clearly accusing Harry of recruiting Ginny and Ron because they were his friends, and (begrudgingly) changed the subject only because they clearly carried the team.

It's probably the reason why Lee was a commentator for at least 5 years, while Smith only got one match.

****** Lee spends an entire game commenting on the Firebolt features. He also uses his commentator position to hit on Angelina Johnson. If I recall Zacharias didn't comment on the Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff game because he was a player. We don't know whether he commented during the final game as Harry was in detention.

With that being sad, the guy made some rude remarks but Ginny knocked him out of the stands. She could have killed him. Also she hexed him for asking her what happened at the DoM. Most socially functional people have other more diplomatic ways to deal even with annoying people.

** Probably Romilda Vane. People laugh the love potion business off, but they forget that not only was the potion the magical equivalent of a roofie, the actions of another witch seventy years before who actually succeeded in doing what Romilda only tried to do (Merope Gaunt) got a LOT of people killed.

*** Merope Gaunt used the strongest type of love potion out there. There are many others that are weaker and we don't know them or their effects. Romilda Vane could very well had tried to give Harry a love potion that would just make him look silly and say cheesy stuff to her. Still shitty, but at least not rape.

**** IRL or in fiction, giving anyone any substance that impairs their judgement, to get them to have sex(or "fall in love" ðŸ™„), without their consent is the shittiest thing you can do, and is rape in my eyes.

***** I agree, but my point is that it might not have been with the intent of raping. Amortentia is the /strongest/ love potion there is. It produced an infatuation so strong that it allowed Merope to rape Tom Riddle Snr.

Romilda Vane tried to give Harry an unknown type of love potion. It isn't mentioned to be Amortentia and we don't know how strong it is. Again, as I said, the effect could just be get Harry to say cheesy stuff, profess his love for her and want to be near her. Maybe the potion isn't strong enough to get someone to have sex or even kiss.

I'm not saying it's okay to impair anyone's judgement, but this doesn't mean Romilda Vane attempted to rape Harry. It doesn't mean it would even be possible with the potion she gave him.

** One could say about Bellatrix that she was loyal or about Snape that he loved Lily. Still terrible characters but they did have some qualities of their own.

Some characters however are simply the worst. No redeeming qualities whatsoever: Umbridge, Draco, Fudge.

If I was writing a time-travel fic, I'd definitely make the protagonist murder these three at the first chance.

*** I wouldn't call Snape's feelings for Lily love, or at least not a healthy type of love, but eh, we could discuss that for days. Now, I'm yet to understand people who argue in Bellatrix's favour that her loyalty to a /mass murderer/ is a good thing. What next? Her amazing duelling skills that she uses to torture and kill innocent people?

Not assuming that's your opinion or anything, but I wanted to point out this might be the weirdest apology excuse I've ever seen (and I've actually seen it quite a few times).

**** Good point! However, it's freedom of speech that's unchecked with unverified sources and quotes...I hated that ethics weren't applied and no disclaimers about the content. Harry Potter was a child with a traumatic past and she had no qualms about spinning lies and making him a "gossip rag" topic. It was already terrible sneaking around as a beetle to get scoops and invading privacy but when she took advantage of an elderly historian and then, sent her a copy of the Dumbledore book liberally mocking her...I totally and thoroughly hated her lol.

I have read redemption for all possible persons (not all of them very good): Bellatrix Lestrange, Tom Riddle, Dolores Umbridge, Vernon Dursley, Romilda Vane, everybody could be redeemed, it just depends on how well it is written.
