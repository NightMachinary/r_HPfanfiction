:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fic some years back.

Harry was sitting in a Wizarding Pub and the wireless was going on about the latest Minister elections. Harry and some other guy talked and got into an argument about how Fudge was actually a good Minister with the man supporting Fudge and kicking Harry's butt(verbally). The fic ends with Cornelius Fudge becoming the minister again and defeating Kingsley Shacklebolt by a landslide.
