Looking for 2 stories. Here's what I remember

1. Harry was making his own fighting group. I don't remember everything but at some point he has a new place where to train his "troops"? I think the fighters where trained as in the army but not sure. They were also healer and the Dursley were taken there for safety at some point. I can't get it out of my head that Harry get's called general by the troops at some point and I think the people weren't trained by Harry himself and they were to learn how to salute military style.
2. A story where Harry is in the Auror program and they train really hard and someone that was visiting was awed by their skills. At some point there was kind of a dueling tournament inter ministry and I think there was a duel between Harry and Draco (they aren't enemies anymore).

Sry if I don't have more information. I'll try to update if it comes back to me


** The first sounds like linkffn(2460564). It's the sequel to linkffn(2163835).

*** Hmm I'm not sure. I tried to look for what I was searching in this story but I don't think that's it or I missed it. I'll look harder and update.

I put more informations on my original request for this fic.

In any way, thanks

**** In Time of Destiny the DA is a real army, the students have military ranks, there is an Air Force on brooms, medic units. The Dursleys are taken to the Grimmauld Place for safety. For me, it sounds like what you asked for...

  This story is a sequel to my first novel-length story, Harry Potter and the Death Eater's Quest. This story is co-written with ghostchicken, who edited DEQ. It's a post-Hogwarts story and we do our very best to stay true to known JKR canon.
