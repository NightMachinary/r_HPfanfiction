Just read this fic last night, and it's great. I especially love the dynamic between Harry and Lily, and wish that Harry would appear more frequently. I like that Harry is kind of a pseudo-father figure, and I like that it feels a little bit like a Peggy Sue fic gone wrong. You get the sense that Harry knows the players but is kind of thrown by Lily's behavior.

And I also like the person Voldemort is in this fic.

I love Harry vs. Voldemort snark, so if anyone has recs for that as well, would be glad to hear it as well.

Are there any other fics that feature a similar dynamic?


** Elsewhere but not Elsewhen is absolutely fabulous - lots of Harry-Voldy snark.

** If you want something with the same feel, I suggest anything by Paimpoint. She is a bit more flowery and less intellectual but is the same dreamy feel as Carnivorous Muffin. lillielle also is an excellent writer for dreamy smart stories that dig in the edge.
