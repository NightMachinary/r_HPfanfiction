James Potter was an Astronomy whiz, and Lily Evans, after seeing the moon landing as a kid, wants to become an astronaut. They work together to launch the wizarding world into their space age, and Harry is famous as the heir to their empire. The main story is about Harry trying to fight Voldemort, a revolutionary sabotaging tech development for the pureblood idea that science and magic shouldn't mix.


** Interesting, go for it!

There are way too few non-crossover 'Wizard in space' fics.

You may want to draw some inspirations from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971), a fic that has some great ideas, but was poorly written.

*** Not so much poorly-written as poorly-characterized, really. The problem with /Starship Hedwig/ isn't the writing, it's that everyone is a goddamn psychopath. The most relatable character in that story was literally the vaguely-muderous sentient alien forest.

**** I disagree. What they faced was unprecedented pressure and stress. They were almost hunted down to extinction, then suffered enormously during their interstellar trip, where a third of their members further perished.

That kind of experience could utterly change people.

No, the failure of this fic lies in the last third, where a super AI popped out of nowhere and shunted the story arc into that unfinished Star Wars crossover.

***** I'm not saying that it's /unrealistic/. It's not, if you take a grim view of human nature (though that, in itself, is sort of OOC since Rowling is most certainly more of a Rousseauist --- I'm sure she wouldn't think Harry or Hermione capable of the sort of thing they do in this).

But it's poor characterization in the sense that turning everyone into psychopaths (even if they have very good reasons in-universe) makes for a poor cast since there is literally no moral character you can identify with. I don't know about you, but unless it's a comedy, I don't /want/ to read about a world where everyone is immoral, a liar or a murderer.

I'm not sure what Hermione did in this story that pissed you so off. She is IMO one of the few who actually kept her morality despite what she had gone through. For example, she was against wholesale extermination of wildlife on another planet, and she was against Harry's plan in how to attack the Earth.

**** This fic did a really good job with the mechanics of magical space travel, such as:

- The spaceship itself has a very small physical size, and living space is created through the expansion charms. Harry with his Elderwand makes sure of that.
- They can not conjure food out of thin air, but they can infinitely duplicate them, so they need to collect lots of seeds and one pair of each animal, kind like Noah's Ark.
- As in canon, apparitions and portkeys have very limited range and are mostly used for transportation between the spaceship in orbit and the planetary surface.
- Interstellar travel is achieved through “floo jumps” by using stars as target heat source.
- Rune stones provide permanent shield charm against physical hazards and radiations.
- Broomstick and banishment charms are used for spaceship propulsion.
- Population bottleneck is resolves through development of artificial wombs and artificial dissemination. Hermione is in charge of these programs.
- Flamel also joins them (the stone in PS was a fake) and gives a PS to everyone. It provides immunity against ALL forms of diseases and extends their average life span to 700 years.

If I were to write a wizards in space fic, I would have them use Muggle solutions for the basic ship design, communication, navigation, and propulsion. With respect to propulsion, they could use conjuration and duplication charms to provide basically unlimited fuel. In the story I mentioned, they later built more ships using the Muggle propulsion system, as brooms with banishment charm didn't work too well.

***** How did the interstellar floo thing work? My first idea was warping space to be smaller, like a reverse expansion charm, so you could achieve faster than light travel.

*** I've started worldbuilding for it, ‘cause its SPACE MAGIC, I can't not write it! I chose to set in the Marauder's era when they are developing magical space travel as the main plot instead, though. I'm currently hung up on whether or not to have the Room of Requirement make a broken spaceship a là D.S.S Requirement by esama, or to have them build it themselves with the excuse of ‘Requirement can't do something as complex as a spaceship'. Opinion?

Bonus if you manage to create a consistent explanation for a) How the Room of Requirement works, and b) why it's infeasible for it to provide a spaceship, without using 'it's too complex.'

***** You could just have them source the materials through the Room. It's my understanding that for the most part, the Room needs to have some measure of access to the items it provides, and maybe the complexity of the magic required to get you into space is a little too much for the Room to just throw together, deus ex machina style.

****** Oooh, thanks for the idea! I've kind of turned it into an explanation as to why you can't make food. I'm headcanoning that life is a type of magic in and of itself, and its impossible to synthesize. So, if you conjure wood, its not natural, its synthetic, like growing diamonds or something, and so it was never alive and never was ‘true' wood.

**** Not sure if this is canon, but I believe that the Room only has access to things that have been put into it, or perhaps things that are somewhere in Hogwarts. And it can't just assemble new things from the resources it has, especially magical things. Otherwise Malloy would have just asked the Room for a working Vanishing Cabinet.

** I really like the idea of Voldemort being a CEO of a big tech company, and the hatred of mixing science and magic. I'm curious if you would keep the main characters in ( Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Dumbledore) Man could you imagine Dumbledore as like a Nasa space agent? It would be so bomb! Just from what you wrote it's already got me excited to read, so I say go for it! And don't forget to let us know how it goes and when it's done!!! Good luck and happy writing <3
