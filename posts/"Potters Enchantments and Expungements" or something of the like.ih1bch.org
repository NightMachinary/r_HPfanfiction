So i was reading through this WP thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/igt1ve/wp_youre_thought_to_be_one_of_the_worlds_most/]] and it got me in the mood to read a fic where after the war, harry opens a shop as a freelance cursebreaker/enchanter and we get to see the world through the history of the items he creates/destroys.

Obv I'm not remembering a specific fic so anything vaguely along this line would be appreciated.


** I'd love to see this, mostly because I'm a sucker for post-war stories where Harry isn't an Auror.
