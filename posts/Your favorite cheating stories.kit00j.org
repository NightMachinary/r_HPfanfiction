As in, taking a very unbalanced canon thing and exploiting it to become uber powerful, like a cheat code.


** Ah, while reading the title I thought about another kind of cheating stories. I know a oneshot which I love, [[https://iulia-linnea.livejournal.com/523403.html][his mother's son by Iulia Linnea]]. It gives a very human take of Ron Weasley and of his relationship with his family. It's probably the only cheating fic in any sense that I've ever read, but if you may be interested you may want to take a read of it, it's very well written, short enough and gives some interesting insights. Plus, apart from one (admittedly rather huge) break from canon it gives a view of the characters that can invite reflexion about other topics too.

  ONE-SHOT. After being entered into the Tri-Wizard Tournament against his will, Harry does some independent research on what precisely "magically binding" means...and comes up with a very different approach to the competition. As they say, the pen is mightier than the sword...but is the quill mightier than the wand?
