So it's been a bit since I read the books but the other day I rewatched the Sorcerers Stone movie and Voldemort asked Harry to join him when he was trying to get Harry to hand over the Stone. Anyone know of any fics where Harry accepts this. Maybe Dumbledore has to defeat them both in the end. Or maybe Harry realizes the Voldemort's just biding his time waiting to kill him.

  Trying to protect the Philosopher's Stone, Harry is kidnapped by Voldemort, who uses Legilimency on him and learns that he is a Horcrux. After that, Harry is forced to learn how to survive the violent and surreal reality of Voldemort's everyday life, and try his best to make it back to Hogwarts in one piece. Simultaneously, a war looms on the horizon. Grey!Harry Sane!Voldemort

  Harry Potter has a problem, and he is rapidly running out of solutions. [Time travel, HP/LV, very slow burn, lots of dead things, canon AU elements.]

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.
