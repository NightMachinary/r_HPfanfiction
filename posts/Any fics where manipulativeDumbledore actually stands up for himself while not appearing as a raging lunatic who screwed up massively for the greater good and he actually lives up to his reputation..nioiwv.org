I know that questions about manipulative!Dumbledore get asked a lot around here but I'm wondering if there are some where he is actually competent as a wizard if not as a master manipulator.

Let's take for example the usual scene where the entire Great Hall turns on him and Amelia Bones threatens to arrest him... is there anything where he actually fights back without acting 'grandfatherly' or whatever and he actually fucks people up like he did when Cornelius and Umbridge were trying to arrest him?

Or Harry throws a violent temper tantrum, more violent than the one in OotP and Dumbledore actually resorts to magic to subdue him rather than trying to explain himself?

Or plotting to put a stop to Grey!Harry's rise to power with an actual competent plot from which Harry only escapes by the skin of his teeth?

Or actually being able to turn people to his side against Harry using his reputation and influence rather than trying to 'grandfatherly' explain why he did what he did? If words don't work, the Imperius curse should sure do the trick just as well.

It wasn't a manipulative Dumbledore story, but I do recall reading a fic where, in response to Harry yelling at him, Dumbledore transfigured Harry into an ottoman. Then he put Ottoman!Harry in front of his chair, lit a pipe, and alternated between explaining why Harry was wrong and blowing smoke rings at him.

  The sequel to Bungle in the Jungle. Told in 2nd person. Harry Potter has returned to England. In the jungles of South America, he became his own man, a hero of his own choice and not unfortunate circumstance. Is it enough to save him?
