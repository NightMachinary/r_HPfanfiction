I cant find any fics where harry doesn't forgive people after the first task besides Losing Control by JackPotr. I'm hoping you can help me find some that aren't one or 2 uncompleat chapters of fictions.


** Harry gets smart and takes control has this as well

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness).

You didn't specify your no-no ships. However this does turn into Tomatoes eventually. Nothing is between them before ch. 24 though, and the chapters are long. It's whatever. I wouldn't say this fic is in my top ten, but it fits your request.
