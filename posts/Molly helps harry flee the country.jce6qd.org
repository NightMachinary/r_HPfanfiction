:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Trying to find a fic where after voldemort is resurrected harry realises how out of depth he is and wants to live his life on his own terms so begins planning to leave Britain behind in an attempt to get out of the combined reach of Voldemort, Dumbledore & the Ministry of Magic

He gets taken to Grimmauld after the attack of Dementors but whilst there Molly learns of his plans to leave and to his surprise she is in full agreement that he should leave as this is a war and she refuses to lose family like she did her brother's in the previous one, she ends up helping him in secret with Sirius pitching in once he figures it out

Cant really recall much beyond that right now, any of this sounding familiar to anyone?
