I get the impression that Arthur thinks muggles are quaint little creatures stumbling around the world wondering how they get on without magic rather than a society of 57 million people (UK,1992) who once ruled 25% of the world.

I would've been far more insulted of his constant badgering about "elekity" or "fellytones" or "How in the name of Merlin can an aeroplane fly?!" Than by the disdain and dismissal of Malfoy.


** Yes and no. I'm going to take this from the perspective of being an ethnic minority.

People like Arthur Weasley are irritating because they're trying to be nice but they're hurtful. You usually have to keep explaining to them why you don't like something they do.

People like Lucius Malfoy are easier to deal with because direct hate is easy to see and respond to. But, people who hate are dangerous. You never know when they're going to decide to act on their hate and it's never just calling you names in public.

At the end of the day, I'd rather deal with the Arthur Weasleys' of the world because their hearts are in the right place and you can teach them to do better.

*** Agreed.

I'm taking it from the position of someone with a disability, which is probably not that different to how Arthur sees Muggles anyway. To a wizard whose magical ability is involved in everything he does, lacking magic *would* be a significant disability.

Arthur's kind in his ignorance. He'd get things wrong, and cause some hurt because of it, but he'd attempt (possibly fail, but attempt) to do better if someone pointed out what he'd done.

Lucius wouldn't even try.

***** ... Do you think the 19th century missionaries in Africa were /intentionally condescending/, rather than genuinely convinced they were doing the right thing and trying to help?

What I'm getting at: The mindset behind that sort of action is such a fundamental thing, so deeply ingrained and a product of its time, that I don't see it changing just like that. Times changes, and /then/ mindsets change. But not during one person's lifetime.

And the "times" here is the static and utterly unchanging wizarding world, and its products are sentiments ranging from Arthur goggling at zoo-Muggles to Malfoy doing a spot of Muggle-Hunting, but in any case an unshaken belief that having magic means being superior. Also in Arthur. /Especially/ in Arthur. (Because he sees the difference every day in his job -- which is rescuing Muggles from magic.)

Ultimately, I don't disagree with your original take: That Malfoy is the more dangerous one (I mean, that's also pretty obvious) and that it's more pleasant to deal with the likes of Arthur, because you can tell him to stfu without you getting cursed. But I disagree that Arthur (and most wizards, for that matter) have a mindset that can be changed.

********* No, I'm arguing two different things, because /everyone/ is. Jesus this thread is full-on on confused.

Insulting, for me, has two components: The mindset and the action. Now /I think/, in the end, what I'm dealing with is the action part, so it's enough to look at that. As long as Lucius Malfoy does not try to kill me (which he doesn't, at least until DH), Lucius sneers and insults me, and Arthur bounces around and insults me. Both need to stfu. One isn't less irritating than the other.

However, apparently, most of the thread disagrees and I'm getting downvoted to reddit hell, lol. So I engaged the "I must consider the mindset argument" and pointed out that in this regard, Malfoy and Arthur are equal, because both operate from a standpoint of Muggles being lesser beings. I don't see how this is controversial either -- both because I consider it a Canon fact (it's simply the standard attitude of 90% of the wizarding world, they can be forgiven for it), /and/ because it's /my/ response to their attitude. I'm not asking anyone to share it.

 

And as soon as I do /that/, the thread shifts entirely and argues that "Malfoy is worse". Which is like ... totally not the question? OP asks which is more *insulting*. Insulting =/= dangerous =/= morally wrong. Insulting simply is a mostly subjective response to a situation, is totally not what you feel "when someone tries to kill you" (that's "afraid"), and I don't get what the noise is all about.

***** Nah, that's "dangerous". There is a difference. Do you feel insulted when someone is trying to kill you? I'd argue that'd be a quite weird reaction.

In terms of what is /insulting/, both are perfectly equal, because that is a question of the mindset, and the mindset of both is belittling. Arthur isn't better, resp. Malfoy isn't worse. The sole difference is what they conclude from that mindset: Malfoy goes all Nietzsche and super-Darwin, proclaiming the rule of the strong, and Arthur wants to study you like a lab rat.

I'd hate either. It's really a good thing the worlds are separate; there's too much of a difference between Muggles and wizards.

I've seen many people here pointing out the obvious, but to give a more accurate example of how Arthur and Lucius interact with Muggles:

​

/“The company you keep, Weasley...and I thought your family could sink no lower --”/

/There was a thud of metal as Ginny's cauldron went flying; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him backward into a bookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads; there was a yell of, “Get him, Dad!” from Fred or George; Mrs. Weasley was shrieking, “No, Arthur, no!”; the crowd stampeded backward, knocking more shelves over; “Gentlemen, please --- please!” cried the assistant, and then, louder than all ---/

​

And Lucius says that while the Grangers family is right in front of him along with the Weasleys. Lucius also scoffs at the Weasley family's poverty just because he is very wealthy.

On the other hand, Arthur said:

"/But you're/ [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Non-magic_people][/Muggles/]]/! We must have a drink! What's that you've got there? Oh, you're changing Muggle money. Molly, look!/"

This may seem strange out of context, but the Granger family (except for Hermione) doesn't spend much time in the wizarding world and so they may even feel comfortable in someone trying to talk about things they understand.

As long as Lucius stayed in his little magical corner not interacting with muggles, that might be something most muggles wouldn't care much about, but after getting together with his master to start a war against them...

To that end, keep in mind that from everything we know, at least pre-DH, Malfoy does not go on Muggle-hunting sprees, and Arthur works as closely with Muggles as is possible for at least a decade, and /still/ has no clue. He had every opportunity to learn and change.

Really, when we're talking about attitudes, I'll take Kingsley's professionalism. He presumably did a good job blending in as the PM's aide in HBP and kept his thoughts, if he had any, to himself.

But that's also not the point, because that isn't what one gets offended about. The (or my, in that first response) point is that if you really must consider intentions, Arthur isn't any better than Malfoy. Both share a world view, and world views have the habit of being very inflexible.

/While working with them every day!/

C'mon man. What's with the ridiculous slack everyone's cutting here? Malfoy, at least, has probably never met a Muggle in his life. /That/ is what I would call ignorant. Arthur should know better, and, as everyone keeps pointing out (though I don't see the relevance), "is the better person", which directly implies he must be held to a higher standard than Lucius "MagicalNazi" Malfoy, whose assholery is just par for the course.

Arthur's mindset, after working in a job that requires him to deal with Muggles for years:

#+begin_quote
  “Fascinating!” he would say as Harry talked him through using a telephone. “Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic.”
#+end_quote

Malfoy's mindset, living in his Manor far removed from any Muggle:

#+begin_quote
  “The company you keep, Weasley... and I thought your family could sink no lower---”
#+end_quote

And by the way, Ron's opinion:

#+begin_quote
  "Doctors?" said Ron, looking startled. "Those Muggle nutters that cut people up?"
#+end_quote

The "lack of magic" and "we are superior" is the fundamental mindset speaking out of /all/ of these, and neither Arthur, nor Malfoy, nor Ron has, before, during or after (19 years later) the series, lost that mindset.

And that is the point.

****** I think fundamentally you've misunderstood the point.

Lucius Malfoy, canonically, has no interest in learning about muggles or changing his beliefs. His ignorance is as much of a choice as possible.

Arthur Weasley's ignorance is due to the separation between worlds and, despite such a barrier, is attempting to improve his knowledge of them and their culture.

I'm genuinly confused on how anyone can view that as Arthur's fault, or even condescending. He doesn't know, and is trying to learn. Isn't that how everyone starts out?

But that aside, yes, that is an attempt to separate them (but you're missing a fact, see below), however, it's also not what the post I responded to argued. The post was "evil human being vs ignorant kind person", and I pointed out -- as you do -- that /both/ are ignorant.

Now, as for your last paragraph, and why your angle doesn't truly work either: Due to his job, which he holds for over a decade, Arthur regularly is dealing with the Muggle world. He is far more involved with the Muggle world than nearly all other wizards, in fact (naturally, since that was the whole reason he took that job in the first place). And after all this exposure, he's still as ignorant as everyone else, and generally of the opinion that Muggles are deficient because they lack magic.

How is that /not/ his fault?

** I somewhat agree and disagree, depending on the situation. If you take them at their actual views, Lucius is uncomparably worse considering he actually wants to kill you. In a more common situation, Lucius is just another racist that will glare at you when you walk by, while Arthur feels like a bit like a virtue signaller who's trying too hard to cover the fact he's a bit racist. Like the guy works in a pretty serious government position, he's clearly not stupid. He could easily just remember what he's told, and not mispronounce the same words for years despite being told about them. To me, it feels like he's trying to show he's progressive, but is held back by his actual biases. Like the dudes on twitter posting pictures of black people reading on a train with that "OH MY GOD IT CAN READ" vibe. As in on a normal day, without Voldemort being in power, Lucius would walk past you, while Arthur is way more likely to do something offensive.

On the other hand, Rowling's characters are written for an eleven year old audience and all require you to suspend disbelief, and realistically Arthur isn't meant to be biased at all, he just has poorly written scenes intended for humor/to point out the disconnection between the worlds.

I think "keep gettings things wrong" is a mischaracterization of Author's character, though.

Arthur is mostly self-taught on muggle culture. He's learning things in a vacuum, almost entirely incapable of reaching out to someone who knows the answers to his questions.

He asks Harry because Harry grew up with Muggles, even though Harry is /not/ a muggle. I think this is an important distinction because it shows that Arthur isn't looking at the individual as if they're a curiosity, but rather their culture itself. He doesn't care /where/ he gets the answers, just that he does. Which I'm not sure how anyone could view as unhealthy.

To directly compare your situation to Arthur's isn't exactly fair because yours is a situation on sexuality, in which case asking questions is inherently very personal. Asking how a rubby ducky works is very obviously not something most people would be offended by.

This is literally what Arthur is doing for a job -- walking around Muggle London, that is. Not so much the learning. I don't see how the conclusion can be anything but that Arthur simply doesn't consider Muggles equals, in much the same way as Lucius doesn't.

Which, to be fair, Muggles just /aren't/ -- they lack magic. But when the question is what is insulting (as opposed to dangerous or morally wrong, which most people seem to be mixing up here), then only the mindset matters, no matter how justified, and both end up looking equally poor.

******* That's actually the case in English as well. The other poster is a member of a particular ideological sect that doesn't exactly /like/ freedom of speech.

** I think if you knew exactly what each man felt, then Arthur would insulting or frustrating, while Lucius would be feared or hated.

That said, Lucius would be considered the bigger problem as he wants to kill or subjugate muggles.

But I think it's a bit silly to rank them based on insultedness. Enemies aren't insulting: they are dangerous.

Arthur is a normal civilian; Lucius is a deadly enemy.

** I would 1000% be more pissed off by Arthur than by a Malfoy. I don't mind douchebags, but ignorant, /arrogant,/ condescension like that would /infuriate/ me. And make no mistake, Arthur may not /mean/ to be arrogant, but he is nonetheless. He views other living, breathing, /thinking/ humans as amusing, clever little children. We're a /hobby/ to him. He doesn't even bother to hide that he just thinks of us as an amusing sideshow, and he never once puts any genuine effort into learning about the people he claims to be so fascinated by. I would /hate/ Malfoy more, because he's a racist and a monster. But I would be more /offended/ by Arthur.

** I would be because I can deal with hate and such but I wouldn't know how to respond to Arthur. He means well, that's for sure, and he's definitely a better person than Lucius, but if he's really interested in muggles then he could just go and research about them?
