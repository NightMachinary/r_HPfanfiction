I would prefer no slash, but I'll take what I can get as long as it's not Draco, Snape or Voldemort. I just want a fanfic where Harry's got someone who can keep up with him.


** In my [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Harry/Hermione stories]], they are generally mostly equal partners with different strengths and weaknesses, but not extremely so. For example, while Harry tends to have the upper hand in combat, Hermione is far from useless in a fight.

One of the best harry/pansy ive ever read and she can totally keep up with harry. Plus its less theyre born just that powerful its that they have to work to be that strong and work hard.
