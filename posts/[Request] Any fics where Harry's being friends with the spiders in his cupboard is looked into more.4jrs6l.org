I know it's a bit of a weird thing to think about, but think about it - Spiders and snakes don't really speak the same language, right? I mean if I was spending all of my time in a spidery cupboard I would probably end up with bites, not friends. Just saying.

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.
