I'm bored with all those Goblin-wank fics and fics in which except defeating Voldemort Harry has no other ambition. So I thought of this prompt.

After the war, while in the process of smoothing things over with the Goblins, they suggest that Harry take an inheritance test. Purebloods and more informed half-bloods and muggleborns know not to trust Goblins, but Harry is ignorant and overly trusting, so he agrees.

After doing the test he finds out that he is the heir to several families whom all of them have huge debts, and because all the members were dead Goblins weren't able to get back their money. Now, here is Harry, heir to all of them and alive and healthy. So they grab everything he has, and because it's not enough they send him to a Goblin-run concentration camp to be a slave for 30 years. And because there is a treaty in place the Ministry can't do anything to help him, despite witches and wizards' furious demand.

Thirty years later Harry is free, but thirty years of constant work has ruined him physically and mentally, so immediately he kills himself, something that he wasn't allowed when he was still a slave.

But instead of the darkness of death he finds himself back in time, in his eleven years old body. He goes to Hogwarts, with becoming the minister of magic and destroying Goblins the only thought on his mind. He is charismatic, hardworking, ambitious, and is always trying to gather allies and favors from others so he can reach his goals easier.

*** True, but the success or failure of a rescue operation depends on actually rescuing your target. It doesn't matter if you bake goblins into pies afterward if they torture and kill Harry first - and if he gets kidnapped right in the bank and spirited away to hidden facility, any overt action will hurt, and any covert action will take time - especially if the 'official' position of Ministry is "We can't help you."

Add in that the 'good guys' usually avoid permanent solutions, going for half-measure and what not... Yeah, problems.

Plus, I actually enjoy the reversal of "Goblins capture Voldemort's followers as branded cattle on behalf of Lord Of Many Names Potter and set them to work in concentration camps".

It's also one of the few non-OOC reasons for a returned Harry to actively pursue vengence and see it through to the end.

Especially if, in the camp, he meets scores of muggle-raised who'd been caught by the Goblin-friend scheme or tricked by blood-test. (Just so his 'saving-people-thing doesn't kick in to save the goblins, but instead condemns them further)

***** I think you're underestimating some aspects of the world-building. When you create the story this is something you'd have to consider, yes? How is this prison/camp set up? Is there a way that they could eventually break him out? What would the consequences of doing so be? Perhaps they TRIED to(or will try to) and there was such horrible consequences that they never tried again for fear of death or injury to friends, family or Harry himself. We have no idea what the protocols are, the guards, where this camp is even located, what is - besides goblins - guarding it? If it's legal they won't have ministry support for a rescue mission. It be a good exploration and I'd certainly be interested in reading something like this to see how the author figures out the details.

I could see this being a very interesting fic depending on how it plays out. Hermione is, as another commentor mentioned, someone who would likely build a fundraiser. I imagine she'd be working towards demolishing the whole slavery ring in itself. While she cares for Harry more than other people, she also cares about ethics and morals and would 100% not be okay with just breaking out Harry and leaving everyone else(even if Ron would be). So....30 years is a long time. I'd make it perhaps less if I wrote the fic. 15 maybe, or even 10...I think the OP underestimates how badly enslavement ruins the mind and the body, and how quickly.

****** I really don't see either Ron nor Hermione, nor the Order, give up on Harry. Also, if the goblins are so powerful, why could three students raid their bank?

But the main problem is that if the goblins were so damned powerful that they could tell the entirety of Wizarding Britain to go fuck themselves after enslaving the saviour of the country, then why haven't they done much, much worse already?

Further, the whole "back in time" plot is, honestly stupid. The main point is Harry wanting to destroy the goblins, presumably using all sorts of politics, dark magic etc. So why the fuck would you want to add time travel with all its problems to that? That's not adding but detracting from the premise. Instead of the Count of Monte Cristo, you have all the shit about time travel, you have Voldemort to deal with again, you have a Harry who is in a child's body with the mind of an adult - creepy much? - and you're stuck with the canon plot and Hogwarts, and trying to explain how an eleven-year-old does politics without everyone freaking out. And you have a suicdal Harry back in time, more mindscrew... that's all stupid shit that doesn't add anything.

So, I'd say, fuck the peggy sue trope. You don't need thirty years to suffer and develop rage. Have Harry spend six month in a goblin debtor's prison or such, see other wizards and witches be abused, some dying from it, until his friends raise the money to free him, and then it's vengeance time.

And rehash all the plot points of the series. Not to mention "just got out of the slave camp, let's commit some suicide!"

There are loopholes but you bring up a lot of good points for sure...all things to consider if someone wanted to make this as believable as possible. I think this would be an easy idea to ruin if it's not done right.

Also the "adult mind returned to the child body" has never been my favorite - I've only ever read one that made sense as the adults around him would notice, surely. I think if you took out that aspect of this, and there was no time travel, the vengeance aspect would be interesting.

******* Eh, while the time travel plot has some /very/ annoying falls it also opens up quite a few doors, for example having Harry hate goblins more than he does Voldemort to the point that he just sends Voldy a letter saying that he is busy killing Goblins and won't be able to attend their bi-annual killing matches that year, the Goblins acting quite baffled at the creepy kid who wants them to suffer while knowing a chilling amount about their culture and way of thinking, hell, maybe even a more bloody version of the Lestrange thief performed /even earlier/ and then Harry just baiting them into a war instead of trying to be diplomatic; not to mention that at this point it would seem as if he was even pettier and more spiteful than Snape, Umbridge and Voldemort together for the other characters (it would be perfectly understandable for us readers, but to the characters it would seem as if first year Harry had just taken offense at some random thing and then ran with it to a genocide extreme).

Though the political angle would be really pushing it and those kind of stories generally degenerate into lordly bullshit quite quickly, much rather if he took the Voldemort path of taking his friends to chill killing and torturing his opposition.

It would probably just all boil down to execution, I could see even a WBWL trope going along well if it was well-written and the author were sensible enough to not stuff the story with more plot-lines than we can be expected to keep up with.

******** The problem is that Harry can't ignore Voldemort if the plot is actually "Harry gets ambitious" instead of "Harry is a drooling moron". If he ignores Voldemort, Voldemort wins and Harry dies. On the other hand, beating Voldemort is the single biggest advantage Harry can get - the reputation and influence he can get by defeating Voldemort will help him more than anything else in defeating Gringotts. So, dealing with Voldemort has to happen if Harry's smart (and using his knowledge of the future).

Let's take even the lousy, overused fidelius charm. As long as the Keeper keeps their gob shut, no one is finding the thing. And good luck finding the one goblin amongst hundreds while the little shits cover for one another. One thing they have over wand-wavers is the unity.

Though honestly? I'd rather see Hermione going fundraiser route. If all people who owed Harry contributed a few sickles, or in the special cases like Malfoy, a few galleons, the thirty years could be cut down to three - enough for trauma and motivation (premise of the prompt) but not enough to fully grind him down in the first timeline.

Because the evil like power, power over people, and they want to see you in fear. They want you to know you're going to die. So they'll talk. They'll gloat.

  They'll watch you squirm. They'll put off the moment of murder like another man will put off a good cigar.

***** Truth be told, we could probably sidestep the whole slavery plot altogether without much trouble. Here is a teen who just won a war having seen many friends die and being traumatized beyond measures, a teen who just so happens to have access to a stone capable of getting him in touch with petty much all teachers in history, a wand that will perform any spell to their most murderous potential, a cloak of invisibility that will never wear off and petty much the entire ministry being run by either his friends or racists that hate goblins. Even some minor scarhorcrux related power boost wouldn't be off the table.

Then you have Goblins baying for blood after the dragon incident, in cannon they seem to have been smart enough to either forget it or be reasonable in their demands for retribution, so what if they weren't? It wouldn't be hard to introduce either a misunderstanding of Harry and his friends standing on the magical world or a cultural difference that leads the Goblins to bite more than they can chew. Harry probably wouldn't be overly concerned by losing some of his own money, but if they went after the Weasley's and Grangers too? Those are much easier targets and things like stealing the burrow or ruining the Grangers would probably hit them much harder them acting directly again Harry even if he is just moderately wealthy instead of filthy rich, make a bad enough offense based on differences between the societies (if having something unspeakables is /really/ necessary than having them *try* to make Hermione pay her part of the debt with sexual services -I say try because I can't really think of any situation Hermione would accept it, to say nothing of Harry, Ron and the order- or even get them to do something like discriminate against Teddy being a werewolf later on) and then you have the perfect setting to get Harry to hate Goblins in a moment when he is powerful enough to do quite the damage if he put his mind to it.

but tbh it was both the "immeaditely kills himslef" /and/ the "goes back in time" that turned me off. It felt a bit disjointed? Like... an elaborated reason to make Harry hate goblins and then throw him back in first year because he died??? It made it seem like it was two fics smashed into one, the "time travel" being only a bridge between them.

Why not write it as Harry spent his childhood in a Goblin slave camp because of all that debt, so by the time he goes to Hogwarts he is filled with ambition or desire for revenge or destroy the system or whatever?

Or the ambition for becoming Minister of Magic comes during those 30 years in the goblin camp, so he starts working towards his goal after he is freed while he copes with the physichal and mental trauma it left on him? And honestly, it would be more believable an actual adult Harry making advancements in this, getting connections and jobs and such, than a freaking 11-year-old lmao (even if he has the mind of a 47 year old).

In the case of this Ambitious Harry, I think it also caused a missed opportunity. OP provided that whole "harry was sent to a goblin slave camp" scenario but concluded it with "and then we would rehash hogwarts, but this time harry would be ambitious". And this doesn't even make sense... who do you think would be more able to make connections, gather favours, work on a political plot and ascend: a capable adult who is a war hero or a literal teenager who is still in school, even if he is "hardworking and charismatic"?

Completely agree! If it's canon divergence - wish fulfillment you want... and it provides much more space for exploring the character, how his different choices would alter the course of the story, and maybe there were some mistakes that he was bound to make.

** Let's odd that the debt to the Goblins was huge due to decades or centuries of mounting interest on the principal debt. The amount owed is so enormous that the Ministry and Harry's allies were unable to come up with the difference or else face financial ruin.

** I have read something like this already .. he gets an inheritance test and looses his fortune[s](not sure if it's just Potter or Black too) due to debts and then once he finishes Hogwarts and defeats Tom, he engineers a goblin rebellion with his newfound fame, connections and starts a goblin genocide for what they did to him .. don't remember which fic though, will post the link if I find it.

  COMPLETE. When Harry is called to Gringotts Bank to meet with the goblin Boneclaw regarding financial matters, things go unexpectedly. Harry is furious. Will Boneclaw come to regret his actions? Goblin bashing. AU after OotP. Oneshot.

** This prompt is ruined by the unnecessary time travel.

Why have him time travel? You say you're sick of fics which don't do new things, and then do the most cliché thing imaginable? No doubt Harry would just play along with school, and be basically a silent observer as canon plays out 100% like it did in the books.

Here's how it should be done:

- Harry is deceived into thinking he's the heir of a bunch of debt, which has him taken into custody by the goblins, his wand broken.

- Their punishment for debtors is forced labor in silver mines all over the world, which makes it exceedingly hard to locate him, because there are so many prisoners and so many mines.

- after 5 years of raids, skirmishes and wars, Harry is located and freed.

- Instead of rehashing canon, the story begins here. Harry is scarred, traumatized and damaged, but he was never broken - no, his will was reforged into steel in the face of adversity.

- Harry becomes ruthless. His new wand is made from the handle of his pickaxe, and its core is a muscle fibre from the arm he lost during the slave revolt that freed him and the other slaves. It becomes a morbid but effective symbol of the cause.

- Instead of a fucked up plan like goblin genocide, Harry concocts something a little more intelligent: he plans to dismantle the goblin nation, its leadership, and Gringotts Inc., liberating the goblin people. There were not just human slaves in the silver mines, after all.

And so on. An original story would be much better than rehashing canon.

** A less exaggerated version where it's 5 years and there's no shinimodori, and he gets out in time to take his NEWTS. He's a wizard, so I imagine the goblins would have taught him something so he's more useful, so his knowledge and abilities may be heavily specialised in one direction. He'll have to figure out how his weird specialisation can help him fight death eaters and catch up on his studies while adjusting to life at Hogwarts.

Or maybe it's 30 years, but the negotiations to get him out succeed after 5 or so but he has to go back to complete his sentence after he defeats Voldemort, making the story bittersweet.
