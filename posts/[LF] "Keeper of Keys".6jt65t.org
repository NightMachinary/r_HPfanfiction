I can't think of the fic name, but I feel like it has something to do with Harry trying to discover Hogwarts' secrets. In this story, Hagrid is /actually/ a keeper of a set of keys passed down through his line of work and was told to give them to a student who asks after it. Anyone have an idea?


** I think it was a Newcomb story linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind]])

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

** I saw this years ago. If it's the one I'm thinking of, someone asking about the keys in a very specific manner causes Hagrid to go into some sort of trance where he's compelled to give the keys over.

I don't remember what story it is, but I almost want to say it was in a Joe or JBern story. Actually, might be in the Deathgate Trilogy?
