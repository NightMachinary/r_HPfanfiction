** My personal understanding is this:

They are not super strong creatures in the typical sense of heavy-lifting, etc. Their perceived strength comes from their magical abilities and their resilience as well as their unwavering loyalty.

I don't believe they are exceptionally powerful. However, they can do wandless magic which is portrayed as powerful in canon. Their magical abilities allow them to perform household chores and apparate among other things. As evidenced in the CoS movie, they do have defensive magical powers as well. Another key feature of their magic is that it is a unique type of magic that cannot be tracked by wizards and is not affected by Anti-Apparition spells, etc. which could provide a unique advantage in a fight.

Their resilience, which shows physical strength to a certain extent, is shown in their repeated self-harm and ability to heal from it and work through their injuries. This also includes abuse from cruel masters.

Finally, although not physical in nature their unwavering loyalty shows great mental fortitude, especially in the face of abuse.

*** Yep, all that makes perfect sense.

Still isn't going to help me get him out of the bathtub though. You know the scene I mean. :( I can't see how my female lead is going to manage it

** The average 200 lb person might be able to carry 100 lbs with effort, so given a 30lb house elf we might able able to estimate 15 lbs. That said, small creatures are often deceptively strong, so maybe 20-25 lbs at a stretch.

*** It's odd. I always sort of assumed they were exceptionally strong (one of the reasons they were valued for their labour) though there is no textual basis for me to have thought that.

Well shit. Now how am I going to get a semi-conscious male character out of a bath tub?

**** My understanding of their magic is that it is not traced by the Ministry. In CoS I believe Dobby caused his Hover Charm to be traced to Harry on purpose, even though it wouldn't normally have been. This is proven by the fact that Dobby's apparition to and from Privet Drive didn't register a warning.

Thus, I think the elf could perform a Hover Charm on a semi-conscious male without the Ministry's detection of magic.

***** True - its why he allows Carou to be around in the first place. I still think he wouldn't allow magic of any flavour around Archie though. Do you?

***** Yeah sorry, thinking aloud about my story. The character in question has a very valid reason to avoid the use of magic in his home.

** That's a good point and I agree. Since he has Carou around, is he doing magic at other times? If so it is consistent for him to do it in this case and would be odd to suddenly prevent it. I do agree that Archie should not be in the scene if that's the case; however, the scene is directed to develop the adult relationships anyways so that would be fine.

If he prevents Carou from using magic at all times, then he definitely can't use it now. Although, I would think he'd have to use magic for some things, such as disillusioning himself from Muggles.

*** No, He doesn't allow Carou to use magic at all - that's why it was a "Big Deal" when he leaves Archie with Carou in the final act with the instruction he is to "protect Archie by /any/ means necessary"

I think the relationship between he and Carou is atypical to most we have seen (except perhaps Harry and Dobby)for the better part of 6 years he's really only had the house elf as a confidante and I think they are closer to being friends than anything else. I imagine the particular family to whom this elf belongs would have valued intelligence in their servants rather than obsequiousness though don't you?

** Based on your characterization I don't think he'd allow any magic. However, that opens a few more plot holes that would need to be filled.

*** Exactly. I think he tolerates Carou coming and going because he needs someone to watch over Archie that he can trust - someone who would do exactly as he was told with regards to magic.

** Good point. He'd definitely be a family member more than a servant. Perhaps if he was told "No magic except in emergencies" in order to leave a loophole in event of an attack or something similar resulting in the need for protection of escape, Carou could use his intelligence to creatively interpret that. When he sees his master and family member/friend beaten and unconscious, he would interpret it as an emergency.

It has been shown in canon that house elves can be creative in interpreting their orders. Usually when they have motivation to disobey their masters, although in this case he'd be motivated to care for his family/master.
