Couldn't think of a good title. But it's like I have ideas and plans for a Marauder trilogy. A story about the rise and fall of Gellert Grindelwald.

And then there's my 14K harry kills bella /Harry-Tonks story i've got but want to stop because it a cliche ridden mess, and the Harry's brother story raised by Regulus i've got.

But I'm no where near good enough to write them and I've got so many good scenes but no filler.

Sorry yes. I just find i've got too many ideas and no patience or skill to do it properly.


** I have an idea about a Ron Weasley BWL, and how he'd cope with it all. Would never write it though. Not enough time..

*** Would this mean every immediately related Weasley except him would be dead? That'd be neat.

** I have several ideas.

One in which Interpol, the EU and the NSA are aware of the political shifts in magical Britain and together with the Inquisition of the Vatican, seek to destroy the Death Eaters. The first chapter I have follows Mongsignore Giacomo Giacinto who meets his team of US-Army Magehunters, GSG-M agents and Dr. Wolfgang Thadd√§us Poratschek (a half-goblin blacksmith and specialist in the field of anti-mage weaponry and armory). The closer it gets to the battle of Hogwarts, the more the story gets influenced by these special muggles. In the end, the battle of hogwarts is more of a full front offensive including several Armed Forces as well as organisations such as the Templers and the Freemasons.

The other circles around, Freyja, a seer-girl that gets in the same class as Harry Potters firstborn, James Sirius. Shes a bit on the shy side since her abilities make her a bit quirky in the eyes of others. She can smell souls, touch strings of fate and hear the whispers of what could be and what could've been. James Sirius, curious and kind as his parents, befriends her. Its more a romance thing, but the underlying premise is that Hogwarts opened up to all magical kin who're willing to attend (one of the many reactions, maybe even overreactions, after the war). Meaning that the school in addition to humans, becomes home to centaurs, goblins, elves, vampires,... sparking some interesting conflicts to write about.

My last idea that is somewhat noteworthy is about Aurelius Lander, a former student of the Macchu Picchu Academy of Magery (you might've noticed by now that I like OC). He gets an invitation to study at the Valhalla University of Magics and Shamanism (think MIT of the wizarding world). As an outstanding student of the fine art of Demonology and Mythology and a capable summoner himself, he dreams of seeing earth from the perspective of the moon. It is said that from there you could see all planes of existence that surround the earth. To achieve his goal he begins to study magical engineering. A few months into his studies he comes to a roadblock. He is about to give up his hopes of ever flying/apparating/flooing to the moon when a professor introduces him to another prodigy of this time. A powerful witch that exceeds her peers in knowlenge about both Arithmancy and Standard Wand Supported Manipulation Magic. Her name, Hermione Granger. (FYI: Standard Wand Supported Manipulation Magic, or SWSMM, spoken Swasumm, is the term I gave the stuff they teach at Hogwarts).

Unfortunatly, none of these stories exceeds 10 chapters since I do have to work and learn a lot for my master degree. However, I do hope to finish at least one in the next 2 years.

** yeah i have get an idea everytime i read/watch something interesting

Right now i want to write

- A HP/SG1 Similar to Isis' Bane but more about family and less about how powerful harry can get. got this after Reading Isis' Bane
- A Story where harry meet an weird girl when he is 8, she ends up being muggleborn and quite powerful (think Tom Riddle when he was young) and end up bonding because they are both considered freaks latter the girl turns into something like a dark lord and harry briefly joins her side (mirroring Dumbledore and Grindelwald) Somehow Haruhi Suzumiya inspired this story
- A fic where canon harry becomes Female but instead of focusing on who to pair him with, focus on how people treat women diferently and how the mind of male interacts with the body of a female. after reading Boku Girl and Balance Policy (NSFW/NSFL!!!)
- An Stargate Fanfic where humanity became advanced rapidly (to a level similar to the Humans in EVE Online) and how the Goa'uld get rolfstomped by them. I Am an eve player.

plus a few original stories i have in mind

*** I'd be quite interested in the third one. With some good research this piece could be a interesting approach to gender studies, especially women and men studies.

** I think what annoys me most is getting really good ideas for things that will only work as a series, but only having inspiration for one or two chapters. I put out as much as I want to, but it seems like the story's not done, and people comment begging for the next chapter, and even though I feel done with the story I crank out another 10 chapters to end it properly and appease my readers, and feel ashamed of the poor quality.

Also a lot of my stories tend to have patterns (ie. One normal chapter, one flashback, one normal chapter) and I get frustrated because I've written 10 flashbacks but only have ideas for 6 chapters or something. At the moment I'm writing a series of short stories based around potions; One chapter gives the recipe for the potion, and the next is a one shot based around the Hogwarts students' escapades surrounding that potion. I haven't released it yet, but plan to release the potion recipe a few days before the short story as a teaser/hint at what's to come. I got really excited and wrote heaps of potion recipes, but only have ideas for 3 stories, it's really frustrating that so much of my work might go to waste if I can't think up more story ideas.

** I want more Harry/Tonks. :( But I just keep getting flooded by Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, Remus/Sirus, Remus/Tonks, and so many pairings that follow into clique.

*** The Rebel and the Chosen.

One of my favourite romances, even though it feels kinda wrong reading it.

*** I feel your pain. Harry/Tonks is my OTP but there is hardly anything once you've read the main few ones. That's one of the reasons I tried the first story but I just cant go on with it..

** I had an idea where Harry would snap and kill the Dursleys with accidental magic. Haven't really done much about it, though, nor do I have the time to.

** I keep getting distracted from my ongoing fic(s) by new ideas.

And I've had an idea for a particular story in mind for over a year now, but simply haven't gotten around to starting it. I'm not even sure why, probably because I don't want to start yet another fic before the current ones are done.
