I feel like he was, but it seems as if in every fic I read he wasn't. Why? Is it just to give him a chance of living or am I just forgetting things?


** The book says:

Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix's jet of *red* light... the second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest... his eyes widened in shock... his body curved in a graceful arc as the sank backwards through the ragged veil.

Emphasis mine and some sentences removed for brevity. So he was hit by a curse but the curse is not specified. If it was the same as the curse /before/ that one, the light would have been red which is definitely not the killing curse.

*** Could a sworn the book said it was purple. Or was that just Bella's opening spell from the scene..?

**** Definitely red in my edition (original UK book). Skim read the whole battle and could only see reference to red and green from Bellatrix but that was only a cursory look.

** He wasn't in the books. The books don't mention what spell he was hit by. It's only described as a another light.

** Most fanfics go off of book-canon, not necessarily movie-canon - and they differ occasionally.

The movies definitely have him hit by the Killing Curse.

The curse Sirius gets hit by is left ambiguous in the books, but it's implied by writing convention to /not/ be the Killing Curse - the previous flash of light from Bellatrix was red, not green, and it's never stated the color changed.
