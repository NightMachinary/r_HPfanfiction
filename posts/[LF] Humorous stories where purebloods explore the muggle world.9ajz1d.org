Hoping to find some stories featuring purebloods getting their minds blown by the everyday life of the modern muggle.. preferably 40000+ words..


** You might like [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307662][Muggle Studies]], it has wizards being astounded by Muggle society. Also very funny.

  Archibald Penrose had a rubbish job: poor students, low levels of respect, high causality rates and some degree of amusement (depending on how you look at things). Why the hell would anyone want to be a muggle studies teacher?
