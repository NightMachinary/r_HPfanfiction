One of my least favourite tropes in this fandom is the obsession with keeping the timeline intact, even if only covertly. Like, go wild. Do stuff.

*** Parts of the end scenes in the hospital wing with those memories are just wonderfully done. I sometimes reread the story, which is great overall, for just that part.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  “This is the most stupid thing you've ever done!” Hermione yells after Harry. Then she blinks. They're no longer at Grimmauld Place and, sitting huddled together on a familiar four-poster bed with red hangings, are four teenaged boys, staring avidly at them. Well, this is just brilliant, she thinks. “And you didn't even get the year right!”Or: the one in which Harry is done with the war and thinks it's time he got something he wanted for a change. He misses his godfather, goddammit.
