Muggle Studies isn't actually about learning muggle culture. It's about learning the muggle sciences such as physics, chemistry, and biology.

Maybe its a new professor that starts teaching this secretly in order to create a wave of scientists come out of Hogwarts.

All of the Muggle Studies students secretly take over the muggle world with magical devices disguised as mundane.

Or something like that.


** I like the idea that a wizard could be well versed in Shakespeare and other muggle literature, could be able to recite Newton's Third Law or whatever by heart, but they can't, for the life of them, dress like a muggle or understand the slang lol. Kinda like how you can study a language in school, but unless you like, /study/, a native of that language would still be able to carry out a conversation that would confuse you to no end. Though that's a pretty lame analogy.

*** Yeah, it's crazy how you can understand almost every word but be completely lost on the meaning if you don't understand the speaker's slang and cultural references.

The Magicians, which in someways is a very AU Harry Potter/Narnia crossover, has a scene where the characters know they are being spied on so they communicate in pop culture references that they know their enemies, who have lived in the Narnia parody world their whole lives, wouldn't understand.

Having Muggleborns use a similar code to get around purebloods spying could be a great idea for a fic.

*** Muggle studies is the sciences and and stuff but doesn't include how to dress. They assume it's obvious

** It's got to be both. Basic muggle studies is for wizards who grew up without much muggle contact who need the class to not be a walking secrecy issue, but unfortunately not everyone who needs it takes it. Advanced muggle studies would be about understanding how muggle society works by examining the engineering challenges of not having magic. For example understanding the physics of how planes fly, which leads to understanding the engineering constraints, then why cities have airports and the economics of aviation compared to the cost of a portkey, and finally do a class trip to an actual airport. Then cover the physics of electricity, the engineering of how lights and electric motors work, the things muggles use these for where wizards use magic, the economics of electric power and finally visit a power plant. Maybe the biology of plants, the chemistry of making nonmagical fertilizer, the economics of modern agriculture and then visiting a farm and seeing tractors at work. Every topic you cover what the challenge of doing something without magic is based on the hard natural laws, then the engineering of how muggles solve it, then the economics of how hard/expensive it is compared to doing it with magic, the impact this has on society, and finally do a class trip to visit an actual example.

** It happens in linkao3(October)

The Muggle Studies professor teaches about science. Each year he takes the most active rulebreakers and forces them to stage Hamlet.

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux.

*** This sounds excellent. Do you have a direct link? When I searched for October within Harry Potter fandom, it pulled up 72 pages of results. :O

With muggle studies put in, I couldn't get anything.

**** Check out ffnbot's reply

But it would be a while before you see this character become a professor

** Wait, I actually really love this. I could see students suddenly graduating Hogwarts and finding all these super practical solutions to problems that couldn't fully be solved by magic...
