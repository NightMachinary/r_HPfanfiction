Hello. Figured this would be the best place to ask after realizing the sub I originally posted in was way less active.

I'm looking for very well written fanfiction with one of three premises:

1. An origin story about Tom Riddle and his journey to become Lord Voldemort.

2. A tale about the school years of Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew, Sirius Black, and James Potter.

3. An origin story about Severus Snape

Because the fanfic community is massive, I'm sure someone has written something along these lines, and I'm looking for the best of the best.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks.


** Tom Riddle:

The imposter complex

Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

Is not an origin story in the sense that we don't follow the original Tom Riddle but when horrocrux Tom Riddle gets out he does his best to find out how he became the Lord Voldemort we see in the books and follows his footsteps across the world researching magic. Is really good story with a lot of original elements to it.

** As for the other two requests: All the young dudes

LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.

I have never read it but I have seen is really recommended.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

  It's 1975 and Whoever-He-Is has turned his eyes towards Hogwarts. Muggle-born Lily Evans is certain her best friend has been recruited by the Death Eaters. She's less certain about her future in Wizarding Britain. And she has absolutely no idea how to handle the dark-haired, outrageously privileged, obnoxiously talented toerag named James Potter. A canon-compliant account of the first Wizarding War and the teenagers who fought in it.

  Severus Snape is going straight to hell. The people he calls his friends are helping him get there.
