I'm working on my second attempt at a Harry Potter AU. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9265719/1/For-the-Price-of-a-Soul][My last one]] had many flaws, with the major two being my writing style (I won't do that type of thing again; I learnt my lesson) and closely following the canon plotline with the aid of a Gary Stu. I think I've learnt some major pitfalls to avoid this time, but I'm hoping for advice on what else to be careful about.

Some issues I know of:

- Hedwig. I've seen it mentioned in at least one of the "things you hate in fanfic" posts that Harry almost always ends up with Hedwig no matter what else changes, and I committed this crime in my other fic. This Harry will have no snowy white owl for a pet.

- The holly and phoenix feather wand. Harry is not the BWL in this fic, so with no connection to Voldemort it makes sense he also won't connect with the brother wand.

- Neville. Also not the BWL (there is no BWL, nor Anyone Who Lived) and he has two living parents (and a little brother). A different upbringing is going to give him a slightly different personality, but I want to be careful not to make him completely OOC. Advice on this is appreciated.

- Lily and James. They never die in this fic (nor are even specifically targeted); I've only read three fics where they survive, but I get the impression that a great deal of them involve Harry being mistreated for some reason or another. I don't intend to write that, but are there any common issues with living L/J that I should be careful of?

- The war lasts almost a year longer than in canon; I realise this will affect the wizarding world. The most obvious way to show this seems to be to kill of some people who survived the first war in canon, but any pointers on other ways I might show the effect of a longer war when the fic is set primarily in Harry's first year at Hogwarts?

- Snape is Voldemort's killer. It's not common knowledge he was ever a Death Eater (which he went into as a spy, not a loyalist turned traitor). I figure people are going to react differently to an available adult hero than they will to a hidden away child, but I'm not sure what kind of differences. What do you think the Ministry would want from him, and what would he be willing to do with/for them? Should I have random people stopping him in the street asking for autographs or something? I can't imagine Snape would react well to that, but how much unpleasantness could he get away with before people start denouncing their hero?

What other advice do you have for me (or anyone else writing an AU)?


** These are all pretty minor things. As an author, you're free to tweak most anything and play out the consequences.

More important is that you /have a story to tell/. Before you start putting words down, you should be able to answer questions like: Who are the main characters? What drives them--what do they want, what do they need? What challenges will they face? What are the essential conflicts about which the story centers? What are the primary story arcs about which your tale will be told? How are your characters going to grow and evolve as a result of facing these events? What POV and narrative style do you plan to employ to tell this story best?

Finally, because this is fanfiction, what sets your story apart from all the rest, the million-plus HP fanfiction tales to be found on ff.net, AO3, Patronuscharm, SIYE, phoenixsong, etc.? What new, fresh perspective are you offering that would make your story worth reading?

** I don't know about everyone else but I've always found comfort in Hedwig. She was always something that stayed the same and was there throughout the books. Other pets - snakes, phoenixes, panthers, other owls (I've read a lot) - I've seen and dealt with just fine. The pet usually isn't brought up much throughout the story anyway.

The wand isn't something I gripe much over either. It's a wand; it does some stuff when you put magic through it whether it's Harry's wand or the Elder Wand. It's not as important as you think it is as I usually forget about the wand configuration right after I read it unless it's one of the central aspects of the storyline.

I think the reason that people like to have Harry abused is simply to add drama. A story is boring unless Harry is suffering in some way (usually) though it can depend on the genre.

Finally, the war lasting longer. Depends on what you do with the rest of the story really. If you aren't going to be following canon too much, then you can do what you want with what organizations may form or military legislature may be passed to combat Voldemort.

** If there's no BWL then the wand could feasibly go to anyone, hell, you could even have Snape break his wand destroying Voldemort then replacing it with the Holly and phoenix feather one.

You could have a brief narrative when you introduce Snape, and say that despite his fame he quickly became known as one of the more irritable wizards, as those who would beg him for an autograph could attest to.

Etc...

Hedwig is always nice to have, personally she's just a breath of fresh air in my fic, and an amusing by-point in the greater scope of things.

--------------

Also, what is the end goal for your fic? Is it just a one-shot narrative following Snape killing Voldemort? Do the horcruxes come into play and as reader we learn that any horcrux=/=Voldemort not dead and so he is reborn?

You could have the prophecy still made, yet Dumbledore is flummoxed about what it could mean... And then how are Neville or Harry marked? etc...

Also, with regards to Neville and Harry's parents, how will that effect the boys? Will James Potter grow beyond his dislike and bullying and Severus? What happens with Sirius?

Good idea, I like that.

I hadn't considered giving the holly/phoenix wand to Snape, but now you mention it I could certainly work it into the story and play it into the "final battle" scene. (In quotes because it's won't be a big battle, but I haven't quite figured out exactly what will go down in the end.)

I suppose the end goal is two-part: Voldemort's true death, and getting Snape to a point where he's happy (or at least content with his place in the world). Currently it's sitting unfinished at 90,000 words (I'm a little stuck and not really happy with several parts), but I only mentioned the issues I thought most relevent, because anytime I expanded I ending up writing massive amounts that I didn't think were actually relevant to the post.

As is, it follows Harry's first year with alternate chapters of key points that went differently in the past to show how/why things are different. The horcruxes are known; I'm not killing Regulus Black and Dumbledore will learn of them, but he tells no one that he realises there's more than one until after Voldemort's death. Also, given that he has an extra year, I'm debating having him succeed in making his sixth horcrux. All but Hufflepuff's cup will be destroyed before 1991, and the cup will be used as part of V's resurrection ritual within the story. [I'm still working on the details of that though and whether he'll be reborn (secretly?? known to the reader but not the characters?) about halfway through the story (which gives him more villain points) or at the end as originally planned (which means he dies for good not long after he's reborn, which kinda makes him a bad villain I guess...)]

As for the prophecy, I'm turning that on it's head by having a propechy--just not a true one. Dumbledore makes up several to tell people he suspects to be spies during the war, and when he hears which one Voldemort believes it enables him to discover the traitor in the Order. Unfortunately for him, this lying is going to come back and bite him on the arse because one of the people he tells is Snape, who suffers some mutilation as a result of one of the false prophecies, figures out what Dumbledore did, and blames the headmaster for what happened to him.

Neville--I figure he's going to be less nervous than in canon, a little more confident in himself and his skills with two encouraging parents raising him, though he still gets nervous and clumsy around his strict grandmother. I figure being a big brother is going to boost him too, give him a sense of purpose as a protective older figure. Still excels at Herbology.

Harry's a little more complicated and ties in with James and Snape's relationship because surprise! Harry is actually Snape's kid. (I know it's overdone, but I like the idea too much.) Also, not much of a surprise in story: Harry's parentage is commonly known because he has Snape's surname. Part of Snape's reasons for going into the Death Eater's as a spy was because of a better relationship with Lily (no Mudblood incident) and they marry (secretly) right out of Hogwarts. Snape's spying keeps him away a lot though, Lily realises she doesn't actually love him it was just a rash teenage decision, and she ends up cheating on him with James. Snape finds out shortly before Voldemort's death, they divorce and L/J marry, and Harry spends his years between his mother's home (term time) and Hogwarts with his dad (school holidays and every other weekend).

Thus far I've written Harry fairly well adjusted to the situation. By the time of his first year, I figure Snape and James can at least be civil to each other, but earlier on Snape would have been especially bitter and hateful to James and Lily, possibly even tried to get sole custody of Harry initally after the divorce. I think any problems Harry does suffer would more likely come from Snape--lil Harry's going to hear his dad trash talking his mother, then if he starts parroting daddy's words in front of mummy then Lily'll have to confront Snape and tension between them could increase. I am trying to find more info on how children deal with divorced parents (mine have been married my entire 25yrs, and then some).

Sirius suffers the Longbottoms' fate and ends up in Saint Mungo's. Remus is killed and Pettigrew gets away before anyone manages to kill/arrest him for being a spy. Not to join the Weasleys, however, because the Potters and Weasleys are friends so he'd get found. But all this would make James mature emotionally very quickly and his disposition towards Snape would alter. Something along the lines of "I've just lost all my friends, I can't waste energy being a git to you, and I realise I've kinda nicked your wife so I should probably be on my best behaviour. Also you killed the big bad Voldemort; I don't want you killing me too." He does his best to treat Harry fairly and not favour his two daughters over him (at least not too much), but I also think James taking the "better man" route might make Snape even more bitter, especially if Harry comes to him on weekends talking excitedly about how James is teaching him to fly or whatever.

This isn't a story about Harry Potter.

It's a story about Snape and Lily having a /better/ bad relationship. The point of departure (and any well-made AU has a single point of departure from which most of your changes should result) is Snape becoming close enough to Lily to conceive a child and also become dangerous or lucky enough to defeat the superhuman Voldemort.

Their child isn't Harry- call him something else. He isn't genetically a consequence of James and Lily, he isn't prophetically relevant and he isn't raised within the abuses of a repressive muggle family while being emotionally protected by the sacrifice of his mother.

Therefore, if Junior Snape is the main character, you're going to have to sell the audience on his being relevant, important and at some level likable.

***** You say what I guess I've been a little afraid of admitting. A different name for the kid certainly occured, but I suppose I'm afraid of losing potential readership when Harry's character is replaced by an OC. If I would only end up with reader's complaining that Harry isn't really Harry and abandoning the fic anyway, I suppose it doesn't matter.

I do think I've made Junior Snape relevant and important. Might have to work a little more on the likable bit, especially when presenting him as an OC instead of riding on canon Harry's popularity.

I can imagine turning this premise of yours into a nice novelette with years or months between chapters, but I guess you went the whole-hog route. I don't blame you, sounds like something I'd read. There's nothing wrong with a little filler, and you've got an enormous number of critical scenes to describe to their fullest, anyway.

You could do Snape kills Nagini at the same time he kills Voldemort? Perhaps have Nagini's death be the opening for the killing blow?

/ results in Snape wondering how the hell the snake affected him so...

Have Snape shitting himself when he realizes the Dark Lord is actually back - I want repeated and sustained assassination attempts, I wan't some of them to get bloody close to happening too. You could make a plot point out of him being saved by [love interest] and they develop something interesting and all that lovey-doveyness that I find abhorrent.

I like this bit in particular - especially if the reader is drawn along Dumbledore's manipulation too, I'd read a smart Dumbledore!Bash any day. You can make the realization Dumbledore has played him into a huge paradigm shift/pinnacle of a chapter.

What will he do to the Headmaster for his being set up.

Harry's parentage is commonly known because he /is/ Harry /SNAPE./ Part of Snape's reasons for going into the Death Eater's as a spy was because of a better relationship with Lily and they marry in secret out of Hogwarts.

#+end_quote

It /could/ work, and I guess you have the social stigma attached with being the kid of the vanquisher of the Dark Lord and all.

You have to write Lily as a misguided and really damned stupid lay-around - and have that sort of attention on her, because she sounds like a massive bitch.

#+begin_quote
  ...written Harry fairly well adjusted to the situation. By the time of his first year, I figure Snape and James can at least be civil to each other,
#+end_quote

They should be professional, but civility will be impossible, as Snape should be seeing James as responsible for not rejecting Lily's moves and thus directly betraying him.

THOUGHT: Lily dies, Snape is somewhat upset yet doesn't really care - James/Snape conflict arises due to that?

#+begin_quote
  ...but earlier on Snape would have been especially bitter and hateful to James and Lily, possibly even tried to get sole custody of Harry initially after the divorce.
#+end_quote

You could have him winning that based on his Vanquisher status, then you can write about the drama that arises due to that.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Woopey, mine separated but didn't divorce:

Lots of awkward tension... mood swings they try to stop Harry from seeing... arguments they try to stop Harry from hearing.

But Lily cheated on Snape, so any potential fighting on her part should be construed as abso/-fucking-/lutely out of the question.

In fact, Snape - out of spite, might tell Harry exactly how his mother betrayed him, then warp Harry's mind against his mother?

#+begin_quote
  Sirius suffers the Longbottom's fate and ends up in Saint Mungo's.
#+end_quote

That's really a downer - perhaps have him have moments screaming and terrified and so on, truly a broken man rather than a vegetable - and have Snape feel content that he suffered.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I take it Pettigrew helps Voldemort's rebirth.

#+begin_quote
  Potters and Weasley's are friends so he'd get found.
#+end_quote

How are they friends? I gathered myself that Dumbledore only really "let in" the Weasley family through Gideon and Fabian connections - and then they died. So... Potter's come into it how?

#+begin_quote
  James' position towards Snape would alter... "I've just lost all my friends, I can't waste energy being a git to you, and I realize I've kinda nicked your wife so I should probably be on my best behavior. Also you killed the big bad Voldemort; I don't want you killing me too."

Makes sense, but I'd think avoidance is key here. They forget the past so long as they forget each other.

#+end_quote

I'm still on the fence as to whether Snape would let James play father to Harry or anything. You could create a sense of "This is all so calm yet fucked up" by having Lily only allowed specific times to spend with Harry and a rigid set time whereupon Harry has to get back to Snape, and so on...

Dumbledore doesn't go to the cave. Sorry, that was a little unclear. Regulus still finds the locket horcrux, but he orders Kreacher to make sure they both get out of the cave, and when Regulus recovers from the potion he seeks protection from Voldemort and Dumbledore learns of the horcruxes from him.

#+begin_quote

I wouldn't want to use Nagini. I always figured Voldemort found Nagini /after/ his inital death, not before, and that she was a last minute "shit I've got nothing else to use" horcrux, so I'd want to come up with something else.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I don't want to portray Lily as the bad guy. I'm not saying adultury is acceptable, but I don't want to completely villify her for it either. She married her oldest friend straight out of school, in the midst of a war, and she was a little excited by the fact that her lover was being a big hero by bravely joining the bad guys as a spy. But in reality, Snape's spying keeps him away from her a lot, she gets several years spending more time around other people and realising that maybe she doesn't actually love Snape. Her decision to cheat was misguided and wrong--she should have parted from Snape before going to James--but I don't want to write her as a bitch. Hopefully the full text does that in ways my summary doesn't.

#+begin_quote
  THOUGHT: Lily dies, Snape is somewhat upset yet doesn't really care - James/Snape conflict arises due to that?
#+end_quote

That, I will not do. That's killing off a female character just to cause manpain and besides, I think there's more conflict to be had with Lily alive. James could get iffy with Snape for not being more upset by Lily's death, but ultimately Snape would be able to take his child and move on from it all. He could just completely turn his back on James. Alive, Lily and James' relationship is a constant reminder of what Snape lost. Also, I am having Snape get into a relationship with someone and it's his first of any real significance since the divorce so killing Lily would make it seem like Snape couldn't move on until she was dead.

#+begin_quote
  In fact, Snape - out of spite, might tell Harry exactly how his mother betrayed him, then warp Harry's mind against his mother?
#+end_quote

This seems all to Snape-like. I considered it, and I know it's the kind of thing he just might do, but it makes my gut twist to have one parent poison their child against the other.

But this fic is making me consider a lot of issue I don't like. I'm going to have to think a lot on Snape's dealings with the divorce and their child and all this.

#+begin_quote
  How are they friends? I gathered myself that Dumbledore only really "let in" the Weasley family through Gideon and Fabian connections - and then they died. So... Potter's come into it how?
#+end_quote

Partly through the Lovegoods, partly through a plot point I'm unwilling to share right now. I imagine Luna's mother and Lily are friends, and the Lovegoods' proximity to the Weasleys would surely mean the Potters will meet them at some point.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I have to be honest, it didn't really occur to me for Snape to be primary guardian. Societal influence, I guess, making me think a mother would almost always get primary guardianship. The one scene I've half written that's set during the time of divorce shows Snape afraid Lily might take the child from him, and he submits to James step-fathering the child because Snape's afraid that fighting for more than he's given might lose him his son completely. Perhaps I should consider the alternative...

I can't imagine Lily not fighting for fairly split joint custody though, and I wouldn't have thought adultery is enough of a reason to set such strick visitation. She's a fit person with the means to raise a child, and she could argue that Snape's an unfit parent because he's not been around and has spent a great deal of time pretending to work for Voldemort. Surely any competant court wouldn't be swayed by Snape's new celebrity status? A lawyer might even argue that Snape being able to murder the Dark Lord means he's unfit to parent: "He may have saved the country from a tyrant, but he still used the darkest of magics. Should a man so capable of such dark arts really be the guardian to a young child?"

Like I said, this fic makes me think about a lot of things, and you've given me plenty to consider as well, so thank you.

:/ When Voldemort got destroyed in canon, the law was still "he who has most sway - wins" so I guess having an adult instead of a kid in the position of "Man-Who-Won" would allow an angle where that fame is used.

I don't mean to make Lily seem like a bitch (much...) but she was a fool by her actions and the bad thing isn't really the adultery, it's the unfaithfulness to Severus that galls me.

This stigma pisses me off; perhaps you can have Voldemort killed by intelligent design rather than some epic duel with dark magic?

Otherwise you can play the trump card; "I just killed a fucking dark lord, and saved hundreds of lives as a spy for our side"... which plays into the idea that he was always on "our side" to the courts.

In Harry Potter, I've observed that having a smooth tongue and money/fame is far superior to any truths; not even Dumbledore could stop Lucius Malfoy going free.
