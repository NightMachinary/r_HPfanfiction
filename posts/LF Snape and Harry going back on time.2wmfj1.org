Hi! I'm looking for a specific fic, the title of which I've forgotten, in which both Harry and Snape go back in time to before Lily and James got married. The main thing I remember is that Snape ends up going to King's Cross first and meets Dumbledore who gives him a second chance. Then Harry takes the same deal. The weird thing was that even though Snape and Lily end up together for some reason Harry continues to exist.

  Severus was granted his greatest wish: a second chance to start over again with Lily. What he hadn't expected was Harry had had the same thought in mind. Could they ever learn to be civil around each other in their quest to protect her from Voldemort?
