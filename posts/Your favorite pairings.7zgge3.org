** Harry/Hermione and Charlie/Hermione.

I saw the first three movies before I read the books and found that Harry and Hermione (Dan and Emma) had great chemistry with each other in which I thought their respective characters would end up with each other by the end of the series. Obviously, the books had a different mindset which is fine.

I also like Charlie Weasley paired with Hermione as well. I don't mean when she's 11 (as there's a 7-year gap between the two) but more when she's of age. Unfortunately, there aren't many stories with the two of them but there are a few that are done well.
