This is such a random thought but has anyone ever written a story where someone tries to sort the sorting hat? I'm just imagining a time traveler character from the future who bring the sorting hat back with them and then right before they get sorted (again), they pull the future hat out from their pocket and drop it on the present hat. Seems like it would make an interesting crack one shot.


** the sorting hat deserves it, tbh

** Both hats, being alone since the Founder's Time, suddenly and unexpectedly bond over their shared experiences and refuse to let each other go.

** Now hear me out: Hufflepuff. The hat has their preeminent traits in spades.

Hard working: same job for over 1,000 years with zero pay other than room/board and self satisfaction.

Loyal: seems to genuinely care for Hogwarts and her occupants(in most fics at least).

Fairness: sorts people into what house they need(most of the time) while keeping numbers even enough that one house isn't overwhelmed or lacking members(most of the time).

Tolerance: it spends its existence looking into 11 year old's heads one day a year and spends the rest of that time doing practically nothing(I know I wouldn't tolerate that as my lot in life).

Accepting: see the above about the kids mind reading thing, they can be very twisted or generally despicable, not to mention those that are simply outcasts from society due to no fault of their own; and the Hat still sorts them and does a pretty solid job of it too!

In conclusion, if I were the Sorting Hat; I'd put me in Hufflepuff. Well not me-me, I'm pretty sure I fall somewhere between Gryffindor and Slytherin(I have a lot of the traits of both and it's been years since I've taken the quiz, I got Gryf at the time and as my favorite color's red I don't see a need to know for sure if I swapped over. Besides, it's our choices that define who we are not our similarities to others to paraphrase the white bumblebee.), although out of curiosity I might post a poll on this subject in the future if this sub allows not directly fic related posts(although a one-shot where the population of Hogwarts/Magical Britain follows the ratios of that poll could be interesting...).

** There is a fic where Harry can tell the history of an object by touching it. The sorting hat says something along the lines about how no one has ever tried to sort them before. I don't remember the name of the fic sadly.

*** Wait I think I remember that fic. I think Dumbledore was the one who picked up Harry from Privet Drive and he could sense the history of the elder wand and cloak.
