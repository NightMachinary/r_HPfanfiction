:END:
I can't seem to remember the name of the fanfic, but this is what I do remember.

- Harry was an animagus, I think it was a wolf or something along those lines.
- There was a pairing forgot who, but said person also was an animagus similar to Harry's.
- There was a part where the Hogwarts express was attacked, and Harry went into battle as his animagus form.


** I need to find this fic

Sorry for letting your hopes up
