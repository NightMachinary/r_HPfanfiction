  I never pretended to know what I was doing in my last life. Why should I pretend to know anything about this one? Well, the other option is a horrific and bloody death, so...I better start learning how to be a witch. OC Self-Insert/Draco's Younger Sister. [DEAD]

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

  It was eleven AM on a Saturday and I was sitting at the desk, spreading a disappointing Vegemite substitute across an equally disappointing piece of gluten free toast. The only thing that wasn't innately disappointing was that I'd made a very good cup of tea. It was still steaming in my giant, garish mug and I was counting on it to make this breakfast worth getting up for.Less than an hour later, Lucius Malfoy would be trying to convince me I was his long lost daughter.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

** I really like this one which hasn't been mentioned yet. The author has a blog where they a month ago claimed it's not abandoned, but it hasn't been updated in a year, so take that how you will. The SI is horrified by which family they end up in, which is interesting and a bit unusual.

  The words be careful what you wish for had never rung truer. "Wait... what did she just call my father? Oh, oh god no, anyone but them! Please god no! I'd rather scourgify my own blood then have them for a family! I would take the Malfoys- no, even Voldemort over them! Anyone but...!" SI-OC. Pairings undecided. Not an SI you've read before, according to reviewers.

** in harrypotter fandom only a few good SI;

amazing si but it takes place in buffy the vampire slayer world Blood and chaos; basically a sociopathic/ chaotic evil character wakes up as a vampire 1 day and sets off to become omnipotent. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blood-and-chaos-the-story-of-a-btvs-si-turned-vampire.354777/]]

also really liked this SI for dragon age; where its male mid 30s/40s?(read it awhile ago) former NCO winds up in Ferelden; unlike the other rec this mc is true neutral good [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7887275/1/Middle-of-Nowhere]]

in the harry potter fandom:

2 good ones: linkffn(the evil overlord list) , selfinsert wakes up inside of a young tom riddles head and only tom can hear him; guides tom down the smart path of world conquest borderline crack fic

and magical me: lockhart SI its amazing linkffn(Magical Me)

recently read one that qualifies as "so bad it's entertaining" also the tags are wrong/ not happened in story yet; but its so over the top; the author has harry/hermione graduated drumstang in like 1 month of starting their for first year linkffa(1754)

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.
