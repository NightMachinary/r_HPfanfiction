**** Maybe, but now I've got a terrible story idea stuck in my head where Shotacon!Fleur goes back in time, "rescues" (read: abscondes with) a very young Harry from the Dursleys, and then procedes to raise him with the intention of seducing him when he's old enough.

** Okay so this isn't a Fleur bullying Harry fic, but more of a Fleur trying to find out Harry's secret and the two eventually becoming somewhat friends. Though Fleur here is a rude and coarse manner to her. I am not sure if this is what apparently a lot of people want but I thought it was at least a starting point.

#+begin_quote
  Fleur came to Hogwarts to compete in the Triwizard tournament. Her mind was filled with expectations of glory and honour, instead she finds a messy haired student by the name of Harry, who is different to every other student in the derelict school. A Veela's curiosity is a dangerous beast and Fleur's demands that it is sated.
