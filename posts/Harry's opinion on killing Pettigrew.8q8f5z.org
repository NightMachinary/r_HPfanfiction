I need an opinion for the story I'm writing. Sirius does not kill Peter because Harry says so in 3rd year right? But Harry sees what Peter is capable of in GoF and regrets being merciful. What do you think Harry's mind-set will be like if Sirius (whose name by some chance is cleared) gets the chance to kill Peter, hypothetically?


** Hindsight is 20-20.

Anyway, I think you are treating Harry killing as far more clinically than is merited based on canon. Even after everything that happens, he never leads off with trying to kill (see the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts). And sure, he seems regretful, but put it in context. He regrets that mercy led to his problem, not that he didn't murder Pettigrew.

This may seem like they are the same thing, but they're not. There is an important difference between regretting that you spared someone, and wishing you had finished them yourself.

*** Yes, I thought so too. Even though I should have put it in better words. I think, he'd agree Azkaban as a better choice. But, now it's got me thinking. If it wasn't for the elder wand and the whole thing about allegiances, how did Harry think he was going to finish Voldemort without using the killing curse?

**** Short version: he didn't.

Long version: Harry as a character is almost /entirely/ reactionary. In some regards this is to his benefit. But it means that he has practically no foresight or planning ability within canon (or at least that is displayed). He takes things as they come. Everything about him reflects this.

To be completely fair, thats partly how most teenagers are as well (been there, done that). Its just more egregious since Harry knows the kind of stuff he gets involved in but takes no steps to prepare.

More to the point, what could he have really done anyway? Like it or not, the only one who could conceivably take down Voldemort in /fair/ fight was Dumbledore, and he committed suicide by dungeon bat. Realistically Harry should never have survived, but thats the point isn't it? Voldemort plans things out meticulously, studies and learns, and prepares for the future, and Harry escapes or defeats him personally seven times essentially through a combination of luck, moral strength and quick thinking.

/Its about how evil will always fail to overcome good and innocence/. Unfortunately, the heavy handedness of some of it does sort of also look like its saying that studying and planning are a waste of time because someone more talented or lucky will always be better than you (that was not Rowling's intent, but is something of a byproduct of her characterizations).

Pretty much impossible to avoid really. If evil necessarily fails, it follows that good just need to exist to succeed. The HP books send out a rather bad message, and these characterizations merely made it clearer. Having prepared and competent heroes defeat the bad guy would have obfuscated the importance of innocence and sacrifice.

****** I think Harry surviving at the last duel with Voldemort(if one could call it that) was a cop-out by JK. Sometimes, killing someone as evil as Voldemort can't be classified as soul-changing for the killer. Look at Molly, for example. She killed Bellatrix by her wand and nobody blinks an eye or even considers that she can be evil. Because, she isn't. Killing is necessary when it comes to people like Bellatrix and Voldemort, no matter the cost to one's soul.

To be more specific, I read the books as a kid as they came out. And there was all this put out there about how "the Harry Potter series is encouraging reading and rejuvenating youth literacy, etc."...and this is the subliminal message in the story.

I literally knew twelve-year olds who used this series as proof that things will just work out if your good, and you didn't need to worry about stuff. And its a fantasy book.

Isn't that the predominant trope in fictions nowadays?

The protagonists must always be pure of heart. God forbid if they show political acumen, strategic cunning, and tactical ruthlessness.

Maybe the audience is finally getting fed up? That should explain the success of “Breaking Bad”, “House of Cards”, and “Game of Throne”.

****** I'm going to put on my historian hat here:

Trends like the popularity of fairy tale heroes and the popularity of antiheroes wax in wane in most western literature and culture. In the 1970s, Jaws and Star Wars kicked off a lot of that trend. In the 1990s it shifted back to popular antiheroes. Harry Potter and a number of other series kicked this trend off again in the early to late 2000s, and in the last ten years it has been a slow march toward antiheroes.

Look at this sub: arguably the most popular fics are dark fics about Harry and possibly the most liked romances depict him with a "bad" girl (ex. powerful Hermione, Slytherin girls, etc.). But good Hermione and Ginny used to be much more popular in the fandom over a decade ago.

And in all fairness, its a fantasy book for children. Rowling did NOT want to focus on the reality of the moral gray area, and only in the 7th and /maybe/ 6th book did she really show some semblance of this (ex. Harry crucioing Amycus for terrible reasons).

****** Here's why you can't kill Voldemort through non-magical means: it doesn't effect the soul. The only reason Voldemort is alive is because his soul is anchored to the living plane. Even if you kill his body, his soul would stay here.

I think Hermione says something along those lines earlier when she jokes about how running a sword through Ron wouldn't actually mangle his soul. So maybe at the end, once all the anchors are removed, it's possible - Rowling never makes it clear, if the soul leaving the plane is tied to the Voldmort's physical death or it was the Avada Kedavra that affected the soul.

Last, I agree with [[/u/XeshTrill]] on the extra if's. All of those require a level of knowledge that most seventeen year olds don't have, especially those that haven't really interacted with the outside society with six years. Not to mention, there's the whole magic vs muggle weaponry issue to get into.

******* You can always vacuum the soul later, something that should be a lot easier without the Death Eaters and Voldemort trying to kill you. Or even let it float around, since you can simply kill it later (when he has a body again and you have executed all Death Eaters for war crimes and crimes against humanity).

And while shield charms might stop bullets and yadda yadda, the whole point of a sneak attack is destroying Voldemort's physical body without giving him the chance to react. An AKM fires 600 bullets every minute. Even assuming just one second reaction time for Voldemort, that leaves still at least 10 bullets (any more would probably not be on target with an untrained shooter anyway), each with 2 kJ worth of kinetic energy. AKs are really easy to operate (see child soldiers in Africa), all Harry has to do is load it, know where the safety and trigger can be found and use the best invisibility cloak in existence to take care of Voldemort.

****** I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt here and assume you didn't think about what I said. The seven confrontations with Voldemort are:

1. Harry survives the AK as a baby, Voldemort loses his body.
2. Harry char-broils Quirrel during the showdown in PS.
3. Harry lucks out by magic wand BS and a strange form of necromancy, escapes when outnumbered, outgunned, tired and injured.
4. Voldemort drops the ball in OotP and misses his chance to kill him when Dumbledore arrives.
5. The Battle of the Seven Potters = magic wand BS part II: revenge of the phoenix.
6. Harry commits suicide by sociopath in the Forbidden Forest = Harry's Magic Blood Part II: the Jesus Maneuver.
7. The Elder Wand refuses to kill Harry, and apparently this translates to the killing curse bouncing back for some reason off of the disarming spell (or charm).

CoS doesn't count, because the Horcrux is not Voldemort, its a separate entity, an anchor, not Voldemort part 2. Evidence? Dumbledore says during the Prophecy explanation that Harry has now survived /four/ times from Voldemort (as a baby, during PoS, in the graveyard, and in the Ministry). So Diarymort doesn't count.

Also, Godric's Hollow and Malfoy Manor do not count, since Harry never actually confronted Voldemort (it was stupidly close though).

******* Oh....you have a point. And Pardon me, if i do count CoS as an Encounter. The Horcrux isnt Voldemort, but a "seperate Entity"...yes, BUT he is from Voldemort (ok, considering this, the Locket would also have been an encounter, but it only could defend itself and not actively interact). Although i wonder if Voldemort can listen to the Conversation his younger self has with Harry. So the Horcruxes are a dark magic way to create an evil clone, never saw it that way. I assumed, if Riddle came to life, the "ghostly" Voldemort would vanish or drawn into his new Body.

******** The horcruxes are fragments of Voldemort's self, but they are not him. The diary was not aware of anything that had occurred since its creation, and had to learn about it through Ginny.

Based on Rowling's description that Harry's scar pain is caused by the soul fragment wanting to return to him, the individual horcruxes most likely innately wish to return to the “master soul” i.e. Voldemort. This is likely what would have happened in CoS had the diary succeeded (remember it doesn't know about the prophecy so it would think the basilisk could kill him).

The horcruxes each have defenses based on the nature of the object: locket and ring if you wear them, diary if you write in it, etc. They are more like sentient cursed artifacts, and getting rid of them is a way of delaying the conflict with Voldemort in the story (look up the term McGuffin for a better explanation than from me, I'm just a moron).

***** Yes he's a very reactionary character, but I think thats partially because he doesn't understand/can't predict the consequences further down the line. For example if he knows that his friends will follow him to the MoM at the end of OotP and fight in life or death battles with actual death eaters, I'm sure he would be more serious with DA and their training.

For a Harry that travelled back in time, I can see him much more proactive because he /knows/ whats coming and he really cares about his friends and family.

***** I think Voldemort's gets a little too much credit for his meticulousness. Yes, his plans are sophisticated and successful, but his own arrogance is generally his downfall. His inability to comprehend certain feelings or actions on a base level means he doesn't plan for that eventuality.

He cannot imagine loving someone so much that they would fly in the face of power, glory, and riches. He doesn't understand loving someone so much that they'd still choose to die for another when given the choice not to. He cannot imagine not fearing death, and doesn't understand sacrifice, and while acknowledging the protection from sacrifice, doesn't understand it.

That's why he never believed that Snape would work against him. What's one woman against the power he can offer him? For Lily, surely no other life is more important than your own? When Harry walks to his death, he doesn't realize that killing Harry - who has chosen entirely to let Voldemort kill him - will once again power a protection that he can't penetrate.

I think a better version of the theme would be /true evil does not understand or acknowledge love, and will always fall to the good that does/.

** Lots of variables here.

Does Pettigrew die quickly/cleanly, or does he get a more messy death? A messy or confronting death is more likely to be an issue for Harry - he's not an overly squeamish kid in the books, but even so.

Does Harry know this is happening in advance, or does he find out after Sirius has already done it, so that there's nothing he can do about it even if he decides he wants to? Does Harry - a bit like in PoA - even get to /choose/ whether Pettigrew dies? Being presented with a guy already dead is a bit different to being asked “well Harry, should I kill him?”

*** Besides which, killing Pettigrew by no means guarantees anything, except that Voldemort does not come back in the same manner or necessarily in the same way.

- Bertha Jorkins was still in Albania, and Voldemort could possess or manipulate people as a shade
- Crouch Jr. is still fighting the Imperius Curse, and would still have triggered the Dark Mark
- There is no guarantee of anyone believing the stuff about Pettigrew being the traitor, especially if he is dead. Fudge was focused on not rocking the boat, and this certainly would given his personal assosciation.
- Lupin still would have gone all wolfman that night, because apparently even a life-long werewolf can forget about the full moon (since age 6).
- Snape was still vindictive, he would likely not have sided with Sirius being innocent unless /forced/ too.
- Sirius probably still would have to be on the run, though may more people may be made aware of his innocence.

And the only time he could conceivably finish him off was in the graveyard, which he would have no way of knowing about (he was in dog form nearby, no one but Harry, and possibly Dumbledore through Snape, knows what happens until he comes back to Hogwarts).

And as for the "life debt" to Harry...honestly I think Rowling either couldn't figure out how to work it in reasonably or just did not remember until later. Thats why the whole "moment of doubt" that causes his death happens in the first place. It has no real bearing on the plot, even though Dumbledore hinted at it being far more significant than this.
