** linkffn(11982933)

Somewhat childish humor, but I enjoyed it from beginning to end. Ginny's characterization is excellent.

** See, I'm usually indifferent to H/G, and oneshots, but I love this. Excellent characterisation for both of them, and the story flowed very naturally (which is hard to do). That's really important for a comedy.

  Does anyone have any other recs where Ginny is characterized similarly?
#+end_quote

linkffn(Out of the Fire and Into the Cupboard) is most similar to this story in tone and characterization. It is fully canon compliant as well.

linkffn(The Wendell that wasn't) has a crackier Ginny. Hilarious story.

linkffn(your losses or your arrears by irnan) has some amusing family moments involving Ginny.

linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond) is another. It's longer, though not as well written as the rest.

linkffn(Hallowed Time Twists; Finding Mr Right; On the Twelfth Hour of Christmas by Madam Wolf; Practice by Gryffindormischief) have similar characterizations as well.

  If this were a detective story, Ginny would write it up with the title "The Adventure of the Quidditch Player". Harry says that's a stupidly generic title for a detective story.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore!

  Scorpius wasn't stupid - well his sense of humour could use some improvement according to Ethan and everyone he met - but he definitely wasn't stupid. So how exactly did he end up with so many problems and so little solutions? Between Albus trying to communicate with him telepathically, a maniac on the loose and a bunch of people he pissed off in various ways, he was entirely lost.

  Mixing the Potter kids with the Master of Death, not-so-secret horcruxes, haywire magic, and the dawning Second War could only end in catastrophe. All was well? Harry Potter really shouldn't have tempted fate like that. For the Potters are now stuck in a year where Voldemort is far more than a half-forgotten nightmare. --- Next Generation Time Travel, Canon Ships.
