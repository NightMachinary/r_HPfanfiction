** The first fic in The Arithmancer series has almost no romance, and not at all before the fourth year when they attend the Yule Ball. The focus of the series altogether isn't focused on romance either.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort.

Look, I promised Tom I wouldn't let him be handed in,” she said in a small voice.“Well, if he's going to go around petrifying people, I don't see much reason why people ought to keep their promises to him,” said Hermione crossly. [Hermione gets the diary. Things go differently from there. AU.]

  Just how did a new translation of The Tales of Beedle the Bard by Hermione Granger make it into Muggle bookstores? Minerva McGonagall explains.
