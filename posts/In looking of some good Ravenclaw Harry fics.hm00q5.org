It must be complete or the author is still active, no harems, no ridiculous time-travelling other than the canon one. Preferably no romance as well. Thank you ðŸ˜Š

  When Petunia Dursley refused to take Harry in she forfeited his birthright protection, so Dumbledore took the baby to the safest place he knew: Hogwarts.The applicable staff (mostly just... not Snape) took Harry in on a rotating schedule as he grew from baby to toddler to child. They traded extra credit for babysitting among the older students, and Harry grew up knowing a few dozen different laps that were safe and warm to nap in.This was a Harry who grew up among books, among old transient walls and learned professors. They gave Binns night duty sometimes, and let him talk young Harry to sleep. This was a Harry whose world changed, on principle, daily. The stairs moved. The walls became doors. You had to keep your eyes open--you had to pay attention. So he did.He grew up in a school. Knowledge was power, but knowledge was also joy. This was his sanctuary. There was magic in his world from birth.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

*** That No Place Like Home one was thoroughly good. There's a couple more in that same series that are also enjoyable. Thank you for the rec!

** At risk of being downvoted, I'll mention Methods of Rationality. It's a pretty divisive fic, lots of people either love or hate it, but it's mentioned often enough that I think it's worth reading it if only to make up your own mind. And remember that a skilled author, which Yudkowsky is, /does not always agree with the protagonist/. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres is frequently arrogant, rude, impatient, and condescending except to those few people he considers smart enough to be worth talking to - but the story doesn't applaud him for it, it smacks him down. Repeatedly. The very last chapter has him looking back on the year and shaking his head at what an idiot he's been, particularly coming within a hair's breadth of literally destroying the planet by allowing dangerous magical knowledge to be widely disseminated; sooner or later, /someone/ would surely have misused it.

It's a funny, thought-provoking, and sometimes quite poignant read, in any case; whether you agree or disagree with Harry's point of view, he challenges you to consider your own positions. The alternate/expanded introduction, which I generally recommend, is linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR).

  Fan edit of the first few chapters of LessWrong's Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality to smooth out tone/characterization, and make it more accessible to those not familiar with Harry Potter canon.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.
