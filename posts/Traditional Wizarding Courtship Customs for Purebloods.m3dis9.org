Are there any good fics out there with the main focus is hijinx around old-fashioned wizarding rituals or laws about courtship? I just finished reading "Must Love Quidditch", and I wanted to know if there were anymore ingenous ways HP fans have incorporated this trope into their fics, as I believe it is quite popular both inside and outside the fandom.

Similarly, are there any fics out there that has any of the following characters: Luna, Neville, Ginny or Pansy acting either as a team or individually working as pureblood liasons for the main pairing? Perhaps doing a little mischievous matchmaking?

It doesn't have to be Rated M or slash or specifically Drarry, but I would prefer those ones and will appeciate any replies all the same.

Many thanks!


** All fics I've seen have pretty similar to modern-day Muggle courtship methods. I think at some point Ron even had a pick up artist's book "Twelve Ways to Charm Witches" or something like that.

But now I'd like to read a fic where the boy has to give the girl's parents a flock of dragons in exchange for her hand.

*** Imagine all the wonders magic brings, and how kooky and bizarre things can get during these courtship rituals, and doing all these valiant tasks for a chance to woo someone. Makes for funniest scenarios, imo.

*** That is canon. Ron gave a copy of the book to Harry.

*** Similar to modern day or stilted manners stuff. You're right that it would be fun to see things like transfiguring an object into an impossible shape (klein bottle?) or, I don't know, instead of a "What are your intentions for my daughter?" conversation there's brewing a Potion of Emotions for her parents to judge.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7866067][Dumbledore's Folly]] Snape courting Harry with wizarding rituals. There's a bunch of fics like that since like you said it's a common trope.

*** For some reason, when i first clicked on this link I got led to a different fic, a Drarry one, a oneshot with time travel and steamy pwp. Ao3 required me to login but doesn't appear in my history üò¢üò¢üò£üò£üò≠üò≠

I'm getting started in reading the Dumbledore's Folly now, but I was confused for a while and wanted to thank you for the Drarry smut, in any case. ‚ù§

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24921664/chapters/60310999][*The Courting by the Pureblood Who Only Has Five Milligrams of Romantic Intelligence and Thinks He's Real Smooth*]] *by Cibee:* Draco could grab Potter and shove him into a stall before proceeding to suck his soul out of his dick, but secretly, deep down, in the part of Draco that he will never admit to anyone, he is (everyone pauses to shudder) a /romantic/. Potter is not someone Draco wants a one-off with. Potter is --- Draco's beloved! So Draco decides to boldly go where no one has gone before: to put himself through scrutiny; their friends' teasing and pranks; unsound romantic advice from a house-elf; wearing pretty clothes; all to try and win Potter's heart through courtship. (An unnamed ginger bastard can be heard yelling from afar: ‚ÄúThis is actually a detailed guide on how /not/ to court someone!‚Äù) But who cares about the opinions of redheads? Literally no one.

*** Oh dear, I LOVED ITTTTT!!!! It was a quick read, but so, so terribly cute and fluffy with all the confusion...and the blanket! I wonder if it's derived from something else in history, since lovequilts seem to be a thing. I must put more research into it. Thank you so very much for that reccommendation! It was so enjoyable. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

** The author Ellory writes a lot of Pride and Prejudice-y style stuff that has that traditional courtship trope. There are a lot of gender swaps and it's all non-slash though.

**** Sans the slash, Ellory/Ell Roche is exactly what you want, yes.

Some of my favourites are

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21826459]])

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12007296]])

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12007029]]) .

But there's something for everyone's taste with just about any pairing you can think of.

I also wrote one myself: linkao3(In Midst Of It All) .

If you want a novel-sized story, see if you can find a copy of "Of Power and Prestige", by Ell Roche and ExcentrykeMuse.

  He needed her now. More than ever, he needed her now, but not in the way she desired; needed not her undying love, but her eternal scorn and her complete and total rejection, and that was so very hard to give. No prize worth anything was won without sacrifice. But facing the hardest trial, Astoria falters.
