:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
From what I can remember, Harry, Ron and hermione somehow get Voldemort to drink a love potion, and Voldemort falls in love and gives up the war for Harry. I think Ron and hermione go with Harry when Harry goes to Voldemort willingly. If I remember it was a one shot, at most a two shot. It was fairly short and to the point. That's all I can remember about it, and it's driving me nuts. Anyone know this fic?


** I don't know that one, but I do have one that has similar tags? I think?
