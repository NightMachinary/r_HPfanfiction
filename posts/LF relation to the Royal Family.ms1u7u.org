Since Prince Philips passing I have been wanting to read fanfictions with Harry Potter characters that are in the royal family. Whether it be Harry or Hermione or whatever. Complete works please thanks


** I have always wanted to read a fic that is a 'what if Prince William was a wizard' ridiculous I know but hear me out. Prince William was born in 1982 meaning he would have been a firstie in PoA. Imagine the hilarity of Prince William reporting to his grandma about all the horrible soul sucking creatures around Hogwarts, the inadequate teaching in Potions and History, the bigotry, etc. etc. And then next year things like "Dear Grandma, they just forced an 14 yo to compete in a tournament for adults."

  This is in response to a plot bunnie on how to give Vernon Dursley a heart attack. Rating to be on safe side. This story is a one shot and complete.

  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.

** linkffn(6652537)

Sort of fits. Harry becomes a royal ward, but the royal family are all very minor characters.

  The Tower of London has a dark and bloody past both in the muggle and wizarding worlds. Besides being a prison, it also served as a sanctuary in times past, what if it became one yet again? -AU

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
