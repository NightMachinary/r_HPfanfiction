Feel free to send some good stories my way featuring Hermione as a Ravenclaw, Slytherin, Hufflepuff or something else..


** Slytherin Hermione:

Muggleborns are sent to live with purebloods, Harry is a girl, Sirius black has a creepy necromancer daughter, and the horcruxes are alive and operating as different people (so far the minister and the defense Professor). Linkao3(certain dark things)

Hermione summons demons when she's a child because she wants friends. My favorite scene is when she offers to do a blood tracking spell for Neville to find his toad on the train and everyone loses their shit. Linkao3(Hermione Granger, demonologist)

I'm only a couple of chapters into mudsnake, but I like it so far. Linkao3(mudsnake)

  They sought her out for conversation sometimes, cornering her in the garden or at the park, not that they ever had much to say. Really, Harriet thought snakes were rather dull.---------Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with grass snakes, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing to happen to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. Harriet attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she makes new friends, encounters a prickly Potions Master, learns about the Boy Who Lived, and meets the enigmatic Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor, Professor Tom Slytherin.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch.

  "Whatever you decide to say, make it believable." Hermione Granger learned to avoid the hard questions years ago. To her, Hogwarts is a relief: a new school with new people who have no knowledge of her past...only, they keep asking the hard questions. And it's getting harder for Hermione to maintain the lies. Featuring: Mentor!Snape and Slytherin!Hermione

Their mortal lives end abruptly in tragedy, and leave scars that run deep.Liam de Lioncourt starts over again, resistant to becoming attached to anything that can end like his old friends.Damien LaVey starts over again, trying to get Liam to talk to him so he can appreciate him like how he forgot to appreciate their long dead mortal friends. Oz starts over again, trying to get themself to a point where they can socialize without having an anxiety attack and get the attention of the red playboy just up the hill.Elise of Salt starts over again, knowing that family is who you choose and trying to get people to choose to be part of hers. Virgil de Lioncourt starts over again, trying to reconnect with the brother his family foolishly left behind.They don't know it yet, but all these different desires? They're all the same.
