Andromeda Black is married to Stephen Davies, but the family does not know that this is a big lie to hide the relationship between Andromeda and Ted Tonks. The Blacks believe that Nymphadora is Stephen's daughter, but one day, tired of hiding, Andromeda reveals who Nymphadora's real father is. Before being an outcast from the Black family, Andromeda taught her nephew, Draco, what was right. Narcissa and Lucius spend a lot of time off work so he believes in Andromeda. Draco (without blood-purist thoughts) befriends Harry, Ron and Hermione. He's not the closest friend, but they get along with each other. Draco has a bad argument with Lucius and Narcissa and is sent to his aunt's house. Now he lives there, with Andromeda and Tonks

Harry always knew he was the boy-who-lived, but his life changes when the real chosen one is revealed ... Neville!

In the Triwizard Tournament, each school has 4 champions, one for each home. The champions at Hogwarts are Cedric Diggory, Hufflepuff, Angelina Johnsson from Gryffindor, Cassius Warrington from Slytherin and Cho Chang from Ravenclaw, plus an extra, Harry Potter


** Are there actually some reverse-WBWL stories, where everybody thinks it is Harry, but it is actually somebody else (most likely Neville)?

After years of struggling being in the centre of the magical war, he is suddenly unimportant person on the edge attention, dealing only with Qudditch, homework and girls. And surprisingly, Ginny still sticks to him, not because he is BWL, but she finds out he is genuinenly a great guy.

** I don't think we know for a fact that all schools follow a four house structure; I don't read Pottermore, but I got the impression that it was just Hogwarts and Ilvermorny for sure. The concept of a champion from each house is used in A Very Potter Musical though!

**** Facts. I'd be wary to approach something where I had to give significant attention to 13 characters, but I'm all for beefing up the Triwizard Tournament.

***** The four champions don´t receive a lot of attention, Cedric only gets in the end because he dies. Fleur is barely talked about and Viktor is Hermione´s love interest

*** Illvermony, the “American Hogwarts”, has four houses. I'm pretty sure that's the only one.
