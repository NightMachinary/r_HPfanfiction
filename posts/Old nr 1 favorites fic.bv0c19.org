Just sorted the HP fanfiction oage by favorites for the first time in ages. And boy, did it change... The fic that used to have the most favorites is nowhere to be found! It was a Harry time travel fic, with a Ginny pairing I think?

I never really enjoyed it but now it bothers me that I can't find it!


** Nightmares of Future Past was recently yanked off the site by the admins for unclear reasons. The author is appealing the action.
