I only remember this one scene vaguely, but it's really starting to bother me: Harry rescues the "real" Bellatrix Black from prison/stasis or something like this. Bellatrix Lestrange isn't/wasn't actually her, but an impostor and the actual Bellatrix is still young-ish (16...17?). I think maybe the same happened to Narcissa? Possibly this takes place in a secret room in Grimmaul Place, but I'm not sure about that.

This might have been from a smut fic, but I'm mostly guessing here. Can't really remember much of anything else.


** I think it is on ff.net wit the title:

"A[I don't know the complete first name, just that it begins with 'A'] Black

Bellatrix is replaced with a dark construct and placed under stasis with Black family Magic. Harry is a female (Genderbender/Trans? I don't know) and Head/Princess of the Black Family.
