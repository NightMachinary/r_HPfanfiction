The fic would be about the ramifications of this occuring. There were many times in the series where he could have died but luckily didn't. What if it actually happened?

Preferably no romance.


** I didn't finish it because it wasn't my thing, but The Little Veela That Could is about Harry dying during the second task and follows Gabriella.

** Not to my knowledge, but it would be interesting to see another character step up his game and arise from his canon assigned role of a dumbed down plot device.

Harry biting the dust in an alternate dimension is quite common, for example in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052), Voldemort killed +all three Potters+ Harry and Sirius on that night. He looked unstoppable until “the Fucker” turned up and totally derailed his campaign.

** Well in Fixing Past Mistake you can see part of what would happen if Harry had died before Hogwarts. It's not really as your request but... I'll put it here anyway and make of it what you want : linkffn(10101403)

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE
