As far as I can recall it was a one shot, in which Harry understood Snapes meaning, or somehow figured it out and stayed after class to talk to him. It showed a few snippets from there life and ended with Harry laying flowers on his grave.

  What is the true meaning of what happened when 11 year old Harry is asked: "What would I get if I added asphodel to an infusion of Wormwood?" This is a one shot. Enjoy. Canon for the most part, character death at the end.
