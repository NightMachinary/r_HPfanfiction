So, a good example would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2618118/2/Harry-Potter-Keeper-of-the-Dark-Heart][Harry Potter Keeper of the Dark Heart]].

I basically want something where Harry gets an OP magical item, and whoever the antagonist is has something to counter it, an equally powerful magical item.

Bonus points if Harry has to train with said item before getting all its power.

Over 70k+ words please!
