Been reading forever but I'm super new at writing fanfiction, looking for active hpff writer communities who are into sharing plots or WIP and exchanging advice, brainstorming, criticism, etc. I've seen a couple such posts on here, but it seems like overall this is more a recommendations sub than for writing? What's out there?

So far all I've heard of is DLP, which sounds like a pretty mean environment? Just second-hand, maybe I'm wrong.

Also since I'm writing out a post, would anyone'd be into helping me brainstorm how to continue the beginning of this story linkffn(12017595)? It's about a Harry who got ignored by the Dursleys hard enough that, using accidental magic, he managed to make himself unnoticeable and forgotten while he continues to live in the cupboard, steal what he needs, and haunt the house. I want to continue the story but am kind of stuck where to go, I don't want to push Stations Of The Canon at the expense of plot sense.


** Check out the IRC, its in the sidebar. People are always up for workshopping ideas.

** I actually like DLP, but you do have to have a bit of a thick skin. Most of them aren't mean, they are just honest, and they don't pull punches. But the advice they give is sound, and the criticism productive. Of course, it also depends on what you're writing. There are some tropes that are universally despised on that board lol.

I belong to a few other HP forums, but none of them are worthwhile for writing advice... Unfortunately. I hope someone else has some insight, because I've been looking as well. :-)

** The idea is enticing, the execution is not. DLP for all its faults will definitely help with the execution aspect. Post in Work by Author and you will get some constructive feedback.

This is the stage of a story/ficlet that is the most difficult - you could have Harry become a ghost of sorts and flesh this out only so much as to tell that story or Harry could decide to use his invisibility to do... or Harry could lose his ability to be invisible at will and...

The difficulty with fleshing out a story like this into a longer fic is believable interaction as Harry is nearly a magical creature/raised by wolves sort of character. Having him write or talk or make friends is a real stretch.

However if you keep it concise then the story needs to stand on its own which it cannot do as a series of headings followed by exposition with a nice few paragraphs to lead it.

You might consider what you want to write, outline it, edit your outline so that the plot points are sensible and then, using what you have and what you write, create a cohesive short story and flesh that out. This kind of idea is great for a shorter work, almost a parable. With that in mind, find what you want the moral to be and leave things more open ended. Let the audience draw the conclusions.

This could be a nice one shot story if you will decide what your parable/fable will be and fit the story to it and then edit, edit, edit. I look forward to reading it.

  Living in the cupboard under the stairs- yes, there was a door, but the Dursleys had somehow forgotten it- was a small child named Harry Potter, who from the age of one was told each morning through the door to stay in his cupboard and pretend he didn't exist. First the boy became unnoticed, then unseen, and finally, the Dursleys forgot they had ever taken in a child entirely.

*** Just read it. I really like the concept. Several grammatical errors, some sentence structure issues... The first part from the Dursley's PoV is good, but the other sections seem like a lot of explanation and background information rather than part of the story, if that makes sense? Can't tell if that was intentional or not. I'd like to see where you go with it.
