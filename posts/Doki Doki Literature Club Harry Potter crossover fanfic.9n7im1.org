basically any Doki Doki Literature Club Harry Potter crossover that's decent (not absolutely cringe worthy)


** well that's certainly an interesting cross, a quick look on ffn shows only two, can't be sure of the quality though.

*** idk maybe all four girls are stuck in Harry's body with either Sayori or Harry himself as the main personality and one day Sayori depression takes over and shit hits the fan. Then like in the game it only gets more interesting after Sayori's death. Monika tries to take over and Harry in essence starts glitching. This in turn tosses the world into maddness and Voldemort has to deal with Monika, Yuri, and Natsuki.
