I don't remember seeing Harry ever needling them in subtle ways to get their blood up. The closest I can think of, weirdly enough, is his canon sass. Usually in fanfic it's just pranks and/or insulting their hair (be it slimy or lu(s)cious).


** Well Idk about subtle ways, but The Lie I've Lived has that good ol' quote, "Malfoy, fuck you, your mother, your father and your entire bloodline". Also Apprentice Potter by draco664 has a good collection of insults vs various people, but especially Snape. Harry mostly uses the insults to unbalance his adversaries.

*** Yeah I'm used to seeing the brash approach, was curious if anyone had a different take, especially with the number of Slytherin Harry's prowling about.

** I have noticed that approach in Snape mentor or centric fics where he isn't super out of character. There is usually a period where they drive each other crazy through subtle sarcastic insults and comebacks. Not sure if that's something you are interested in though since they do generally end up getting along somewhat at some point.

*** I'm not /against/ them per se, I just don't go looking for them usually. Do you have any recs?
