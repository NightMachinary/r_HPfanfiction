So main thing I'm trying to figure out here is how everyone sees rituals in the Harry Potter world working. What use would they have? Why would a ritual be potentially better than a spell? What are rituals strengths? What are their weakness? If you know any fics that go into rituals those would be welcome as well.


** Well, the most obvious ritual-like thing we see in the Harry Potter series would be the creation of Voldemort's new body in GoF ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4ll6mz/alchemy_is_apparently_an_optional_class_thats/d3om8o0][though I believe that to be more of an alchemical process than anything]]).

Instead, I would look at other, less obvious things for the rituals. To do so, let's first look at what a ritual is. [[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ritual][Merriam-Webster has multiple definitions for ritual]], and the most useful/applicable one is:

#+begin_quote
  an act or series of acts regularly repeated in a set precise manner.
#+end_quote

As you've probably noticed, it's not a super useful definition for our purposes. So I'm going to propose a definition for the purposes of my comment. A ritual is a non-spell action, series of actions, and/or set of words that has magical weight. And I know some of you are thinking "But yargle, how can that work?" My response is to go back to Deathly Hallows, and read the bit where Ron saves Harry and gets the Sword of Gryffindor. Harry states that he learnt from Dumbledore that some acts have magical strenght/implications/I-forget-the-actual-quote-off-the-top-of-my-head.

The Sorting of the Students is the first ritual that the reader sees in the series. This ritual begins not with the placement of the Hat upon a head, or the song, but after the students get off the Hogwarts Express. The first step is the First Years crossing the lake in the boats, followed by being led into the castle by the Deputy Headmaster/mistress. The Singing of the Hat, and then the Sorting of the Student into their House, which forever impacts their life.

Then there is the Gaining of Gryffindor's Sword. Only a true Gryffindor can draw the Sword (as stated by Dumbledore near the end of CoS), and this is determined by the Act of Bravery. Compared to the Sorting of the Students, this ritual is much more fluid. The Sorting of the Students is a yearly event, which reinforces both the magic of it and (I assume) the manner in which it proceeds. This doesn't work for the Gaining of Gryffindor's Sword. True Acts of Bravery vary by the individual. For Harry, it was facing the basilisk alone, wandless, and seemingly only supported by a bird and a magic hat. Certain death. For Ron, it was diving into a frozen pond in winter to save a friend he had abandoned (for far longer than he wished). Neville's was defying the most dangerous wizard in all of Britain (if not the world) when all hope seemed lost. The Act of Bravery distinguishes the true Gryffindor, who then receives Gryffindor's Sword.

There is Voldemort's rebirth, and that was such a damn major, important moment that I'm not going to discuss it, other than to say that I personally believe it to be a more alchemical process, and if you wish to know my thoughts on that you can check out [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4ll6mz/alchemy_is_apparently_an_optional_class_thats/d3om8o0][this comment]].

Probably the most important to the series is what I'm going to call the Love Sacrifice. This happens twice. First is Lily's sacrifice to save Harry. The second is when Harry walked to his death, which gave magical protection to his friend's and allies (see end of Deathly Hallows). From what I can tell, a willing sacrifice made out of love for the purpose of protecting others somehow makes it so the Enemy cannot harm the protectee, unless the Enemy does something to bypass the protection (GoF). I'm not quite sure what the requirements are for the sacrifice beyond what I've given.

If we ignore the previously posited definition of ritual, spells could be considered ritualistic. The wizard to fuel the spell, the wand to bridge the spell between the wizard and the target/object, the incantation to give the spell form, the wand motion to make it real.

*tl;dr* Rituals are both more and less important than we would think. A ritual is what set off the damn plot, but is also used for the simple purpose of organizing students. They are rigid and flexible, mystic and mundane, anomalous and prevalent.

One thing I don't see get brought up is in both instances of this self-sacrificial protection, there is an underlying implication of an agreement that Voldemort would stop.

In Lily's sacrifice, due to Snape, Voldemort demands Lily step aside to spare her life while at the same time Lily is demanding that Voldemort take her life instead. The implication here is that her sacrifice was unneeded and Voldemort accepted her payment to spare her son.

In Harry's sacrifice, Voldemort gave Harry the opportunity to freely give himself up, so that the fighting would stop and no one else would have to die. Harry accepted, and through the power of his sacrifice Voldemort couldn't touch the students.

In conclusion, just as shown as the general theme in the books, there is great power and consequence in the choices we make.

** A ritual usually gets you advantages that are more permanent. I think it's a bit like how you anchor magic with runes, you just use the necessary sacrifices needed depending on the effect you want to create and anchor it with(in) your blood. Like Voldemort uses rituals in many fics to i.e. give himself immunity to most poisons and the like. I think something like a magic strengthening ritual would be...interesting but kinda hard to pull off. Usually sacrificing is explained like alchemy. You always need to sacrifice something in equal value to that which you want to obtain.

** I imagine rituals work far less consistently than spells, but they can't go as horribly wrong as spells. And when they do work, it's astounding what they can do.

I'm going off AQATSA for this, basically. Because it's my canon.

  Harry was left at an orphanage after his parents met their demise. There, he finds nothing but suffering until he rejoins the Wizarding World. Dumbledore may hope for Harry to be a kind soul, but he's made mistakes. And what he gets is a future Death Eater. Harry is Dark, Harry is ruthless, and he is siding with Voldemort.

** I see it as being 3 distinct types of magic. Wand magic uses an individual's own energy to create a temporary effect. Runic magic binds an effect in place either permanently or until the runes are destroyed. Ritual magic requires a sacrifice to create effects more powerful than one can create with wand magic.

*** There's mention, in canon, of wizards Transfigured (a wand-based process) into animals being permanently stuck in that form. The Fidelius Charm (though that may be a misnomer) appears to last forever, as does the Undetectable Extension Charm (Charms are wand-cast spells). A lot of jinxes and hexes, however, do wear off over time (Stunning Hex, Jelly-Legs Jinx etc). What are your thoughts on this?
