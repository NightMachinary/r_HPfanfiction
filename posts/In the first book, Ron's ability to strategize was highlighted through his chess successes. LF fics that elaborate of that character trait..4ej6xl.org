I don't really like Ron as a character in canon, because I always wanted him to be something... /more/. In the first book I loved how he strategized and hoped that he would continue being the "Planner" throughout the books. Of course, we all know that wasn't what happened.

So, do you wonderful people know of some fics where he steps up his game and plans things out for his allies? Or, I guess, where he has a significant role in the intelligence side of things?

I don't really like Harry/Hermione, Harry/Ginny, femslash, or harem fics. Those are my only restrictions though.


** I never understood why people equate chess playing ability with a strategical mind. You're not a cunning tactical genius if you're good at chess. You're just... good at a game; nothing more, nothing less.

I'm actually happy Ron turned out to be a normal guy who just happens to be good at chess, because I see that trope often enough as it is.

*** Chess playing ability does equal a strategic mind, or more accurately the /kind/ of strategic mind you are. It is, after all, a miniaturized battle game. You can't blame tropes for being Truth in Television.

That Ron almost never divorces the strategy from the game doesn't mean it's not there. It shows the way he thinks about the world. (I've always felt he was the least bothered of the trio about Dumbledore's past and plans)

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

Unfortunately it was the authors way of getting Ron out of the story for the ship without killing him or making him evil. IE that was the bus he was put on.
