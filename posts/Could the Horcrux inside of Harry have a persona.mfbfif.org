Just made me think. What would have happened if the Dementors had been some-what successful in getting Harry's soul, or at least the Horcrux out? Could that have been possible? Thoughts?


** I always thought that Harry was such a favorite target of Dementors was because he had a soul and some extra while Voldemort could easily deal with them without casting a Patronus because they were not interested in crumbs. Whether with the kiss would have come Harry's soul and Voldemort's piece of soul is unknown but I like to assume that not necessarily, solely based on Dumbledore's comment "in essence divided". However a greedy Dementor would have not only stopped at a piece of it but would have drained the whole thing.

** This is a good question but when I read 'persona' all I could imagine was Harry cosplaying as Joker and yelling out 'ARSENE!' and freaking Voldemort shows up behind him

*** Legit wonder what each of trio's personas could be based on mythological and historical characters though. I could see Harry's being biblical or a classic heroic character. Hermione I definitely see having a literary character

** I've wondered about the same thing a while ago and I once even stumbled over a fic in which Harry dies in the 5th year dementor attack and all that remains is the horcrux taking over his body. Was a WiP though, don't remember the name
