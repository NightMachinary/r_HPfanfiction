Fanfiction involving a muggle Finding out about the wizard world and slowly learning magic like I would think with ritual magic everyone can do it

He doesn't have magic so he can't use wand magic but he can learn blood magic ritual magic etc


** linkffn(In the Bleak Midwinter)

linkffn(Muggle At Large)

Both not really doing magic but „cheating“ their way through it

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  A muggle scientist stumbles upon the Wizarding World and refuses to let the discovery go. Technology meets magic in a dangerous adventure through the Magical Americas. She just might reinvent what it means to be magical... that is, if she doesn't get caught first.

** I think there's a subreddit turned into a story like that.

[[/r/magicmuggle][r/magicmuggle]]

Fun for a bit, but probably not worth it.

** No like what I really want is where they actually do magic they're not magical but they have one specific magic discipline they can do like runes or rituals etc etc It can even be where he just uses other people invented magical stuff Like expanded trunk or portkeys or brooms he has no active magic but he can use items

*** There's something I read aaaaages ago where Harry was originally living on the streets after running away from the Dursleys and an older girl also living on the streets adopts him as a sort of little brother. Because she's so protective and everything, and is basically his family, she gets to know about the wizarding world when he gets his letter and they let her go to Hogwarts for her own safety where she learns basic potions, Arithmancy and Runes because they don't require a wand. There's a particularly lovely scene where she's got a portkey to the school, and she's just dropped Harry off for the train and wants to pass as a "real witch" so while activating the portkey she spins as if she's apparating.

Is that more the kind of thing?
