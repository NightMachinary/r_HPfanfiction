** If you love 'Master Spy', then you'll love 'When a Lioness Fights' by kayly silverstorm on FF. Anything by her is great, but she hasn't updated in a while. Hmm... 'Chasing the Sun' by Loten. 'Hermione's Portrait' by Pearle. Not all of these are on FF, but you can find them if you look.

** I don't know too many of the kind of stories you ask for, but one of them is definitely Snape's Boon by Amr. I can't find a link to it online, but I have a copy I can send to you if you'd like. It's a really good story.

[[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=1480][In Annulo]] by ladyofthemasque (NC-17). Definitely Severus as the master spy.

#+begin_quote
  It began with a letter, and a secret. Was it madness to trust? Was it a secret salvation? Or was it all just lying on a ring, in the end...?
#+end_quote

Some other stories: [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=2345][His Draught of Delicate Poison]] by Subversa (PG-13). I return to this fic time and time again. One of the few Marriage Law fics I like.

#+begin_quote
  In the wake of the Final Battle, the Order has opened Headquarters to house its youngest members during a summer of Ministry-sponsored social events. With Snape as a chaperone, and engaged to another woman, the advent of a busy Hermione, determined to see her friends in love-matches, can only be a recipe for disaster.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.scribd.com/doc/124084162/The-Lioness-Prophecies-by-AMR][The Lioness Prophecies]] by Amr.

#+begin_quote
  On Valentine's Day of Harry Potter's sixth year, a new prophecy is heard which suggests that Severus Snape's marriage may offer great help in the war against Voldemort. Albus Dumbledore decides to take action to ensure that the prophecy comes about.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewstory.php?sid=12772&i=1][Phantom of Hogwarts]] by Good_Witch. I love Phantom of the Opera, and this story cleverly combines it with HP without making it a crossover.

#+begin_quote
  How in the world does Hogwarts come to be doing a performance of The Phantom of the Opera? And just why is Snape so pissed about it?
#+end_quote

There's also a big reclist of SS/HG fics [[http://harmony-bites.livejournal.com/59308.html][here]], and the SS/HG exchange has a masterlist of all the fics and art that's been written for the exchange [[https://sites.google.com/site/sshgexchange/masterlist][here]].

Happy Reading!

*EDIT:* Oh, I completely forgot about two more. I was recently going through my very old list of SS/HG fics, and I remember two that feature a kidnapped Hermione. I don't remember if I've read these or not, but here they are:

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=5114][A Time to Heal]] by KajisGirl (L).

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger is captured by Death Eaters. Can Severus Snape heal her body and mind?
#+end_quote

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=14458][Augury and Ardor]] by SnapeySnax (L).

#+begin_quote
  Hermione is abducted by Voldemort and his Death Eaters in order to fulfill a prophecy.

** Besides Ashwinder, I recommend joining Livejournal, then friending these communities: grangersnape100, quiz_sshg, sshg_exchange, sshg_newbies and sshg_promptfest. Writers often share SSHG stories in these communities before (or instead of) posting to the moderated sites. In particular, the archive in sshg_exchange ought to yield positive results.

Also check the sidebar under "Useful Links" for a couple more SSHG-centric sites.

  everyone talks about Loten's 'Chasing the Sun', I preferred this story of hers. I enjoy a more humanized Severus sometimes, he can be so deliciously damaged. There are also a number of follow-up pieces.

  As Hermione, Harry, and Ron are about to begin their seventh and final year at Hogwarts, they learn some surprising and dangerous information regarding what it means to be Pure in the wizarding world. HG/SS with H/D. AU after OotP. (This one is LONG... 638k words long. Sometimes it slogs, sometimes you want to slap people, and sometimes it is deliriously deliciously delightful and you forgive everything else.)

  Hermione and an unlikely Pansy form an elite group of witches, and possess one unusual commonality. Facing their most carnal desires, they will harness a power not seen in an age, to save themselves and protect Hogwarts. Can it stay a secret? (Another about virginity, but treated very differently than Probw/Purity. It's also a nice change to have all the Hogwarts girls bonding over something that surpasses their houses.)

  Time turner accidents and more. She's also in the middle of a companion piece called Divide of Time (she was torn about the ending, so there will be 2 options when it's finished).
