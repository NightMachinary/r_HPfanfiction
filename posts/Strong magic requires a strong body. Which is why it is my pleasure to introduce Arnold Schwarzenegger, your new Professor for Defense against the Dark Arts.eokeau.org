** Everyone: He was the best professor we ever had. Its such a shame that the curse will not allow him to continue working.

Arnold: Don't worry students. I'll be back. /Puts on sunglasses and rides a motorcycle out of Hogwarts/

**** Imagine if Skynet was the accumulation of centuries performing magic in a single location and all that ambient magic became Skynet. She tries to kill students in subtle ways in the first years like the moving staircases or manipulating the house elves. Then the Terminator comes to protect Harry.

** (Dumbledore voiceover) Watching Harry with the machine, it was suddenly so clear. The Terminator, would never stop. It would never leave him, and it would never obliviate him, never grow a second head, or forget to take it's potion, or torture him with a bloodquill. It would always be there. And it would die, to protect him. Of all the would-be professors who came and went over the years, this thing, this machine, was the only one who measured up. In an insane world, it was the sanest choice.

--------------

Harry dropped his bag on the library table and made his announcement, "I figured out what's wrong with this year's defense teacher."

Hermione looked skeptical, though Ron motioned for Harry to continue, "Let's hear it, mate."

Harry leaned in, "He's a killer robot."

Ron looked confused while Hermione rolled her eyes, "Honestly, Harry. A robot. Do you have any proof."

Harry was actually a bit lacking in the proof department, but didn't let that deter him. "I know it on my gut. And did you see how he picked Malfoy by the neck let me it was nothing?"

"He must've used a featherlight charm or something." Hermione sniffed and went into lecture mode, "Besides. Robots can't function inside Hogwarts. No technology past the 1900's can function. To much ambient magic. I read that, in Hogwarts, A History."

Harry hesitated to admit she might have a point there. Even radios barely functioned. Sometimes. "Maybe someone found a way around that. Maybe because it's surrounded by living tissue?"

"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard."

"What's a robot?" Ron finally asked.
