i feel like this is often ignored in discussions about why harry named his son after him. his heroics are obviously a large part of why harry is able to forgive him, but people usually only talk about his courage and affection for lily while ignoring what else harry thinks about him. which is funny, since he overtly, consciously draws parallels between himself and snape. his first thought about him after seeing his memories wasn't about lily, it was:

#+begin_quote
  But he was home. Hogwarts was the first and best home he had known. He and Voldemort and Snape, the abandoned boys, had all found home here. ...
#+end_quote

also:

#+begin_quote
  He had just been forced, yet again, to relive a stream of very early memories he had not even realized he still had, most of them concerning humiliations Dudley and his gang had inflicted upon him in primary school.

  He had no desire at all to return to Gryffindor Tower so early, nor to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just seen. What was making Harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars thrown at him --- it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers, knew exactly how Snape had felt as his father had taunted him, and that judging from what he had just seen, his father had been every bit as arrogant as Snape had always told him.

#+begin_quote
  One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like Snape, but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked.
#+end_quote

snape's history of abuse is a not insignificant part about how harry conceptualises and relates to him. he sees parts of himself in snape- abandoned, mistreated and un-cared for, and sees aspects of his tormentors (draco, dudley) in his father- privileged, doted on, bullying etc.

#+begin_quote
  In honouring Snape, Harry hoped in his heart that he too would be forgiven. The deaths at the Battle of Hogwarts would haunt Harry forever.

** I have never agreed with "Albus Serverus Potter" as a name, but it has always made sense to me that Harry (and Ginny) would do it.

** I'd never noticed that!

I'm always surprised when people think Ginny had no input on the names of their children. I can't see fiery Ginny letting Harry steamroll her on their children's names.

** Yeah this totally makes up for destroying two families by giving the prophecy to Voldemort.

*** ? harry's empathy doesn't 'make up for' anything or guarantee his forgiveness- he also sees parts of himself in voldemort, a mass murdering terrorist

like i said, the other part of how harry was able to forgive him is that he actively opposed voldemort and regretted his past affiliations
