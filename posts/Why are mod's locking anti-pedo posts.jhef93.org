Mod's showing bias perhaps? Let people talk about a very important point as to why a lot of people cannot take HPfanfics seriously. There is a rot in our community and people are pointing it out.


** Not a mod so I can't speak for what their actual policy is. But by way of observation only:

1. There have been four threads about the topic in the last day or so. Five, if you include this one. There comes a point where it just becomes spam/bad faith attention seeking rather than an attempt to have a discussion. If people wanted to discuss it they could have just continued posting in the first thread rather than continually posting new threads.

2. The discussion also frequently failed to meet the basic standards of civility.

3. Whether or not those threads were in fact "anti-pedo" goes to the heart of the very matter in dispute.

** Jesus fucking Christ will you people /shut up/? Nobody is defending pedophilia except the people you're making up in your head. Posting a new post every six hours doesn't change that.

** If the mods have a bias, it's strongly on the anti-pedo side. They still haven't done anything about [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jfrn3r/what_is_up_with_weird_age_gaps_in_fan_fiction/g9m335n][the comments that started all the drama, even though they clearly violate rule 3]].

Pedophilia is bad. But it seems like the mods are trying to stop any hint of "maybe a fictional relationship between a teenager and an adult could be okay to read about in some instances." Like when that teenager is actually over the age of consent, as is usually the case with Honks.

(Edited to link to the comments in question instead of the entire post.)

** How disingenuous of you. Why are mods locking threads that rehash something from a thread that was made six hours ago and barely has 20 comments, repeated for 2 days? would be a much better title.

Also, as has been mentioned many many times. SS/ school kids, AWBD/ school kids etc, etc. Is not what most people have an issue with people taking issue with. It is the blanket statement that if there is an age gap, then its pedophilia. It is not. Quite a few people view Honks as pedophilia. It is not.

** Those threads are linked in the top post on [[/r/subredditdrama][r/subredditdrama]] today so that might have something to do with it

** Do you mean mods are locking posts that are against like hermione and snake ships?

*** mod's locked this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jh214c/why_i_will_no_longer_be_posting_in_this_sub/]]

People were actively discussing the fringe group of people who are supporting those fics. Overall was anti pedo stories like that

**** That was probably locked because so many comments were making excuses for pedophilic pairings

** Look, can you and everyone else just...stop, please? I know that you want to know what's up with the mods locking the posts, but really, the mods do not have to explain themselves here. This is not a drama sub, and yet in the past two days I've seen more drama on here than there has been in the past few weeks, if not months. And it's irritating, especially because a lot of the “reasons” for the drama that I'm seeing have been virtually non-existent on this sub. Seriously, I check this sub twice a day (have for over a year now) and I haven't seen hardly anything to warrant these posts.

So please, just give it a rest. Nobody is going to be changing anybody else's minds here. If you see a legit issue, then report it or message the mods if it's dire enough. Otherwise, just leave it and other people be.

** Because people are flooding this sub with drama and even canvass outside of this sub.
