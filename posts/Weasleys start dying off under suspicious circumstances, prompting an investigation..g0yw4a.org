I've been thinking about all the almost-deaths in the family, and how easy it would be for them to tip from 'Ron almost died being clubbed in the head by a chess piece, Ginny almost got her entire lifeforce sucked out in the Chamber, etc' to 'dead Ron, dead Ginny' from 'seemingly' normalish causes (as far as wizards go) but the only connection would be the family.

I started imagining it as a vengeful AU portal character, like from one of those crazy weasley-bashing revenge fics, who's carefully or gleefully orchestrating everything, and the story would be the investigating characters' journey toward that discovery. But it could work any number of other ways as well.


** I would love to see a fic like this from the point of view of someone who's investigating it, but it is all coincidences. But it's all ironic, cause the audience knows that there is no conspiracy, but he actually finds evidence and shit for it. Maybe at the end it could be a surprise that there really is a murderer, but there doesn't have to.

“Ron Weasley. Killed by a chess piece. Does it just happen to be a coincidence that was his favourite game? Ginny Weasley, such a lively, and spirited girl. Had her life force literally sucked out of her. Fred and George Weasley. Dead in joke experiment gone wrong. Percy Weasley. His cauldron bottom wore out and killed him. Charlie Weasley. Now dragon food. Bill Weasley was recently found dead in a pyramid in Egypt. Cause of death, and ancient curse. Now at a glance all these deaths are explainable. But to me, it seems like someone is trying to ironically kill all the Weasleys. My suspect? Hagrid.”

** I am now wondering about a Final Destination version of the Weasleys. They escaped all that, but death keeps lurking...

*** Plot twist, Scabbers was with Ron when the family escaped death. He dies and they think the pattern has been broken, but not so much.
