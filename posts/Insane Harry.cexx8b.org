I may not have been very clear on what I meant by insanity last time I posted this - No matter, it is such a broad term. Here is what I meant by insanity:

*Insanity*. n. mental illness of such a severe nature that a *person* cannot distinguish fantasy from reality, cannot conduct her/his affairs due to psychosis, or is subject to uncontrollable impulsive behavior.

Are there any fanfics in which Harry is like that? Thank you.


** linkffn(Worthy of Magic). Very original plot too.

And I hold my Breath - If you have no problems with slash. Even though there's hardly anything in the story. WIP

Harry is bonkers, as in he's slightly off, since a overpowered obliviate in the Graveyard.

*** Thanks for linking this one! I was looking for it recently and couldn't find it. I liked the unique way Harry interacts with the people around him. Some of them notice his problem quickly and some don't. Some find a way to communicate with him while others struggle.

**** Yes, it's really an unique take on Harry with PTSD , don't you think? I mean Harry is very well adjusted for someone who goes through really traumatic experiences (especially in graveyard), in most fics. I like that this one handles a vulnerable teenager with what-might-haves.

  Harry has been a little off since the graveyard. He sees more than a closed door in his nightly visions, and he's losing his grasp on reality. The memory charm around the student population isn't helping. Who has Voldemort allied with? Riddle, always suspicious, seems to be a symptom of something larger.Between lessons at Hogwarts, where the professors resolutely insist that nothing is wrong, and the strange glances Harry gets in the Great Hall, it's only natural that he makes friends with a Slytherin Tom Riddle, even if he doesn't understand everything about the boy.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.
