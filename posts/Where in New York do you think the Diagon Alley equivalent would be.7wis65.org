I'm working on a story where Harry visits New York and am having a hard time coming up with where NY's wizard shopping area or areas would most likely be located. I am also drawing a blank on what it would be called. Does anyone have any suggestions?


** I could see it in Greenwich Village. There are a lot of little crooked streets there and no one would blink twice at oddly-dressed people. Plus, The Strand bookstore is close by. I can see that place having a secret magic section.

**** My dad and I walked from Washington Square park down by NYU and towards The Strand in September. There was a juried sidewalk art show going on with some really great stuff. My dad stopped to rest for a few minutes and we struck up a conversation with a guy who recommended a local coal-fired pizza place nearby for lunch. It's such a great part of NYC. I think Times Sq is too hustle and bustle for a magical section. Central Park is big enough there could be a municipal Quidditch or Quodpot or whatever field. I think NYC has a ton of potential as a magical center.

** Maybe somewhere near Rockefeller Center, or Times Square for a location.

** As a New Yorker I'd suggest down in Greenwich Village. It's one of the older areas of the city and the streets aren't on a grid system which gives it cover and less ease of being found.

** MACUSA had its HQ in the Woolworth Building, so they were definitely trying to keep up with the latest Muggle developments. It wouldn't surprise me if MACUSA relocated its HQ to the Empire State Building later.

Their version of Diagon Alley would likely be some addition to an existing No-Maj megastore. Macy perhaps?

*** Or Sak's, but frankly "both, depending on what you want to buy" would be the best answer.

Of course the new MACUSA entrance is under 1 World Trade. Obviously.

** Thanks for the location suggestions.

I think I thought of a name. Would Vertic Alley be too weird/cringy? I was thinking that any shopping area in NY would almost have to be in a tall building, so vertical instead of diagonal...?

** Definitely the village, probably off of Bleeker or MacDougal (mainly because MacDougal is fun to say), there are so many shops and bars that are basically underground any one of them could be an entrance. In fact, my head canon is magical NYC is almost completely below ground and they make heavy use of the charm that's on the great hall ceiling at Hogwarts.
