What it says above, want some fics where Hermione (preferably non-gryffindor) is the clear main focus with absolutely no focus on romance whatsoever, please and thank you.

Because seriously, it seems that if you want Hermione as the MC you have to accept an absolute ton of angst and 'romance' (read: relationship drama) usually with Draco/Snape/Tom etc that completely overshadows everything else and read likes a bad teen romance book or 50 shades of grey (complete with hideously inaccurate BDSM and outright abuse)


** linkffn(12592097) This one has romance but not too much. I hated the romance part so I mostly ignored it and that was totally fine. It's also very long. The author has some other Hermione-centric fics, but I don't think she has any without romance at all.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch.

** linkao3(7944847) The universe explodes when Voldemort dies, and Hermione is sent back into another body to fix it. She's in Slytherin and purposefully avoids the main trio. Has a little romance, I suppose, but nothing major.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path.

  Ginny made a thin, distressed sound. “I ... Look, I promised Tom I wouldn't let him be handed in,” she said in a small voice.“Well, if he's going to go around petrifying people, I don't see much reason why people ought to keep their promises to him,” said Hermione crossly. [Hermione gets the diary. Things go differently from there. AU.]
