Just an Idea in my head and here it is as I'm not talented enough to write it.

Obviously AU, It's 1990 and the Countess already managed to kill ,or engineered the death of 5 of the 7 Men that sent Sirius Black, her lover, and father of her son Zabini, to Azkaban. Only Crouch Sr and Albus Dumbledore remain.

Sirius is not even aware of his son because the old Zabini Count pulled his daughter from England back to Italy back in 1979 (before she was even aware of her pregnancy) when the War truly turned ugly, severing all communications with the British Isles.

/The Countess wonders, for Bartemius she should be able to play the card of the competent wife and also use her family connection to entice the man with any possibility to support his possible run for the next election of the Minister of magic, yes that will do./

/As of the Old fool, the true traitor of the Seven, she is well aware that any attempt at seduction would not go well, the man has no interest in women, but perhaps, yes, perhaps she might take that cursed post of DADA professor. Yes, that should be enough to get close to the old Fool and one whole year should be enough to send him to his own grave, and dodge the curse by quitting because of her grief toward the dear Headmaster.../


** Lmao, I'd like to see her try and seduce Albus.

"I truly am flattered, Miss Zabini, but I am afraid I do not swing that way."

** IF I was brave enough to write it myself, I'd like the son Zabini to eventually catch on to his mom's shit. And maybe end up talking to Harry somehow because of the fact EVERYONE KNOWS SIRIUS BLACK IS HARRY'S GODFATHER. There'd be a very weird, uncertain allies sort of rep between the Boy-Who-Lived and his godfather's /technically/ illegitimate mystery son that would honestly be an interesting way to change up the Golden Trio + DA friends dynamic. Blaise wants to hear about his absent-and-unfortunately-imprisoned-for-a-long-time dad, and Harry's feeling very uncertain about a possible connection between arrogant Blaise and Sirius. And it'd also be entertaining? Blaise isn't a bad guy, but it's pretty vain and he does have some anti-muggleborn feels. It'd give people a chance to better develop Blaise and maybe have some really interesting character growth/interaction. Maybe Blaise can be written to be a decent Slytherin and not give into that Slytherins-are-evil trope.

*/Bonus points/* */if all of this starts happening post-Book five when Sirius is dead!/* Like Countess Zambini is now especially fucking upset that her favorite lover, who went through so much horrid shit, is now dead because of Dumbledore's bullshit about not really helping Harry with his issues. And maybe she's a little upset at Harry too, cuz he was kinda an emotional dumbass (but shit, he's a teen and teens do dumb shit). Everything starts to really hit the fan, Blaise the Slytherin actually proves to be a super useful member of the Crewâ„¢ that reluctantly respects Hermione and tries not to engage Ron (because I just can't envision them getting along very well), Harry and Blaise bond in an unexpected way, Voldemort hears about and hates this developing friendship tons, Countess Zambini is actually a super cool DADA professor, and I'm absolutely here for some calculated murking of Dumbledore by Countess Zambini that completely throws Draco's whole assassination plan into the trash. Would that mean the Malfoys would lose value/face in front of the Dark Lord and just all get Killing Curse'd out of the story? Or what?

I'm fucking here for creative ways of subverting canon.

** Countess Margarita Zambini ground her Cigarette into the Freshly churned earth of her 7th husband's grave, the man's granite tombstone was a tasteful stone Monument simply saying Ignatius Rookwood , 1918 -1992. Ignatius had joined his Predecessors in the graveyard on Margarita's estate. In a plot she called the dirty bastards section of the cemetery. She smiled cruelly, A smile only a true black widow could pull off successfully. She could cross another name off her list, One more man dead And in the graveWhere he couldn't do any more damage to her family.

She only had two men Still on her list Barty Crouch and Albus Dumbledore. She Nearly laughed until she heard a twig snap behind her, she twisted Simultaneously drawing her wand in one fluid motion, just as her beloved Sirius has taught her decades before But quickly Abandoned her dueling stance as The intruder came into view, it was the only thing beside vengeance that made her life worth living, her baby Blaise Zambini. Her little boy that was getting older by the day and looking more like his Incarcerated father every hour. The son was a constant reminder of everything good in her life and everything that had been taken from her. Of everything and everyone she would one day get back with that she smiled at her son And his failed attempt at stealth Before apologizing for making him late,it was nearly 10 and she might have made him miss his train,?and all for a sad little funeral. Margarita walked over to her son and took his hand she kissed his cheek and appeared them to the Hogwarts express , The Locomotive responsible for how his parents met and the method by which he would take his first steps towards a bright future and unknowingly aid his mother in her revenge

** How would that tie into Harry though, assuming he loves Harry as much as I think he does, and how Mama Zabini would feel to him. Assuming Countess Zabini knows either how much Sirius was bound to love Harry, or just knowing because of letters (I have no idea how that would work in the time line cause I'm not doing the math). It could be a fun play with the Countess seducing Vernon to get to Harry after finding him, or Blaise getting to Hogwarts and finding Harry before Ron does and how that would play into their Hogwarts experience.

*** Well I got the idea reading linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23702959/chapters/56911591]]) Where Sirius was already dating Mrs.Zabini during his school years at Hogwarts.

Being fulling aware of the Black Widow Zabini trope avenging her first husband, I just created (if I'm allowing myself to think that my idea was original and never made before) a big mix of a multitude of tropes.
