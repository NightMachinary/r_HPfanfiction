I'm looking for the fic where Neville somehow got involved with the wizarding equivalent of the Mafia and he made potions or drugs for them and as time wore on he slipped in deeper and deeper and despite the plot similarities it was not a Breaking Bad crossover.

Can you help me find it?


** Haha that sounds awesome, I hope someone can find it for you so that I can also read it!
