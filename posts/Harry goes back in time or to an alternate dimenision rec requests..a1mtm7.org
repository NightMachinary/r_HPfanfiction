I have recently got into fics where Harry goes back in time and does Hogwarts again with future knowledge such as "oh god not again", "again and again" and "Xerosis". In some of these fics he is still trying to stop Voldemort and just save as many people as possible in others he's helping Voldemort (the last two are slash). I'm not picky what side he's on or what pairing (or even if there is any pairing) I just want adult Harry back in his eleven year old body going through Hogwarts again, preferably humorous fics.

​

I also found a few where Harry ends up in an alternate dimension where his parents are still alive the hell is your son from another dimension series is quite good and I read another one where Harry and some of his friends end up in an alternate universe (Harry and Hermione were engaged and Ron and Hermione had died as children in the universe they were in). So anything with Harry meeting his parents in universes where Harry died and Lily and/or James survived.

So fellow HP fanfic fans any recommendations.
