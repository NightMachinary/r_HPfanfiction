  You don't like the way this country operates? You think its bureaucrats corrupt, its politicians moronic, its people apathetic sheep? Fine! Go make your own!

** I don't think such fic exists, but there are probably fics where Harry takes control of part of the country to counter the Ministry and creates his own government. For example Scotland, he would also then have authority over Hogwarts instead of Ministry which is in London.

Anyway, I'm just speculating, I doubt many people are awere of all the happenings in Yugoslavia to be directly inspired by it. Although, it would be logical for Vernon to complain about it in the 90s.
