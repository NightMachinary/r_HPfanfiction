** Might not be exactly what you're looking for, but The Knight Bus Crew by Rowanmoonlight, found on ao3, I really great! The plot is that, in third year, when Harry goes on the Knight Bus after running away, he gets a job, and learns all about wizarding culture from the passengers of the bus.

** Relief from Nightmares by Ariel Sakura- Harry eventually is in a relationship with Blaise, but it is really interesting because he has an apprenticeship with Madam Pomfrey. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9614855/chapters/21721490]]

This one might not be 100% what you are looking for, but Harry is very knowledgable about potions and works on it with snape as a mentor, but its not an apprenticeship. Perception is Everything by Kendra James. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5926514/5/Perception-is-Everything]]

A fic that I never see anyone recommend is Cafe by PleaseDial123. Be warned it is 28 chapters, but is not finished. It is a fic where harry creates his own cafe in an alley that is right next to Diagon Alley. It is a good story, but I am not a fan of how the author portrayed harry's relationships, some of the relationships that harry gets into raise red flags for me due to age gap, or consent isssues, it has been a while since I read the fic. I just remember reading the fic when I was younger and I really liked the plot and I had never read a story where he owns a cafe , but also was a necromancer.
