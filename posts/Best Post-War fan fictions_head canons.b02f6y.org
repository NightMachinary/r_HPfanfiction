I'm brainstorming my own story about what happens immediately post-war, like the days after the battle of Hogwarts (canon-compliant)/Voldemort's defeat/the trio's conversation depicted in the chapter before the epilogue. I want to see how other authors have handled this point in the character's lives.

I'd also love to hear your headcanons for this time in the story we don't see in the books!

** linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution)

Voldemort is dead but the Wizengamot is still in the hands of the old families. They try to regain some lost power with a new marriage law. The DA decides to do something about it.

Shortly afterward, war breaks out across Europe. The french duke tries to intervene, the bastille is stormed, Grindelwald supporters try to take over magical Prussia, the russian muggleborns don't like being treated as curse fodder and rebel, Viktor Krum is accused of plotting to overthrow the government due to his correspondence with Hermione and reacts by overthrowing the bulgarian government, and there's a flying tank patrolling the english channel.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** I always found that this chapter of this unfinished fanfic was one of the most insightful about postwizarding britain and its relationship with muggles

​

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127805&chapter=5]]

​

Another story (also unfinished) that I found smart in its premise was [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8449852/chapters/19358473]] - which brings in the concept of the ICW coming in for legal purposes
