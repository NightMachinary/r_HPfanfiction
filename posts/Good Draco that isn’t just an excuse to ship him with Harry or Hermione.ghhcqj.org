Any good recommendations for docs about Draco redeeming himself and fighting for for the rebellion? Preferably during the time when the books are set? After is fine too but I'd rather see him actively fighting against Voldemort. Harry/Draco or Harry/Hermione is fine as long as it's not the focus.


** There's eventual Draco redemption in the linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series, but book 1 is half a million words and only has the setup for it as a background thread; not much actually happens with Draco until book two. That said, I highly recommend the series, just be prepared for a long read.

The way it occurs is both believable and disturbing, though. I won't spoil it, but let's just say it's a lot more complicated than Draco simply deciding that Harry's a good guy and muggle-born wizards and witches are the same as everyone else.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  AU,6th yr. Draco has a secret, he's a genius. Bill Weasley is teaching Ancient Runes. 6th year brings debate class, mystery, horcruxes, etc. The story is complete, but I am currently editing and commenting on the chapters. NEW FORMAT as of 1/14 - All newly revised chapters will be at the END of the story, for ease of reading. It makes way more sense this way...
