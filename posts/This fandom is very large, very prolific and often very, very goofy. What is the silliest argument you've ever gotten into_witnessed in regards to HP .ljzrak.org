*** It depends on the way you interpret the canon magic on the electric force level.

If you consider it as just obscure laws of physics that still fit into the common model, then yes --- there's no reason for mechanical devices not to work. In this case, magic can be interpreted as a localised probability change, and the issues with electronics would be caused by it messing with the weak electric forces inside the atoms and causing the electrons to go haywire.

However, this is boring. Magic is supposed to be wild, so my personal preference is it being a complete substitution of reality. You do not interact with the laws of physics by influencing probabilities --- you just completely ignore them and just make something happen. The wands, the incantation and the rituals are just something to guide your intent, and not entirely necessary --- which the canon supports with non-verbal spells and wandless magic.

This also makes magic capable of literally anything, to the point where the only limit is its user's imagination. So if enough of said users decided that "muggle items can not work in places that are strong in magic", then they would not work --- even if there's no reason for them to stop.

Lord of the Rings and Earthsea are soft. Star Wars is somewhere in the middle --- there used to be rules but they are getting broken lately.

And yes, it does come to a personal preference. I completely understand the desire for a ruleset in the story. It's just that in my personal opinion, forcing Harry Potter magic into the hard system is kind of antithetic to its spirit --- there's a reason why it is always shown as a counterpart to the mundane, instead of an invisible part of it.

Yes, and, I'll be honest, the thought never crossed my mind that they drew it because wizards very rarely do things by hand and it /does/ show every detail; the entire castle and the grounds, minus, of course, the Chamber and RoR simply because they didn't find them. Harry gets to Honeydukes in 3rd year following one of the passageways on the map.

But even if they /did/ draw it, the charms against Snape and the password protection, makes that 3 different spells haha.

****** We had in real life so sadly there is no record of it.

The gist of my girlfriends argument was that blood magic in Harry Potter makes no sense, but in her headcannon it would not make a difference as the working of blood magic is tied to the person making the sacrifice and depends very little on the blood itself.

My argument was that as voldemort influences the bloodprotection by taking Harry's blood we have cannon evidence of "replacement blood" working to a certain degree so the true question would be how the method of replacing the blood would influence the magic and who's DNA voldemort has in the end.

From there we spiraled into the genetic chimerism and polyjuice argument because voldemorts body might just consist of different parts with different DNA (bones: Tom Riddle sr., blood: Harry, rest: Wormtail), so what would happen if one tried to use polyjuice to turn into him?

If you polyjuice into a pregnant woman, do you still have the baby?

If yes, can you keep taking the potion for the rest of the pregnancy and then give birth?

If you polyjuice into a woman, can you get pregnant? Would you keep the pregnancy?

It seems like you turn into a copy the same age as the person, is that determined by when the hair is removed, or do you automatically become the age of that person regardless of when they hair is from?

Would you experience any illness that a person has when transforming into them? And if not/if so what are the determining factors? Genetic? Chronic illness due to injury (i.e. back pain)? Disease? Cancer? Broken bones? Psychological disorders?

***** My answer would be they watched the movies first. I try(key word: try) to never argue with someone who prioritizes the movies over the books about ships or personality related stuff because they, in my opinion, are engrossed in a different fandom with some of those things. Ginny Weasley is an obvious example, but Hermione is a great example too. In the books, she is book smart, but bossy, lacking tact, and described to be average looking. In the movies, Hermione has all the best lines, is essentially perfect, and is played by one of the most beautiful people in the world. If you watched the movies first, and still think they rank above the books, of course you'd love Hermione and think she and Harry are perfect together and dislike Ginny! Why wouldn't you, she's perfect! Sorry for ranting, continue with your redditing.

***** Hermione is many people's favorite because she's basically the only female character that Rowling actually made somewhat badass.

Ginny and Luna weren't looked at in details until book 5, Lavender was intended to be a slut, I assume, for shoving her tongue down Ron's throat.

Padma and Parvati was mentioned on one major occasion and that was the Yule Ball, except that they got about 2 paragraphs worth of words.

Cho was meant to be a girl who gets in Hinny's way and therefore hated on.

Pansy and her friends were meant to be portrayed as bullying bitches, and I honestly can't remember anyone else off the top of my head.

So based on what I just listed, it kinda makes sense that Hermione is the favorite. She's the only character who was actually portrayed as a strong girl *all* the time.

That's most of the female characters who are at the very least notable enough to be worth mentioning, minus those you didn't mention or who are supposed to be unlikeable (Pansy, Rita Skeeter, Umbridge, etc). How many of them do you hate? All of them?

Yeah, not every character has a ton of character development (I mean, it's from Harry's perspective, and also it's not just okay but necessary for most stories to have side characters, and also you are on a fanfiction sub so it's an odd place to hate characters without much development).

Ginny is not much more than the token badass girl who likes Quidditch and ends up with the hero when she wasn't even that close to him prior to this.

Hermione is, as Snape said, an "unsufferable know-it-all", and she's like way to fucking much in the fandom.

Luna is a loony girl who makes no sense, and people seems to like her for no reasons at all when her only moments in the spotlight are her saying stupid invented shit.

Lily Potter appears for like two flashbacks, and she's dead anyway.

Tonks does not have much more characterisation than "oopsie I fell again" and "I'm an auror".

McGonagall is a neglectfull teacher.

Molly Weasley is an overbearing mom who listen to her sons telling her Harry was in a cage and she's just like "shut up you fucking liars I know best go to your room".

Fleur's only moments are the second task when she admits she was wrong about Harry and her speach at the end of Book 6 about staying with Bill no matter his looks.She's otherwise a wasted character.

Sprout does plants and lets the students she's the head of bully someone because "he took my kid's position as a champion". She's petty and vindicative, and never say sorry for this.

Parvati is Romione's token obstacle.

Susan Bones does not exists.

Hannah Abbott does not exists.

Katie Bell only exists when Harry remember Quidditch is a thing.

Angelica only exists when Harry remember Quidditch is a thing.

Padma's only moment was the ten lines she had for the Yule Ball.

Alicia Spinnett does not exist.

Amelia Bones does not exist.

Penelope Clearwater does not exists, aside from being Percy's ex girlfriend. Current wife, maybe? Dunno.

Augusta Longbottom is an horrible grandmother who only wants her grandson to be a carbon copy of her son.

Madame Maxine... Okay, I don't have much for her.

Madame Pince is a bitch.

Madame Pomfrey couldn't see that Harry was abused. But at this point, nobody seemed to be able to do so.

Andromeda Tonks has like one chapter. In the 7 books.

​

But yeah, your views are interesting. "You're not agreeing with me, therefore you, bad sir, are a prick and your arguments are invalid. I now shall declare you the M word, your opinion does not matter anymore, and you shall die forgotten and ignored by all."

Also, please learn how to read. And I mean, *really* read. When, exactly, did I say I hate all women in HP? I was just saying your opinion was dumb, because disliking characters does not make you something-phobic. As a matter of fact, I like Ginny. I like Luna. I like Tonks, I like Ms. Weasley, I like Fleur, Katie Bell, hell I even like Pomfrey and older Tonks. But it's easy to see why someone would not like them.

Also, "you answered to me to say you don't agree, which mean I was right about what I was saying because you were */triggered/*!!!" is not a valid argument. If I was indeed triggered, I would have just said something harsh.

****** It's hard to dislike a lot of those characters because they're so minor.

Lily literally died years before the books are set.

Sprout has maybe ten lines? Parvati again has about ten lines. Padma might have more just because of the ball. Susan Bones is literally mentioned like twice? Same for Hannah Abbot. Katie, Angelica, and Alicia all boil down to 'Quidditch girl'. I know literally nothing about them otherwise. Penelope Clearwater, Augusta Longbottom, Prince, and Andromeda again are all barely there. They have very little characterization. Hating them is probably misogynistic just because there's /so little to their character/ aside from their gender. Why the hell else would you hate them? Unless you dislike them specifically because of how under developed they are.

I don't think disliking all the female main characters makes you a misogynist, though. Personally I don't particularly like Hermione, Ginny, or Lavender. I'm kind ambivalent to the rest except Tonks and McGonagall.

I've also lurked during fraught arguments on whether Muggles could overpower wizardkind.

My general perception is this: they'll just cast a Muggle-repellent spell and if you even think of raising your gun against a wizard you'll get the sudden urge to brush your teeth or make yourself scarce.

***** Which ignores the fact that both sides are completely ignorant of each other's respective capabilities. A wizard may recognise a muggle with a gun as a threat and counter accordingly, but he will have a much tougher time countering stuff like artillery, cluster munitions and combat aircraft.

Similarly, a muggle may recognise that a wizard with a wand is dangerous, but not exactly how dangerous, thus underestimating the threat of one dude with a stick in their first encounter. This is corrected by the time of the second encounter.

In a conflict between the two, the wizards will simply cut and run, which is what they always do. Muggles will escalate to the point where they kill more people than the wizards would have, but they'll keep doing it until they're sure the threat is dealt with. The conflict ends when nuclear strike options are discussed, because ionising radiation has this nasty habit of killing everything.

Wizards may be more powerful individually, but they are also ignorant of the abilities of their opponents, their opponents' command structure and just how far said opponent is willing to go to neutralize the threat of teleporting, mind controlling terrorists. By the time they do get a handle on just how badly the muggles would react to a potential population of hostile magicals, it's basically too late.

******* True. You need to have preset scenarios to frame this particular debate, because it will suffer from insane scope creep otherwise. Things such as 'is the wizard aware of what a gun is?' and 'what gun is the muggle carrying' and 'where is this confrontation taking place?' are all questions that can affect the outcome of the debate.

Besides, there are always two questions inherent to the debate as a whole, with one being 'can a modern muggle kill a wizard?' and the other being 'are guns useless in a magical setting?'

To the first, I answer 'maybe'. We're ridiculously good at killing things after all, but there is a serious problem inherent to said question: does the muggle know the person he/she's trying to kill is a wizard and, if so, how did he or she find out? If the muggle does know, then their approach to the kill may change. Wizards are popular fiction characters after all, so maybe they ditch the gun. Maybe they go for explosives, poison or something else entirely. If they think they're just facing a weirdo with a robe, then the whole thing could end up being a very short fight. As always, the crux of the question remains information. What information the parties have will determine whether or not they can defeat each other in a one on one fight. In this case, the best informed party wins.

But the second question is my favourite, because guns can absolutely be useful in a magical setting! For muggles getting a shot in is one thing though. The far more prevalent question would be: what can a wizard do with a gun?

See, guns don't kill people. Bullets do. A pistol is, mechanically speaking, an over-engineered pez dispenser. Put a loading mechanism, a trigger mechanism, a chamber and a barrel together and you have a gun, so enchanting one to basically clean and maintain itself whilst maximising parts performance (and nullify sound) is the sum total of what you can hope to do with a gun magic-wise.

But a bullet is where it's at. Enchanting bullets means that you can up your accurate spell-casting range from about 20 metres all the way up to 2 kilometres. Simply enchant the bullet with the spell you have in mind, load it into your gun and fire. Bonus points if you manage to replace the nitrocellulose composite used to fire the bullet with an explosive potions solution that imbues the bullet with magical properties in flight, making it fly straight, impervious to damage for a short time period (long enough to overpenetrate a tank for example) or explode on impact.

Now there's a setup for a Voldemort killing gun-one whose bullets and mechanisms are so heavily enchanted parts of it glow in the dark.

It's all in how you use it... And who uses it.

Conjure ammunition in the chamber, vanish the case. Failing that, extension charm on magazine. Featherlight. Extension charms in Barrel and chamber. Cancel the momentum of the recoil.

#+end_quote

Going off canon, they likely do not. Canon wizards are so incompetent/useless with regards to muggles that it'd be pretty shocking if the sole exception were to be the Aurors.

In fanon, that's going to be up to the author of any given fic to decide. Personally, I fall on the side of they don't really understand it at all, and technology/computers in particular would cause them issues. Like, the MO that I get from the aurors/wizarding police is that they would just obliviate muggles. But to have a careful understanding of technology in the muggle world, that's somehow much more accurate + well developed than Arthur Weasley has? That's a bit much for my taste.

That being said, the level of muggle awareness that wizards have throughout the series does fluctuate - from Malfoy in book 1 knowing what a helicopter is (which I chalk up to book 1 being, well, book 1) to Shacklebolt managing to be the Muggle PM's assistant w/ no issues, it's not always consistent.

******** Author consistency aside, canon as written then suggests that wizards /do/ have an understanding of muggle technology. Civilian citizens (such as Malfoy) maybe only on a surface level (dangerous flying thingie = helicopter), but specialists like Shacklebolt to a degree of fully functioning within muggle society. Plus there must be an understanding of muggle government in order to know where to place Shacklebolt and how to do it.

That still doesn't mention muggleborns and half-bloods who lived in that society and inevitably will have an understanding of most things muggle.

However, in the end its all up to the author. I personally like to think that wizards and muggles are capable of understanding the other side in general, with details getting lost in translation. Like wizards have a hard time understanding electricity, muggles do their heads in with the casual impossibilities dictated by the laws of nature wizards clean their shoes with.

Sure, Muggles are also written to be completely incompetent in the books. But we also have RL experience with the competence of non-magical militaries or other capabilities that don't match that - we don't have that for the WW.

Notably, this is also a muggle world that apparently doesn't care about or take precautions against the magical world... even while the leaders know about it. That doesn't strike me as particularly plausible, though it works in the HP books because muggles aren't the focus.

It has nothing to do with canon consistency. Wizards are humans, not some hive mind robots. There is zero reason they should all be ignorant of muggle technology. There is zero reason Draco Malfoy couldn't know about helicopters or Kingsley Shacklebolt couldn't blend in with muggles.

This isn't Rowling's fault. It's your apparent inability to view the wizarding world as individual beings.

Or there are no good precautions. Maybe they've already tried, but just fail, because wizards are insanely broken when it comes to power. "Literally all muggles are morons" is not a reasonable explanation.

****** I dunno why people generalize the entire wizarding world like this. They aren't a hive mind. There are plenty of wizards who would know exactly what the muggles are capable of. Just because we see a couple of wizards being ignorant doesn't mean literally all of them are. The ones in the know would quickly inform the others.

Draco Malfoy knows what a helicopter is. There are a ton of muggle-borns and half-bloods. There would be people undoubtedly assigned to keep up with the muggle world. There would be people simply interested in muggles, like Arthur. Diagon Alley would've experienced the London bombings in WW2. Wizards were said to have protected muggle neighborhoods during those wars too.

And even if we didn't have any of these examples, it'd still be silly to assume to know every wizard would be completely ignorant.

Similarly, muggles would be able to get some muggle-borns on their side and learn what wizards are mostly capable of. From there, maybe they'd still not understand due to HP magic working less mechanically and more conceptually, but they'd get a general idea. Not that it'd do them much good, in my opinion.

People like to talk about wizards as if they're all stupid, but they're just humans. And I wonder if these people have been living under a rock too. Like, /we're/ stupid too. It's amazing how incompetent people in our governments often are. You argue muggles would only be surprised by wizards the first encounter, but don't apply the same logic vice versa.

#+begin_quote
  The conflict ends when nuclear strike options are discussed, because ionising radiation has this nasty habit of killing everything.
#+end_quote

No it doesn't.

Firstly, nukes would never be used. Wizards live among muggles, and muggles aren't going to nuke their own cities. Secondly, I don't believe nukes would even get past proper wizard protections.

Thirdly, all it takes is one decent wizard to stop an entire country (if not the world) from continuing this war. One wizard with ability to get to the world leaders and Imperius them. Muggles would have to kill /every/ wizard, and that's impossible.

Fourthly, if we read Chapter 1 of Half-Blood Prince, it becomes fairly clear to me that the war would never even begin in the first place. Wizards already have their foot on the throats of muggles. The "war" already happened, and it was so one-sided that muggles didn't even know about it. Wizards casually manipulate the minds of muggle presidents, with zero fucks given.

Honestly the biggest factors in wizard v muggle are awareness and range. An unaware or ill prepared wizard stands no chance against a muggle with a long range weapon, by the time they realise what's happening, it's too late.

The same however is also true in reverse, except wizards are more limited in their range (not by spells, but by the rarity of wizarding tools for long range vision, the exist sure, but they dont use them like muggles do).

***** I personally don't think I'm trans or even nonbinary. I'm fine being a girl (though I don't think I'd mind if I'd been born a dude), I was just having some odd thoughts about my boobs and thinking about being a dude (and its parts) and stuff. Like, I put a bra on last night because I just felt so odd about my boobs and I emotionally/mentally felt better. It was like a weight had lifted from my chest (both emotionally and literally, lol) and I just felt happier. Thank you for the comment, though! I can agree that I'm somewhat uncomfortable with some aspects of the female body and how it's portrayed.

Re slughorn sure he had an ulterior motive but it was hardly obscured. Everyone in the room knew what was happening. And if he were manipulative he would have at least told harry what he wanted.

I was of the opinion that they change to fit the situation over time (adding new languages, change in culinary styles, maybe a war with a rival ministry to settle who has jurisdiction over this or that territory), but that it takes longer (sometimes significantly so) for the changes to become apparent.

Most of the others dissented, arguing that this didn't happen since both muggle and magical worlds are separate. This is despite there being a school called 'castellobruxo' sitting in the Amazon rainforest.

It was an interesting debate, especially when factoring in the 'fun' that were the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.

What the hell is a Horcrux and how is it used?? Because it's not used in Voldemorts Ressurection and I feel like if there was ever a time to use a Horcrux, that's when you should be using one. Is Voldemorts shade a Horcrux when he 'dies' trying to kill Harry?

WHY DOES SIRIUS NEVER TELL HARRY TO USE THE GODDAM MIRROR IN OOTP THEY TALK TWICE USING THE GODDAM FLOO??

Who invented Butterbeer. And why? I can only assume the NHS also covers wizards because selling spiced butter to kids is just leading to a world of problems.

Everyone studies astronomy, divination, dada and care of magical creatures. No way Remus Lupin kept the werewolf thing a secret.

1. It's an anchor. He would've died without them but there's no reason he'd pull them out and do a ritual. This is why he was able to hide them in hard to access places.

2. Yes, it's crazy. He was also entirely under the control of a narcissistic madman. Elaborate plans are to be expected. It's how Voldemort reassured himself that he was still a genius master of planning. (he wasn't but he thought he was)

3. Okay, yeah this is a genuine plot hole lmao

4. Are you saying butterbeer is just a mug of butter? It's warmed, spiced, only barely alcoholic beer. Plus, it's meant to be more of a treat than a regular drink, like hot chocolate more than anything.

5. I believe the shrieking shack was enchanted to shriek at other times as well. Werewolves are very ostracized and stereotyped as well. Lupin is described as mild and non-threatening, completely opposite the typical stereotype. That alone would have deterred most who got suspicious. There's only so many full moons in a year, few enough to chalk up the absences as coincidence imo. Also, more of a nitpick than anything, but divination and care of magical creatures were electives, so not everyone was studying them.

For a long time I was under the belief that to come back he had to use up one of his Horcruxes, it wasn't until much later I realised the anchor aspect of them. I always used to get confused when people said they would hide them in completely unreachable places, thinking that it would stop the person who made them from retrieving them themselves.

If he had just been a slightly better politician he could have just made one Horcrux and hidden it in Australia? Since he probably wouldn't get actively murdered.

I think this is just a gripe I have with the concept of Horcruxes. Like, if I was a writer inventing a soul thing, I would definately use the bit of soul in my ressurection spell. So it'd be like making another lifetime for yourself and you have a limited amount of lifetimes. To make another lifetime/Horcrux you have to take someone else's life...

Like? What was Malfoys plan here? Even if "getting it to Hogwarts" was the plan, there's at least 8 better, more reliable ways of getting it to Hogwarts than bringing the thing to Diagon alley???

Did he know it was a Horcrux? Was "Release the Basilisk" his plan? And if so, this is a dumb as fuck way to do it? Write in the diary yourself. You're on the board of governors you can just walk into the school under any vague excuse and open the chamber then?? And then at least the Dark Lord will know it was you who ressurected him and not some convoluted plan with an 11 year old kid???

MsScribe was a livejournal blogger with numerous sockpuppets.

My own headcanon has Pureblood have magical parents and grandparents (even if all 4 of their grandparents are Muggleborn), Muggleborns have 2 muggle parents (this is canon) while the rest is halfblood. So Harry's children, assuming he had them with a non-Squib with 2 magical parents, would be a first-generation Pureblood, while someone like Snape couldn't make Pureblood children no matter what since he had a Muggle father, despite both of them counting as half-bloods. This headcanon is purely cultural -- I consider it "scientifically" nonsense, but I figured it was a definition settled over time as a result of people asking "is this person a pureblood or halfblood" a bunch of times.

Which is a moot point, because JK Rowling stated after the Deathly Hallows was released that she was named after Luna, and that Harry didn't use the name "Remus" because he wanted Teddy to be able to use it later in life. So the matter is closed, never mind how messed up it would be to name his daughter after the moon - which was Remus's boggart??!! And why so many people were so adamant about this instead of the obvious answer that they named her after one of his parents best friends is beyond me.

that you think incel would be an apt description for a character whose love for a estranged friend led him to honoring her ideals even after she was long dead is very telling of your understanding of his character, and even the meaning of the word, lol

I don't like her domineering bossy (I know, kinda synonyms) attitude towards everyone she deems unfit to be "an adult". Her narrow-mindedness towards her children's dreams careers. The absolute despicable way she treated Fleur.

I like Julie Walters in the movies but they toned down the character A LOT.

Now about Harry, there's a limit to how many times you can use the "I didn't know about magic until recently" excuse before people should yell at you "GO READ A BOOK, GO ASK QUESTIONS".

Also, nobody gave a fuck about the representation of trans people when HP was written. We were at the beginning of the end of the anti-homophobia fights, and all the... "nuances" had yet to be imagined. Trans people existed but they certainly were not everywhere like they are lately.

If anything, you could (dumbly) argue that Rowling is sexist by making the mean character ugly and unfeminine, but then that'd be forgetting all she has done for women rights, which people seemed to easily forget once it has been shown that her opinions are not everyone else's.

JKR really does have some weird stuff with character design tho. Why was wormtail, the fat ugly one, evil? Same with umbridge? Did she HAVE to be stout and ugly? The dursleys were fat and/or ugly (horse face). Why does fat and ugly equal evil? The only counter examples I can think of are Neville and ms. Weasley. Neville was the butt of a lot of jokes though.

********* I think you don't understand what I'm saying. So let me be clear.

If there is a problem, it is shared between people like Rowling and people like you. You are two sides of a coin.

On one hand, we have Rowling, who's firm into her beliefs, refuse to admit that maybe she's wrong, and will fight for her beliefs no matter who she hurts. And hurt people she will, for her takes are, for the most parts, wrong and hurtfull.

And then, on the other hand, there's people who actively *wants* to be hunted. Who *wants* everyone to hate them, because it comforts them in their little world. For those people, everything that may be considered as a slight against them will be seen as a slight against them. No questions asked. And you're proof of this second category.

Here, we have a woman described as "not the most feminine person", acting as a bad guy. You want to know who was not the most attractive person and was a bad guy? Voldemort. Is Voldemort a slight against non-binaries? You want to know another bad girl who was seen as not attractive? Pansy Parkinson. Is Pansy Parkinson a slight against trans people?

Petunia Dursley is described as having a horse neck, or something along these lines. Is it a slight against furries? Or was it just that, a description? The answer is, if you WANT it to hurts you, then it will. Simple as that.

I don't need to "educate myself", because my education is well-rounded. I've seen enough stable trans people, talked to them enough to understand what makes them wince, what makes them tick, what hurts them. I've made mistakes, and apologised for those. And for all of them, the thing that hurt them the most was deadnaming them, when someone didn't manage to call them by their respective genders they wouldn't care as long as that someone apologised, and the only character they universally didn't like in HP, when they liked HP anyway, was Umbridge.

And that's because /they don't seek to be hurt/. Because they're living their lives as much as they can, in the way they want.

People calling you transphobic for how you see Rita isn't really transphobic. In a way, it's both dumb and mysoginistic. Mysoginistic because she's not an horrible person that is also a womanly woman, so she's a transphobic representation of trans people.

To me, "subtext" is another term for "making stuff up". If you are looking for something to be offended by, then you can probably find enough subtext in /anything/ to be offended.

If somebody didn't mean to offend, it's probably not worth taking offense.

However, I will agree that Rowling's trans views that she posts on Twitter etc are offensive. However, I don't remember ever seeing her say that /all/ trans women are predatory men in disguise, I think that what she said is that she doesn't want that loophole to be open for predatory men. Undoubtedly, she has said some offensive things, but let's be accurate about what she is offensive about.
