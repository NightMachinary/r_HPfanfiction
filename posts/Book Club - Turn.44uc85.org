Sorry about the delay since last time. I gave it extra time since it was generating more discussion than most months, then just started forgetting.


** I was never a huge fan of slash, especially Harry and Draco, but this is one I've reread a few times. I'm a huge fan of the premise, and the writing style and good use of grammar are a definite plus as well. I especially like [[/spoiler][when Harry goes back to his actual timeline and has to deal with telling Ginny and the kids]]. I would definitely say that this story should be read, even by people that aren't big fans of slash.

** I really like this one. The idea behind the fic is original, and well executed. It does get a bit predictable [[/spoiler][you know right away when Harry gets back he will give up his job as Auror, and that he and Draco will get together]], but it proves how well it is written that I didn't find this troublesome at all. I did find the whole Anthony Goldstein-thing a bit unnecessary thought, I wouldn't have missed it if it was left out. But in general, great fic, you should read it.

I really really loved the artwork (or at least, descriptions of artwork) in this! I never thought much about glass blowing, but this fic managed to get me obsessed pretty quickly. So yeah, watching hour-long glassblowing demonstrations on Youtube was a side-effect for me, but not one I mind (Corning Museum of Glass livestreams anybody?).

** MAN OK, I was so excited when I saw this was the next fic because it is seriously one of my favourites.

The author's prose is beautiful; they manage to paint with their words. The emotion and age felt by Harry and the supporting cast comes across as so real mainly because it isn't spelt out, but rather snatches of daily weariness and moments that any reader can relate to and think: "Ah, these are the things I feel when I have a build-up of sadness/anger/restlessness/anxiety".

I don't really want to say much more, rather than that this is one of the few slash fics I have ever read and it actually seemed plausible - also, the portrayal of Ginny here is /fantastic/.

** I'm not a huge fan of shipping fic, but this one has a solid premise AND follow through. Character development is pretty logical and not rushed at all. You could suss out the endgame halfway through, but still enjoy every minute of it.

** Not a big slash fan either, but enjoyed this. Nice idea, really well executed. Captures the emotion and tension of [[/spoiler][telling beloved in-laws about a relationship bust up]] really well along the way.

** So I really liked Turn, but it bothered me so much at first. Like, I was mentally uncomfortable with the very idea, the concept bothers me. I've had really elaborate "entire lifetime" dreams where you wake up completely shattered. So it took a while for me to just settle into the story and enjoy the ride.

Then when it went back into the 'real' world, that was hard too. And I think it depicted that pretty well, Harry forgetting what was from which timeline, like his knee, trying to reconcile the two worlds.

** "Do you ever wonder if things would have been different... if you'd done something else?" - Harry Potter, Chapter 1 of Turn

How many of us have had this thought or one similar? If you haven't, you may be too young to have had that one major regret in life or you've already experienced that regret but not enough time has passed for you to realize its significance.

How many people are trudging through life because there's comfort in routine, even though that routine has put them in a rut? Even if you've never experienced a bit of what it is like to be complacent with the status quo in your real life, you will here through Harry.

Author Sara's Girl does a great job of showing us Harry's life. We're not just reading about Harry, we BECOME Harry. We feel his regret, his guilt, his ennui, his hope, and his eventual optimism. The writing is witty, heartwarming and humorous; the characters are fresh and yes, while the plot leans towards the predictable, it is still very satisfying.

The author's message is clear - do not be afraid to step out of your comfort zone. Do not be afraid to make changes - you just might be surprised at what you learn about yourself along the way. Do not settle for 'what if?' Go out and take a risk. Take the unknown road now.

** I positively love this fic. I read it when I want to feel my feels. Probably I've re-read 3-4 times. Sara's Girl writes beautiful, thoughtful prose.

I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts about the [[/spoiler][calmness of Harry and Ginny's divorce. The divorces in my family have been brutal. Does Sara's Girl write with rosy-tinted glasses on this aspect, or do some couples genuinely dissolve ~20 years of marriage with little fanfare?]] I ask mainly out of curiosity, not of a position of criticism/critique. The way it was written just flies in the face of my personal experiences, so it's something I've wondered as I read/reread this fic.

*** I think there's little fanfare because they're just /tired/. I have definitely seen quiet dissolution of marriage.

  One good turn always deserves another. Apparently. Epilogue compliant/AU. HPDM slash but some canon het along the way. Please trust me - I promise the epilogue will not bite you.

  CoS according to Ginny: Nobody noticed anything wrong for an entire year. How did she slip so far from her family and friends? Angst and betrayal, but also mysteries, jokes, an enchanted suit of armor, and a guaranteed happy ending. COMPLETE!
