A month or so ago, [[/u/FairyRave][u/FairyRave]] made [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8e5mrs/request_in_an_alternate_dimension_newt_scamander/][a thread]] requesting a story where Newt Scamander was Tom Riddle and the idea got lodged in my brain. So I ended up making a short story based on that a week or two later, but completely forgot about it until I was perusing my Google Docs earlier, so I went ahead and published it. Check it out if you're interested (probably a couple of errors)~

** Unless you're being intentional in having Voldemort misspell it, it ought to be "PrewEtt", with an E.

I think the sex scene was sort of superfluous. For one thing, it feels sort of jarring to have Voldemort (even young, crackfic Voldemort) use the word "fuck" so casually. I don't know, it seems like if he had to refer to his own bodily pleasures he'd do so in a less flippant way.

Other than that however, brilliant story. Great writing and great ideas --- this concept of what Voldemort's "world tour" might have entailed is hilarious and also very much in-character.

*** Typo on Prewett, oops (went ahead and fixed them).

To be honest, the Myrtle bit was (from what I recall) just an attempt to find a semi-canon starting point. And then her being "Moaning Myrtle" came to mind and I stopped putting any thought into it, heh. But fair point on the "fuck" bit.

Thanks for reading!

  "No murderous household is complete without a copy of Magnificent Murders, well thumbed by the generations who have riffled its pages in search of the best way to rid their towns of Muggles, interpret the mournful cries of the dying, or cure their despair at lacking direction in life." -Mortuary Monthly
