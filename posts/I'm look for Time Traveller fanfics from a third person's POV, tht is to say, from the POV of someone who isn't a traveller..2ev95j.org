  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

In progress.

  When Sirius accidentally screws up a mission and almost gets them killed, James Potter, Sirius Black, and Frank Longbottom wake up in a tent with three dead-eyed teenagers who tell them that they've got a mission, but can't give up any details, not yet.

Abandoned, probably.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] is the only one that comes to mind, though some of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Edunuelos][Dunuelos']] The Lone Traveler spin offs also apply.

If I find/think of some more, I'll come back on by and update this post. don't count on in though.

** If you're not opposed to slash, the first book of Minisinoo's Aorist Subjunctive series has some scenes from Cedric's POV interacting with a time traveling Harry. The rest of the series is an AU borne from said time travel.

You mean [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/106720/Minisinoo]] , right? I was unable to find any such story. (I don't have anything that I say no to in fanfic. I don't tend to like slash, but that's also cause a ton of slash is poor. I've read good slash though.)

**** Minisinoo is about as good a fanfic writer as they come. Doesn't look Aorist Subjunctive is on ff.net, here's the series in a variety of formats: [[http://amalthia.mediawood.net/ebooks/viewseries.php?seriesid=29]]
