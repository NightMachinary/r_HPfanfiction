Does anyone have any suggestions where Harry is the BWL and James and Lily survive to raise him? Something with a Harry/Ginny pairing would be nice. Also, novel length or several novels would be good, too.

This is one of the best fics out there (Imo). James and Lily still live and there's a really interesting family dynamic going on. It's a loooong series (author is currently working on book 3!). No pairings yet as Harry is still quite young.

Explores the world of potions in an interesting and unique way. It's a cross over from The Lionesses series but you def do not need to know anything about that series to be able to read this one. The cross over is tinny. Great story, cant recommend it and it's sequels enough.

** I tried reading a few of those, but seeing as my favorite character is Severus Snape, most of them make me cringe because they gloss over the fact that his life would have been radically different had Lily lived. Perhaps he could let go... perhaps he couldn't... but he wouldn't be hounded by guilt and turn into such a bitter and angry man. And yet, every one I read seems to ignore that fact.

I can't honestly recommend those. The Family He Deserves is rather nice I suppose, again, ignoring that fact.
