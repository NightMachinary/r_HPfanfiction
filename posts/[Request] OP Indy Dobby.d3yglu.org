You know just as well as I do you want to see this.

Bonus points if you make him a conceited little shit like fanon Indy Harry.


** Yessss! House elves are canonically badass, and OP as shit. Can apparate in and out of Hogwarts, Malfoy Manor, and VOLDEMORT'S CAVE when not even Dumbledore could. Can track down Mundungus with nothing to go on, because house elf omniscience I guess! Further omniscience is shown by just KNOWING how to get to Shell Cottage, or to Harry's house in book 2 - I doubt Dobby looked it up in a phone book.

Make it a Dobby Winky teamup, too! Or a Dobby/Winky/Kreacher trio of badassery. :D

*** So Winky is Hermione, Kreacher is Ron, and Dobby is Harry

Sounds about right.

***** I just finished Raptor, where Hermione was hysterically drunk for the last half of the story. So, sometimes...

****** I love that story, although I'll admit Hermione was a tad out of character when it came to dismissing knowledge.

******* I thought the author put a fairly plausible explanation for her dismissing dinosaurs. I've seen enough perfect Hermiones to appreciate one with character flaws and growth.

** I've always considered writing a satirical fic where, instead of Dumbledore being the great manipulator behind everything happen, it was Dobby. A rogue house elf could get some serious shit done. But I never had enough inspiration/ideas for it

*** /For the Superior Sock/ - Dobby.

I'd gladly brainstorm some.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/16/Odd-Ideas]] chapters 16, 36, 43.

I think the author, Rorschach's Blot, does this in a couple more of his Odd Ideas too.

*** I've read odd ideas. Quite a few of his ideas are really good... But the writing hasn't aged well.

I appreciate it though. I'm really looking for an independent Dobby. He can be friends with Harry.
