So after reading a ton of fanfiction you tend to get the lines blurred over what happened in fanfiction versus what happen in canon.

For instance some people claim for whatever reason that Ron is the one who called Hermione a Mudblood even though that never happened.

Some people think that Harry married Ginny because she looked like his mother, which A: Just because they're both red heads doesn't mean that they're anything alike personality or look wise, and B: That was never stated in canon, even though some people think it was.

And other similar things like that. So, are there anything that you end up getting confused by? Things that you need cleared up on? Or maybe things said by other people that swear is canon and isn't, and you just think it's funny that they thought that.


** The humble Warming Charm. A simple charm you can place on your robes to prevent them from getting chilly in the winter, or reheat muggle food following a breaking-and-entering-and-obliviating.

*** The Warming Charm has some canon basis. Hermione is shown using a charm that expels warm air to melt the snow in front of them as they're walking in one of the last 3 books.

The prophecy really gets my goat. Mostly, because it shows a shallow interpretation of canon. The prophecy only mattered because Voldemort acted like it did.

Dumbledore himself didn't follow the prophecy like a rabid dog. I remember an argument in the 6th book, where Dumbledore says something along the lines of, "Stop taking the prophecy so literally"

Seriously, where did the whole 'the prophecy is binding and unbreakable' thing start? Is it just selective memory, maybe? People going 'It was the big reveal at the end of book 5, Scrimgoer comments on Harry supposedly being the Chosen One, Harry himself makes a joke about it, he really is the one who defeats Voldemort' but forget the small scene in the middle of Book 6 where Dumbledore explicitly states that prophecies are powerless except for belief in them?

Or maybe they're getting Harry Potter confused with another series. Tell me, does anyone know any stories where a prophecy ISN'T self-fulfilling? Where it actually has power of its own?

This part at least goes for Harry Potter as well. And that would be a common canon misunderstanding as well. So many people are still stuck on the "power he knows not" being the power of love because Dumbledore thought it might be that. It was actually just that Voldemort didn't know Harry had the elder wand on his side.

**** I think Dumbledore followed the prophecy as well. He was 'training' Harry since year one. When Dumbledore knew he would die in the HBP, he gave all the information to Harry. Not Order, Minerva or Kingsley, but to a 16 year old boy. Would he choose Harry if the prophecy would not exist? I don't think so.

Btw, if Voldemort did not believe the prophecies, it would not exist because it would not come true.

***** I think a lot of people just like to rag on the old man. Personally, I see him as someone terrified of power (because he fears he'll end up killing more people like his sister) extremely reluctant to use violence or force (because of Gellert and his sister) and far more interested in teaching and studying and pursuing his own hobbies (backed up by him being odd and quirky as a teacher who was beloved but considered mad).

However, he had the problem that because he was a genius who was also the most powerful wizard of his age people kept expecting him to do all the things he hated. They wanted him to be a war leader, even against a man who was his friend and possible lover. They wanted him to lead the country, when Dumbledore feared of what he would do when in power. I even suspect he was reluctant to be made Headmaster of Hogwarts and had to practically be dragged out of the classroom because he feared he would have too much influence.

Of course I expect all that to be thrown out the window when the new Fantastic Beasts movie comes out and he becomes a generic badass.

** I remember reading on here (or somewhere) that the only time the word "Marauder" was brought up in canon was in reference to the Marauder's Map. James, Sirius, Peter, and Remus were never explicitly called the Marauders. It's led me to think of a funny gag if this is true.

Fred and George stared in shock at Professor Lupin.

"You're one of the Marauders!" they yelled in unison.

Lupin stared back, confusion written clearly on his face. "I'm a what now?"

The twins quickly looked at each other, then back at their professor.

"You just said your nickname in school was Moony."

"The same Moony that's friends with Padfoot, Wormtail, and Prongs, right?"

"That same group that has personalities in our map?"

"The one that boldly proclaims itself 'The Marauder's Map'?"

Professor Lupin only became more confused as Fred and George explained their reasoning, but then it finally clicked when he realized what they were talking about. "Ah, that map! I remember that! We made it in our fifth year because of all of the exploring we did, and we constantly added enchantments to it over the years. As a last great prank on Hogwarts, James and Sirius let themselves get caught by Filch with it near the end of our seventh year, knowing that it would go straight into his drawer of confiscated items. I think that's why they named it the Marauder's map, it was for any Marauder brave enough to raid the drawer. We were never actually arrogant enough to give ourselves a group name!"

It's exactly a Charlus and Dorea situation. That is: just like Charlus and Dorea were never realistic candidates for James' parents, those who know their canon also know that there's nothing to suggest Susan was raised by Amelia.

The passage in OotP reads thus:

** remus lupin isn't mentioned as having any scars on his face, or at all. his face is lined, and his hair is graying, and he does look older than his age

lucius malfoy doesn't have long hair, or a cane. in fact, if we go by draco in the epilogue, he probably has less hair than average. there's also a larger trend where people seem to think that long hair on men is a wizardy cultural tradition which i'm not sure is true. the malfoys are wizard high society preps, so his hair is likely exactly like draco's: short and slicked back. we also see a lot of hair loss among pureblood men: arthur, salazar, draco's receding hairline, slughorn. plus, a lot of the men who do have long hair are usually eccentrics or rebels of some kind e.g. snape, the dumbledores, xeno, bill. and molly, a pureblood mother, decidedly doesn't like bill having long hair

*** They might as well be with all the times magical 'protections' in some form show up. Ward by another name. It's not just the persisting ones like Fidelius, blood protection, or anti-apparition charms, sometimes they go 'active' and form giant glowing domes like in the Battle of Hogwarts and Fantastic Beasts.

I think it's the fanon runes that get most people, not that transcribing arcane symbols on a stone and channeling magic through it to 'set' the ward is that big of a jump given how much is left to the imagination with HP's magic system.

**** In HP, magic is generally grouped into branches which share similar properties: Transfiguration, Charms, etc. By using the term "wards" the natural implication is that the magic within that area is a branch of magic in the same way that Charms, Transfiguration etc are.

But "wards" are not a distinct branch of magic in canon. They consist mainly of Charms and Curses. "Wards" classifies magic by function rather than nature and in doing so it clashes with the rest of the HP magic classification system.

In doing so the use of the word "wards" can lead people to forget that it is not a distinct magical field with its own rules but rather simply a shorthand way of referring to a variety of magic which more properly belongs to the other branches of magic. That in turn will generally lead to these items of magic being mistreated (said abuse generally involving runes).

Ultimately this isn't about being /different/ to canon, this is about being /worse/ than canon. Like many fanon inventions, "wards" take something which is interestingly complex in canon and make it simple. Having magical protections be composed of a mix of magic of different natures and governed by different rules has a messiness to it which makes it feel more realistic - the real world is a messy place. I don't understand why anyone would want to get rid of that in favour of neat categorisation.

TL;DR: the problem isn't the word "wards", the problem is people treating wards as a branch of magic. Which happens in basically every fic which has ever used the word "wards".

***** I can sort of get your point, but take the profession of mediwitch for example. We generally accept that the field is a mix of charms and potions (and probably some counter-cursing), but I just don't see how classifying those spells or potions with the same general function as 'healing' to be somehow less than canon.

Just as I wouldn't gripe if a curse breaker(?) was called a Warding Specialist and concentrated on taking down (or erecting) magical protections in the field of Charms (or Runes, as the case may be). It may simplify a definition, but it's still a generalization and thus "messy".

I refer you back to my TL;DR. If the fic uses the word "wards" in such a way that it is clear that it is not considered a branch of magic but rather is a shorthand way of referring to magic of a certain function, fine. But I have literally never seen any fic do this.

2.  Was Sirius seriously a cassanova during his Hogwarts years?

3.  Lily being this perfect mary sue in 99% of fanfics. Was it true in canon too?

4.  What are these "raids" voldemort conducts on muggles/wizards? How exactly did the war pan out during mid 70s?

5.  Fred and George doing stupid stuff or bullying and naming it as a prank.

6.  Luna Lovegood just a weird girl. Not a seer nor some special girl who could see invisible stuff.

7.  Severus Snape. Canon Snape did not loathe Harry as most of the Snape bashing fics convey. He was a complex character overall, but fics make him one dimensional sometimes.

8.  Voldemort's true motives. He's been portrayed by many ways in fanfics, but eventually he was just a power hungry manipulator.

9.  Slytherins. I feel the books were a bit biased against Slytherins. But as a whole never really got a good insight on Slytherin characteristics.fanon portray slytherins with wide variety of their own additions.

10. Harry. Harry was a genuinely average teenager in books with special circumstances. His character literally eveolves book-wise and is different every book, POA onwards. Fanfics generally have a point of divergence, and add their own characterization as to how Harry should have been according to them. Some have become such common tropes that it's sometimes hard to remember what's canon and what's fanon
