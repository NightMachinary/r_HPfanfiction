*** Just a curious thing I noticed. I was looking through these fics and found this author: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2646642/Forgotten-Toaster]]

How is it possible to have one story (1.7k words) with 149 reviews? His/her other one is 15k and has 145 reviews, which isn't absurd, but the readership isn't enough to give the oneshot that much of a boost.

**** Cauterize is the same length and has 1300+ reviews. Stranger things have happened.
