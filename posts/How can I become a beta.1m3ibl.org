Hello, I've never participated directly in Harry Potter fanfiction because I have a hard time finishing any story I begin, but I've thought about it and I think I could be a good beta. Does someone know how to? I guess I should probably register on some HP fanfic web, but as I normally read fanfics on mirror webs or sporkings I don't know any, except for Sugar Quill, which is dead. Do I need some kind of credentials?


** If you use fanfiction.net, then you can make a beta profile to go along with your writing profile. I usually use the forums there to offer my services, so I get a lot of requests. There's no credentials, you just have to do a decent job and be nice about it.

** I became a beta in a roundabout way. There was an author I really liked, so I found her Livejournal page and began reading her blog posts. One day, she mentioned her regular betas were all busy. I sent her a PM and said hey, you don't know me, but I read and comment on your stories, and I'd be happy to beta a piece for you. She was delighted with my work, and we got to be friends after a while. She recommended me to others. I also joined the two beta communities on LJ, hp_betas and hp_betas_wanted. Whenever there are HP writing fests, I volunteer to be an on-call beta. Now I put in anywhere from 4-6 hours a week. In the last few months, I also started writing one-shots. I find they take less commitment than a multichap project.
