So I have a few questions about magical combat for an upcoming fight scene in a fic I'm writing.

1: could you stab someone with a wand like just Yeet that shit into their throat? I would guess probably the wand might have to break first to get an edge but I think you could do it

2: could could you summon someone's bones? Like if you broke a bone with a curse and it pierced the skin could you just accio a motherfuckers femur?

Also what interesting methods of magical combat can you all think of.


** 1. I feel like it is basically a branch, so it wouldn't be a first choice weapon for stabbing someone. I've had a character shove one into an already open wound and do some damage though. I bet if you combined the stabbing motion with /Diffindo/ it would be pretty fucking effective.
2. Damn. I don't see why not. That is brutal AF. And now I have a new head canon for how Moody lost his eye in battle.
3. I don't know who you are, but I like the way you think.

*** 1. I mean spears are just sharpened stick right so if you just break it a little then stab someone I imagine that'd be decently effective 2.yeah it is brutal I also had the idea to transfigured someone's lungs into wasps and shoot a blasting curse at the ground and then transfigure the kicked up dust into a wall to block the killing curse

2. Thank you kindly good sir

**** 1. I could see someone demented, like Bellatrix or such, sharpening the end of their wand and keeping it that way for this very purpose. If you break it, you're going to expose the core, so maybe not the best long-term solution? It would be kind of epic if a character broke their own wand in half and shoved it into someone though.
2. These are damn good ideas. Very effective. I support this.
3. lol thanks

***** Yeah my story I'm building is first wizarding war but much much darker and with a Voldemort who's far more terrifying so I've had to invent more inventive methods of magical combat. So I've had to think about the application of otherwise basic charms and spells plus other areas of study (like runic grenades)

****** This sounds similar to the fic I am working on, and I have now written a lot of dueling/combat/chase scenes, so let me indulge, especially for those who are downvoting.

Canon doesn't develop combat magic as much as you would think it should, and a lot of authors just stick with the basic spells and methods from the books and movies. This works . . . until you have a story that is centered around battles, dueling, and combat, and/or war stories. You need more. You need to expand and get creative. No one wants to read the same "wizard one fires a curse, wizard two blocks, wizard one tries again from a distance" battles. The more you world build, the more you end up improvising, and having your characters invent new spells and curses. I am a firm believer that coming up with unique combat spells IS world building.

I disagree with a lot of the comments you are getting, obviously. Fuck the knife/gun analogy. Combat is messy. It is personal. Sometimes your characters don't want to fire /Stupefy/ from a distance or try to hit someone with the killing curse six times in a row - they want to apparate behind their opponent, kick them on the ground, and turn their eyes into puss while they scream. The duels we see in canon are clean. Real life fights are gruesome, and, like you, I wrote to reflect that.

Also, this is fan fiction. wE doN't sEe iT in CaNon. So? Want your character to have invented a summoning charm that works on parts of the body? Do it. Why not. Evil wizards are sick bastards. Why wouldn't they come up with spells like this? Sure, animals like dragons have resistance, but wizards are not automatically spell resistant by nature, and not all of them are walking around with /Protego/ thrown over their bodies, ready to go. Ever fired off a roman candle? It's fast. It's /loud/. The force travels up your arm. That is what casting an attack spell should feel like. You won't always have time to /Protego/ your way out, and doesn't that get boring after your sixth or seventh battle scene anyway? I think sticking to canon spells for combat is selling your characters short, too.

Keep up the creative battles and world build your combat magic.

******* I was very much going to invent new curses and other methods of combat (using transfiguration and potentially conjuration) so far I've thought of thinks like a blinding curse or something that breaks bones because if that hits your spine or sternum your fucking dead from internal bleeding.

Plus not everyone makes the wisest decision in the heat of the moment a blasting curse might be the best option here but you might fire a killing curse instead people are irrational and combat should reflect that

******** This is creative, great world building, and I am honestly doing similar things with my story. I think this kind of shit makes the combat feel so much more real and intense.

Oh, totally it should reflect that. If your characters are blocking every spell and turning glass to sand all the time, that is boring, overpowered, and unrealistic, too. Like, ok, I have a young Auror in my story who is learning all of this battle magic, and I like writing him, because he /has/ to get creative to survive, and he is constantly getting knocked on his ass. This isn't dueling club. This is battle. Your characters want to kill each other in painful ways. Real fights are fast and messy. I will scream it from the hilltops. Instinct takes over and your characters will react however they can in the moment.

You've got this, friend!

** 1: Nope. It's basically a blunt wooden stick. You /could/ poke someone's eyes or other sensitive places if they are unable to defend I suppose. You could heat up the wand tip first to actually use it in melee combat.

2: Nope. My favorite headcanon: Summoning anything that is a part of some other magical entity is unlikely to work. I like to think of it as all wizards having a innate degree of magical resistance. A summoning charm would likely be unable to overcome this resistance. Whether this immunity applies to non-magicals is upto you. This immunity likely extends to their immediate person i.e. their clothes.

*** 1. If you break it I'm sure it would work otherwise I think I'd depend on the individual wand shape
2. Eh I think maybe they themselves have some innate resistance but I don't think it'd extend to there clothes or immediate person

**** 1. A broken wand is basically game over unless your opponent is also disarmed.

2. If it didn't, summoning someone's shoes/spectacles would have been an easy cheat. Yet we don't see it in canon.

***** I'm thinking more your fighting two wizards you disarm one and use his wand to stab his friend less you using your own wand

** Canonically, Neville did stab a Death Eater in the eye with Hermione's wand because he wasn't able to come up (or maybe had been jinxed) with a spell. But yeah, other than that obvious weak point then no stabbing with a wand.

*** Do bones count as living objects? Is anything inside the body unsummonable? If that's the case I'm sure someone's made a summoning charm that works on living creatures because that sounds incredibly useful for combat

As for the range thing well knife vs gun logic applies here. Within 10-20 ft a knife is better than a gun because guns at that range don't have the time to aim and shoot. I'd say the same applies to wands especially if you have to make flamboyant movements and say some fucked Latin.

***** That's fair but you also have to account for the fact that most people probably aren't expecting to be stabbed with a stick the element of surprise is a very very powerful weapon. Also it's a lot easier to shoot wide if they're within 5 ft of you let alone also trying to fuck you up in the process (hence why creatures have disadvantage on ranged attacks with 5ft in dnd)

** Harry summoned a witch's front teeth in /Midnight's Godson/. Which made it impossible for her to cast the unforgivables, since she couldn't pronounce them. Using a switching spell on teeth was mentioned in book 4, although it was never explicitly stated or shown to work.

I would say if it broke the skin you could summon bone, but it might not come out due to the ligaments and such attached to it. But it would hurt like a motherfucker.

** 1. That happens at the beginning of the Crimes of Grindelwald

2. I don't see why not but the summoning spell does require you to visually focus on how the target looks like and if you haven't seen that person's femur, that might be problematic.
