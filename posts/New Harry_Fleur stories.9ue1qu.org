#+begin_quote
  As the threat of Voldemort grows, Harry does his best to prepare for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as new challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.

*** Ok, I have a quick question for you. Harry and Fleur has always been my favorite combo to read, but over the last bit more and more Harry/Fleur fics are beginning to include Daphne. Either she is a friend, she is a rival to Fleur for Harry, or we go full poly and they both get Harry. Its getting to the point where I really despise Daphne. Why do so many authors include Daphne when using Fleur in their romance? I just don't understand it. I am hoping you can illuminate me since I see you have Fleur and Daphne listed in the characters section of your story.

**** I think it's a culmination of a few reasons, one of which could very easily be because of the recent popularity of Daphne over the last few years. When a character is popular or 'in fashion' in a fandom, a lot people want to write stories including that character. It could be because they want to use a new character as an exercise in writing, or that they have an interesting character idea for them, but it also can be because an author wants their story to become popular and using a trending character helps direct traffic to their story. A lot of people like Fleur and a lot of people like Daphne, so having both would essentially double your prospective readers.

Another reason could be because you have blank slate of a character in Daphne. She is canonically mentioned, but we know nothing about her at all. Add in the fact that she has a cool name, and now you have the perfect mixture for a character that you could do anything with. Given how riddled fanfiction is with common tropes, it was only a matter of time before Daphne became an Ice Queen bombshell who turns Harry's life around. She takes the place of Fleur in a lot of situations where Harry is too young for her, or people don't know how to properly set Harry and Fleur together.

Me personally, Daphne was initially supposed to play a very, very minimal role in my story -- simply a character in passing -- and it was Susan who was supposed to have a much larger role. But as I wrote, I found that I enjoyed writing Daphne more, and interesting plot ideas came to mind for her and the story changed from there.

Saying something is good only if you don't mind that one thing is true, but it's not really important unless someone has already told you they want to avoid something. This fic is only good if you don't mind infidelity, that fic is only good if you don't mind rape, that one's only good if you don't mind violence, etc.

The unpleasant thing is part of the conflict of the story.

******* Obviously, but "fight against magical fascism" is a rather detached subject. I mean, I'm German, we had basically nothing but Hitler during history lessons, I had a Grandfather who served, and yet it is not a subject I have a connection to. But infidelity isn't just some distant "good vs evil" struggle, it is something that happens all the time.

But what really makes this story bad is that Bill does not deserve what Fleur is doing to him. He is not some Death Eater who ought to be put in front of the nearest ditch and shot, but since this isn't an option let's at least fuck his girl. He does not mistreat Fleur. At the very worst he neglects her due to his work.

******** The beauty of this situation is in the conflict... yes from an ethnic 3rd person their actions are wrong and there is a lingering guilt that both characters display but that's the point. You as a reader are given an insight into the character's perspectives which muddies the ethical decisions that characters end up making. To borrow a quote from George R R Martin this is a situation where we can see "the human heart in conflict with itself". Its not easy reading but it is powerful storytelling that forces you to see the shades of grey.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

*** Ron crotch rubbing was pretty hilarious to picture, but besides that it didn't really feel very well written.

What's the point of including all this side filler? Why does Harry know about Snape and his mother early on, why bother mentioning it? I don't care about or want to hear from Seamus, Dean, Neville, George, or Lavender etc.

Fleur and Hermione also feel super out of character. Yeah I get that you do need to make Fleur OOC to make her attracted to a freaking middle schooler, but it didn't even feel like the character was Fleur. Instead it was just some French veela that's into Harry.

I think a good contrast to this story is linkffn(8848598)

Allure Immune Harry is slightly longer at 8k, but despite that still feels more focused. I think it's a good depiction of an OOC Fleur whose attraction to Harry makes /some/ sense, and best of it all it still feels like she's the same character.

Similar to Drool, this story has comedy as well as some Harry Hermione interaction. In both cases I think Allure Immune Harry does it better, with the humour flowing into the story rather than being sort of jarring and awkward sounding.

Still, Drool is far from terrible and the Harry/Fleur ship needs to take whatever it can get.
