Bonus if its psrt of the story, with funny/silly/cute interactions, and not just a "mentioned once then never again" prefer longer fics, and prefer a straight Harry,

It's not really integral to the story at all, but the retrieval process gets a good chapter-or-so dedicated to it and is well thought out.

LinkFFN(12125771)

Probably more of what you're looking for, even if it is a crossover fic. Harry is lead to a Phoenix reserve and bonds with a youngling that keeps getting into silly scenarios.

LinkFFN(11634921)

Probably the crack-iest story ever written. Tired of being used by Hari (because it's a Naruto crossover so, of course, his name has to be spelt differently ðŸ˜’) as a taxi service, Fawkes sets him up with a chick of his own that is pretty much completely useless and causes him no end of grief.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
