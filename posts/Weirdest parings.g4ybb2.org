For me it's Neville/Bellatrix no time travel no mind control or anything like that

** Hermione/Troll.

Don't read it. A few people who tried were left traumatized.

*** I feel like Hermione/Fang would be worse. Thank god for the flexibility of Ao3 tags so that you don't have to look further than the "relationship" field to avoid shit like that.

Or "Hermione/Dumbledore's Army" with the description saying that Umbridge forces the DA to rape Hermione as group punishment.

** erm, I think the -weirdest- one I ever stumbled on was... hmm... probably either Luna x Whomping Willow, or maybe Fawkes x Slytherin's Basilisk...\\
but staying away from creature pairings I feel like there's a few contenders for "pfffff, yeah like that's gonna happen without the imperius curse or a full AU rewrite so canon doesn't matter" and Neville/Bellatrix is certainly up there, alongside every DE/Hermione pairing (sorry Dramione lovers, I simple can't possibly agree that there's so much as a snowball's chance in fiendfyre that would happen with their canon history, no matter how he may or may not change in the post-hogwarts years, and don't even get me started on Snape/Hermione and how */horrifyingly disgusting/* even the idea of that is... and yes it creeps me out worse than hermione and the troll)
