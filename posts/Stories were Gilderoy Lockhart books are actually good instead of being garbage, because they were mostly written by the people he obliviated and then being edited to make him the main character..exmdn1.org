I imagine that he mind controlled the person who actually did the stuff in his books into writeing them. So the reader has to just sift out all the extra bullshit Lockhart added.

Like I remeber one were ever after It was found out he was a Fraud Molly kept useing his book on household pests because the information in them is actaully useful.

I feel like a lot of people Forget that the stuff in Lockharts books actaully happened its just that Lockhart wasn't the one to do them.

**** You are right of course! But also most people aren't good writers. And there is something to be said for a good and entertaining narrative for the success.

Take even the HP books themselves - I've always treated them as sort of retelling of true life events that have been adjusted to tell a good story rather than just describe sequence of events. That's my way of dealing with all the plot holes, oft silly actions and inconsistencies in the books.

** This is actually something I just thought about after reading another fic where the books are discovered to be "basically fiction" written by a fraud. In canon, Lockhart finds people who have done amazing things, interviews them for their story, and then wipes their memories so he can take credit and write stories about what "he" did. That means that the stories should be factual and their core.

I think that a lot of people get caught up on the Homorphus charm story and the fanon of the books being "basically fiction" and forget that, like you said, the book on household pests was actually very useful to Molly. The problem with Lockhart wasn't his books, it was that he didn't have any sort of experience to back them up.

I have seen interpretations that handle the Homorphus charm by making it a real spell that ends a werewolf transformation prematurely but that werewolves build up a rapid resistance to, making that story no longer seem like a fabrication.

I'm my opinion/headcanon, any straight up useful book like the household pests book was written by someone else that Lockhart stole and memory charmed the author to forget before they published it. His other books are somewhat sensationalized and heavily constructed with a novel like narrative that details Lockharts "adventure" rather than a textbook like description of how to handle a banshee for example. The facts are there, buried in the narrative, but overall not very useful to try to dig for the helpful facts, especially with a teacher that can't actually do any of the useful things. Lastly, I think the best explanation for Wanderings with Werewolves is that the real hero didn't like Lockhart and spun a tale of complete bullshit, and Lockhart, not having the actual skills and experience to realize, bought the whole tale, memory charmed the hero, and wrote a book about how he wrestled a werewolf and turned it back to a human with a spell that doesn't exist.

*** I think Lockart changed some things in the story he stole, because they would have been "boring" otherwise.\\
So some event like "I was just nearby when the monster attacked, so I did the sensible thing and came to give an hand" became "I was traveling the world, in search of a new quest, when a poor wizard approached me into a lonely bar in the mountain, and, knowing my reputation, begged me to free his village from the terrible monster that was haunting the land. Listening only to my courage, I of course, agreed to help, and start to travel toward this village, in the hope to find here a monster worthy of I, Gilderoy Lockart."

He probably invented the Homorphus charm because in reality, the wizard he stole the story from probably did something really less impressive like barricading himself in a house, waiting for the Auror, or somehow managing to detain the werewolf with a some ropes or whatever.

**** Another explanation for the Homorphus charm is that the person Lockhart obliviated invented it, and this was their first successful casting of the charm. Then Lockhart obliviated the knowledge of how to cast it from the person, and it was lost forever.

**** Well now here's something to think about: in one of his books there's a spell that can (supposedly) revert a werewolf back into a Human. If that's true, and such a spell really does exist, what are it's limitations? Is it a permanent cure for lycanthropy, or would it be something that needs to be cast every month, in a similar vein to the Wolfsbane Potion?

***** I just addressed this with an explanation in my main response.

In one fic I read, the charm is real, but werewolves build up a resistance to it quickly, where it stops lasting until the end of the full moon after only a few uses, as well as making their next transformation more painful.

I think that it's a good enough explanation that maintains the canon fact that Lockhart was stealing people's stories rather than making things up.

Other canon compliant explanations are that Lockhart found a hero that could tell he was a fraud and spun a bullshit tale of what had happened just for the fun of seeing Lockhart nod his head and act like he totally understood what the person was doing, only for them to end up memory charmed and their "true story" stolen by Lockhart. Another explanation is that Lockhart was always trying to find these heroes that weren't already well known enough that he couldn't take credit for their actions. Perhaps the reason no one heard of the Waga Waga werewolf hunter is that they were a compulsive tale spinner at some pub constantly throwing out stories of their amazing exploits and Lockhart wasn't able to realize that the story had flaws.

With any explanation for the homorphus charm in wanderings with werewolves. It doesn't change the fact that Lockhart admits to stealing real heroes stories, and that some of his books are proven useful by people, which implies that if Wanderings is fictional, that not everything is.

** I'm suddenly reminded of a story I saw some years ago where Lockhart recovers enough to be able to leave St. Mungo's, but never gets his memories back, but decides that since he's clearly such an incredible person, based on his books, that he needs to get back into shape, and spends years training to be just as good a monster hunter as his books portray him to be.
