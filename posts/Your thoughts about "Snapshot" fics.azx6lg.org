Writing a story spanning seven years just to show the occasional minor divergence (eg Harry spends more time with X, Harry has brown hair, Harry owns a cat instead of Hedwig) feels inappropriate and would end up rehashing canon way too much since those changes should not alter the main plot all too much.

So what are your thoughts about stories which show the changes in a series of snapshots instead of repeating the entire series, but once in a while Ginny/Fleur/Luna makes an appearance?


** I think that if it can truly be summed up in nothing but a series of snapshots, it's probably not worth it and the writer should just start from where the story really starts and use ordinary exposition to reveal changes from canon. Readers have to learn entire new characters every time they start a work of original fiction, they can handle a few differences.

If the changes are involved enough, I'm fine with a very fast-paced narrative for the first few years. linkffn(The Long Game by inwardtransience) covers up to year 4 in 20 chapters, with second year only taking 5 chapters, and I think it works well enough. I've also read stories which covered entire years in 20k word chapters.

I'm realizing now that this will depend on what you're defining a â€˜snapshot' as. I was thinking of drabble-like 100-word scenes, but if you mean something more along the lines of a short scene fully exploring a single event, that would be totally fine.

In general, though, I think writers in the fandom underuse traditional exposition. If the changes are largely based around relationships with just a few people, they can likely be revealed in a single conversation.

Say you want a "Harry spends more time with X" scenario. You can obviously summerise it with "Harry looked at X with whom he has been spending a lot of time over the years" and then do the last scene as a traditional oneshot. But if you want to give more depth to the "build-up" than just its conclusion, that would not work that well.

**** I'm thinking less of revealing the events which would have happened over that time and more revealing how relationship dynamics would have changed. Instead of saying that Harry spent more time with X, have him talk with X as if they were good friends. Have them share personal info that they wouldn't be comfortable sharing if they weren't close friends. In general, trust the reader to use their imagination to flesh out the relationship just as writers trust readers to flesh out physical descriptions.

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

** I'm generally not very interested in "missing moments" fics since they imply nothing changed in canon. A series of connected snapshots can do better - provided there are changes which matter. If Harry's cat munches Ron's rat in the train, then I expect that to significantly change the story. Or, if Harry has a cat, I would expect Ron to lock up Scabbers as a result, bypassing the whole Crookshanks row and derailing most of third year.

*** Obviously that would result in bigger changes. But if you simply fleshed out the Harry/Ginny relationship after they get together, that will not change a lot in DH other than Harry missing her more. If you write some more friendship moments with Luna but keep it platonic, it won't change much of the later plot either.

** Not a bad idea, it's certainly easier than a continuous epic. Should also allow you to bypass some writer's block.

If inspirations return, you can go back filling those missing moments.

Well, the whole thing is supposed to be a missing moments filler. The non-included parts would simply be too similar to canon and could be summarised with "everything happens as it did in canon, Harry just hung out with X on Friday 20th."
