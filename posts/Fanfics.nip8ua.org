Hey ya'll! So i've seen a lot of fanfiction.net in which Harry is friends with Deatheaters and they love him and all. And fics with an exasperated Snape who's tired of Harry's bullshit (in good humor ofc). Fics in which the Deatheaters are frank with Tom Riddle and stuff so if ya'll have any recommendations that y'all could give that would be great!


** Wait, shouldn't this be "request" rather than "recommendation"?
