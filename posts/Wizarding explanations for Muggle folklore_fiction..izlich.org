Recently, I've been reading the books again, and I've noticed a few things available in the Wizarding World that could fit /really/ neatly into Muggle folklore. I thought it'd be interesting to compile a list of things that Muggles might have picked up on and worked into their folklore, and to add to that list collaboratively.

To start:

- Shakespeare must have had some potions knowledge. The potion Juliet takes to appear dead sounds eerily like Draught of Living Death, and love potions feature heavily in Midsummer Night's Dream - in fact, it wouldn't surprise me if Shakespeare had extensive knowledge of the Wizarding World.
- Father Christmas, Sinterklaas, and other holiday characters whose theme is "enters house via chimney" would have been wizards testing early versions of the Floo (before it was restricted to a specific network, or trying various ways of "breaking out of" said network). The holiday stuff is a cover-up for Muggle children if the wizard in question isn't good at Obliviating them.
- Knowledge of magical creatures was hidden too late for them to be erased from folklore entirely - hence, Muggle fantasy novels and mythology featuring them.
- The image of the Grim Reaper could be what happens when a Muggle sees a Dementor, but embellishes the story heavily and lets it mutate.

Any more you could think of, corrections to make, or just comments? Feel free to share them. Also would love to see a fanfic that explores all of this in-universe.

*** I think "Boggart" was just a generic term for anything scary and unexplained. There are many different conflicting stories about them, which vary widely between the places they come from. It is fitting then that Boggarts are shapeshifters. Trolls fulfilled a similar role in some areas, which is why there are so many different versions of them.

** Someone wrote a blog on just this topic, actually. It's called the Monster Blog of Monsters. It kind of comes at it from the opposite side (Magical versions of real world myth) but it's similar enough I think it's appropriate to recommend. :)

EDIT - Just to check my understanding, you're looking for Wizard things that've popped up in Muggle mythology and folklore? Wizard rides broomstick, Muggle sees Wizard, Muggle creates story about Witches on Brooms?

*** Basically yes, but also less-obvious examples where the actual phenomenon might have gotten "twisted" a bit (see: Dementors â†’ Grim Reaper). Also thanks for the blog link, I'll check it out.

**** Ah, okay, cool. Thank you for the clarification.

Well, there's the obvious answers like the Philosopher's Stone, Alchemy, and the general spellcasting idea (Avada Kedavra = Abracadabra, etc).

Then there's the controversial answers of Gods and Miracles being real wizards that were seen.

There's also a kind of Japanese spirit that possesses tools (tsukogami) that could either be Poltergeists fucking about or something similar to what happened to the Ford Anglia. Practical items for doing things gaining magical abilities to do for themselves, I guess.

Horcruxes could appear in 'tempter' stories like the Baital Pachisi. Basic gist, a Wise Man promises a wizard that he'll capture a Baital (basically a vampire-ish ghost that can possess people - sound familiar?) and ends up making a deal with the thing to play a game. If he can't answer a riddle (genuinely can't - if he pretends, then the spirit explodes) then the spirit will go with him. They put a nice ending to it where the spirit reveals it's actually a prince and the wizard wants to do terrible things to him, so the Wise Man helps him and they end up being allies. Be interesting if the real story had the Baital talking to the Wise Man long enough to possess him like the Diary did to Ginny. Hell, the biggest mythic tale in Egyptian Mythology has Osiris being killed then ritually brought back to life.

Egyptians also believed in words of power in both verbal (incantation) and written (fanon Ancient Runes) form.

There are a lot of tribal stories about animal shifters that could be Animagi.

But there's also some historical possibilities. For example, the Bronze Age Collapse. Basically, the Great Civilizations that were around the Eastern end of the Mediterranean fell mysteriously and we weren't sure why until we found out about them being raided by the Sea People, a ragtag group of weirdly dressed people with no discernible origin that seemed to tear through the locals with incredible ease. General history concludes that the Civilizations were already facing famines, earthquakes, internal strife, and other shit that weakened them before they were attacked by people who could counter their military strategies, but it would be interesting if the Sea People were magicals creating those effects to chase away the locals.

** What's interesting to me is that muggle folklore might have access to knowledge that wizards have lost, or at least is not in the Hogwarts library. Like how Voldemort, supposedly one of the most learned wizards, takes the whole year to figure out that you can put a Cerberus to sleep with music, while a muggle book about Greek mythology would have given him the answer.

This is a good justification for bringing whatever you want from folklore into Harry Potter fanfiction!

*** Fun fact, Cerberus is spelled something along the lines of "Kerberos" in the original Greek, which translates to "Spotted".

Hades named his giant three-headed guard dog "Spot". Hades was the Greek Hagrid, confirmed.
