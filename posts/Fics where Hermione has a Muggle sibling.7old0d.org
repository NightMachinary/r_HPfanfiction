Since we know from Lily/Petunia that some children of Muggle parents develop magical powers while others don't, I'm curious to see what it would look like if Hermione had a brother or sister who was in a similar situation.


** Funny thing, Rowling once intended for Hermione to have a nonmagical younger sister, but then she didn't find a narratively place for her and eventually cut her out.

*EDIT:* I found it mentioned by JKR [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0304-wbd.htm][here]]:

  I always planned that Hermione would have a younger sister but she's never made an appearance and somehow it feels like it might be too late now.

**** to be fair the only "appearance" she could have is in DH when she says she obliviates her parents, she could say she obliviates her parents and her sister. lol.

** I'm exhausted by HP canon rehashes (and Hogwarts setting fics) and more stories from a squib or muggle sibling POV would be great.

*** I'm sick of rehashes, too - which is why I prefer reading post-Hogwarts fics. Hopefully, the story in question would focus on Hermione's sibling rather than on Hermione.
