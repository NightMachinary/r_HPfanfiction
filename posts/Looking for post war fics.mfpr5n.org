I want something either post war or during late Hogwarts years where Harry has nightmares about the things he's been through. How does he cope with the pain and anger of loss and the feeling of not being able to help all those who died fighting for him? Is he an alcoholic, or does he abuse drugs or potions? Does he avoid public outings and live in seclusion? That kinda thing


** All things considered, Harry came out pretty much intact after DH. No one truly close was lost, he didn't even take part in much of the violence while sneaking around. Dobby and the Lupins are the only grief inducing loses he had.

Linkffn(What We Lost) Is a rare pair romance but takes a rather unique and realistic view on the state of Wizarding Britain based on real world history. Complete.

*** Yes I love this story so much! It is part of what caused what I'm looking for. There's a scene where they are in Malfoy Manor towards the beginning and he can hear the faint echo of Hermione's screams as Bellatrix tortures her. Also the Harry/Draco family relationship is one of the best I've ever scene. Harry teasing Draco by calling him nephew is perfect

*** As for your comment of him not really losing much, the thing that I don't think many readers understand is that a lot of what happens in the books between the important parts are glossed over and summarized, but Harry obviously lived through it all. Not only did the Remus and Tonks where close to Harry yes, but he lost people he had seen literally every day for the whole of his Hogwarts life. The worst of which was Fred, who he saw as a brother. He saw him at the Burrows or Grimmauld during the summers, spent multiple times each week with him at Quidditch practices. Then there's Lavender Brown, who he saw every day in every class for 6 years. I'm sure he spent a little bit more time with her when Ron was dating her too. Colin Creevey also died during the battle of Hogwarts. He might've started out as a nuisance with his Hero worship and his photography but I'm sure he grew on Harry during the 5 years the went to school together. And that's just the one I can think of. I'm sure there were tons more that died, people Harry had known for years. Imagine if you were in school and a terrorist group killed a bunch of the people you had known for years, wouldn't you have nightmares and problems afterwards?

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

*** Thanks for replying to me! Unfortunately I'm not one for Drarry or Harry/Lucius, Harry/Snape or other similar pairings. They don't feel right for my idea of Harry. Same with Hermione/those characters. But thank you for the recommendation anyways!

**** My fic isn't quite as bleak as what you might be looking for, but it's a long WIP about post-war Harry, and his mental baggage definitely comes up.

***** I kinda half read your comment right before going to sleep and then clicked on the story. When you said my story I honestly thought you meant the story that you're recommending, not that you were the actual author. Secondly I didn't realize how long the damn story was!!! I read the first chapter and I love the story so far! You're writing style is magnificent and you make the characters, especially Harry actually feel and seem alive. I'm looking forward to reading the rest! Thanks for the recommendation!

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

  Eleven-year-old Scorpius starts writing to Harry. Harry starts to fall in love with Draco through his portrayal in his son's letters. Featuring an extremely remorseful Draco living with muggles and working at a second-hand book shop, an isolated Harry, and a Scorpius who's dreading going to Hogwarts because he knows he'll be bullied there.
