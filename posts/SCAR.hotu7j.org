*** This fic breaks Rule 8. You may tell the OP what the story is and where to find it, but you may not provide a direct link to it.

**** Wait. I'm confused. There's not any sex in this fic. It is M for themes I think.

** There's a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10280808/33/Little-Whinging-Pet-Shop][one-shot]] where the scar covers /half/ of Harry's face, but that's due to Dudley experimenting with applying H2SO4 to it (childhood ignorance/innocence/cruelty).

Sadly, the one-shot stops at the Sorting.
