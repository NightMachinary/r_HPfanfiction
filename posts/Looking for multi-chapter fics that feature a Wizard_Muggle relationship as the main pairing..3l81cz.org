I just finished reading HP Widdershins by Didodikali and I really enjoyed the pairing of Hermione/Dudley in it. I'd really like to read more fanfictions that are about a magical person and a muggle in a relationship like this... Anyone have any recs?


** Here is a really good fic that's still being written, but the author updates regularly.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss is a fun read, and it's from the point of view of the muggle (Adele Polkiss) who has a crush on Harry throughout the story.

Expecto Patronum! is another good one, well, I say good but I never finished reading it. The relationship in this one is Aquila Black (Regulus's daughter) and Dudley.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Pendant of Slytherin)

If you get past the first couple chapters,its a pretty great story. Takes awhile to pickup the pace, but it's worth it.

Edit: I messed up the name.

  6/7th year fic. Harry decides he wants to do things his way, because Dumbledore's method of defeating Voldemort just doesn't appeal. He finds friends in unexpected places and embarks on a method of defeat in which he sometimes holds little hope. H/OFC.
