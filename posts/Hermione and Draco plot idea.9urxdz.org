** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5843449/chapters/13467880]] its abandoned now but it goes through all of 6th year and into DH. Such an amazing story.

** Just a heads up, a pretty large portion of this subreddit hates Hermione/Draco, so you might find yourself with a fair few downvotes. You may have more luck on [[/r/Dramione][r/Dramione]]

I utterly despise the pairing, but OPs idea is one of the few ways I can see it pulled off without turing everyone OOC (assuming a PS or early CoS divergence).

**** That was my first thought too. The thing I hate most about this pairing or any other DE pairing is you'd have to rewrite the character in order for me to see it work, because it would never work in canon

** Coulda sworn this fic was already completed but looks like the author is going back and editing chapters, but this one is a secret friendship starting from first year linkffn(11679490)

This one is a post war secret friendship and pretty good writing linkffn(11354116)

And I have to mention my all time favorite secret relationship fic Revert linkffn(12125463) and of course Clean linkffn(11720199) and it's sequel Marked linkffn(11878656) which are more sixth year/war focused

** Oh! oh! After The Battle linkffn(12131414) is a perfect example of this! Not only does is succinctly go through the years of their relationship, but has a great reveal scene(s) from multiple pov's!

Good luck to you in your writing!

** For Romeo & Juliet themed dramione, try:

Show and Tell, by nevernik

I can't exactly recommend it, as I've never read it, but dramioneasks has it tagged as R&J. I honestly expected them to have quite a few but it seems to be relatively unmined country.

** Now, it is no secret that I have a higher opinion of a stranger's bowel movements than of Malfoy.

Your idea is one of few ways I can see a Hermione and Draco relationship actually happen IF the Mudblood and Buckbeak incidents do NOT happen.

The ideal approach here would be for Draco to question things after his first year. If Muggleborns are inferior, why is the top student Muggleborn? Why was the Dark Lord defeated by either a Muggleborn or a Halfblood? So he asks his mother, who points out that it is just a lot of BS, quoting her niece (Tonks) as an example. Halfblood and yet the only known metamorph.

So Malfoy thinks some more and decides to keep an eye out during the next year. He watches Hermione in class, gets a list of the books she checks out in the library and so on. Throughout his stalker episode, he realises that Hermione is not nearly as bad as he imagined. Still an annoying know-it-all, but not magical trash as his father insists.

At the end of the year, he talks to his mother again, who is only glad to nudge her son away from militant pureblood supremacy. Maybe she introduces him to the Tonks, or takes him to Heathrow, just anything to prove that you don't need a pure lineage to achieve something in life.

At some point, Draco tentatively reaches out to Hermione, they strike a truce. They talk in the library, become friends, yadda yadda. At some point, Hermione tells Harry, who is more than a little confused and remains sceptical for quite some time but does not throw a tantrum.

It would be important to show some of the old Malfoy as well, the easiest option here would be a feud with the Weasleys. Maybe even go for some Marauder age parallel where Hermione ends up defending Malfoy when the twins cross the line with a prank or something like that (just without the Mudblood part).

*** The character you describe is definitely not Draco Malfoy. Why write a Draco Malfoy who would never exist like that? It would be more honest to pair Hermione with an OC to keep her in character.

**** Agreed. I'll probably never understand why someone invents an OC and then gives them the name of a canon character. It makes the story incredible.

****** I only said that OCs should be named accordingly. Of course, you're free to write about a florist in Kings Cross Station who's in love with Mrs Figg, but please don't call him Tom Riddle, or even Voldemort.

It bores me to death when the main idea for a fic consists of turning canon characters into their opposites.

******* I was told by this sub that Draco is "redeemed" in canon despite never really coming across as such or facing the consequences of his actions. And frankly, I find any postwar story with him in unbelievable (he belongs into prison for war crimes, using unforgivables and treason for one), so I thought about finding a way in which you could take canon Draco (first year in this case) and write a story in which he is slowly steered away from pureblood supremacy. But if you are willing to argue that he is irredeemably evil, well, I won't argue against that.

******** Draco fought for his Dark Lord till the very end, he tried to capture Harry for him during the Battle of Hogwarts and reassured a Death Eater that he's on his side. This doesn't sound like a redeeming story to me.

However, I'm not surprised that Draco's is considered a redeemable. Nowadays criminals and rapists are being pitied while their victims are mocked and laughed at. So that fits very well.

**** Exactly why is it unbelievable that Malfoy, at the age of 11, could be changed? I'm not suggesting that he'd declare his undying love for everything Muggle, but it would not be unbelievable that he could be steered away from his father with enough backhand tactics.

***** One of Malfoy's main features is his cowardice, it would make it impossible for him to break away from his father. His complete worldview is based on the protection of his father. Malfoy would never give up this protection. He'd never been seen without his cronies, who'd use their fists to protect him. He'd lose this protection if he would turn against his father.

Don't get me wrong, of course, you are free to write what you want.

****** Again, I'm not saying that he should be open about it. That's why, in my proposal, he'd act like a stalker. And even after getting a truce with Hermione, he'd want to keep things secret, afraid of the consequences. When Hermione tells Harry, he is scared shitless. When he begins to develop feelings for Hermione, he is scared, scared of his father, but even more scared of himself. He should not be doing this, should not feel that way.

(Perhaps ironically that Hermione, his kryptonite, would be the one to eventually break him out of his shell).

Also, Draco is a coward with a sense of self preservation. The Basilisk could be used to break his father's hold (he unleaded that while I was in Hogwarts?), or the Sirius episode (this is how Death Eaters are treated? They have to endure THESE MONSTERS?)
