Hello, I'm searching for a .pdf of a beautiful watercolour comic called The Death of Narcissa Black, which was pretty well-known in its day (I'm an old veteran from the days of Cassie Claire). I'm well and truly out of fandom at this point but remember being deeply touched by this work when I read it years ago, and would love a copy to revisit. If anyone has one, please post here or drop me a line!


** Amazingly, we talking about [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5qftic/name_a_memorable_fic_youve_read_that_has_now_been/][just that sort of thing]] yesterday...
