It could be after Ron comes back, before he leaves, or even about Harry just thinking about him while he's gone. I just really want a fic about them in the tent lol.


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12967862/1/Not-needed-the-aftermath]]) is good. I don't recommend the original, it's a Ron bash.

  I recently read something that almost had me spontaneously combust with rage and this pretty much wrote itself. The original story is "Not needed" by Romantic Silence; sorry for hijacking your story... but not really.
