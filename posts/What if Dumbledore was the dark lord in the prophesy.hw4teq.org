The fight between Dumbledore and Voldemort is not between good and evil, but between two dark lords over who will have control.

Trelawney's first prophesy is a warning to Dumbledore about the boy who would defeat him.

Dumbledore is in denial about being a dark lord and so does not realize this.

Snape is an abusive, controlling jerk who gets his due.

McGonagall learns that the Nuremberg Defense doesn't work.

I would love to see a fanfiction on these lines. No slash. I am ambivalent about protraying Ron and Molly negatively but no over the top bashing. Ginny may or may not end up with Harry romantically, but she should get fair treatment, by the later books she is a popular girl and well liked after all. Ideally this doesn't include Harry secretly hating Ron and/or Hermione and it all suddenly coming to the surface overnight. something either more tramatic or more gradual is more believable if you are going to use them as minions.


** Every time I read any fic, I always think the same, because although his actions are not bad in himself, he created two dark magicians and with Harry I almost created the third, I have always thought that Dumbledore is a supporter of blood purity even if moderate, for he does not concern himself with matters of Muggle knowledge, besides that he has done little with his political power, only to maintain the status quo.

** Something like bobmin's /Healing Harry/ but in real time not as as an almost time travel flashback. [[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Healing_Harry/Healing_Harry/]]

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?

**** this is close, but Dumbledore is revealed and Voldemort defeated really early. I was thinking of something where Dumbledore would be trying to use Harry against Voldemort, only for Harry to realize that both must go. Harry's actions to free himself would defeat Dumbledore in a way that clears the barriers for someone else to handle Voldemort.
