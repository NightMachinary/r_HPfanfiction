I just finished "Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness", which I thought was absolutely fantastic. I also recently finished "The Snape Chronicles". What I loved about both is to seeing that there is so much more that was going on than what Harry was privy to, and exploring how it wasn't just Harry's quest, but that these events affected the entire Wizarding World.

I'm really looking for something similar to these fics in depth and detail, but concerning members in the Order of the Pheonix, preferably starting from the end of Book 4 and continuing to Book 7. I'm especially interested in what exactly the Order was up to in Book 5. I'm willing to follow any Order member (though Lupin, Tonks, or one of the Weasley's are who I originally had in mind). Any suggestions?

** It's likely abandoned, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4774670/1/Socks][Socks]] by Deadwoodpecker is excellent, if a dark AU. 33k words, WIP.

** Did you read the sequels to Dubledore's Army and the Year of Darkness? They are also excellent although the second sequel is abandoned I think
