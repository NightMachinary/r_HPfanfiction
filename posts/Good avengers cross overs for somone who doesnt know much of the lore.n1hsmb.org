I know enough that I've watched a few of the movies, such as infinity war, endgame, spiderman, doctor strange etc but I don't get or remeber much of the lore. any sort of "introductory" fics would be welcome ((:


** These are the ones that I know of, but there may be spoilers in them for MCU movies you haven't seen (I don't recall well enough to say what spoils what).

Holly Potter is probably the easiest introduction to the MCU, while Heroes Assemble is a bit more traditional.

Froze to the Marrow: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1648501]]

Holly Potter and the Midlife Crisis: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17946929/chapters/42383930]]

Heroes Assemble: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13054713/chapters/29859897]]

I hope something in here suits your fancy.

** Despite what others might have said, the actual best MCU cross was Morta Priests linkffn(Wand and Shield), though sadly unfinished.

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.

**** ATPF is definitely one for the long haul. Even at this stage, the author thinks there's a year or so worth of updates remaining. Don't feel intimidated by the chapter sizes. Its really well written and since updates a relatively slow (I mean, 50k words every 1-2 months (guesstimate based on what I remember) is pretty good) they'res plenty of time to read it before the next chapter comes out.

** I read Finding Home before I watched a single solitairy movie - my knowledge of marvel came from the 90s cartoons and so not actually relevant to the MCU.

Honestly, I've read a /lot/ of crossovers where I had no idea wtf was going on with the other fandom, and was usually fine from context. Just sort by favourites/kudos or whatever and give it a shot.
