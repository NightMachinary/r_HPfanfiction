Hey, I'm looking for some stories where Harry is mentored by Dumbledore. I've read 'By the Divining Light' and Conlaodh's Song'. Any Het pairing or even no pairing is fine with me.

Edit: I'm looking for super Harry where he's mentored by anyone that's 'realistic' now.


** It appears to be abandoned but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magics-of-the-Arcane]] is my favorite.

** Not [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766604/1/What-We-re-Fighting-For][that]]. Definitely not that. It might just meet your requirements and it is at the very least a story. A story written by robots, but one where Dumbledore intervenes a very long time before he does in the books.

The books are all about Harry mentored by Dumbledore, but, yeah.

** It's honestly been awhile since I read it, so I'm fuzzy on the particulars, but the first thing that popped into my head when I read your request was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5953863/1/A-Patrol-Changes-Everything]]

*** Ah, I've already read this story, I'm thinking along the lines of super Harry, I suppose I could expand my request to be Harry mentored by anyone that's 'realistic' If you get my meaning.
