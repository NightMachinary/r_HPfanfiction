I wrote "CLOSEST TO CHARACTERS" because Hermione is somehow ALWAYS out of character and end up being a whiny mary sue and I DON'T WANT THAT.

A want to read *COMPLETED* Dramione fics in where they don't fall for each other right away, in the first chapters. In where *they truly hate each other* but can't help feel the attraction between them and so they start to have *hate sex* but with time they fall in love (slow-burn in the love aspect).

- Completed fics only
- Yes of course smut
- Strong and confident Hermione.
- More than 15 chapters (+30kwords)
- Them being in their twenties or thirties.
- Draco getting jealous at some point but *CUTE jealous* not alpha-macho-violent jealous more like: /wait, what is this weird flip flop happening in my heart. No I'm not jealous I don't even like her. Wait why Am I mad?/
- Him getting the redemption arc he deserves.
- HEA.
- NO R*PE

THANK YOU. üëê
