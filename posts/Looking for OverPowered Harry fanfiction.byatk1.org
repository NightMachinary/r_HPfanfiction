I mean super op, he can be dark or light and the house doesn't really matter. It can be slash or no slash and have no pairing at all. I would prefer the story be finished or in progress but I'll read an abandoned story so long as it's long enough.


** Multiverse lnkffn(7390178) is absolutely hilarious, it's a story where Harry works for God Inc. If you're looking for one where Harry's just stupidly powerful for no other reason than he's Harry Potter try Honour Thy Blood linkffn(12155794), Harry Potter and the Summer of Change linkffn(2567419) or maybe Earl of the North linkffn(2208427)

Edit: also realised most of these are pretty popular so the chance you've read them before is probably pretty high

** Have you read linkffn(4068153)?

It might be the most OP Harry that I've read--almost to the point where he's not even really Harry anymore--and it is complete with a sequel.

But it's also pretty popular so you very well may have read it before.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** I liked this fic for the most part but I felt a lot of stressful dread for Harry's situation by the end of the story.

I mean he acted like everything was hunky-Dory time to get on with life and it seemed the author made him seem way too much of a sociopath without meaning too.

But still I loved the story for how it began and happy that the author saw fit to finish it.

***** By the end of the story iirc Harry was looking into the hallows forcing these changes along having a small idea what he was doing to himself but had zero issue for his well-being nor for those around him.

He has a one track mind on this account and when he realized what it meant for him, he didn't even address the major issue of it. It's like he gave a big fat whatever. /Hermione won't care that when she's old and wrinkly I'll be the same young looking person I am today and I feel nothing in particular about having to see her grow old and die in the future./

*To me* it seems he changed from someone who was caring and considerate in the first 3/4ths of the story to someone who was desensitized by everything going on around him but what he was focused on.

Not a sociopath but seemingly something of sociopathic behavior. At least this is what I took away from the finale of the story.
