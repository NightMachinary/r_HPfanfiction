Maybe he continues the DA after Umbridge leaves, and he invites the Slytherins, or maybe something else happens.

I don't want: All Slytherins are bad guys, but I also don't want all Slytherins are secretly good either plot line. I want there to be grey characters and the like.

I just would like Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin houses to be more united. Even if it's not all of them, for instance, not Malfoy or Parkinson or such. It'd be more believable if it wasn't all of them. Would be nice for the younger and older years as well.

Though Malfoy and Parkinson can join as well, though it depends on how it's done.

For pairings (If any) Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual, et cetra.

Harry smarter and/or stronger then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be because he worked for it, for it to be believable.

No Weasley Bashings. Can be as Canon or as AU as possible. Can be on ANY site, Can be oneshots/drabbles/multichapters.

Maybe him hanging out with people in other houses makes it harder for The Daily Prophet to discredit him, because people know him better.
