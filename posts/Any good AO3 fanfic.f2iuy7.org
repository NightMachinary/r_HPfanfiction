Basically I've spent all my reading time on FF. net, tried searching through AO3 and just found a mountain of m!preg and slash.

Shouldn't need to be said but just in case, no m!preg or slash please.


** Have you tried filtering tags OUT? That's one of the main reasons why I like Ao3. The flexibility with searching makes it far easier to find something suitable to what I want.

*** The main problem i have with A03 isn't even with the site itself its the fact that like on FF.net people will just not tag their story properly.

I have had M/M filtered out and have had stories still trickle in with Harry/Draco as the untagged main pairing. Same thing happens when i remove draco as a character

**** Ao3 also imports stories from ancient fan fiction sites, and I've noticed that some of those imports come through without tags... so while there are certainly authors dropping the ball, it's also coming from however they're importing crap.

Authors not tagging fan fiction properly has been a problem for a long, long time and it's not gonna stop any time soon. Goes back to the days when people were posting on forums and blogs and using headers and they weren't even called 'tags,' haha.

I guess I could complain, but... you get what you pay for, and fan fiction is free.

I liked Triple Trouble, but not sure when it'll be updated.

  Dumbledore would regret the decision to hand over the school letters to the house elves, even if it did save him hours in admin. Eleven year old Harry Potter was expected... Tom Riddle and Gellert Grindelwald... yeah, not so much. However that might turn out to be the least of the school's problems.

  If Harry Potter could alter the past, he isn't sure what he'd change, but he knows he'd change something. If Severus Snape could hold history in his hands, he knows exactly what shape he would mold it into. Albus Dumbledore might flatter himself enough to think he would walk away from such power. But Delphi Riddle isn't here to serve any of them. (Rating for some really prolific cursing and very little else.)

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** Yeah I know what you mean. The fics I am linking are some of the best I have read here. Even though they are marked slash there has not been any romance yet or it is at the very end.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410]] The Second String. I think the pairing starts after chapter 35 can't recall exactly.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]] Face Death in the Hope. It has not happened yet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12402654/chapters/28221378]] Men of War. Has not happened yet except for Grindleward trying to seduce Harry
