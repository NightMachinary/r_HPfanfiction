Where Harry Potter meets a god at some point, maybe when he's getting a second chance at life or something. Except when he meets this godly being he doesn't give a shit when it tries to shame him for poor study habits. Alternatively, the god doesn't mention it at all. My gripe with gods in stories is that they care way too much about study habits, and Harry is always so ashamed when it's mentioned. I get that maybe death makes one rethink their life a bit, but I enjoy the Harry character that would think "Well I could of done better, but oh well" and move on.

See, that's /exactly/ what the gods are talking about. You need to study more.

But seriously, if a literal god complained about my study habits and gave me a 2nd chance, I'd sure as shit do my best in my next lifetime.

Either way, I think you're mostly referring to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6dtmll/archive_dont_fear_the_reaper_challenge_by/]['Don't fear the reaper'-challenge by reptilia28]]. Most of these are pretty similar and I don't know any stories in that challenge that /don't/ mention study habits, since it's mainly a 'mate you failed'-challenge, and thus there are things that Harry did wrongly - not studying enough is obviously one of them.

Ah, so /that's/ who I blame for all those samey fics where Death berates Harry for not bonding with his soulmate or failing to claim his five lordships.

**** Most of the fics I read reference the challenge in the author's notes. However I mostly skim those as well, so I get how you can miss that.

The soulmate is part of the challenge, the lordships aren't -- IIRC. If Hermione is referred to as "Some Granger Girl" it's this fic 100%.

*** I do have a problem with grammar while typing on my phone. I suppose I haven't read those. The ones I've read haven't given the impression of failed ambition. Mostly it's just seems to be pointlessly added. There has also been quite a few that mention how his parents would he dissapointed in him. It's not even like he did terribly, he got average grades with a couple good ones. Some parents would probably be disappointed in a 3.00 GPA. However, I can't get over that it seems to be such an insignificant aspect of life. Again, I haven't read those, and the stories I have with this involved never go to the aspect of why he failed and the danger of his failure.

**** From a certain perspective, school should be Harry's main goal, and while some parents would be content with an average performance, I do not think that Harry's parents would approve of that.

They both were teacher's favorites and seemed to place value on their magical prowess, and I'd expect especially Lily to require some performance of him.

This doesn't mean that they wouldn't be proud outside of that, but I disagree: Education is an important part of Harry's life that Lily and James seemingly value.

I do agree however that these stories do have the wrong focus, but the question for education probably isn't the main problem with them.

** Most people probably don't study hard because they don't think it matters overmuch and they'd rather have fun.

If A GOD told me to study I'd sure as fuck know what I'd be spending the next considerable length of time on though. It kind of implies there might be a little bit of a point to it no?

*** I suppose I'm not the right person to ask. I don't believe in them in the first place and feel that if one did tell me to study more, I may take the advice but not something to change my life over. Like don't be lazy but that's considerably insignificant. I probably wouldn't believe there would be a point to it unless told the point. That's my problem I guess. I do what I do and none of it is immoral so who cares? Laziness? That's my own problem, not something for someone else to be bothered by unless it affects them.

*** Agreed. 1) I don't want to get smote. 2) Too much is at stake to just laze about being worthless. The reset would need to be earlier in his school years, preferably, though, so no one (/cough/evil/bumbling/master manipulator Dumbledore/cough/) gets suspicious at his new-found scholastic fervor ("He's possessed by Voldemort's soul sliver! I've got to kill him!").
