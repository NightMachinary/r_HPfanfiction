Just dont want to read about Harry himself. I've read a lot of si's before so looking for anything new. Asking for pure/halfblood so it'll focus more on the magic stuff. I'd prefer it if they come from a long line of magic users because it'd be fun if they can interact with their (great) grandparent and stuff and learn about older magic and tradition from them since Wizards live longer.

I'd prefer the protagonist to not basically tag along with the golden trio. Would prefer female protagonist but male protagonist is fine too. And yes I've read whats her name in Hufflepuff (although she's muggleborn in it).
