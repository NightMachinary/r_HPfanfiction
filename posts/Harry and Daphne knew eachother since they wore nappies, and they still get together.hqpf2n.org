** That sounds incestuous, honestly. Kids who live together from a really young age don't really get romantic feelings for each other.

**** Just being friends with someone is not the same as living with them and thus falls out of the scope of the Westermarck effect.

***** I'm not OP but I know that and it is still possible for romantic feelings to occur between people who've known each other since they were babies. Just like it's possible for two friends to be nothing more than friends.

****** Not if they live together [[https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Westermarck_effect]]

** This prompt takes the appeal from Daphne as a character. If they knew each other since you were young. She would no longer be seen as a "forbidden" love interest.
