  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

It's a one shot of around 25k words, but the interactions between Ginny and Harry are heartbreaking. A film would definitely tug at the heart strings, as long as the acting was up to par. Probably my favourite charactization of Ginny I've read.

  A mysterious illness leaving a handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

** Seventh Hocrux would be bloody hilarious to see on the big screen, especially how Hermione could be viewed as someone who (by accident) is more "evil" than Voldemort ever was.

Thanks,

Warryn.

** Trying to remember he exact name, but it's a canon compliant fic detailing Neville's experience during seventh year in Hogwarts. Very well written, and could have been its own book.

I think it's called Year of Darkness?

*** Ah yes, the story written by a cult leader who preys on vulnerable people. Some people don't deserve credits or attention, this guy is one of them. That's beside the fact that the story itself is, like [[/u/dehue]] said, awful.

*** Isn't that the one that's often criticized because of OOC characters, and excessive violence powerwank type stuff? I believe the author even turned out to be crazy in real life and deleted his fic at some point.

I remember that it started out okay, but it turned into this over the top dark fic that seemed more like torture porn than one that values a thought out plot and storyline. I also did not like how the author portrays Snape as an entirely evil character who has no motivations beyond trying to torture or kill the main characters. I am fairly sure it's canon that he sent Neville, Luna and Ginny into the forest for detention because he wanted them to avoid a punishment from the carrows, not so they could be eaten and viciously killed by the werewolves. And he did take his promise to Dumbledore to protect students seriously, even if he did end up failing on that somewhat. Although I don't believe anyone died so maybe he did not do that bad of a job.

It has been a while since I read the fic though so maybe I don't remember the details clearly. I just know that I stopped reading it after a while due to the characterizations and plot driving me crazy.
