I read this a few years ago and really really want to read it again. I think it was on Fanfiction.net but I can't find it anymore and really hope it's up somewhere else. In the story, Luna and Ginny are room mates and are in uni. Harry and Ginny are dating but through POVs, we can see that Harry and Luna are drawn to each other. Luna is an avid painter and Harry buys a self-portrait of hers and hangs it in his bedroom. Out of loyalty to Ginny, the two of them don't act on their feelings. Then some stuff happens that I don't remember. Then they all go dancing in a club where Luna and Harry dance with each other. This doesn't go unnoticed by Ginny who then discusses this with Hermione and someone else in the club's bathroom. Luna overhears this and leaves the club, upset. Then some more stuff happens that I don't remember. One day, Hermione texts Harry to get some flowers for an event/cooking and Harry goes to the farmer's market to get them. Here he sees Luna and they go back to her place and cook and end up sleeping together. Next morning, Harry receives a letter from Ginny and intends to go meet her to break things off and writes a note to Luna saying so. However, he accidentally wrote it on the back of Ginny's letter and Luna wakes up and reads Ginny's letter. She avoids Harry believing he chose Ginny over her. After a while, they run into each other in a cafe/pub and finally sort things out. I think the story also jumps back and forth in time.

Sorry for the long and incoherent summary of the story. I have searched for the fic for so long now. It really was lovely.
