Magic is conceptual, if he kills Lily, whatever method Voldemort tries to use to kill Harry is thwarted, even a hammer.

Now if Lily is the wand to turn her wand on Harry, not only is there no sacrifice to protect Harry, but the last semblance of risk that the intent of sacrifice would serve to protect Harry is gone.

** Voldemort ensures he wins. And then, thousands of years later in his reign, he dies somehow... and wakes up with Lily in-front of him, begging for her and her son's lives.
