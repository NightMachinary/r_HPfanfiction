Killing and torturing people, constantly hearing about it in the newspaper, people randomly disappearing, students getting caught in the cross fire, et cetra. I understand that Rowling couldn't get too hard core in the series, since it was still for teenagers, even when Harry and his friends got older, but I was always disappointed by the Death Eaters.

It doesn't have to be all of these, just something.

Bonus Points for a more cunning and scary Voldemort as well. You always hear them unable to say his name, actually have it be reasonable for the fear in the second war.

As for pairings no Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, otherwise I'm fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

*Would rather have it be completed, but if updated constantly that's fine. If it's not complete and you feel it's that good, feel free to recommend it.*

*Would rather not have Manipulative Dumbledore or Weasley's, or Dark Lord Harry Potter.*


** Surprisingly enough, I've been reading Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce on AO3, and it actually does this a quite well. It's the Gordon Ramsey becomes Potions Professor in year 6, and in between the cooking, it does a fantastic job of elevating the wartime tension, people getting attacked, and paying real attention to the effect of war on the student population.

The later books in this series have a ton of very gruesome and horrifying things done by Death Eaters/Voldemort.

One memorable example:

"The Death Eaters took dozens of Muggleborn children from their homes, and, most unusually, did not kill their families. It was believed they did this as part of their strategy, to encourage desperate hope and anticipation, and even to encourage their families to withdraw from the war. Of course, when the news of the Children's Massacre came a few days later, all thoughts of strategy vanished in a tide of overwhelming grief.

"The Death Eaters raised crosses from the ground near Ottery St. Catchpole, and crucified the Muggleborn children upon them. They used spells that heightened the pain of the nails being driven through their wrists and ankles, and other spells to make sure that they stayed alive throughout it and did not die from the shock. Finally, they set a ward around the crosses in one of the rare examples of Dark wizards cooperating during You-Know-Who's War. The ward took hours to knock down when the Light wizards and the Aurors finally reached it. When it finally fell, lines of lightning lashed from it and struck every child dead before they could be rescued. The emotional destruction of many families was complete, and far fewer Muggleborns remained in the war; instead, they applied for sanctuary from the Aurors and Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, and retreated into hiding."

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  In the wake of the Dark Lord's triumph over Harry Potter, the defeated must learn their new place. Hermione Granger, former Golden Girl, has been captured and reduced to human chattel. Sold to the highest bidder as the top prize at an auction of Order members and sympathizers, she is thrust into the rabid, waiting hands of the Death Eaters. But despite the horrors of Voldemort's new world, help---and hope---seem to arise from the most unlikely of places.PART 3 of the RIGHTS AND WRONGS series.
