Looking for well written Harry/Ginny, and Ron/Hermione stories, any other pairing is fine.

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Any other pairing is fine Het/Slash/Femmeslash just as long as it has Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione.


** I'm in the process of writing one now. 9 chapters and 70,000-ish words in, updating as often as I can crank new chapters out. There will be a few other minor pairings, but H/G and R/Hr are the main focus.

*** This is great! One of the more realistic explorations of the immediate post-war era that I've read so far. I've always had the opinion that Harry and Ginny would reunite rather quickly, and intimately like you've shown. I think dying, and nearly dying, would create an urgent need to feel alive. Anyway, loving the fic and can't wait for the next update! I'll have to join the site so I can get emails.

***** I'm almost finished with your other fic on the site, Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood. It is another gem of a fic. The characters are believable, it's not too predictable, the evil is truly evil, and the OCs are engaging. I was super sad with what happened with two of the characters so that's how I know I'm enjoying the story! I have a few more chapters left but I wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed it before I forgot to leave a message.

****** The site admins are looking into how their software implements chapter update notifications. Just want to make sure they don't wreck themselves if they turn it on.

In the meantime, Chapter 11 is up.
