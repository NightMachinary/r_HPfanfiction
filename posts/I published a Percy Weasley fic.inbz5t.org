I posted on here about an idea I had that was Percy Weasley centric

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13688864/1/Invisible-Bruises]]

I hope you guys like it!

Summary: Au. Set in the summer before HBP. Percy Weasley is eager to move on with his life and become the extraordinary person he knows he's meant to be. Too bad he didn't know that sometimes our deepest desires are the most dangerous.

As I said when I posted before, this wont have any Weasley bashing. They may seem nasty at times but I'm trying to be realistic about how they would react

I cant say anymore about it because I dont wanna spoil it lol


** that's a very good fic, and a nicely written take on percy.

It's an AU of Percy's betrayal and why he believed the Ministry over Harry.
