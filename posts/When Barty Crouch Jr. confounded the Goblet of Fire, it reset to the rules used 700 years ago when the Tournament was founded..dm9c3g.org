In this when Barty Crouch Jr. confounded the Goblet of Fire to add Harry as a Fourth Champion. The Goblet was 'reset' to the rules of the first Tournament 700 years ago. Which removes the safeguards placed by the Ministry of Magic and makes the tournament the dangerous contest it was before.

In this case, the Goblet of Fire itself chooses and provides the Tasks for the Tournament instead of the Ministry or the Schools. Meaning their is no way to cheat or game the tasks to guarantee a win by Barty or the other Champions.

It officially becomes a battle for survival and a true test for each champion. As the Goblet has been misused in the last Tournaments and has reverted to the impartial judge that it is and the magics that restrained it unbound after 7 centuries, it can no longer be affected or changed by outside forces and doesn't go out until the tournament is finished and a winner decided by it.

*Note:* Personally, for the First Task I would have the Goblet provide something like the "Pandemonium" event from the Grand Magic Games arc of Fairy Tail or something like that that would really be a challenge for the champions and really be a test. Plus, the fact that they can't prepare for what's coming due to the now unbound Goblet providing the Tasks and acting as the Judge.

*OR*

Someone could go with JK Rowlings original plan and have the Goblet provide four tasks, each representing the classical four elements of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. (Rowling had to partially scrap it due to not being able to conceive a task for all four and Air and Fire were finally combined in the form of the dragons, with the lake representing Water and the maze representing Earth. This could be used as the format for the original Triwizard Tournament rules and tasks that the Goblet has reverted to.

What do you all think?


** “How this situation arose, we do not know,” said Dumbledore, speaking to everyone gathered in the room. “It is however completely unacceptable, and we must immediately get to the bottom of it.”

With that, Hagrid burst into the room, holding the still flaming wooden cup. He looked a nervous wreck, and cast a reproachful look at Harry.

“Thank you, Hagrid- put it on the table, please.” Dumbledore gestured to a small wooden table nestled between two plush chairs.

“I think a thorough inspection of the cup is necessary. Surely, we can at least get an idea as to why this has happened.”

Karkaroff snorted in disgust and made no move towards the goblet. Mad-Eye Moody's magical eye did not leave his face.

However- Madame Maxime, though still looking extremely suspicious, at least entertained the thought of inspecting the goblet.

“Do you think it is possible- what Moody has said?” She glanced towards the auror. “Zat ze cup has been confounded?”

“I am not sure,” Dumbledore responded solemnly. “It would be difficult to confound an ancient magical object, but if someone had the knowledge- perhaps it is possible. Would you assist me in inspecting it?”

Madame Maxime pulled her wand out of her sleeve. It was a beautiful, intricately carved piece of what Harry had guessed was mahogany. He had never seen a wand made with such detailed carvings.

The two Heads approached the cup, muttering spells under their breath, brows furrowed in concentration. It was at last silent in the room as everyone seemed to hold their breath in anticipation of what they were going to find. Karkaroff inched forward, clearly wanting to be able to make claim that Durmstrang also had a hand in making any discoveries, although he did not pull his wand.

Harry saw Moody's magical eye was still trained on his back.

After what seemed like ages, Madame Maxime let out a gasp, and a look of fear flashed across her face. She made eye contact with Dumbledore, whose face quickly mirrored her alarm.

“Zis- zis is /impossible/!” she cried out.

“What's happened?!” Karkaroff demanded immediately.

“It seems as though the Goblet of Fire has... reverted back to its original magical state.”

“But what does that mean, Dumbledore?” Said Ludo Bagman excitedly. “It's always been a powerful magical object.”

“It was once,” Professor McGonagall said, clutching her hand to her chest. “More powerful, was it not?”

Dumbledore bowed his head. “The tournament has evolved over the years, in order to make the safety of our students a priority- but the layers of magical protections and limitations that have been placed on it by the ministry seem to have been removed.”

Mad-Eye Moody's lurched forward and his regular eye dilated with an uncharacteristic fear and desperation.

“Sorry,” Cedric said, nervously. He was still standing near the fire, out of the midst of the chaos. “I don't understand exactly what that means, professor.”

“It means,” said Professor Dumbledore. “That each of you whose names were drawn absolutely must compete. This is no longer a contest for glory. It is a battle for survival.”

There was a stunned silence in the room.

“The Triwizard Tournament is out of our hands now. The cup itself controls the tasks and the judgements.”

“Surely- surely there is a way out of the tournament!” McGonagall cried. “They can't possibly compete in such an archaic-“

“They can, and they must. It's part of the rules of the Triwizard Tournament.” Barty Crouch spoke up, at last. “They have no choice in the matter. And whether he put his own name in or not, Potter is now part of the tournament and must also compete as a champion, or suffer the consequences of attempting- and failing- to pull out of the contest.”

“Outrageous! Unacceptable!” Shouted McGonagall, as the room erupted into chaos once more, everyone shouting over each other with increasing desperation.

Harry's stomach twisted in a vicious knot. The words that he'd heard in the Great Hall earlier were echoing in his head.

/The death toll had mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued./

Harry made eye contact with Cedric, who opened his mouth to say something to him, when a change in light flashed across the room.

The flames of the cup, for the fifth time that night, turned a bright, electrifying blue and spat out a piece of parchment. This time, no one made to grab it. Everyone merely watched, as if in a trance, as it slowly drifted onto the carpeted floor. Harry made out a nondescript, but extremely elegant, handwriting on the paper. It did not appear to be another name.

Dumbledore pulled himself from his reverie and picked up the piece of parchment.

“The first task,” he announced, his words dry. “Is titled /Fear/”

*** Very nice, I hope you consider writing a full fic for this prompt.

As I mentioned to a few others and have discussed with one poster, who I agree with, is to have the Goblet have some sort of magical intelligence (similar to how the Sorting Hat was created)

The Goblet could be the combined creation of the 3 schools Headmasters/Headmistresses of the time of the original Triwizard Tournament and used the Sorting Hat as inspiration in creating the Goblet's magical intelligence imparting onto it knowledge of the rules of the tournament, the ability to create and provide the Tasks for the Tournament, as well as giving it the ability to choose the school champions and judge the tasks impartially.

Here is an example: [[https://st4.depositphotos.com/9449108/28026/i/1600/depositphotos_280265436-stock-photo-furious-elemental-woman-fury-spills.jpg][Blue Fire Woman Elemental]]

The intelligence could have an avatar within the fire that comes from the Goblet like a fiery woman with the combined features of the Goblet's creators or something.

*** If it's okay with you I would love to use this and write something with it. I have one story ahead of this I am working on right now. When that is done I would love to build off the Fear task with this prompt.

Thoughts are the goblet created the first boggarts to begin with. After the riddickulus spell was created Dementors were created next time Fear was chosen as a task. Part of the reason the goblets magic was bound was due to how dangerous it was across the board.

That's why Dementors are only in Britian, it's where the Goblet made them. Now that the Patronus spell has been made.

Yes, Fear would be an excellent task.

Edit: The fourth tournament had a final task more dangerous than any other as all three participants had made it to the end of the school year. The event was labeled Extinction.

A Death Curse was set loose. Defeat the curse or see everyone die most horrible deaths.

The Champion that year had the solution named after them. Alphard Black converted the Death Curse into a Plague which was named in his honor.

** "Oh, good lord," Dumbledore muttered, tracing his wand along the burnished ridges of the Goblet. "That isn't good."

"What isn't good?" Harry practically growled, a terrible mixture of fear and frustration rushing through his veins.

Dumbledore turned to him, eyes flicking towards the ground - cautious.

Karkaroff crossed his arms. "What is it, Dumbledore? Has the boy cheated?"

"I..."

Albus paused, lips pursed and a plaintive look on his face. "No, Harry has not cheated."

"Then what?" Maxine interrupted.

"Someone indeed has tampered with the Goblet. It is... it has reverted, somehow, back to how it once originally functioned."

Harry screwed his eyes shut, trying to ignore the banging drum of his heart; pounding in his ears like a war march. "Headmaster, what does that /mean?"/

"It means that whatever tasks the Ministry has planned are now defunct. The Goblet decides everything."

A chorus of gasps rang out across the room, echoing eerily within the candlelit room. The occupants stood still a moment, the only sound left being the low, rumbling murmur of the hundreds of excited students sitting impatiently within the Great Hall.

"What?"

Dumbledore swallowed, straightening his glasses with trembling fingers. "The Goblet will decide the tasks, and will judge you thr-" He blinked, glancing at Harry. /"Four,/ how it sees fit."

Fleur raised her hand. "It is an inanimate object, yes? How is that possible?"

"Ancient magic," Snape explained, with no amount of spite in his voice - Harry noted. "From the Golden Era of Magic."

Karkaroff let out a snort. "Did you plan this, Albus?"

Fury in his eyes, Dumbledore span about. "How /dare/ you, Igor!" he thundered. "Do you not understand what this means?"

"It means our students are as good as dead."

Harry shrank back, staring at the floor.

It was happening again. /Again./

"Oh no."

"Very succinct, Mister Potter."

"Piss off, Snape."

"Excuse me?"

Harry glared at him. "I said /piss off./ I'm not Hermione, but I don't have to be to know that this is serious. More serious than anything I've seen my last few years." He sighed, directing his attention toward Dumbledore. "Am I right?"

"Yes, you're correct."

"There's nothing we can do about it?"

"I- "

Albus let out a long, drawn out breath, his shoulders slumped. "No. There is nothing we can do."

Harry clenched his hand into a fist - could feel his fingernails digging into the skin of his palm. "Oh."

** Everytimes I see the Goblet choosing it's a corrupted vile piece of rubbish. making extra dangerous tasks and the only reasons it was "safe" was because past schools made new rules to diminish it's malevolence.

I would like to see the contrary of this with a nice goblet wanting some entertainment without bloodbath but past people forced it to be bloodthirsty adding more dangerous creatures and rules and removing "uninteresting" tasks.

*** Umm you do realize that would would negate why they stopped the Tournament in the first place. If it wasn't dangerous than they wouldn't have stopped it.

Besides, this was a tournament and object made in the 13th century, the time of Genghis Khan, the Crusades, Empires are born and fall, etc. It was a time in history where tests were likely to challenge people in ways that were extremely dangerous.

Add in the fact that Wizards tend to lean toward the more dangerous side in their contests than is it any wonder the past Triwizard Tournaments had a death toll. I mean even the "safe" tournament had them pitted against Dragons. I imagine back in the day when there was less safety rules in place the tasks danger levels were bumped up considerably.

Plus, when you consider the word "Champion"" in a medieval sense of the world when the goblet was created, than contests that truly tested the champions were to be expected. Think of it like the tales of the quests mentioned in Arthurian Literature by the Knights of the Round Table. Each quest taken by the knight challenges them in some way. Perceval, the Story of the Grail is a good example of such a quest, The Lancelot-Grail, also known as the Vulgate Cycle is also a good one.

**** Wouldn't negate it, actually would make more sense - wizards make the goblet to pick the tasks, it creates solvable, challenging, non life threatening tasks. Fast forward a few tournaments, people are getting bored of the tournament, so one of the headmasters starts tinkering with the goblet to make things a little more interesting (deadly). This trend continues as time goes on, every few tournaments someone decides to add some charms to make things more deadly, until the goblet can no longer generate tasks due to a series of overlapping, contradictory enchantments, so the organizers start writing them instead. Lo and behold, you get an insane death tally racking up extremely quickly as the organizers come up with tasks that are horrifically lethal, leading to the cancelling of the tournament altogether.

***** Not really, a task can be difficult and extremely challenging (even life-threatening depending on the individual) without being impossible to overcome. You have to think about the tasks made by the Goblet from a medieval perspective not a modern one. Even tournaments where regular real life Knights participated in jousts and melees had a high possibility of being fatal.

The Goblet was from the 13th century a time where a lot of tasks and challenges were potentially life-threatening but still doable. You seem determined to ignore this fact to fit in with modern sensibilities.

Plus, your dealing with an object that is impartial and analytical in it's judgement of what tasks to challenge people with using a medieval mindset to do so. So yes it would be highly likely would mean that their would be risk of mortal peril involved.

If you want to do it your way I would go the opposite route, have more spells to bind the Goblet not less to do as you want.

Otherwise, your views don't make sense from both the view we get of Wizards historically (in-universe) and actually historical evidence that suggests that a lot of the contests and tasks back when the Goblet was made and created were even more dangerous than our modern world due to it's harshness.

******* Few problems with those ideas, Godric wasn't around 700 years ago but 1000 years ago and died in the 11th century. The 1st Triwizard Tournament happened in the 13th century. Madame Maxime was likely one of the few half-giants to ever gain a title like Headmistress due to anti-giant sentiments so it's likely that the Head of Beaubatons at the time was human or if they did have mixed heritage it wasn't as blatantly noticeable. Durmstrang likely is the same.
