As the title states, if you've read any crossover fanfiction, which movie/book/anime... do you think is most interesting and works best with the Potterverse? Personally, I'm a big fan of crossovers with Fullmetal Alchemist. Both stories tackle war, loss and discrimination, but their approaches are fundamentally different. Most importantly in who's point of view the stories are written from. Harry Potter looks at violent conflicts effects from the eyes of civilians, while they make the choice to be more active in the fight against Voldemort, they are no organised force, they are not soldiers but defenders. FMA meanwhile, despite the fact it's two main characters are strictly opposed to murder, is a lot more focused on the point of view of the military, the state and the people working within it.

I always find that this makes a really interesting clash of ideologies. Despite similar initial circumstances, the characters in FMA are a lot more jaded, since the war really only starts in the sixth and seventh books in Harry Potter, while it's shadow is constant in hounding the pasts of FMA characters. I think FMA crossovers also allow for a lot more exploration of the adult characters in the potterverse, seeing as many of the secondary protagonists in FMA are adults and are thus more likely to interact with them honestly instead of the unreliable narration provided to us through Harry in the books.

Basically I really like FMA/Harry Potter crossovers and wanted to talk about how great they are, what are your favourite potterverse crossovers?


** If one is assuming the two things exist in the same universe, there are plenty of things that can work really nicely with the Potteverse. /Bedknobs and Broomsticks/, several Roald Dahl books, /Wizards of Waverly Place/, to name a few. There is of course potential in bringing some "muggle" stories too, such as any iteration of /Sherlock Holmes/.

When it comes to dimension-travelling, a /lot/ fo things can work. /Star Wars/, /Lord of the Rings/ or /Fullmetal Alchemists/ may be obvious ones, but there are /plenty/ more.

** Root of Darkness is a pretty good Naruto/HP crossover. It's 38 chapters long and it's still being updated. Although the HP part comes in chapter 32. It's also fairly well-made gamer fic.

**** - Definitely read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12447494/1/Sherlock-Holmes-and-the-Adventure-of-the-Seventh-Safeguard][Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Seventh Safeguard]] by Charlotte Ann Kent if you're into well written mystery type of stories with a magical twist.

Basically, BBC Sherlock Holmes and John Watson (both are completely muggle) helped the trio find the horcruxes from the Deathly Hallows in a Conan Doyle detective style story.

Don't let the first person POV style derail you from reading the story. This is one of the rare stories that was actually written like an art form. When I say it's like a Conan Doyle book, I really meant it. The suspense and mystery is all there from John's relatable, yet insightful, perspective.

- This one is a crossover series with the MCU' verse where the story is centered around Luna Lovegood. The series is extremely underrated. I just needed to at least attempt to spread it considering I absolutely adore the writing. It's like looking at a painting except with words.

A really basic non spoiler(ish) summary: It starts off with a young, four year old Luna encounter with Loki. Afterwards tragedy strikes, and she ended up with some truly dreadful people. She then goes through the process to become the next â€˜Widow'. In a typical Luna fashion, she does not break.

The Under the Moon series starts off with a chronological series of one shots or two shots that eventually turns into a multi chaptered fic. This series is written by MerciaLachesis or on Ao3, Mercia. Here are the links to both sites.

  Loki, de-aged and lost, wakes up in England. Well, he didn't know it was England, or maybe it was Scotland, he couldn't be sure since all he had to go on was a forest, a lake, a castle, a slightly cloudy sky and basically no knowledge of Midgard country names to go on but there was definitely something odd about the place. He could be imagining it in his slightly concussed and confused mind but somehow he didn't think owls carrying mail and children wearing robes were very common place not to mention the magic sticks.

** I personally like lots of Crossovers, but for same universe stories, I like Hp/Buffy Stories as both deal with young people barely in to their teens fending off a hidden darkness that most of us wouldn't know about all due to a quirk in the way of the world declaring them the subject of a prophecy. They have to deal with the destined one unintentional pulling their innocent friends into the darkness that surrounds them. I wish more stories focused on the idea of young heroes banding together against the darkness that haunts them, rather than the surprise family, wake up married storyline.

  It is said that as long Alessia's heirs bear the Amulet of Kings, then Tamriel shall be protected from Oblivion and the Empire will be prosperous. But the Amulet has been shattered, and an eternal barrier has been placed between Mundus and Oblivion. But even as an Emperor sits on it, the Ruby Throne waits for its true heirs to return. (Skyrim timeline; pre-GoF; AU and Timeline)

  He's not the Boy-Who-Lived. He's not the Chosen One. He's not even a hero. Quite the opposite in fact. He's a being of such terrible greatness that at one point, those who were hated as devils and worshiped as deities, saw fit to seal him away. Now he's back and he wants his throne. Let Order reign...

** I truly think that the Marvel universe is well suited to incorporate the HP universe with close to no open seams.

The MU has several organisations using magic, and the necessary level of power to defeat wizards in great numbers. Just Dr. Strange alone would be a sure way to keep the wizards in check.

*** But why are you thinking about keeping wizards in check especially large groups of them unless you are nerfing wizards. You gotta give the wizards teeth if you expect them to carry weight in a crossover

**** Because wizards are incredibly overpowered if you let them unleash what HP magic is capable of. Teleportation, Mind-Control, Memory-Altering, Instant-Death-Ray,... are just a few things that make any capable wizard and witch a serious threat to almost all players in the Marvel Universe.

Thats the part where most crossovers with HP fall apart. HP magic users are /so unbelievably powerful/ compared to most franchises' magic users that you often end up with characters either stomping through, or being artificially nerfed.

In an HP/MU crossover, I assume that there are organisations keeping an eye on them, and especially on such characters as Grindelwald, Voldemort, Bellatrix or also Dumbledore or Mad-Eye. That means that there are counter-measures in place if a fight breaks loose. In that case the MU has quite a few characters that can go against one of these powerful wizards or witches with good chances of winning, and the MU has some entities that would flat out destroy them, like Dr.Strange, as I already said.

Thats why I think these universes fit so well together. Wizards and witches can be as overpowered as the HP universe suggests, while not being the most powerful entity in it. Even potentially weaker characters, like Black Widow or Hawkeye are intelligent enough to outsmart the sheer power of a wizard. In summary: There is still challenge to be had. Fights and conflicts don't have pre-determined outcomes and the simple existence of characters like the Ancient One give a good explanation as to why wizards never ended up ruling Earth.

***** Yes, but if Fiendfyre is can roast a horcrux then a giant stands no chance, especially since it is self sustaining.

Alternatively a few muggleborns can simply Apparate to Easter Europe/Russia and use their gold to buy anti tank weapons. If something can punch through over twenty inches of steel, then a little magically resistant skin will be no problem.

** Do you have any recommendations for FMA crossovers? I liked The Colours of the World a lot, but most of the others I've tried reading ranged from bad to ok.

I think Reborn is a good option for a HP crossover. If you keep canon strength levels the characters are probably too OP though, but it has its own magiclike system that could interact with HP magic in interesting ways, and has a good mix of colorful protagonists and villains to work with. I've read several I've liked, though most don't update frequently/ever.

I also think a Pokemon crossover could be interesting, I've only come across one I like though.

Some other fandom that don't seem to common for crossovers but I think could be good are Doctor Strange, Attack on Titan, RWBY, and BNHA.

Buffy also works pretty well, while there are a number of them, I'm surprised there aren't more well known/better ones.
