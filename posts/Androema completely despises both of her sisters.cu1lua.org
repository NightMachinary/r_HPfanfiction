Kinda sick of the Black Sisters loyalty stuff


** I kinda agree.

Seriously, Narcissa was a bigot in canon, who lied because of her son. Does that make Petunia a good person if she would protect her son?

***** She had a reason! A petty, petty reason born from jealously that literally drove her to technically disown her sister, but nonetheless a reason no doubt

****** By that same definition, Hitler had a reason too.

It's just not a very good one.

******* Not getting into art school vs being treated as the unfavourite because your witch sister is perfect. I think Petunia's reason is better than Hitler's.

******** I don't know... I mean Petunia was jealous because she lacked the ability to do magic. Hitler actually had the ability to create art.

Seriously, I view Petunia and Snape in canon as being two sides of the same jealous coin.

********* Yeah I agree. Petunia was a bitter woman but Hitler was much worse. Being forced to take your nephew in or face being killed is not a pleasnt thought.

It's like being the black sheep of your family, going no contact and starting a new life, then having to raise your nephew because your sister got killed and being forced to everybody you know and love will die.

Petunia was a bitter bitch but even when she tried to distance herself she couldn't win.

** There is this idea in this fandom that pure or true love is reason enough for redemption. It isn't, but it is still seen lie this by much and I suspect JKR as well
