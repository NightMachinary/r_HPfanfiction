I'll just leave it at the title, make of it what you will...

*** And quite disturbing considering that CoS has the trio aged 12/13.

You could repurpose the Chamber later on, but given that the entrance is rather complicated (underground maze after a pipe to slide down), there are a lot of better places to choose from. If you want a pun with the name, the Shrieking Shack/Shag would be the first choice.
