I have absolutely no idea why this fic popped up in my head again, but now it's there, and I need to find it to stop thinking about it. All I can remember about it was that Harry leaves the wizarding world, travels to like muggle new york or something, and starts designing lingerie using magic or something like that. He has his own clothing line, an assistant, and I think eventually Daphne helps him as well.


** I don't think I've ever even thought of something like this, and it sounds terrible.

But I hope you find this, and I kinda wanna read it too.

** Blind, red rage filled Harry. Nothing Malfoy had said, nothing he had done before could compare to this outrage, this obscenity. He raised his wand. He was almost just a listener to the words.... as though they were being spoken by another.

/"Sectumsemp....."/

"Potter," said Malfoy, calmly, "I know all about Eulalie".

***** If it takes a man ten minutes to strip me of my fancy lingerie, I'd be on the floor laughing my lungs out long before the ten minutes have passed. Assuming, at least, that I'd wear lingerie for ten minutes at a time because I'd be dressing up for a beau.

Yup, that'd be the assumption, it's sure not much good for anything else.

******* Oh, I've worn it to job interviews sometimes. Ehm, underneath my daily clothes that is. It was supposed to be a subconscious boost but it didn't work. Practice and lots of preparation was what got me jobs first and foremost.

**** Thank you ValerianCandy. It's all those things. And I don't like it because my mother used to buy them when I was a teenager and forced me to wear them for her as part of her abuses. It was always something I hated, and was uncomfortable and upsetting. I guess that's why I still hate lingerie and never wear it as an adult.

Oh boy, that sentence conjured a lot of horrible scenarios. I don't know anything about you or what happened between you and your mother but I wish you all the confidence and the strength in the world to deal with any resulting issues.

****** Thank you. I've dealt with a lot of the issues since then, but there are others that I'm still dealing with. Like irrational lingerie hatred. Or that I can't trust other women, which is bad for me because I'm gay.

******* Yes that definitely makes things more complicated. Does it become easier for a woman to win your trust over time? Or are you stuck in the not-quite-friends-but-I don't-expect-a-knife-between-my-ribs-either stage?

And if my nosiness makes you comfortable, I'll stop asking questions :)

******** I think I'm always stuck in the knife stage. The only other woman I interact with on a daily basis is my sister. Strangers and store workers and stuff all make me jumpy. I mostly avoid and ignore them, except when I can't and I get very anxious. You don't have to stop asking me questions. I don't mind questions, and I don't mind talking about any of it. My mother has been in prison since I was fourteen, and it's like Harry Potter said, "Fear of saying something is fear of the thing itself." And I'm not going to be afraid of her still by being afraid to talk about what she did and how she affected me now. Plus in general I think it's bad to not talk about stuff. Especially abuse stuff. Don't people always say that's why abusers keep getting away with it, because the victims never want to talk about it?
