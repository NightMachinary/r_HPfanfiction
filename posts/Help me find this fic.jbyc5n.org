The fic had the ministry trying to appease Voldemort by slowly reducing rights of Mugglebornes, Hermione notices similarities between that and the Holocaust and forms a resistance movement with other Mugglebornes. Their first act is blowing up Malfoy Manor

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
