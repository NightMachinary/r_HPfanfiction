They have to be at least 40k+ words if they're complete. If they're a WIP then they have to be at least 20k+, and not abandoned. No on-shots, no PWP. Slash ships are preferable, but I would be okay with Harry/Ginny or Harry/Luna, too. And god forbid, no Harems, although reasonable Polyamory is fine. I prefer no bashing, but I can deal with it. No Dark!Harry though, meaning no Harry/Voldemort or some shit like that. I don't necessarily mind if the “Dark” side is good and the “Light” side is bad, though, that I can deal with. Just no Evil Harry lol. Please don't rec me any poor quality fics---as someone who is at school to be an editor/publisher, I just can't stand to read them. They don't have to be amazing, but at least decent quality. Last but not least, no crossovers (expect maybe for Avengers, but I have a whole other post for those fics you can leave the link on if you don't mind). Oh! Bonus points if Neville is the supposed boy-who-lived, and is still in-character. That's certainly not necessary though. Thanks to anyone who leaves a rec, sorry for the crazy specifications lmao.

Edit: I always forget to include this part, but no genderswap fics, please. It's fine if the swap is for a minor character, but other than that, I just can't do it.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

** I started reading an unfinished 50+ chapter story on AO3 many years ago that was canon up until the Goblet of Fire where Harry dies and Cedric is the one who lives- The author then extrapolates on what would have happened in that situation. Diggory, Helga, and the Hufflepuffs eventually lead the school in a rebellion against Umbridge that I remember being super badass and unexpected. I think he and Hermione had a thing too, but it didn't feel forced at all.

(If anyone can find that fic for me, I would be eternally grateful.)

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

*** So I'm on the second installment in this series now, and I'm wondering at what the main paring is going to be---I have a feeling it will be Harry/Ginny since the author is cautiously introducing small Ginny POV scenes. But that's just my theory. Do you know what the end pairing for Harry is?

**** Hey, glad you enjoyed it! It's actually gen for a while, but this particular author seems to love writing romantic potential in a few characters.

Harry does go to the Yule Ball with Daphne, but last time I checked whoever is endgame is still a secret.

** Linkffn(2900438)Unsung Hero: super long, good twist, my fav of the genre

​

Linkffn(11191235)Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin: working my way through this and I'm liking it a lot. Suuuuper long

​

Linkffn(5353809)Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived: it's decent

​

Linkffn(7539627)The Warlock of Slytherin: it's been awhile since I read this so I can't remember if it's good

​

Linkffn(2964792)And Still Can't Stop Hoping: when you wanna feel sad

​

There's also Harry going to an AU where Neville is the BWL but I wasn't sure if those count.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
