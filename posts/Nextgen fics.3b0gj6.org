Looking for some good Nextgen fics, preferably multi-chapter but one-shots are okay too. Romance, family, adventure, anything is fine!


** I just posted a good variety [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3an5ot/great_fics_from_hpff_primarily_oneshots_minor/][here]]! HPFF has probably the largest concentration of active next gen authors. Most people who look for next gen here want something close to canon, but if you don't mind ones starring OCs or have less to do with the world, I can add more recs.

Here are some more:

The [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=144658][Stygian Trilogy]] by Slide that's also posted on ffnet. /A mysterious illness leaving a handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world [...]/

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=329915][The Fred Weasley Memorial Scholarship]] by ad astra is an ensemble humor fic, great queer characters. /Five thousand Galleons. Five formerly law-abiding, studious Ravenclaws. One year to leave a legacy like no other./

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=104605][ac_rules]] has a lot of completed next gen romance/humor fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11226787/1/Clash][Clash]] by shez, which is a great dark fic in which the main ship is Albus/murder. Crossposted to ffnet as well. /Albus and Rose, brilliant but opposing minds. He is cold, cruel, and nothing like his father. All she wants is to save her brother./

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=283722][Starving Artists]] by peppersweet, cracky magical art school with Lucy Weasley the non-artist. /Lucy Weasley doesn't know what to do with her life. Luckily, there's art school./

I also write next gen :) [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][And Capers Ensue]] is my complete one, an ensemble heist-comedy surrounding the invention of a Muggle-Magic converter.

*** Wonderful, thank you so much! I have to admit I've mostly been reading stuff on ffnet, so I'm glad to know there are so many good stories on HPFF that I haven't seen before. I will check out your fic for sure! :)

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

  "We're four." Sasuke eventually found the need to point out. Naruto grimaced. "I... noticed." And hadn't that been an unpleasant surprise? "Why? I thought we'd be at least ten." Sasuke frowned, making him look reminiscent of his future self. "Kura-chan said that we'd 'probably' end up at that age." He grimaced again. "I guess that it really wasn't as predictable as we had hoped."

  Prejudice runs rampant in a world even without Lord Voldemort, but when a Potter boy is sorted into the House of Slytherin, the next generation is set to change forever. This is the story of Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, and how their friendship guided each other in times of love and strife. AL/OC, SM/RW

recommend breaking the quidditch code (the sequal is decoding the tutshill tornados or whatever) and hormones

both of which are cheap comedies/romances sorta

both are written in first person, which I usually hate, but i dunno didn't bother me too much reading these
