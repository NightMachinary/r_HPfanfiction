People. Reports are not a dislike or disagree button. They're for posts/comments that actually break the rules. [[http://i.imgur.com/UIshVi5.png][See this example.]] There's nothing in that post that's even borderline against the rules. Knock it off.

*** How ... the fjord are you getting reports for this thread?

I mean, it's an admin thread asking people to not be trigger-happy morons about reporting, reporting this thread is just asking to be gutted with a rusty knife (and no, I am not threatening anyone, just commenting on how stupid an action that is).

Edit: changed “admit” to “admin”; I have no idea where this typo came from the first time.

That said, this kind of behaviour is just sad. The only thing they are proving by doing that is that they do not really have lives worth anything (because if they had, they wouldn't need to get entertainment out of /that/).

** A lot of that comment is pure gold, even if my tastes on a couple of things are different (especially the attitude towards fem!Harry, but whatever, life'd be boring if we all agreed on everything). I can understand how one person might be tempted to hit the report button depending on whatever the context is, but two? I don't get that.

*** I can definitely understand disliking it when used as a "literary no-homo", as he put it. It's basically slapping a coat of paint on it and calling it an entirely different house. Or as I like to put it, a literary palette swap.

And I definitely agree with the No Pure Genre. Love me a romance sideplot in my adventure fic.

**** Yeah. The fem-Harry thing is just... weak, in a way? While there is no moral difference between male and female, the different societal expectations and whatnot can make for interesting possibilities of character interaction and avenues of action not seen in canon.

Those middle three points s/he made (No Pure Genre, Snape Apologetics, Character Flatness) are very good, and things I wish more people would think on.

***** Well, I'd say it's weak when used for pairing, but when done for the sake of exploring those differences or for the sake of comedy, it can be quite entertaining and not necessarily bad.

But, obviously, too many people write about pairings because ... I have no idea, really.

*** Hey, I'm OP of the posted comment, and a few things here were explained more specifically further down the thread. I don't have a problem with fem!Harry generally, it's the use of it to get out of writing an m/m pairing specifically that bothers me, 'lol I like this pairing but ewww the gays so he's a girl now.' Which I see...rather frequently on certain sites, and in one of my favourite pairings.

EDIT: Some of this was originally clarified further down the thread. As a single post, this is taken a bit out of context, so I wanted to add that in here as well, since people are commenting on the actual comment here.

**** Even if it is taken out of context, I have to say I had no problems taking that post of yours as what you now wrote it was, without knowledge of the rest of that thread (so with no more context, really), and as someone who fairly likes the cliché that is female Harry. Because yes, switching a character's sex just for the sake of making it a “no homo” thing is, on its own, not a very good thing.

And with that in mind, I can say that the ones who reported you are overreacting ... chipmunks, really.

*** Probably at least several a week, more if there's a thread that's particularly controversial. Recently someone was reporting every single post [[/u/laserthrasher1]] made for a while.

The majority of reports I get are either frivolous or borderline. It's rare that someone reports something that I think I really need to do something about, and even then it's usually just a warning to be more civil.

**** Well, I can get the thing with that particular user, as he'd shown himself to be quite arrogant and disrespectful when it suits his fancy, at times using his age as an excuse (which is really bad and no more respectful towards those slighted), and some subreddits have rules against blatant disrespect; as such, it may or may not be possible that whoever did it simply didn't check the rules and reported for that kind of degenerate behaviour. I can get it even more considering how resistant that user was to actually correcting his ways and how eager to blame those around him.

That said, some of his posts were actually fairly neutral or even positive in some way, so reporting every single one is a shitty thing to do.

** One of the problems is that nobody really understands what the report button does. Most people are unclear on the difference between mods and admins. But even when they know there's a difference, they seem to think the report button brings the post/comment to the attention of the admins, as well as the mods. So people who report all of one users posts want that user "shadowbanned" not just from one sub, but the rest of Reddit, too. They seem to think that there's an automated system that might even handle this, if only a user gets enough reports. Understandable, as Facebook and Twitter kind of sort of work this way. They also don't really understand the difference between "shadowbanned" and "banned", and don't seem to get just how easy it is to get around a Reddit ban. I hope Reddit steps up, at some point, with a lot more user education; it'd make things easier for everyone.

It's not that people are unhappy because of this thread. Instead, this thread is here because some people are making certain others unhappy. So no, this is not the time for jokes; instead, it's the time for people to learn, and on your part you have a chance to learn to read the mood to some degree now.

******* It's simple: For one, his reply was to a comment rather than to the main post, and if the one he'd replied to is fine with it then I will not get onto his case any more than I have with giving his comment my opinion via the rating system. For two, he hasn't done the same thing you have, which you have done because “oh, woe is me, everyone gangs up on me” when it's at least partially something that's happened because of your attitude, and right now you are showing that /this/ did not change in the slightest.

Age in not an excuse for not behaving yourself, and neither is anything else when you are told by others to change your behaviour, which you were told enough times that it's gotten boring by now. If you really want to play the game of “oh, let's never learn because everything is others' fault” then suit yourself, but if you do that you will soon do the same thing again and again and after some time you will piss off someone who has the power to annoy you back.

Also, since we already seem to be going the opposite of being cordial, I will add that you edited your post after I'd seen it, which is signified by the asterisk added to your post; in such a situation, unless the other person has been told to await an edit that you are going to make, the correct response it to take the edit back and make a reply out of it, rather than go “read the part that I added”.

Why the other answer has a positive score might be because of what you wrote, though, as people are usually a bit less likely to downvote a +2 or more comment than they are to do the same with a 0 or negative score one, so that one point from an acquaintance rather than a negative one from a stranger can be worth much.
