I've been trolling this site for days searching for already recommended time travel fics. I've found a few! But I want more, and a lot of them are not complete or abandoned.

I prefer well-written, long, and relatively realistic plot advancements. I like Hermione only traveling back, either on purpose or on accident. I would prefer fics where she either goes back to Tom Riddle's time, Founders, or if she goes to Marauders time that she does not become friends with them(because based on what we know and have seen of them, I'm not sure she would have been). I like the Marauder-era to either be friends with Lily or Snape, or other characters. I also don't mind Hermione/Lucius when time traveling(I've read a few fics that changed my mind on that haha).

I prefer romantic dramas, if anyone wants a genre! Humor is important too, sarcasm but I don't want a slap-stick or over-the-top dialogue(lots of caps and !!!! and screeching) writing.


** In this one she goes back to try and raise Tom Riddle change his future.

  The war didn't end when Harry and Voldemort fell. Hermione refuses to feel helpless any longer, and goes back in time to remove the scar that an unloved Tom Riddle left on the wizarding world. Tangled in the pureblood sphere, will Hermione just become another cog in Tom Riddle's plans? Final pairing is a secret! But not a Tomione. Lestrange OC. Parent!Hermione Child!Tom. COMPLETE!

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. Hermione is thrown back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over? NOW COMPLETE!

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

The Debt of Time was such a weird experience for me... it really sucked me in, but about half-way in it really started to drag on. I barely skimmed a lot of the later chapters and didn't feel like I missed much.

  Sirius is not technically dead. So here he is. 1978. Set to try and make things right. Hermione would disagree with that plan. Loudly. Repeatedly. Regulus is descending into darkness. Luna and Ginny are along for the ride. *eventual Sirimione* *is it a fix-it?* *time-travel fic*

I've read a few recently that I really enjoyed, mostly Hermione/Tom(the one I remember most clearly Hermione goes back in time and becomes Hepizbah Smith's neice, and the other is a group fic and Tom Riddle was cursed by his mother) and one Hermione/Lucius that I really loved(that one Hermione was convinced to go back in time by Lucius himself and save him).
