Basically what I am looking for is a Harry/Dumbledore apprentice-ship sort of fic, a well written one where the two travel around, Harry is taught old and new magics by the old man, they meet new peeps, new adversaries they defeat, etc. I really don't want one with any harem stuff as I hate with a passion those kind of stories, in fact Romance may as well be none-existant or if it does, just no harem or slash. Yes, I realize I may be asking for too much lol, but hopefully you peeps answer me with some good stuff.


** Its not quite what you are looking for, but the story is "new", going strong and has developed a quite interesting set of magic. (it feels similar to Magicks of the Arcane) linkffn(12104185)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magicks-of-the-Arcane][Magicks of the Arcane]] is just what you described. But it's mentioned already :)

There is also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind]], which you might've read already. It hasn't been updated for a looooong time though :( linkffn(10758358)

[Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived] has good Dumbledore & Harry scenes.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

It really is good, in all honesty. The magic system, characterizations, the mysteries... Everything I want in an excellent HP fic.
