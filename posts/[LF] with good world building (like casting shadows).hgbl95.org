Recently (today) I finished casting shadows linkffn(13365454) by Wakefan, and it was great. More than great in fact.

Even though this first part still hasn't delved into deep lore, the world has already enthralled me. Interactions between DoM and its french counterpart, ancient magics (why are no longer widely spread + why there are some exceptions [no spoilers]), relationships between characters (you are in for a ride), politics of the magic world (seriously, first fic where i don't want to kms after delving into what normally are cring/unreal politics)....

Everything feels so organic and natural... I just loved it.

Finally my request: basically I was wondering if anyone knows of some fics with quality world-building.


** If you like world building, then I'm guessing you like long fics?

I can recommend two series, both incomplete but active, and over a million words each thus far.

linkffn(Innocent) involves Sirius escaping Azkaban five years early and raising Harry for several years before Hogwarts (while hiding from a manhunt over the "kidnapping"). It does a great job of fleshing out many characters from the previous generation; Sirius, Remus, Marlene McKinnon, Gawain Robards, Snape, Tonks, etc. Also some original characters. Seeing Harry get a flawed-but-caring parental figure is really sweet.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) starts off as a decently written but otherwise straightforward adaptation of the premise (girl and boy imitate each other so they can attend each other's schools). As you keep reading, though, more layers keep unfolding. It explores the political landscape (this Riddle decided against violent warfare and chose legislation instead), the nature of magic (especially in relation to potions), the alleys beyond Knockturn, alchemy and its relationship with other magical fields, plus really interesting reinterpretations of Draco Malfoy, Lily's protection, Riddle's motivations, and many others. Also, it has conflict and trauma beyond anything in canon. Harriet wanted to go to Hogwarts in order to excel, and she does, but that draws the spotlight to her in a way that makes their ruse increasingly difficult.

*** As you deduced, I really like long fics if the univers and the story are well built.

I knew about the Pureblood Pretense, yet I never started to read it (don't really know why). Hearing your recommendations and "briefing" though, I will give it a try. I don't think I ever heard of Innocent, but after Pretense (which may be quite a while), I may also give it a go.

Thank you for your recommendations! (And I really recommend the one I mentioned {sorry for the spam :3, but I just finished it and still retain the hype})

**** Hmm. I read up to chapter 6, but I couldn't get into it. I think it's mostly the presentation; lots of spelling and grammar errors, lots of switching between past tense grammar and present tense, and characters rethinking their positions and opinions remarkably quickly. There were some interesting ideas (Uber powerful Harry isn't my favorite thing, but I can see there is some effort to show the drawbacks and take it to interesting places), but for me it's too jarring, like trying to enjoy the scenery while riding a wagon on a bumpy trail.

The runespoor definitely has comedy potential. Again, I think it was let down by the presentation - in particular, the fact that our first point of view on it is Ginny's diatribe against it. At that point, Ginny has just been introduced, so by default the reader tends to import canon attributes until the story makes clear otherwise - and in canon she's a hero and Harry/Ginny is the happily ever after, so it's easy to feel sympathy for her attitude and view the snake as an obstacle to happiness. That's probably not an issue for the author, who planned all along for Ginny/Harry to be impractical and undesirable, but at that point it's not clear to the reader.

It would have been very helpful to first get /Harry's/ perspective on his familiar, before seeing Ginny disparage her. I think it would even help in presenting their breakup, by establishing the girls as sympathetic and thus showing Ginny's objection to be unfounded. Also, do you know whether the author has a beta reader?

***** I totally agree. The first chapters are a bit chaotic. It seems that up to chapter 8, it just tries to brief about the world, while trying really hard to make Ginny not be the black sheep.

And I'm not going to lie. Seeing it in retrospective, there were two or three scenes edgy/cringy (?) as fuck. Maybe a bit justified by the emotional context... but they definitively made my back hurt. By the end (like 1-2h before posting) I was so hyped and probably biased, that completly ignored any negative point. The world presented, and the fact that the series is not abandoned really hooked me.

I'm not sure if the author has a beta reader. (Maybe he/she has one from chp 10-15 and up, or at least the overall writing improves).

** Been recommending this everywhere today, it seems, but it fits!

Linkffn(Crawlersout)

Worldbuilding in a way that just takes my breath away. MACUSA is fleshed our wonderfully, with a whole other school of magic with amazing electives. Magic from more obscure countries like Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, and Tibet is explored. The ancient magic of historical empires like Sumer and the Mayans and Incas ensnares the mind wonderfully. Not to mention we have some political landscape with the featured dark lords, Grindelwald and the mysterious Pershing.

Another one, coincidentally another Fem!Harry but wildly lauded by this subreddit, is linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure)

Great spells introduced with the added bonus of kids being kids and not 11 year old politicians, though politics still manages to weave its way through in a manner that is inoffensive and indeed intriguing.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
