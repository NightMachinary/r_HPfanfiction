I'm looking for a fic where Draco uses a foreign curse instead on harry. It cause harry to lose control and r*pe draco. Reason for this was because he wants to get pregnant with harry's child so he won't have to participate in the war. I remember the slytherin house follows draco as well.

I found it! It's "Saving Draco Malfoy" by Dayspring. It's a good story but my explanation above didn't do it justice ðŸ™‡ (i'm bad at explaining things. Sorrly).
