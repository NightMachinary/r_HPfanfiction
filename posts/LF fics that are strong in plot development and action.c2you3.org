Anything goes as long as it's not twenty chapters or character development and no plot


** Idk what type of fic, but there is this really good one, it's of Sirius raising Harry, the first one is 75 chapters, and the sequel is being worked on, some is posted, but idk if they are still on hiatus or not. It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12550911/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Dogfather][Harry Potter and the Dogfather]]
