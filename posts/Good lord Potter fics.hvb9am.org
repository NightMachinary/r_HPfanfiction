**** I'm not saying she is in fact looking at his penis. She could, perhaps, be looking at something else.

However, if she was looking at his penis, then I guess she would be doing so because she was amazed by the size of it.

** I'd say try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11547735/1/Amicus-Protectio-Fortis][This]]. It's got a little Dumbledore bashing, and the last update (chapter 20, at 175,393 words) was July of 2017, but it was pretty good while it lasted. Basically, Harry recognized how useless the staff was (and to be honest, can you blame him?) after the troll incident, therefore forming the DA in his first year rather than the fifth. It doesn't have many tropes, "call me Lord Potter" isn't really a thing unless he's purposely trying to tick someone(usually Dumbledore) off, yes his name is HARRY, and he is still honestly kind and compassionate, trying to make the school a better place for those who come there and realizing the only way that's going to happen is if he puts his foot down. Honestly? I'd give it a go.

********* Pacing is an issue, I'll give you that. On a lack of direction I'd have to disagree, it feels like there's a lack of direction but some of the sideplots take a while to resolve. Now that book 3 is finished and some of the sideplots have been rounded off the direction becomes a bit clearer.

********** I feel like it would be better if it was several separate stories, rather than one big one. The author is clearly ambitious, but you can't write everything. But then, I prefer my fics to have one main protagonist, a few side characters and a maximum of 2-3 POVs. It just gets very overwhelming to have to try to follow what everyone and their mum's up to

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
