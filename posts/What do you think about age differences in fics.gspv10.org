I am currently working on a fic and what would you say is to much of a age difference


** I'd say any age difference where one character is an adult and the other isn't, though generally, I /also/ apply "Romeo and Juliet" rules to the idea. 18 and 16 isn't really something that should be considered particularly immoral, IMO.

** Wasn't Theodore Nott Sr as old as Riddle and married to a woman 35 younger than him? My problem with this question is that Movies and J.K.R's Books show Wizards and Witches never really reaching past the standard age expectancy of a /"basic"/ Human (Look at the Black family all the elders are dead in 1995 so all dead before reaching 90-100 years old) but if the magical can truly live up to 150 or 200 (or maybe far more) years old, a 30-50 age difference shouldn't be so bad.

It's not our society, it's not the same world. Of course Child-adult relationship is completely wrong, but a 25 years old witch marrying a 55 years old Wizard (and vice versa)? Whatever, I don't mind.

*** Exactly. It's always kinda bothered me how it's stated that wizards and witches have a longer life-span, yet the only two real examples I could think of are Dumbledore and maybe Slughorn. Like, Blacks' older generation, Weasley/Prewett grandparents, Potters all should be around. It was obviously made for the plot convenience, but still...

I actually remember a line from some fic that went somewhat ‚Äúin a hundred years I would be 120 and you would be 140, so what does the age matter‚Äù.

** The standard for adults is half plus seven. For teenagers it gets a bit murkier because the numbers are so small. (Apply that rule to a 14 year old and see what you get, for instance.) I'd say a year or two in such a case is the upper limit before things start getting weird.

The first one is to add some experience as an adult in there. That, and mentality. It takes a bit to get out of the childhood mentality.

** Too much of an age difference (for me) is either:

- Crossing the legal adult/younger divide with more than maybe a 2 year gap (18+16=fine, 19+15=nope)
- breaking the half your age plus 7 rule in either direction
- among two minors, being more than two years apart in age (seventh year dating fifth year is ok-ish, seventh year dating fourth year isnt)

** It depends on the age of the participant and the nature of the relationship.

Someone who's 11-13 shouldn't date or have sex with people more than one or two years older/younger than them, and if they do have sex the plot shouldn't focus on it at all. We all know this stuff starts at that age with many kids, but most of us dont want to read about it.

At 14-15 you should still stay reasonably close to that age, but relationships with someone 3 and maybe 4 years older aren't necessarily a problem if they're still at school, you can also start mentioning sex a bit, but dont focus too much on it.

At 16-18 dating people under 14 is weird, and while it happens its not something you should write about. At that age you're pretty much old enough to consent to sex with anyone older than you, though having serious relationships with working self sufficient adults is weird because of the difference in life experience, thought even that depends when the Relationship starts and the Nature of it. For example Hermione dating at 17 dating a 20 Krum would be fine, because of the level of maturity and their shared history.

** Any age difference is okay, as long as they are both consenting adults. I don't care if it's 12 years+, its completely okay and legal.

I don't really...think it's okay for like, a 14 year old and a 18 year old to be together though. It all really depends on the ages if they are underage because...well a 14yr old is not completely developed compared to even say, a 16 year old. And a 16 year old is not as developed as an 18 year old but it feels different even though 2 years is the same age gap but they're older.

Edit: everyone's terms of ‚Äúadult‚Äù are different. Here in the US, most states consider the age of consent 16 and the legal age 18.

I know in the wizarding world, the legal age is 17. In this aspect, I do believe that 17 is adult and should be treated as such. But not everyone does I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è like I said. As long as it's CONSENTING

**** Well, the way I see it is this:

I was in a relationship with a man who was merely one year younger than myself. This was not healthy and very bad for my mental health. We were both over the age of 18 for the entire relationship.

I am now in a relationship with a man 12 years older than myself. This is the happiest and healthiest relationship I've EVER been in. My friends and family can even see a difference and have even commented on how much better my mental health has been.

Yes, healthy relationships come in all shapes and sizes, colors and age differences.

I find it odd that you say it should not be illegal for an adult to be with someone under age but it's not okay for student/teacher because of power dynamic. If you look at my relationship, it could be considered a ‚Äúpower dynamic‚Äù issue as he's older and has had more life experience and graduated high school when I was literally in 1st grade. Now here's a forewarning: if you reply with a negative response to /my/ relationship, which I can see happening, there will be problems.

** The question would be easier to answer if we knew the ages involved... although I understand why you'd be reluctant to put that out there.

In general, try and keep the ages similar. But also take into account maturity. The age difference can be larger for adults, and wizards can probably have up to a 30ish year difference because they live so long.

Don't pair any minors with characters who have not been minors for a significant amount of time, mostly because of the imbalance of power between them. With magic you could technically have an extremely powerful younger person, and people won't mind as much if they're paired with someone older.

*** It's tricky. Probably the only really safe option is for the traveler to wait until their love interest is an adult, challenging though that may be.

Nightmares of Futures Past has an interesting approach, because Harry and Ginny aren't actually dating, but he couldn't just keep away from her, because the whole point of coming back was that if he didn't change things, everyone would die. So he's basically hopelessly devoted to her, and she's known why for a while, which would normally tend to count as grooming, but is perhaps forgivable in this case. And it's not as though he's trying to ensure that she'll want to date him, he's just trying to look after her and help her become all that she can be.

Lol, if Neville was taking Ginny *at* the Yule Ball I am pretty sure Ron would kick his ass.

But to be serious do you really think what they did matters? From the half plus seven rule him taking Ginnny to a date would make him a creep regardless of what they do.

** linkffn(What We Lost by JacobApples)

The pairing for this fic is Andromeda x Harry. There is a huge age difference between both of them, 20 years if I am not wrong. However, it does deal with the age difference in a very mature and realistic way, in MY OPINION.

I still go back and read it from time to time since it is such an enjoyable read that really makes you connect with the characters.

So regarding the age differences in fics?

I think it is important to work with them in a mature and realistic way. Not just have the older characters as MILFS or FILFS for the Harem of the MC. Also use reasonable ages. Do not pair prepubescent with older men or women since it will come off as pedophilia or have teenager lusting over adults, unless you are writing smut.

** Depends how it's handled, but generally a pretty huge one for me to notice. I generally quit caring much at all when the younger is 15-16 since that's around the full age of consent for most of the world. That's not to say that the more more extreme ones aren't going to be a tougher sell in most cases.

The state I grew up in had close in exceptions of 3 years for under 15, and 15 +10. Along with later living in a state that had it set at 14. So I saw quite a few relationships with ages that would apparently send large chunks of this sub-reddit and the moderators into full-blown meltdowns and lamentations. They didn't seem to be more disastrous as a whole than more normal high school age relationships.

The 1/2 plus seven crap is completely useless when you start moving into speculative fiction and start dealing with things like clones (Young Justice's Superboy was only roughly ~ 1mo old when he started dating the 48 year old Ms. Martian, but they're both mentally ~16), time travel, vastly different maturities (80 years old means much different things for an elf vs a human), flash puberties (hello Veela), possessions, the undead or otherwise basically immortal, de-agings, and reincarnation.

For example: in LOTR a 20 year old elf would likely appear as an adolescent yet they'd have more age and maturity than a similar looking human, so who would it be appropriate for them to be in a relationship with?

** Like in real life, don't really care much. And for a society whose members can easily reach their mid 100s, you do you.

** In a fic well... You do you, that's what they are for and it really only depends on how you master your craft. Think Nabokov. As for what is socially acceptable

In my opinion passing the teenage mark anything goes. People above 20 are adults by most standards and whatever age gap they have is perfectly fine.

Bellow the age of 20 I believe they should not date anyone older or younger than two or three years at most.

** Depends on the ages After the age of 20 age differences don't matter as much unless the gap is like 20 years Under the age of 18 I would say a 2 year difference is acceptable anything above that starts to become creepy
