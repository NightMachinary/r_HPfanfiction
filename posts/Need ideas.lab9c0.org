Planning to write a Harry and Ron paring in my oc slytherin fanfic. Need ideas how to hint it in their fifth or third year


** The common and easiest way to do it is to use jealousy. Have Harry and Ron get jealous and irritated every time someone spends time with the other or flirts with them.

Problem? Usually the author just states it.

If you want to do the jealousy right, don't just say “Harry found himself rather irritated that Ron was with Lavender but couldn't for the life of him figure out why.”

I've seen way too many sentences of that structure.

Less tell more show. You can tell, but not too much.

My advice? Have Ron feel lonely despite being in a full house. Have Harry wait eagerly for letters to arrive. Then have him get disappointed when it's not from Ron.

Have them smile more around each other. Have them go to each other first for all their problems. Have them spend a lot of time together and have inside jokes that even Hermione doesn't know.

Things like this.
