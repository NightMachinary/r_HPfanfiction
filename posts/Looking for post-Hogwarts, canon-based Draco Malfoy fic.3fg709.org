Hello there! I sometimes read this subreddit to find new fic, but now that I am looking for something specific, I decided to make an account so I could ask.

I'm interested in fic about Draco Malfoy after Hogwarts that is based in canon. Which is to say, no AUs and definitely no fanon characterization. I don't want to see him bashed, but I have no interest in reading about a Draco that is charming and witty, effortlessly heroic (I don't mind him as a reluctant hero), nice, super powerful, or any other entirely fanon-based interpretation. I don't dislike AUs or anything, just not what I'm looking for right now.

I'd prefer something that takes place between the end of book 7 and the epilogue, works within that context, and includes the new Pottermore/interview content, specifically about his relationship with his parents (still close but doesn't agree about blood purity anymore), Astoria, and the interest he developed in alchemy later in life. I'd rather see how he gets to this point than see him already there. How does he fail along the way? What does it take for him to become the better man that JKR says he did become? How did the war affect him? I'd also take fic about him trying to be a good father. Not redemption fic exactly, because Draco is not a villain... he's a cowardly little bully, but he's not evil, and JKR states that he changed later. I'd like to see how.

However, EWE is fine too, as long as it's not AU otherwise and the characterization is close to canon. If it's EWE, then I really don't care about ship at all and don't care if it's het, slash or gen, but I'm not looking for a romance, so I'd prefer not to read anything that is focused around that. If it is not EWE, then obviously he should be married to Astoria.

In case anybody else likes this sort of fic, or to give an idea of what I'm looking for, I will link a few that come close.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6406102/1/The-House-That-Cedric-Built]] - This is Draco/Astoria and not EWE, but written before the post-canon information came out. I really like this Draco characterization, and also the Astoria.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9992917/1/Friends-and-Foes]] - Not Draco-based and Northumbrian doesn't write fic about Draco, but he is portrayed perfectly in this, IMO. I like Northumbrian's characterizations in general, honestly.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/291923/chapters/467029]] - A little sillier than the other two and EWE, but I enjoyed it. The first two are about Draco, while the rest of the series is focused on the Next Gen characters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5533537/1/Four-o-clock-in-the-morning]] - EWE. This one is about Hermione and Draco, but it is not a Draco/Hermione ship. (Draco isn't paired with anybody in it.)

As an aside... if anybody has any fic about Dudley Dursley along similar lines, I would also read that! It seems like they are two sides of the same coin, and I find both characters interesting. Again, Northumbrian does a great Dudley, but doesn't write fics focused on him. That said, I will also take fics that don't focus on Draco or Dudley, but still have them as characters who are portrayed in a way based on canon.

Sorry this is so long, but thank you very much to anybody who has any recs for me!


** That kind of Draco is /so/ rare, rare enough that it spurred me to write one of my own. I've read a handful of Dracos that would fit my headcanon (i.e. pathetic Draco) and got used to fanon for the rest of them. I'll have to read the ones you listed!

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=179718][peppersweet]] writes a lot of Draco and Scorpius, but I don't think she has a lengthy post-canon Draco except for [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=290059][Memento]] which is on the old side; but if you're interested in Malfoy family life, her Scorpius fics have a fair bit of Draco (she loves Draco/Astoria but also tends to write them divorced in next gen; Draco is trying to be a good father but it's... not easy). She has some one-shots, too.

She also rec'd me [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=325457][Traitorous Hearts]] by Penelope Inkwell (Draco/Astoria), but I haven't had the chance to read it yet myself.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=322009][Mine]], I swear I'll finish one day.

*** Thank you, I will check these all out!

I agree it is disappointing how rare it is to see Draco portrayed this way. I wouldn't even call that headcanon, honestly. I'd call it regular canon, and I find it far more interesting to read about than some cliche "charming bad boy" that doesn't even make sense for his character. And while it's less common, I'm really not a fan of Draco being portrayed as some evil murdering rapist. That also has no canon basis. In fact... the opposite does. His bark is worse than his bite, and when push comes to shove, he doesn't have the stomach (which is a good thing in this case).

I'm glad to see there are more people out there who see Draco this way and are still writing fic. I hope you do continue your fic at some point!

**** "His bark is worse than his bite"--exactly! I'm far more interested in a shaken-up Draco, someone who never entirely escapes his cowardice, but has survived and loves nonetheless, but so much of fanon has been influenced by the movies. I think overdramatic, theatrically snooty, Potter-obsessed Draco is fun in its own way too, though--at least he isn't some glistening sex god.

It's a real pity because I could ship him with anyone but he's usually exactly that. Like I'm a big fan of Draco/Luna /in idea/ but most people can't write either of those characters well individually as it is. And while I'm willing to tackle Draco, I don't think /I/ could write Luna particularly well either!

***** I think Luna might be one of the most difficult characters to write well. I have seen very, very few fics that I thought captured her voice. It's even more rare than an IC Dumbledore, who is another one I think is rarely gotten right. At least Draco has it a little better than those two!

***** I do think canon Draco is kind of a drama queen, and a humor fic can play that up a lot for some fun. But yeah, loyal to family but kind of a whiny coward all the same is my favorite characterization of Draco.

Good Draco/Luna sounds amazing, but I have so much trouble finding readable Draco centered fics that I've never even tried looking. Have you found anything good?

****** He is, the more I think about it! The entire Malfoy family is hopeless. I would totally dig serious fic that has good drama queen Draco, too. I kind of use that characterization for writing Scorpius moreso than Draco, so that might explain my preference.

peppersweet who I linked above actually has two Draco/Lunas, though neither is romantic. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308510][Christmas In Prison]] is one of my absolute fav oneshots, about Luna's time in Malfoy Manor. She's also writing [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=334334][Your Heart on Your Sleeve]] for me, which shows Draco's last days before his post-war trial. We've read one or two others that are all right, but quality in that ship really is that scarce.
