And acts arrogantly a bit. Not like Dursley or Malfoy but just a bit arrogant and a bit pompous.

The reasons as to how he's arrogant and spoiled doesn't matter, Harry acting spoiled and arrogant does.


** Thats every fic according to Snape.

I guess I've probably seen some fics from an "unreliable narrator" like snape where he thinks Harry is arrogant, but that's not what you're looking for right?

*** Yeah, definitely not what I'm looking for and heh, a Harry that actually justifies Snape's descriptions would probably be exactly what I'm looking for

** linkffn(The Happy Red Prince)

He's more than a little arrogant and about as pompous as pompous gets. It's discontinued and old so don't expect it to be finished.

  Seven Year AU. Suppose the Dursleys had not been Harry's only living relations. How might the young hero that we know and adore have been changed by a loving childhood? The differences might not be as universally positive as one might think. Discontinued.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
