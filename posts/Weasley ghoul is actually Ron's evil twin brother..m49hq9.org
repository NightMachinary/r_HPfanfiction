:END:
Based on The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror VII. In this prompt, a prophecy is made about a good twin and a evil twin and its linked to the Weasleys. Molly didn't have the heart to kill one of her own children so she stuck him in the attic and only have him food. The evil twin is called Roonil and is the living embodiment of evil!ron tropes. He breaks out at some point, replaces Ron and goes to Hogwarts. He then does all the evil!ron things like stealing from Harry and love potioning Hermione. He gets caught and it basically ruins Ron's life. Meanwhile the real Ron is trying to get his mums attention by screaming and shouting but it isn't working. The evil twin gets discovered years later when the real Ron breaks out of the attic. He is pissed that no one noticed the difference.

** "Why, Ron, what's with the twisted moustache this year?" Harry asks.

Evil-Ron shrugs and leaves for dinner, not before slapping Hermione's bum and winking. Harry's eyes widen as Hermione's jaw drops and her cheeks blush.

** Plot-twist, you can't go against a prophecy. Ron upon freeing himself and realizing what his evil twin did goes dark and decides to kill his whole family, including his twin. Harry is the head-auror and married to Ginny (since this is restricted to Ron tropes, so no love-potion mishap from that direction) plus somewhat distant friends with a reformed Roonil and starts investigating when his brothers/parents in-law start dying putting him against Ron, in the beginning he is somewhat understanding when he gets the gist of the situation and tries to get Ron help, but Ron went completely crazy and doesn't want to see reason anymore, always managing to escape and delving ever-deeper in the dark arts and pulling stunts such as sending an army of inferi to try killing the twins in the middle of Diagon. Things hit a breaking point when Ron stages an attack on Hogwarts and manages to kill Albus Severus and James Sirius (having a ‚Äúwhat have I done‚Äù moment soon after), the remaining death eaters and dark creatures start flocking to him soon after and the situation dissolved into a civil war. Eventually Harry goes face Ron and almost manages to kill him, but ends being hit from behind with a killing curse from an escaped Umbridge.

Meanwhile Roonil is mostly broken out of his worst habits, but still not actual hero-material. But with Harry's death he is forced to (help) take care of Lily Luna and ends growing fond of her, so when Ron goes after them to kill both he takes his niece with him and flees for years, helping the resistance to the best of his abilities and protecting Lily, all the while growing in power and skill. In the end a completely reformed Roonil and Dark Lord Ron meet in a final battle on the burrow (which Ron couldn't bring himself to destroy up to that point since it was the house where he passed some of the best years of his life). They fight and Roonil is good, but ultimately outmatched, Ron is about to throw a killing curse at him but Lily steps into the path and he, still not quite over Albus and James' deaths, tells her to step aside, she refuses and tries to appeal to his better nature enraging Ron into killing her, then he turns his wand on a crying Roonil and casts another killing curse, Roonil takes the curses but survives because of the blood protections Lily invoked through her sacrifice, Roonil enraged jumps and bodily pushes Ron into the ground before beating him, his touch now burning the dark lord to ashes.

** I know it was likely meant as a comedy prompt, but actually when I think about it, it plays in my head as a drama or tragedy of some sort. Like, they discover the truth, that Ron's twin was hidden away in the attic and called "The Ghoul", but really he was just the Weasley family's dark secret; much like all other Pureblood families, any squib or child born with physical or mental differences is disowned and sent off to live in the muggle world (if the baby's lucky), but Molly and Arthur went a different direction with what to do with their misfit child.

Oh gahd! I shouldn't be allowed to think about things like this! I'm the worst! üò´

** I'm sorry but the Weasleys are the most big-hearted family in the wizarding world so it feels wrong to even think about an evil version of them, even if it's a ghoul. And what exactly do you mean by 'Noone notices the difference'??

Anyone who thinks that it's even distantly possible for Ron to be evil, has no soul. Everyone seems soo obsessed with 'stealer Ron and love-potion Ron' theories that they find innovative ways to make it happen. Because deep down they know the real Ron would never even think about such a thing. So it's simply projecting their own evil thoughts on to Ron.

I wonder why there aren't many Evil! Harry or Evil! Hermione theories, that too considering they showed WAY MORE darker traits than Ron.

**** Lmao!!! Ron is stupid ?!?!? Just because the film writers gave all his shining moments to Hermione, and turned Ron down into a clown who only cares about food and makes funny faces, doesn't mean he is sTuPiD. Ron was strategic, observant and infact the only person who was able to have an equal debate with Hermione and keep her grounded. It's the others who were stupid or didn't have the energy.

So if someone has a pure heart, it doesn't mean they're too stupid to be evil.

***** I know that, but most fanfic evil!Harry and evil!Hermione get written as proper evil bastards. Compare that to evil!Ron where he appears.

In stories where Ron is a evil love-potioning nitwit, he is usually following Molly/ Ginny's orders. He lacks all agency and doesn't show much apart from jealousy.

Harry has the Horcrux and abusive upbringing. Hermione is very clever and knowledge-seeking and when she breaks the rules, breaks them hard.

Ron... doesn't have much of evil traits. He has poverty in his upbringing, but doesn't have any inclinations towards stealing. He has interest in chess, but you can't imagine him as a manipulative bastard.

I could easily recommend you good evil Hermione and Harry fanfics, but good evil Ron doesn't seem to exist in fanfiction.
