*Looking for fics that go into more detail about the innerworkings of the auror office or just heavily use Harry's abilities as an Auror. It doesn't have to be canon, but canon pairings would be ideal.*

For example a suspense/mystery fic where Harry and his office are investigating something.

I just read Messing with Time, in which Harry as head auror is thrown back in time to pre-Hogwarts. I like it because even though he's pretty powerful, it doesn't seem unrealistic because he's drawing on real skills as an Auror. He takes on like 8 aurors because 6 of them are people that he's worked with and he knows exactly how they're trained to react to situations and how to keep them at bay.

And the author goes into a lot of detail about the inner workings of the Auror office, which is interesting.

So a fic similar to that (in which Harry is using his skills as head auror in an alternate universe or a different time period) would be cool.

But anything that heavily features the auror office would be appreciated.


** I'll offer you Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood. Novel-length, complete and fully canon. It focuses on Harry and the other canon characters unraveling a conspiracy.

** Harry isn't quite an Auror, but if you're looking for mystery then you can't do better than [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4080247/1/Lost-Time][Lost Time]]. You never know what's coming, it's great.

Another mystery fic that's incredible is Matt Silver's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6166553/1/Breach-of-Contract-Twelve-Signs][Breach of Contract]]. Harry is actually an Auror in this one, but it's far from typical.

** There's a fic that I vaguely remember

It was something about the French Minister's daughter, and Harry was an Auror who banged her silly

** Swissdog has written a long series of fics about Harrys life after DH. Over a million words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4335716/1/Harry-s-Future][Harrys Future]] is the first.

They contain a lot about his work with the aurors, and his family life. They are canon according to the sequel, but take a few liberties.
