All the information we have is in two examples, Lupin and Greyback. When we meet him he is seen to be full of self loathing over his condition and worn down by the stress of the transformations. Note however, that he would also probably suffering from trauma from Greybacks attack which he links to his condition, survivor's guilt, betrayal by a friend and probably several other unresolved issues from going undercover in a magically enhanced terrorism campaign/civil war, twelve years of isolation and stress from starting teaching/meeting Harry/Sirius' escape. All of this is compounded by an awareness of wizarding attitudes of werewolves, and first hand knowledge of why it can be justified and possible guilt over how much effort his parents, teachers and friends went to to accommodate his condition. Frankely, if you take a step back and look at how shit Remus' life had been, if lycanthropy had significant psychological effects then he wouldn't be even functioning. Also bear in mind that he seemed to get through seven years of Hogwarts, a boarding school away from his family and surrounded by other children, with only 3/4 people ever realising his secret. All of his life up to, and after book 3 his curse is never relevant again (except for angst reasons). This suggests that much of Lupin's hardship is self-imposed and may not be much to do with the curse, and that it doesn't really affect day to day life.

The other example is Greyback, who was probably a psychopath regardless, and the curse just gives him an excuse. I feel using him as a typical werewolf would be like using Bellatrix Lestrange as a typical witch. While there are many (but even then not all) werewolves around who fought for Voldemort (they were an oppressed underclass and he promised changes, I can't blame them too much), he is the only one that is mentioned or seems to be an enthusiastic minion. The very fact that he appears at all is because he is exceptional, and therefore cannot be used as an example.

With werewolves as a group, they seem to conform to general ghettoised second class citizen behaviour. Society expectations tend to be self reinforcing. Lupin is special for getting education at Hogwarts, so any turned as children (which Greyback specialised in) were uneducated. If you are expected to have criminal tendencies, legitimate jobs are harder to come by, so you may be forced to crime. Also you are more likely to be suspected, found guilty and given harsher sentences whether you did it or not, which validates public perception. Again like Lupin, if there were any additional major tendencies for werewolves to be intrinsically violent, then that combined with the sheer horror of a werewolf attack, which is taught in schools, and all of the mundane social prejudice and the fact that some fought for Voldemort, then they probably would just have been exterminated, rather than tolerated.

One last fun point. The phases of the moon is related to, but not in sync with, the solar and lunar day-night cycle. Half of full moons will be in the day, and half will be when the moon is below the horizon. Depending how generous you are with the term full, as it is a continuous cycle not discrete stages, you could have two short full moons in the sky hours later (depending on latitude and season), or it could skip a month. Whatever set of rules you use (how long does it last, can it be day, does it have to be in the sky) this makes the transformation far more unpredictable than is usually depicted.

TLDR: Werewolves have enough problems anyway that if the curse added to them significantly, they wouldn't function.


** In Canon, the Curse does have a physical effect. In PoA, Lupin could barely function is the days of the full moon because the transformation is extremely tiring and painfull.

But yes, the "physical" consequences of the curse are really a minor problem compared to the social sigma werewolves have to endure, and it's not impossible that Lupin made his transformation worse by "fighting" it, though I doubt it would ever be a plaisant experience, even for the likes of Greyback.

** If it was real, wouldnt it be more realistic to castrate them and put them in prison or kill them since they are a danger to humans if they do one mistake like Lupin did?

Hmm im a bit off topic

Edit: it is the truth, i mean if they all die it would prevent anymore from being created so instead of just downvoting tell me why yoy disagree
