#+begin_quote
  Collection of one shots where various Harry Potter characters will get more upset than in canon and end up saying or doing something that will likely destroy relationships, and possibly have long lasting plot impacts. Not meant to be bash-fic, but there will be some unforgiving interpretations of actions and words that will edge on bashing.
