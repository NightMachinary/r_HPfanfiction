I'm looking for fics where Harry goes "Fuck it" and kicks everyone out of Grimmauld Place, Dumbledore be damned. I want this because they tend to have quite a few Dark!Harry themes.

Over 70k+ words please!

A Harry Potter/Addams Family crossover. I enjoyed it and I know nothing about Addams Family. Hits all your criteria as well.\\
YMMV.

**** Yeah. I probably should've mentioned that. Slipped my mind. Definitely not for everyone.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

  After Sirius dies, Harry is isolated and feels betrayed by everyone who's been around him recently and leaves to figure out what he should do. An "old friend" is sent to look after him and try to bring him back. Together they search for a way to kill a Dark Lord and maybe fix society too.
