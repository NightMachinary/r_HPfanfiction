:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
decided to rewrite the description xD

harry gets letters from an unknown person who likes to talk and discuss things with him. he doesn't know who that is but the person is reluctant to meet since they are â€˜enemies' and harry wonders who that may be. when he asks remus or bill (i don't remember) they offer malfoy or snape but also voldemort though harry does not believe that he agrees to meet up but only when his pen pal offers information about a ward he wants to use during the meeting. they meet at a clearing near the hogsmade and before that harry asks bill to go and chcecj if the ward was correctly raised and if it really makes them both be truthful and unable to hurt one another while inside. then they meet and harry is shocked that it is in fact voldemort but he seems saner than before. he offers truce and after a while disapparates (which i think should be impossible if he wasn't truthful cause of the ward) harry stays there for a while in shock.
