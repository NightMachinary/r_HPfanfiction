When reading dialogue, what kind of voice do you imagine the characters having? Pitch, tone, accent, that kind of thing. As an example: I imagine Hermione having a similar voice to the movies, but slightly more nasal, a bit more high-strung; think Emma Watson doing an Arnold Rimmer impression.


** Honestly when reading I personally don't 'hear' the dialogue in my head. But when I do think about it Hermione sounds like a friend of mine doing a slightly pompous British accent, we read fics to each other and her voice just feels right. Other than that the characters really just sound like text to me. (If you are wondering what text sounds like, the answer is nothing.)

** I rely very much on visualization when reading, picturing people, locations, events and what have you. I do sometimes imagine voice (usually movie ones) but far less. For example, I have a consistent picture of teenage SS as a result of reading a lot of Marauder-era SS fics. I do not have a consistent teenage SS voice.

** My mind speaks without voice, so I don't...

** Harry to me always sounds like how Stephen Fry did him in the audiobooks, a bit nasal. Ron is just Rupert Grint, because that performance was perfect.

Those are the only two that have clear voices for me.

** Exactly as they sound in the movies for Draco, Harry, Hermione, and Ron.

** NGL but I kinda see Harry as your typical London road donnie from the chippie shop.

** Every character has the same voice to me: a very monotone, robotic, Bristish female voice straight from my Samsung Galaxy's TTS options.

I like listening while driving and audiobooks aren't really a thing for fanfics. But, more seriously, I'll often read things as if someone else is narrating it if I've been listening to someone for a decent length recently. For example, this weekend I binged a bunch of Armoured Skeptic videos on youtube, since I haven't actually watched them before, so currently I hear his voice narrating stuff when I read. Another youtuber this has happened with recently is MauLer.

As for when it's just my normal internal voice and I come up with voices for each of the characters, I really can't think of them off the top of my head. I'd have to be reading something to actually hear it, and I don't think I'd be able to properly describe them. Vaguely British, I guess.

** Well, I imagine Harry having an almost child's pitch for some reason.

** Almost all of the kids, including Harry, have the same exact child-like British accent to me, give or take a few pitches up or down depending on gender or age. Exceptions include Luna, who I give a fairly high, wispy voice that sounds constantly deep in thought, and Draco, who sounds similar to all the others with a slight poshness to it.

Mcgonagall has a very severe voice, with a barely noticable Scottish inflection, though I admit she only has it when the story points it out or I spontaneously remember that she's Scottish. Snape has a methodical yet drawling voice that sounds just about as greasy as his hair is described in every single HP fic. Dumbledore is straight up the King from Zelda CDI just because of how many times he's said "My boy" to Harry.

Quirrel sounds just as anxious and stuttery as he's described in the books. During the all-so-important Sorcerer's Stone scene, however, his voice is not stuttery at all. Instead, it's thin and angry. Voldemort gets the honor of having the generic evil villain voice, albeit with an added British accent.

Hagrid, Fleur and all of the other foreign students/headmasters with written out accents sound exactly how they read, with respective levels of throatiness depending on whether it's Hagrid or literally anyone else.

Sirius, for whatever reason, has an urgent voice with a middle-pitched General American accent. Sort of like... Solid Snake? I don't know how I conceived of this internal voice, but it's there. Peter (Pettigrew) is somewhat like Quirrel's voice if it was actually his natural tone of voice. If there was a voice that was rat-like, that would be the one for me.

Most of the other adults have generic middle-aged British voices. I may have missed a few, but that's pretty much all for me.
