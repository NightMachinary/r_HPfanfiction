Harry runs away right before he turns eleven, and ends up living on the streets. He doesn't go to Hogwarts and has some sort of instinctive/intuitive magic (like salt circles, crafting trinkets for luck, friendship,etc.). He uses this to avenge one of his friends who was killed by a paedophile (he hypnotizes the dude into speaking the truth to the cops, sort of like an instinctive confundus charm/imperio). He earns some money by doing some magic tricks on the roadside too.

Voldemort's resurrection still takes place, but they use Moody's blood. And Voldy's body is very weak.

In Draco's 5th/6th year, he ends up running away to the muggle world and meets Harry, who takes Draco under his wing. They eventually end up in a relationship.

It's a 7-9 chapter story, I think. Any idea which fic it is?


** Pretty sure it's Life skills outside the curriculum by Endrina.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or HolzschuhkÃ¤se.
