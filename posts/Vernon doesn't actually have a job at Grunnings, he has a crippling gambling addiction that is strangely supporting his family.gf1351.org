** If it's supporting his family, then it's not a crippling addition, but being a self-employed workaholic.

*** In this example, it could be the case that the stress of almost losing everything could be causing anger issues. In which case it is still an addiction. I'd also argue that gambling is an issue whether you win or lose because you can't control the odds.

**** The odds in gambling are far more predictable and controllable than the odds in, say, investing in the stock market.

Now, I don't know about other games, but poker players who systematically win more than they lose are not uncommon. Those who are good enough to actually make a decent living doing it are far more rare. If Vernon is good enough that he can /provide a family of four with a middle- to upper-middle-class lifestyle/, then he has a superb understanding of odds and can shrug off short-term losses easily, because that's what it takes.

OK, now I want to see a fic in which Vernon plays in poker tournaments in Vegas and Monaco with a pretty good success rate, as well as earning some money on the side as a "sparring partner" for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_roller][high rollers]].

***** Yes, I thought so too - but Harry's magic kicks in with strong emotions, so my thought was that Vernon's gamboling was causing problems and so subconsciously Harry was protecting himself by causing Vernon to win. Only Vernon thinks its his own skill.

****** His winning streak would end as soon as Harry left home for good. Petunia would learn about the gambling and connect the good fortune to her nephew's presence. She and Lily used to hustle pool or bet on horses during their teen years.

I want a heist Harry Potter crossover now.

Gringotts?

That's nothing compared to what I used to do...

*** There's Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) where Hermione has a group of professional thieves including Mundungus Fletcher, Sirius and Sirius's OC girlfriend. There's more than 10 different, increasingly more difficult heists, from a small store in Knockturn all the way up to Gringotts. The strategy they use for the Davis heist is remarkably similar to how Ocean's team gets into the casino vault.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
