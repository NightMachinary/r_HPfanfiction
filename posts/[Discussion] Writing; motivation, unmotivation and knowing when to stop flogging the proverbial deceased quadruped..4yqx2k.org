Writing fanfiction was a bit of a lifeline for me at a time when I really needed something to hang on to and I have written quite a bit now, but I don't have much faith in my storytelling ability.

A couple of weeks ago I unexpectedly found myself strongly inspired to write a new story (specifically a CC fic) and I was really excited. It's over a year since I have been so fired up with ideas. But a fortnight on I'm taking a step back and considering whether it is worth the time and effort of finishing it because I think I have some good ideas, but I don't think I can do it justice and I rather think it would be better left to others.

I know that â€˜writing for yourself' is the apparently the ideal standard, but I have to admit to being shallow enough that two years of effectively writing for an audience of one is enough.

So do other people struggle with this sort of motivation? Specifically if there is hardly any audience for what you write, do you find the will to keep going or do you give up and move on?

Eh, not really. You aren't running a race. If you end up writing it, dislike it, and throw it away without publishing a word of it, then you should still be happy with what you managed to accomplish. Time you enjoyed wasting is not wasted time.

Take the good, leave the bad. For me, I do it because it's a fun, relaxing hobby that beats sitting on my arse watching television or films. If I ever stop enjoying it for whatever reason, I'll stop.

*** Well, yes, I don't (except in my darkest moments) regard any of it as a complete waste of time. If nothing else it's been good practise and an exercise in self-discipline (never one of my stronger traits, it has to be said). And I certainly agree that anything creative has got to be better for the mind (hopefully staving off the onset of dementia in my case) than watching tv.

When it comes to pleasing readers it's a bit more complicated. I quite like my own stories; if I didn't, there would be something badly wrong. At least I've always got something to read, I suppose. I am not professional enough to tailor what I write to someone else's taste though; I always twist things back to what I want to see, which is not what most other people want to see. Ha.

** I understand where you are coming from as I have multiple unfinished stories in various forms. One way that I have looked to address this is by writing one-shots as I can be confident that I will finish them.

** I used to be really nervous about writing fanfiction, and felt like I had to please the followers. I didn't want to update too late and really wanted the story to be perfect and it wasn't fun anymore, so I took a break and began writing on my own. Now that I've grown up a bit and have become more confident in my writing ability, I write for myself. It helps that I have fun with the story. I'm still nervous about what people will think about it, but not nearly as much as before. I say you should go for it. I've had trouble making sure I finish a story, so I began making myself write an outline for what happens before I write the story. That way, I'm no longer stalling about what happens next, but how to write it.

** I write because I like it, and my stories aren't popular. In the past I sometimes got depressed about that, but I will continue to write and I don't let a lack of comments spoil my fun. If you think someone else could better write your ideas, you could post a 'story' in which you explain them and let others pick an idea they want to write. That's how I got an idea for a story once as well, but I haven't finished it yet (it was my mistake, I think she could have better written it herself.)
