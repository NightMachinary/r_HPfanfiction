I want an MC who's main talent is being significantly stronger, tougher, and or faster than everyone else. I prefer the pairings to be a background kind of thing. Only m/f or f/f and they must be close to each other in age. At least 50k+ please.

Examples

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11779002/1/Invincible][Invincible]]- Harry is a viltrumite. Xover with Teen Titans. 110k+

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11871675/1/Young-Justice-Shazam][Young Justice: Shazam]]- Harry has Shazam powers. Xover with Young Justice. 102k+

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11631824/1/Unstoppable][Unstoppable!]]- Harry slowly gets Juggernaut powers. Xover with Marvel. 65k+

In a post Wizarding War world families are torn to shreds and in the middle of piecing themselves back together the Black Family, notoriously wicked for generations, is the target of Minister Fudge's wrath for a scapegoat to make it all go away. Only what he never expected was the uproar the youngest assumed dead member of the clan would unleash on him to ensure he rights all he has done against her family. Though soon enough she learns Fudge is only the tip of the iceberg, much bigger wicked fish are circling in those waters waiting for her to slip.

(Mc oc who is trained by Sirius and Regulus in Muggle hand to hand sparring and several fighting techniques to have an upper hand over Wizards their family knew would be sent after them.)
