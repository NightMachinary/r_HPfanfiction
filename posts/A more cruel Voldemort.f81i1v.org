At the end of the OOTP, Harry chases Bellatrix, but this time Hermione comes along.

When Voldemort shows up he quickly disarms Harry, and Harry calls to Hermione to do something, anything.

​

But she doesn't do anything. Voldemort turns and sees Hermione behind him, frozen in fear.

​

Hermione is still holding her wand but is too shocked to do anything.

Then Voldemort starts mocking her."When I went to Hogwarts, you actually had to be /brave/ to be a Gryffindor. I sympathize with the sorting hat really, I mean where's it supposed to put you! There's no house for *mudbloods*!"

​

He turns to Harry and starts mocking him. "*This* was the /great/ Hermione everyone's talking about? The smartest witch of her generation yet she doesn't have the wits to even move! Muggle sympathizers are stupid, they pretend mudbloods like her are real witches and wizards!"

​

"NO!" Screams Harry in defiance, " You're wrong! Hermione - Do so something! You can do it, don't believe him! You're the smartest! You memorized everything in the books in just 3 weeks!"

​

Hermione stays frozen. Voldemort laughs, the hollow high pitched laugh making Harry shiver in fear.

​

Hermione pales."And why wouldn't she!" he continues, "Our textbooks must read like fantasy to her, no wonder she stayed up memorizing OUR hard work, didn't you /Hermione!/ You're a thief, Hermione, just because you stole our brushes doesn't mean you're an artist! It means you're scum!"

​

He steps forward and raises his wand high."NO!" Harry leaps at Voldemort, consequences be damned, but Voldemort justs flicks a finger. Harry is blasted back into a wall and suddenly a tangle of black ropes wrap around him. He struggles, but yelps in pain when they sting him.She jumps back, backing against the wall, unsure what to do.

​

Her eyes remain locked on Voldemort's hand's but her lips and hand are petrified."Mudbloods can steal all the magic theory they want but you'll never steal the spirit to apply it!"

​

"Don't kill her! Don't touch her! I'll kill you!""And how are you meant to do that, Harry! You're useless, look at you, you can't do anything to help! Don't worry, I won't kill her. I'm merely going to prove a point

​

"Voldemort's wand is now touching Hermione's head. She grips her wand uselessly in her hand, she can't, she can't, gather up the strength to move.

​

"What are you doing." Harry quietly asks. "WHAT ARE YOU DOING!"Harry violently writhes in the ropes, but then screams in pain. He can do nothing but watch.

​

"Taking back what is ours. OBLIVIATE!"

​

Hermione screams, and tries to move out the way, but fails. 5 years of memory are suddenly inaccessible, locked up, hidden away. They're gone.She's whimpering, tripping backwards into the corner and falling over. Tears are running down her face and she's curled up in a ball. Someone's calling her name, but who?"

​

Mommy!" She cries, "MOMMY!"What is she doing here, what's going on, where is she, who are these people, what are they doing, what's going on...

​

"Does this look like a Gryfindor to you! Is this what YOU were like before you learned you were a wizard? In fact, let's play a game, let's see if she even picks up our books again now she knows what she is. Although, I suppose you're not going to live to see her fail, are you Potter?"

At this point, Dumbledore arrives and things continue on.

Hermione's lost something very precious to her, her knowledge. She has such pride in her knowledge that the best way to annihilate her belief in herself as a witch is to take away her knowledge and have her start from square 1 with the gnawing question in her mind, maybe all her theory is useless?Maybe muggleborns do lack something wizardborns have? Maybe the sorting hat really was putting her in a random house?.

Of course, this would hurt her. She and Harry and Ron would be shattered. But Voldemort isn't going to win this war! They're all just as determined to keep on, keep on fighting, even with the added heartbreak. Hermione'll have a hard time getting her knowledge back, fighting her traumas and doubts, rebuilding her relationship. Anyone in her place would. But with Ron and Harry's help, she wouldn't exactly recover, but she would get past it. (A kind of butterfly effect this might have is that she won't obliviate her parents, and therefore they are definitely in danger)

PLEASE MAKE THIS HAPPEN. PLEASE.

This idea was COMPLETELY made up by Uniquenameosaurus on youtube.


** Holy shit. This is an awesome and horrifying prompt. Apparently Hermione used a different spell than obliviate to modify her parent's memories so there is no cure for obliviate besides the dubious one of torture. Imagine a Hermione getting so desperate that she begs to be tortured by Harry and Ron to get her memories back, risking the Bertha results.

*** Imagine how many sleepless nights she'd have, how many days she'd be doubting her own existence. The concept made by uniquenameasaurus really does make voldemort a cruel villain. I'm sure that if done right, she'll be able to get back some of her power and help Harry defeat Voldemort.

*** Yeah. Silly me for adding it at the end, but I was afraid people would not bother reading it if they didn't get hooked at the start. I added a few things to smoothen it out, but it's all his idea.
