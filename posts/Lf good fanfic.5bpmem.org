  This is the first of a series of books I wrote for my kids set in the Harry Potter setting and occurring at the same time. These stories are meant to interweave seamlessly with the HP books and focus on characters primarily in the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses. The Tamblin books are a tad darker than the HP books, starting at about the level of the 3rd or 4th HP book.

*** I like this answer. Clearly the best fanfic is the fic that we write ourselves and everyone else's fic is a lesser work. So in a thread asking for the best, give your own work.

**** At no point did anybody ever ask for the best fanfiction. The OP asked for good fanfics. If the writer is proud of it and wants people to read it there's no reason for them not to post it. They never claimed it was the best fanfiction or even better than any other fic. Why do you feel the need to be such an asshole about it?

**** Because "Good fanfic" is not a good way to describe it, and just make's it harder in the long run to find you fics.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
