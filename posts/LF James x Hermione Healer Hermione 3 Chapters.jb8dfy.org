Hello! I'm looking for a James and Hermione fanfiction that I think was on AO3. It had 3 chapters and the author played with the ages just a little. Hermione went to a different school and was fast tracked to become a healer. She met James after an auror job gone bad. They started hooking up but he didn't realize how deep it was. He froze up whenever the anniversary of Lily's Death was approaching and hermione broke it off. Theo and Harry both make an appearance in the story. Thanks!
