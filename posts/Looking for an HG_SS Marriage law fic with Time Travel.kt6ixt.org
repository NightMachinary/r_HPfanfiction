Post-war, Snape is dead. A marriage law gets passed and Hermione and George decide they'll marry, but he ditches her at the last minute and leaves her with a time turner.


** I bookmarked this to look this morning because I'm almost certain I've read this (for once with a LF post). It's sadly not turning up so far though.

Just to make sure I'm thinking of the same story, practically everything with George happens and is over with by the end of the first chapter, right? And it's the day that they're to be wed that he leaves her with a note that he's moved out of Wizarding Britain? The rest of the story being time travel.

*** Yup! I almost want to say it was from ff.n, which would explain why I can't find it in my ao3 History.

**** I was thinking ffn too, but I cannot find it for the life of me. Even after going through my favorites, alerts, and reviews. Sorry I couldn't be of help in the end. I would have liked to reread it too...

****** That's awesome! Also ugh. I can't believe I couldn't find it when it was an author I'm fairly familiar with. I ended up spending way too much time yesterday looking. Glad you found it in the end though and thank you for sharing it!
