Tell me about your favorite ones so I can read them later.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

Unfortunately, the sequel ("Harry Potter and the Debts to Destiny") has not been updated in almost 10 years.

** If Bill doesn't need to be the main protagonist, Wakefan's Harry Potter and the Dance of Death is a good one.

In it, Bill is Harry's primary (living) tutor and kind of adopted him as a brother of sorts.
