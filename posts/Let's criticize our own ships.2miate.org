We're all being critical currently, but what about our own ships? What are some things about your fellow shippers that drive you batty? I am and always have been a Harmony shipper. But oftentimes I get bothered by so many things in fanfics.

- Like the general hatred of Molly, Ron, and Ginny.
- Harry and Hermione often are super self aware of everything and almost written as adults (I can make the argument and have accepted that their upbringings has aged them emotionally but only to a point).
- Harry suddenly becoming super studious ONLY because of Hermione and not on any will of his own
- Dumbledore trying to keep them apart only to continue to use Harry for the greater good (I've seen so many variations on "Harry wont be willing to sacrifice himself if he has Hermione)
- Love potioning Weasles

So what are the common themes in your corners of the fandom?


** I'm a big fan of the idea of Harry/Fleur, but really dislike what people tend to do with the idea of veela (veela mating, veela life debts, soul bonds, etc.) I think Fleur's an interesting enough character that you actually do her a disservice by making it all about her veela heritage.

  "You saved my life!" Angelina cried, hugging Harry tightly. He felt a strange tingling sensation. "Don't you know what this means, Harry? When you save a black girl's life, she's bound to you for life!"

  Harry blinked. "You mean... like a slave?"

  "That's right!" Angelina said cheerfully, "a sex slave, to be precise!"

  Harry could only imagine how Hermione would react.

**** Well. The Lie I've Lived manages to avoid Veela nonsense. I wouldn't go so far as to say it does it well. Fleur is still incredibly objectified, to the point that Harry first properly encounters her by massively breaching her right to privacy.

But, when Fleur later finds out about this, of course she can't be allowed the agency to be disgusted by the betrayal of trust. No, she's Harry's Love Interest and therefore nothing Harry does can be bad. Her entire purpose of existing is to make Harry more awesome, so of course she can't react to Harry's behaviour realistically.

***** All very fair criticisms.

In the end I like that there is the illusion of a personality for me. In the end I mainly read fanfics not for high quality but for easy entertainment and The Lie I've Lived is 100% easy entertainment for me. The way she ignores the whole Pronghorn thingie was an issue for me, but I got distracted by the awesomeness of the conflict afterwards.

The relationship might still be forced, but the story is at least not flat out screaming "THIS IS FORCED ON THE CHARACTERS, WHAT IS FREE AGENCY"

It's not high quality, but it is good fun for me.

** Harry is waaay too immature for a relationship in the canon series. That much is clear. Asking Hermione (or anyone else) to the ball 4th year doesn't fix this. He isn't there emotionally, even in book seven, and has zero positive dating role-models in canon. Almost no Harry and Hermione shippers and writers notice or care about this.

I should know. I've read (almost) them all.

I think that's why Harry//X/ soul bond fics are so popular; they "fix" this glaring problem.

Bridging the gap with Hermione is the worst, though. Hermione's character alone, even after school, isn't enough to drag Harry into a positive relationship. This is partially demonstrated in the tent scenes after Ron leaves. Hermione just can't deal by herself with the mess that is Harry Potter.

You need something else in the story to connect the two. A non-canon event, a long AU lead-in, a reason for them to spend time together growing as people, /something/.

That's why HHr sucks a lot of the time. It has even less direct canon support than the actual canon relationships (which is not much in the first place) and is usually not well supported in the fanfic world building, even in early-change AUs.

And I'm sorry, Hermione just doesn't have a Magical Vagina of Therapy any more than Harry has a Magical Penis of Sexual Experience. That doesn't solve anything, relationship building-wise. Not between adults or teenagers.

*** Sad to admit, but it really is a stretch. Harry may have survived hostile action and made life-changing decisions, but as far as relationships go he's operating from a educational deficit.

Tonks by comparison is a fully-enabled witch with a premium skillset and level of authority despite her youth and somewhat bubbly affect. Sure, she'd be great for Harry in many ways, but it's a rare story that can come up with a /good/ reason why Harry would be great for her. Most default to a fortunate moment of accidental honesty- 'I don't want you to be someone else for me; I just thought you'd like to not have to keep up a false identity'.

The only thing that makes it work is that Remus is even worse for her than Harry would be.

** Also Harmony, and I think the ship name sums up one of the issues... Most FF.net HHr stories have powerful Harry/Hermione that rarely fight or disagree on anything, usually with Hermione finding answers to every problem. I can't believe 12-year-olds speaking like adults and loving like adults. The character bashing and other tropes have been mentioned so I won't repeat them.

Also, some of the stories are so AU or contain completely OOC HHr that you can't really call it Harmony anymore. Incredibly athletic and fit Hermione? Stupid/submissive Hermione? A bigoted, arrogant Harry? An outgoing, charming Harry? That's just H/G or James/Lily or Draco/Hermione under the names of Harry and Hermione. I can't read stories with unrealistic characterisations in general.

But Dumbledore doesn't need to be a dark lord, Ginny doesn't need to be a crazed stalker, and Ron doesn't need to be moronically oblivious all the time, and certainly not all three at the same time.

Well, Ron did abandon Harry when he thought he put his name into the goblet AND in the forest of dean. So for Ron to abandon a "best friend" because said friend does something he doesn't like isn't that unusual. But Harry abandoning someone is a whole other story, especially because he knows how it is if people just abandon you over something stupid.

** SSHG

- The sheer amount of plots where Hermione becomes Snape's slave/he's forced to rape her because of Death Eaters blah blah blah. Never read a good one of those.
- When when the author continually reminds us that they are "former teacher" or "former student." Or that she's usually at least 18. The world's not going to break if she 16 or 17. Call me sick, but part of the appeal of this ship for me is the teacher/student, age-difference-y thing. And not many authors can come up with convincing post-war scenarios where Snape lives. Most of them are pretty lame. Bring me the flouncing of authoritative positions, man! (but please note that this isn't a necessary; i've read some really good post-hogwarts scenarios and loved them to bits)
- I like banter, but god please not all of the dialogue's going to be banter.
- The much over-used WE MUST FIGHT AGAINST VOLDEMORT BY MAKING A RANDOM POTION TOGETHER plot. Dear lord.
- Sex god!Snape. Sex goddess!Hermione.
- Their relationship's definitely not going to be smooth, or perfect, or anything like that, so please don't portray it that way. Ew.

*** I agree with everything you wrote and I wanted to add that school age (17-19) Hermione is written way too maturely in regards to knowledge of how relationships work in most SS/HG fics than what she should be.

Her only canon relationship experience was her time with Victor Krum and maybe some on/off again flirting with Ron. There is NO WAY she should be the relationship sage she is portrayed in many SS/HG fics.

I read one Hogwarts era fic where she gave relationship advice to Harry, Draco, Tonks, and Lupin as well as navigated her way perfectly around Snape's sour moods. Authors tend to write her with a level of relationship experience comparable to one who is 25 to 30 years old and not of an inexperienced ~18 year old.

What bothers me often is that writers don't make Tom psychopathic enough, or (even more often) make Harry too clever. I'm not a big fan of superanything!Harry. Just because the Hat said he'd do well in Slytherin doesn't mean he can hate-banter with 1940's Tom on his first day in Slytherin House and impress anybody. I get that banter is all kinds of fun to write, but Harry needed Felix Felicis to stop scaring off Slughorn with his obvious stalking. A story needs more buildup than that. The appeal of this pairing is the transformation needed to achieve it, much like SS/HG.

** H/Hr is my favorite, mainly because Hermione is the best character and Harry is at least not that bad. But those go hand in hand with overpowered Harry and a lobotomized Hermione who has no priorities or concerns beyond helping Harry. I mean, yeah, killing Voldemort is kind of important, but whenever we have this pairing, it seems Hermione wants to help kill Voldemort only because it helps Harry. Um, hello? Evil dude who's killed dozens or thousands, depending on how math applies to the wizarding population, and who specifically thinks that you should die and will probably make it painful. Nah, that doesn't matter. The important thing is that he wants to kill Harry.

Of course, all het ships involving Harry have that tendency. The choice of pairing is mainly for flavor, or more precisely, what hair color the author most likes. It's just more noticeable with Hermione because she's got a lot of screen time and personality in the original.

The more realistic way for H/Hr to go is for Hermione to take charge. Harry's the muscle, Hermione's the brains. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]] follows this pattern: Hermione drags Harry into helping with her Runes project, and she's leading or even with Harry at all times.

** I absolutely love Hermione/Sirius and Hermione/Remus (of age/ post school or Time Turner same age).

But. In most of what I've read, Hermione goes from being her canon bookworm guarded self to basically public sex and raunchiness. There's nothing wrong with the latter, but it's such a drastic and unnecessary and SO COMMON thing that it sucks.

Or with Remus. They forget that he was a troublemaking Marauder. He's probably not gonna sit on a couch reading and tending to his partner all day. Plus they never mention the trauma of losing everyone he cared about in a day at 21. And he's always lie 'but I'm a werewolf and not allowed to be happy ever' or some shit about werewolves only having one magically determined mate for life. What happens if a happily married adult with a family gets bitten, does he magically have a new magically bound mate? Is he forced to seek out the first person he ever had sex with? Does he die for having more than one 'mate'?

With Sirius, the mental illness is always forgotten. As a teenager he was in an unhealthy home and ran away to James. At 21, literally his entire life fell apart over the course of not even twenty four hours. And he's either extremely promiscuous as a teenager/young adult, or constantly drunk as an adult. Lets get some variety, K? We only know in canon what Harry sees or is told, we don't actually know /who/ he was, so let's stop conforming to firewhisky every day and a different woman faster than he changes his boxers.

I enjoy some Neville/Luna, but they tend to start him off as a blubbering fool or macho and confident. Luna can magically see everything normal people can't! Auras, magical creatures that don't actually exist, through your clothing, magical residue, oh oh she's a Seer too! Omg Luna.

I really like Sirius/Remus, but most of what I read downplays the 'prank' so much it disgusts me. I really really don't believe Remus or James would've forgiven Sirius after even a few months, and I think it would've been tense for quite a while and maybe never go back to how it was. The prank really shouldn't ever be used as a catalyst for a romantic relationship. No. Honey, you just used your crush in an attempted murder, that's not romantic.

Edit to add: why does nobody ever freak the fuck out over Hermione dating someone old enough to be her dad? Sure, there's a few, but there's gotta be at least some Weasley rage in there somewhere! You can NOT tell me that everyone would be accepting or happy about it. There would be accusations and screaming and 'I forbid this' going around... Quite a drama fest. I don't see it enough.

** Harry/Fleur Harry is immune to her allure so obviously they have to be together.
