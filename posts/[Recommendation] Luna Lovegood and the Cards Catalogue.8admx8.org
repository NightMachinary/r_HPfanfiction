Idly sifting through old, 2000's fics on fanfiction.net, I happened upon this lovely one-shot: linkffn(3554180). It primarily features Luna, with Ginny as a secondary character, has quite a creative concept behind it, and is (amazingly) still wholly canon-compatible to this day. I can't say much more about it without spoiling the idea more than my title did, but really, give it a read, it's just 3k words long, after all. Not perfect, but very nice indeed.

  Luna Lovegood has a strong suspicion that the card catalogue in the Hogwarts library was sentient. Ginny is quite, quite sure that she's insane. What if they are both right?
