I was wondering what rating Ron would have in chess?

People below 1200 are considered novice.

1200-1399 rating is usually a beginner

1400-1599 is considered average for a tournament player

1600-1799 is considered to be above average

1800-1999 is considered to be a strong player

2000-2199 is considered an extremely strong or expert player

2200-2399 is considered Master and is the strongest amateur rank

2400-2499 is considered International Master

2500+ is considered Grand Master.

I was wondering if J.K. Rowling ever specified what rank or rating Ron is at? If not, can anyone make an educated guess.


** Well, if you go off the movie, I believe the game Ron plays against Minerva was created by an International Master.

** In principle, Philosopher's Stone makes the most sense if Ron is some kind of prodigy. To the argument advanced by [[/u/EffectiveAudience9][u/EffectiveAudience9]], well not the ELO argument the Ron one, we know that Ron is pretty obsessive about Quidditch. Given Ron's realistically only got the three interests (Quidditch, Chocolate Frog Cards and Chess) and he's actually pretty nerdy about 2/3 of them I think the only reasons to imagine Ron doesn't study chess are (a) wizards have never had the idea to and (b) the Weasleys don't buy chess books on their budget.

That being said, Ron never seems leagues ahead of anyone he plays. This suggests:

1. Ron's not actually that fantastic, just good... and the Philosopher's Stone is not particularly well protected
2. Harry (in particular) really doesn't mind how badly he loses... or notices he loses badly
3. Ron takes any particular opportunity to be notable and holds on to it with all his might (which might explain why he's such a die hard Chudley Cannons fan even though literally no-one else seems to be)
4. Ron just really likes playing chess, no matter how easy it is
5. Some combination

Given 3 is pretty much a description of Ron's character, I think it's either 3 or 5. Given the books make the most logical sense if Ron's good, the question then becomes how difficult a match McGonagall thought was necessary to provide security. I would put this as the strongest amateur rank on the basis a professional chess player's also being a thief is... unlikely.

Regardless, I think Ron's underdeveloped and not as good as he could be.

** I personally think the ELO rating is very flawed in evaluating the ability of a chess player against the general population. This is largely because all the stats on the Elo system are based on data that is collected from people who actually have an Elo rating, which are typically also people who are better than average at chess. To use myself as an example I can beat literally everyone I know in real life at chess but I'm only rated around 1k, maybe 1100 on a really really good day. I know the general basic theory of chess but I don't study lines or endgames or anything like that.

Ron would probably come in around 1200-1400 Elo. Honestly to get any higher than that you have to study the theory and strategy of the game. Which I just don't see him doing the way he was characterized.

*** Very good point with the system being flawed, I have the same problem irl, except my maths teacher can absolutely destroy anyone he comes across

I'm at around 1250 to 1300 on a good day, it really depends on what site you're using to play, because chess.com starts at 1000 and lichess at 1500 it's ridiculous
