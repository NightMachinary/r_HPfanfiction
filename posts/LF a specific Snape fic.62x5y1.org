Dumbledore locked Harry and Snape into the Room of Requirement until they could have a better relationship. I remember that there was one part where they were thrown into each other's memories, but I don't remember anything else. Does anyone know what fic this is?


** Possibly linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3625984/1/A-Place-for-Warriors]]) by owlsaway? It's been long enough since I read it that I don't remember whether there's a scene like the one you describe.

  Dumbledore locks Harry and Snape in the Room of Requirement. Harry's magic works, and Snape's doesn't. Will they kill each other? No slash.

*** This is the fic. They both see Harry's memory of Dudley's missing Dinosaur and Snape's memory where child Snape delivered money to someone who smacked him with a ring on his hand, and then saw Lily at the park.
