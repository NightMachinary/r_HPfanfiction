Does anyone have any Dark Lord!Harry fanfics. I would like them to be Tomarry but it's okay if they're not. Things like MoD!Harry, or powerful!Harry but not too OP are appreciated. Things like â€˜The Rise of a Dark Lord' by Little.Miss.Xanda or â€˜Again and Again' by Athey or â€˜Death is but the Next Great Adventure' by TheObsidianQuill would be nice.

Thanks


** Lol there are quite a lot
