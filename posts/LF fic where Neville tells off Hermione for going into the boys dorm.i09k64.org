:END:
It was one of those OP!Harry fics. Hermione was regularly entering the boys' dorm and Neville called her out on it either 2nd or 3rd year, saying that the boys' dorms aren't warded because no self-respecting girl would go up there anyway, and that she wouldn't still be McGonagall's favourite student if she knew about it.

Oh, and there was a scene where Percy called her a scarlet woman or something like that, but that's all I can remember.

*** The Percy scarlet woman scene wasn't serious as far as I remember. I thought it was hilarious when I read it, because Harry kept implying it to Percy, and Hermione's completely innocent actions were being taken way out of hand.
