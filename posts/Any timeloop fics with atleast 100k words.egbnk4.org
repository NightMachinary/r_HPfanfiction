I'm looking for something that is quite long but has decent quality


** If you're not opposed to original fiction, I highly recommend Mother of Learning. It is about a young mage studying at mage university, who becomes stuck in a time loop. He uses it to become stronger and hopes to eventually escape. The fic clocks in at about 700k words if I remember correctly, and the final chapter is due for December/January.

*** This was my first thought too. I 'finished' reading it when it was only about 400k words and can't bring myself to read it again, though the writing is excellent.

My boyfriend has since read it through and LOVES it. Definitely give it a try if you want a time loop read.

It's good enough to be published as its own book, and long enough that presumably it never will be. :)

Harry loops back when he dies... I think I dropped it after either Voldemort also looping or Harry getting to a checkpoint.

Unsure which but both do tick the 'stuff don't work out'-category for me... which I don't enjoy. (was a good fic tho. and you might enjoy it more)

(note: don't remember if Voldy looped in this one, quite sure Harry reached a checkpoint)

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...
