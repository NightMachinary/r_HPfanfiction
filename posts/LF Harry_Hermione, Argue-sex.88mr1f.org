Doesnt have to be a H/Hr Fic. They have a Fight and in the heat kissing, snogging and shagging. I imagined a scenario when during the Horcrux Hunt, Ron is getting hit by a spell or something and while Hermione wants to help him, Harry claims to escape. Its unclear if Ron survived or not, but Hermione is angry at Harry an accuses him on multiple times during their travel about this. It might heat in hate-sex, although i wouldnt call it that...or wouldnt let it get so far. But i guess, my intention is clear. Possibly unresolved sexual tension, until they have to get it out of their system.

If its a long Fic, i would like to know the passage/chapter
