Some baddy (Umbridge, a Dursley, Voldemort even) either through time-travel, alternate dimension travel or whatever, decides not only to not do bad things anymore but actively make up for what they've done. Preferably with major AU due to their actions, not plot regurgitation.

Slash, bashing and crossovers are fine. Please no mpreg, harems, romance/smut-driven plot, pottercest or genderbending. Thank you!

Side note: If anyone knows the name of the fic where I think it's Vernon who goes back in time to stop Harry from dying in a fire, that'd be great

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

** There was one where Dudley had a witch daughter and he reconnects with Harry, makes up for his wrongdoings, and Harry helps him with his parenting. If I recall correctly, it was inspired by a tumblr post.

** linkffn(Perfectly Normal, thank you very much) might be one example.

Generally search for Harry and Dudley stories on FFN, they usually redeem Dudley.

** Linkffn(benefits of the old laws)

It has a very interesting take on what you're looking for, where Voldemort is making up for things he's done but also to further his personal goals.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upsite down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
