I've worked on a few Harry Potter & RWBY crossovers before, but on one of the ideas I've been working on lately that's a bit different since the first part of the story is set in the Harry Potter universe before going over to Remnant, I've been struggling on figuring out a weapon for Harry. I want him to remain a caster primarily (since he's obviously been trained in magic for years), but I want a melee component as well. I was thinking some kind of sword? I'm planning on his semblance to be some kind of intangibility (a bit like Kitty Pryde from Marvel / x-men). I'm also trying to figure out if like most RWBY weapons, it should have some kind of gun form, but idk if that would fit Harry really, especially since he still has magic for longer range. I just want something that would fit Harry's personality and physique and would give him a unique but cool fighting style. If anyone has any ideas, let me know. Thanks.


** Guncasting. That way you get both Bullets, and spells. like a Gunmage from Final Fantasy, actively shoot out the spells, but it also gives him the option for Dust Ammo. Hybrid with a Sword form, british style long/broadsword (like the Sword of Gryffindor, or actually the Sword of Gryffindor used in the construction if you want to go that route) When you say Intangibility do you mean more like Kamui? Active Shadowcat Phasing would be OP AF, he could phase his Sword partially into Grimm and ignore their armour, and he wouldn't be able to offensively use his semblance in Combat Class or it'd bypass Aura and kill people (as much as that should happen to Cardin)

*** that could be a cool idea. I actually sort of like the gun casting idea. Any ideas on what kind of gun? And how it would transform. I originally was thinking of him getting the goblins to somehow help with it's construction before he goes to Remnant but I was leery of the doing the whole "nice goblins" trope and was trying to figure out how he'd get them to help. I guess he could just buy their services but they'd expect the weapon back after Harry died, though if he's in another universe I guess they'd be screwed on that. lol. I wasn't sure if Goblins would have enough tech to make a trasnforming weapon either, unless they just forge the blade.

I was also considering some kind of staff/lance thing but wasn't sure about that.

I was also considering maybe making it, so at least he has a weakness with his semblance, that if he tried to phase something through aura and turn back solid it would hurt him but idk. I haven't decided on that and just drop it.

**** Make it a weaker Kamui. He can phase through attacks but it costs aura, so it would only last a few minutes at most. So even if Cinder Fall blasts him with more fire than he can dodge or apparate away from in time, he can phase it, but it tanks his Aura pretty fast. That's both fair and balanced. Even if you made it unable to phase through Aura, it'd still let him 1shot every Grimm with your idea.

Let him buy the Materials from the Goblins and craft it himself. Goblin Steel is better than RWBY Metal. You could have the Weapon absorb dust, and keep all of the dust propertie.

As for the type of Gun and how it transforms... That I'm unsure on. To get a Sword length it'd have to be some kind of Rifle or Shotgun. Magical AK47?

***** That seems like a good idea, will probably do something like that. That might also work (the buying the steel bit). As for the gun, I'm sort of partial to a smaller gun, like a hand gun of somekind, but I don't know how that would transform unto a sword, unless the blade could like extend out and fold up. Idk.

****** Or you could go Sword and Board like Jaune, Shield shrinks into a Gun, and the Sword is seperate (and actually the Sword of Gryffindor, if you want)

******* Yeah, that could also work. I did originally think I might have Harry practice and learn how to cast a localized protego with his off hand that he could summon up as a magic shield, but using a firearm off hand could also work with Sword of Gryffindor main hand. There's so many options. lol.

** I'm a RWBY novice, so I don't know /that/ much about the kinds of weapons in the show (I've only watched a little over half of volume 1). But, I've always viewed Harry as someone who will try to hold back against an opponent until he is given no other option but to attack. So, I feel like some sort of shield that is charmed with all sorts of "battle charms" (or something like that) could be cool. And, because this is Harry Potter we're talking about, I'm sure he could learn how to turn a shield into a fine offensive weapon when needed. Hope that helps.

I really have enjoyed your crossovers (and your other fics too) so I'm anxious to see what you come up with.

*** That's an interesting idea. Thanks. And thank you as well for the compliment. I'm glad you've enjoyed my other ideas. This new one came to me a while ago and hasn't been leaving me alone so I started writing it. It's different from my others since it starts at the beginning of Deathly Hallows and the end of volume 3 of RWBY. It will have a RWBY character ending up on Earth for a while and eventually involve Harry going to Remnant.

** Go with Gryffindor's Sword. It's gun form could be having the sword's blade separate in half vertically and he can cast just a couple of offensive spells out the opening (Stunning Spell, maybe Disarming Charm). Since the sword is essentially unbreakable and is enchanted to automatically add to itself the properties of any stronger substance it touches, it'd be pretty great.

Maybe instead of intangibility you could make Harry's semblance work off of the sacrificial enchantment Lily left in his blood. He could temporarily select one single opponent to become immune to damage from due to a selective magical barrier. That one person cannot harm him by any means while in effect. But as a side effect, Harry cannot attack that person while the barrier is up as a trade off (the barrier would block any attack intended to target that other person). This, of course, means others besides that one person could still attack him and he could still attack them.

** To start i would like to say that i Love your stories. Harry's weapon is not that important since magic will be how he makes himselft important to the plot and if you are writing him whitout formal training would no make much sence having a complex weapon, unlike your weiss\cimder\hp fic. I would suggest a one handed\wand comb with a shotgun module for short range.

You could make his semblance Luck xD

** Make the weapon be a device that combines dust with magic to create a solid blade, like maybe a large baton when not in use and have it project a blade construct when active, it could have multiple modes and would essentially be a shape shifting weapon limited only by dust for fuel and harry's own magical reserves.

** If you are at all familiar with the dark souls series, you could always go for something more like the Farron flash sword. Rather then carry a traditional blade, harry could instead have some sort of casing/device he could pop his wand into, and uses it to project a blade of pure magic. you could also make it so he could manipulate the length/width/shape of the blade, based upon how much magic he is pushing thought it at the time.

As for the gun, idk. I kinda think it would be cool to have some sort of enchanted gauntlet or made up spell or whatever that could be used to summon an endless stream of metal flechettes or something. If you wanna keep him balanced, giving him Dust weaponry seems a tad overkill to me.
