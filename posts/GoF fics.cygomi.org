I really enjoy stories involving an alternate 4th year. And if a romantic story is thrown in then it's all the better. I finished Gods Amongst Men by Slimah and it was the best thing I've read in a while. So if anybody could help me find something like that it'd be awesome

It can start anytime between the end of third year and when Harry's name comes out of the goblet

I'm fond of fics where Harry becomes powerful but it's not a requirement

I'd rather it be lengthy and completed but incomplete ones work just as well

(Sorry if any part of this seems odd, it's my first time on this subreddit)

Hermione casts a spell to let her know if Harry is in danger, it confuses the Goblet so her name comes out instead of Harry's. Good, complete.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon) features an entirely different tournament, time travel in a loop, and Harry/Hermione. It's unfinished but has basically three full loops completed in it

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) is a complete work that goes up to the end of 4th year (though I think there was an abandoned sequel that was supposed to comprise 5th year). It starts at the end of 3rd year. Harry receives the memories of his father. There is romance and Harry is powerful but not OP. This author writes the best Quidditch scenes and also does really good action scenes.

My personal favorite fic that involves GoF stuff is linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) it's Harry Potter in the style of Ender's Game. It's a really well done AU where after the 1st Wizarding war against Voldemort, Hogwarts gets significantly more militarized and it's curriculum becomes much more combat based. It starts in the beginning of 3rd year, but GoF stuff takes up the last half of the work. There is romance, but not much, Harry is again powerful but not OP. Dark with lots of mystery and plot twists and turns in this one; combat is also well written. In progress, updates bi-annually, but the tournament has been finished.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13035363/1/I-m-back]]) is a fic that borrows heavily from kathryn518's I'm still here but does a better job of it in my opinion. Harry time travels to 4th year but quickly realizes that he's in an alternate world where there is a Girl-Who-Lived. Incomplete but very well written and worth the time.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here]]) the original. Again, IMO I'm Back does a better job but I'm Still Here was written a few years prior. Incomplete.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

Harry gets adopted by the Tonks after a slightly altered 3rd year (story starts on the last day of the third year). Focused on family and friendship, even though there is a romantic subplot. Ongoing and updating.
