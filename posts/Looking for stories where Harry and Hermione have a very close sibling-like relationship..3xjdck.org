** I haven't finished it, but Accidental Animagus should definitely fit the criterion of a very close sibling-like relationship.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth.

** *Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925), has Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Luna traveling to a different dimension where things were a lot better. Although Ron and Ginny were dead, Harry and Hermione maintained a sibling like relationship throughout the story. I really really love that Hermione.

*Three Turns*, linkffn(9757451), Harry never hooked up with anyone, while Hermione fell for Remus Lupin in this story.

*Strawberry Fields*, linkffn(4940094), Dr Who sent Harry to the Grangers for adoption. A nice one shot

  "What we need," Dumbledore said slowly, "is more time." He looked at his watch, "three turns should do it, Miss Granger. Good luck." Only Lady Luck wasn't on time. Time went back, but not to when it should have. "Well, we came from the future, but apparently it wasn't two hours ago as we first thought and if that really is Remus Lupin, I'd wager we went back twenty years..." AU

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** linkffn(9591005) Champion by OctaviusOwl. In this story, muggleborns are taken from their families and placed in orphanages when it's discovered they can do magic. Harry and Lily meet Hermione after she's taken (age 8, I think) and Lily adopts her almost immediately. While it is fairly central to the story, it isn't the main plot point.
