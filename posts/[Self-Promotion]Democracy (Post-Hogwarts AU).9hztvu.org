This story is set in an Alternate Universe. The society of Wizarding Britain is different and a number of characters will behave differently as well. Notably, the Wizengamot is composed of hereditary and appointed seats, some of them (those for recipients of an Order of Merlin, First Class) for life.

** A very interesting premise, but it's going to be insanely hard to make Hermione succeed at this while being believable. Radicals need followers, and unless you plan to make Wizarding Britain have way more muggleborns than canon (which, honestly, is just cheating), I don't see how Hermione's getting them, no matter how much the name of Harry Potter draws.

Also, preemptive criticism, but if you make Neville [[/spoiler][change almost all of his positions just by reading muggle books]] that's going to be ludicrously cheap, too. But I assume that's not going to happen. Hope this is a good one, revolutions are always fun.

*** I assume, in this story, that there are 20% muggleborns, 30% purebloods, and 50% half-bloods. (In canon, Ron claims that "most wizards these days are half-bloods".)

And don't worry - Neville stood up to Voldemort and spit in his face. He won't change his opinion because he read a few books.

**** I believe canon has it at closer to 10% or even less, doesn't it? In Harry's whole year, there's only Hermione and Finch-Fletchley. Even being generous, that's not more than 10%. And that's /before/ the war, in which presumably many Muggleborns were hunted down. I mean, obviously it's fanfic, you can write it however you want- just wanted to check how much of an AU it is.

Great about Neville, thanks.

** "status quo ante"? After the *Second* war?

I feel it's one more "everyone is stupid except MCs" story...

[Edit]: I haven't even needed to open the first chapter. One of the reviews has a quote:

#+begin_quote
  "So, you think the muggleborns should be content to let purebloods - a select few purebloods, at that - rule the country?" She actually sneered at him. He clenched his teeth. "If you don't like it, why don't you leave the country?" he snapped. "And go where?" She tilted her head. "To another country ruled by purebloods? Where Dumbledore didn't spend a few decades improving things for us? Maybe North America, so we can be at war with a dozen enclaves ruled by radical pureblood bigots when we're not fighting the Native Shamans? Hm?" She shook her head. "We didn't fight Voldemort just so we'd remain second-class citizens. Or fourth-class citizens. Can't forget that most purebloods and all half-bloods don't have a say in who rules them either." "I didn't fight Voldemort to see my country torn down by ill-thought-out proposals," Neville snarled.
#+end_quote

Yes, it's again "Everyone is stupid except the Great Hermione Granger and her minions".

Not mentioning that in the described world (I believe it's the similar to "Patron") Voldemort's motion against muggleborns is meaningless, because they are already rightless under pureblood ruling. And with changing the war's premise the butterfly effect changes everything else and therefore Hermione's position is just a wish of one of many muggleborns. Nothing more. Sad, but true.

Also Neville can alway advice her or any other muggleborn to return the their muggle world if they don't like the Magical one.

*** I'm not really sure I see the problem. Even in canon, being a Muggleborn and a Half-Blood in the U.S. would be even worse than in Wizarding Britain (outside of the wartime periods) because Rappaport's Law had been in effect for centuries until some time in the sixties. It's not really an out there idea.

On the Pottermor or HP.wikia I haven't found any evidence of mistreatment of muggleborns (or to be precise No-Maj-borns). Moreover Pottermore provides an example of a very successful No-Maj-born wandmaker.

But it doesn't really matter. As I see the author uses here his own AU where muggleborns mistreated everywhere in the world and the only place where it's changing is Magical Britain, because the Great HG lives there.

It's an obvious pattern in his stories.

***** Aside from us not having much direct scenarios involving U.S. muggleborns, you might have tried looking up Rappaport's Law.

#+begin_quote
  Dorcus's indiscretions led to the introduction of Rappaport's Law. Rappaport's Law enforced strict segregation between the No-Maj and wizarding communities. Wizards were /no longer allowed to befriend or marry No-Majs/. Penalties for fraternising with No-Majs were harsh. Communication with No-Majs was limited to that necessary to perform daily activities. [...]

  In Europe, witches and wizards married and were friends with No-Majs; in America, No-Majs were increasingly regarded as the enemy. In short, Rappaport's Law drove the American wizarding community, already dealing with an unusually suspicious No-Maj population, still deeper underground.
#+end_quote

Remember, a large part of why wizards (especially purebloods) dislike Muggles is the view that they're inferior. For centuries U.S. wizards were legally not even allowed to interact with muggles, and thus Half-Blood were by definition illegal and basically didn't exist for wizards from the U.S.. Anything coming from Muggles was suspect, disliked and avoided. It takes no great stretch to see that as a even worse in some respects that wizard Britain. Also this:

#+begin_quote
  Moreover Pottermore provides an example of a very successful No-Maj-born wandmaker.
#+end_quote

Was before Rappaport's Law. Afterwards wizards couldn't even interact with Muggles beyond the barest needed to do a job they had. At least until the sixties.

#+begin_quote
  But it doesn't really matter. As I see the author uses here his own AU where muggleborns mistreated everywhere in the world and the only place where it's changing is Magical Britain, because the Great HG lives there.
#+end_quote

Whether or not it's true, the backup you used in making that seem foolish was wrong. Muggleborns are generally mistreated. And in this case, isn't it Neville doing the bulk of the work?

No, they aren't illegal. Half-Bloods have some muggle heritage, Harry Potter is Half-Blood, because his mother is muggleborn, not a muggle. Accepting muggleborns into community leads to Half-Bloods. No muggles are needed.

#+begin_quote
  Was before Rappaport's Law
#+end_quote

No. [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/1920s-wizarding-america-en][Pottermore]] tells us about one in early 20th century:

#+begin_quote
  Johannes Jonker, a Muggle-born wizard whose No-Maj father was an accomplished cabinet maker, turned himself into an accomplished wandmaker. His wands were highly sought after and instantly recognisable, as they were usually inlaid with mother-of-pearl.
#+end_quote

Rappaport's Law is all about interactions with No-Maj. It has nothing to do with No-Maj-borns. Unfortunately we don't know how No-Maj parents are handled, but nothing in canon and Pottermore shows that No-Maj-borns are mistreated in US.

***** You haven't really looked, I see. [[https://www.pottermore.com/features/things-you-may-not-have-noticed-about-hermione][Pottermore]] tells us straight that "In the end, she managed to do both. Driven by her earlier efforts to liberate house-elves, one of Hermione's early jobs post-Hogwarts was at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures to further their cause. After that, she went directly against what she said to Scrimgeour and worked in the actual Department of Magical Law Enforcement where she became ‘a progressive voice who ensured the eradication of oppressive, pro-pureblood laws'."

Nota bene that this was years after the war - this wasn't a case of "Oh, we need to get rid of the laws Vodlemort^{'s} regime passed".

Pattern. Or overused tropes.

The thing is that you actually /gave the context/ in the summary and here in a parallel thread.

Neville's words are too obviously wrong and clearly show your bias against him. The story haven't even started, but outcome is already clear. Take into account that Riddle's movement against muggleborns is ridiculous in your world (to get rid of slaves? Really?) and any serious political debate becomes impossible, because there's no consistent history it can be based on.

***** Wow, you do prove me right. Muggleborns weren't slaves - just a minority disliked by a large part of the population. Which, as anyone who knows a little about politics, knows are likely to be the focal point of radical movements - see: Antisemitism, and racism.

****** Ok, I should have put the world 'slaves' in quotes. But I wasn't far away:

#+begin_quote
  She shook her head. "We didn't fight Voldemort just so we'd remain second-class citizens. Or fourth-class citizens..."
#+end_quote

It is stated in the story.

#+begin_quote
  Muggleborns weren't slaves - just a minority unliked by a large part of the population.
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  I assume, in this story, that there are 20% muggleborns, 30% purebloods, and 50% half-bloods.
#+end_quote

So you're talking that even majority of half-bloods (who knowingly has muggles in their heritage) dislike muggleborns for... what?

The summary tells us that the story is going to be a political drama. But politics is inseparable from history and your world lacks it. Again you are ignoring the biggest hole in your world: *two* wars with Riddle. The first thing a reasonable politic would do is to analyse why they happened, especially is such short timeframe.

Riddle was just a man who wanted power. But why did he almost succeed? Who followed him? Why did they follow him? Where did he get resources from? If purebloods are already on the top of your world, they didn't have any reasons to follow him. Moreover Riddle was the direct threat to them. In the world you're describing the more logical way for him is to attract resourceful Half-Bloods, who doesn't like pureblood's ruling, and muggleborns as men-power.

Absence of proper history makes any debates meaningless, because nothing can be said outside "We always lived that way" by one side and "It's wrong, because we don't like it" by another one. The quoted dialog is all about it.

  You really shouldn't try to talk about a work you haven't read.

Knowing your other stories and your favourite tropes I expressed my opinion about that one. The quote from the first chapter shown me that I'm right. None of your answers to me or anyone else here shown that there's more to the story than that quote presents.
