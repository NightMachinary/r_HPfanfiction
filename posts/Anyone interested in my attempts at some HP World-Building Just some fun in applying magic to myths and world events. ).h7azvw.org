I've been putting a bunch of world events/myths into the context of the HP universe. Obviously everything I mention is complete fanon and AU.

My personal favourite thing so far, and something I eventually want to incorporate into a fanfic of my own when I get around to writing it (all of this worldbuilding will go into that eventual fic, lol), is based on this line of reasoning:

*The 'Gods' of Ancient Civilisations were actually powerful and talented magic-users.*

The Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Hindu, Chinese, Norse (etc, etc) pantheons were all wizards that gained recognition and worship through their talent with magic.

Now, for my favourite idea so far:

*Odin (known as Odin Allfather by his worshippers, but to his fellow magic users, Odin Borrson) bonded magic to runes through magical sacrifice.*

The myth goes that Odin stabbed himself with his spear, Gungnir and hung himself from the roots of Yggdrasil to learn the magic of runes in death, before returning to life. However, this is not quite true. At this period in time, there was NO magical language in writing. Magical languages were /spoke/, but none of the magic held in any written forms of language, including the most famous written magical language today - Elder Futhark. Odin Borrson, however, was a very learned and wise wizard, possessed of large amounts of ambition. He wanted his name to be /remembered/.

The Norse Sorcerer created a ritual of his own, a ritual of binding, language and magic (*Note: I also have had some ideas about rituals and their creations, I might share those later, but for now know that the more concepts/ideas in a ritual, the greater the difficulty of performing the ritual. The stronger/more different the themes/ideas, the more difficulty. Rituals are just difficult and dangerous magic, period. In Odin's day, rituals were nearly unheard of, let alone rituals with three themes). He used his own blood to power the ritual, and then invoked the ritual magic that arose, concentrating on his chosen themes. Finally, he hung himself from the World-Tree, Yggradsil and sacrificed his life to provide the power to seal the ritual's effects forever.

Thus, the moment of Odin's death and the completion of the ritual, the magic took effect and sealed magic to Odin's native tongue - the runes of Elder Futhark. Forevermore, magic would permeate those runes whenever written, so long as the witch or wizard knew how to manipulate it (ties into why Ancient Runes are studied starting third year - a young witch or wizard must learn how to manipulate their own magic enough to even be able to begin using runes, something that takes time and teaching to do).

I personally really enjoy expanding on the HP world, and have plenty of ideas, so let me know what you think and I'll post some more of my ideas. :)

**** If you wanna flesh out the World of HP, I would say that remember that having one like 3 Wizarding schools in Europe and also so few in other continents wouldn't make sense at all.

Like for example Finnish (as I'm from there) people speak Finnish, which isn't in anyway or shape related to Indo-european languages like English, Swedish or Russian or French, so it wouldn't make any sense for Finnish people to go to school in Dumstrang or Hogwarts or in Beuxbatons (wrongly written some of these), as Finns would not understand anything anyone there would be saying, so there would have to be Wizarding school in Finland, how ever small it is.. And funnily enough Finland has one Boarding School, that all Finns joke about being "Finnish hogwarts"..

So like every country that speaks language that is no the language the school uses (if they don't understnad the other language, say Swedes, Norwegians and Danish propably would have same school as they all understand one another) should have their own Wizarding schools.

***** I agree that only having three magical schools in a continent doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I think that perhaps Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang are the /premier/ magical schools. By this logic, there are many other, smaller, less prestigious magical schools that take less students and perhaps don't teach to quite the same standards as their counterparts.

Another interesting possibility I think, would be language potions or charms. My main point for this is Barty Crouch Sr. - I believe it's mentioned in GoF that he knows over 200 languages, give or take. Either he's got some fantastical blood trait that allows him to memorise and regurgitate more languages than physically possible, or there's a magical method of adding a new language to a wizards repertoire. It neatly solves the issue of language barriers at a multi-lingual school, as well as the problem of their being so few schools that we know of.

****** Standart could very well be same, as say in Finland we have one of the best educations in the World (according to all kinds of things) but we still are really small, so just because we are small doesn't make our school worse.. I think the premiere would be more about them being bigger and older, but the education would be about same, though schools might teach different subjects relevant to their culture etc, but as person from smaller country where all our schools are equal in educational standart, it's kind of insulting to think that school from smaller places would teach worse.

For the language potion, you need to take in account also culture and historical differences, Korean witches or wizards would not want to study in the Japanese wizarding school that is one of the biggest ones, becaus of the Japanese occupation of Korea, that was really bad for them..

Finnish people wouldn't want to study in say Swedish or Russian, and would prefer Finnish language as for a long time it was not the lanaguage that we could use in official things (like when speaking to officials etc), same with many others countries and places, that for cultural, linqustical and historical reasons wouldn't want to study in other than their own language.

******* Just to clear it up, by premier I didn't mean in terms of education, but the prestige of the school in question. The best/brightest teachers would want to teach at the more prestigious schools. The nobility/purebloods/elite would want their children to be taught at the most prestigious schools. I envision Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang to mostly teach the wealthy because they can afford to charge/pay higher for it. There'll always be places considered better/superior by the wealthy. I personally agree with the whole culture/context of schools being important and think there are numerous magical schools, and I don't believe that the education of those other schools suffer because they're smaller.

In regards to subjects, I would say that the ICW would govern over a 'standard' set of subjects - Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, Herbology, Defense, History, Runes, and Arithmancy. Otherwise, elective subjects are taught by masters of their fields (Care of Magical Creatures, Alchemy, Rituals & Bloodmagic, Warding to name a few), however, because there's no official system to determine mastery in those magical subjects, it's generally taught by a Master/Apprentice relationship. Any school can hire any master of any subject (obviously in line with a countries laws regarding certain magics), but it's up to the school to ensure quality and safety to those learning those subjects.

******** Actually Defence wouldn't be standart, as it seems to either be DADA or Dark Arts (Dumstrong, written it so much today I don't remember how to write it anymore)..

I think the superior by wealhty would also have to do with your culture and language, as in not all would go to other places, and even then some countries/cultures would never think school in certain country would be superior, because of cultural/historical reasons..

And with all the subjects, I would think that certain countries, even if they tough same subjects they would teach some different things, like in Finland (sorry, it's esiest to give example as I'm form there) we would teach about magical creatures that lived here (IRL our mythology or culture etc), spells would be different in different languages, translations of the spells from the books and some old cultural magic spells we have (why would Finnish use Latin spells, when those two langauges aren't related etc.).

Also herbology would propably be about different plants relevant to the area, and I think same potions could be made with different ingredents, debending on what are native to where you live, like some universal that have to be ordered from outside, but having different potions with different ingredients for same purpose (say skele grow).

Maybe ancient runes are different in places, like those who where Vikings (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Island) would use nordic runes in their ancient runes studies, while Finns wouldn't have the subject, or would use the nordic runes, as we never had rune writing of our own..

I like to think that well once again Finns would use Kantele (Finnis instrument) in spells and singing and maybe have classes for it (this is from our mythology etc), things like this would propably happen in other cultures as well, teach things that are kind of mythology IRL and to witched and wizards would still be in use etc..

One problem with Harry Potter is that it's quite British centric, and even when it has other places it still makes things too British or American and makes it kind of like all Europeans are same, or all Africans are same, even though it should be that all different cultures should have different ways they teach or do magical things etc, or even Fantastic Beast, it emits lots of mythological beings that different countries have, even though I liek to think that all those exists, or are died off.

********* So I just want to clarify that everything I'm talking about is my own views and ideas on the extended HP universe. It's all AU and fanon, and my own ignorance on many different cultures and myths will shine through, haha.

In regards to whether or not Defence is standard - in my opinion, it is. Hogwarts teaches Defence Against the 'Dark Arts', but in reality, it's defence against anything you need defending from. The name of the subject likely stems from the Ministry's bias and fear against the Dark Arts. Durmstrang on the other hand... in my view, the Durmstrang Dark Arts class is one of the non-standard ones that require a master/apprentice teaching style to pass on the knowledge effectively. It would also have a Defence class in my opinion - because by ICW standards, every magical school MUST teach the standard subjects.

Agreed, some people would never go to certain schools, even if they were older, etc because of cultural and historical reasons. But a majority would in my opinion.

Your thoughts on different things being taught in different schools is correct, but the /classes/ would be the same. I agree that a Finnish school would focus more on local plants and creatures in their respective Herbology and COMC classes - but the classes would still be Herbology and COMC.

In regards to runes: my version of runes being a magical language means that the fact that they happen to be Norse mean /nothing/. It was just Odin's native language. The runes of Elder Futhark are just one of the only magical languages, and thus schools all over the world learn them, even the ones in places it makes no sense to learn runes as a language. It's not the language that's important, it's the fact that it's a magical written language. Magic doesn't hold in many other written forms of languages, so it's standard to learn the ones that magic does hold in. Does that make sense? Again, just my headcanon.

For sure. I think that wands would be more widespread, but that perhaps the Finnish school/s have speciality classes in the use of a Kantele and how to wield magic through songcraft. I completely agree that specific regions would place heavier emphasis on local 'myths' and traditions, magics, etc.

Well, Harry Potter is based entirely in Britain, so it makes sense to be British-centric. Furthermore, the story takes place from an 11-17-year-olds perspective, so I personally think that it's a case of unreliable narrating. It's our prerogative to expand on the HP world and widen the perspective of magic from just 'British British everywhere'. That's what I'm aiming for at least.

********** I understand that yes, I would be the same, as I would propably just use the canon HP and if I added anything outside use Finland.. I just liked to brainstorm ideas using Finland as example as I'm from there, but it's more of a like to understand how things would work differently in other places.

I think only minority would go to different school, like only people to go to Hogwarts would be British and Irish, only people in Beuxbatons would be French and people in the surrounding countries and for Dumstrang it would be propably those who speak Slavic languages, but there would propably be some other bigger schools that Rowling never mentioned (like there has to be some super old magical school in Italy with it's long history, not having bigger school there seems kind of stupid), since it wouldn't make any sense otherwise (with smaller ones for say Finland and other places).

I don't think personally that the runes should be same in different places, as those people never where in contact with one another in older times, so the runes wouldn't have spread, it makes more sense that all magical people have their own runes or other markings and they teach them (and places that didn't have them the magical folk removed them from muggle knowledge etc), there have to be multiple, it's kind of same as saying that everyone should know English because it's linqua franca, when in fact everyone should only really know their native tongue, like lots of cultures have their own markings or drawings that I might think as fitting to be magical, and they really are, there should be multiple magical runes in use in different places, as there are multiple languages.

Yeah for last bits, of course it's British but sometimes it feels like when Rowling adds things (to outside of Britain) they still feell ike they are outsider adding things to other places that people living there would think wouldn't really fit well in there (or should be different etc), as to person who isn't British they seem really British even when they aren't about Britain..

*********** It's fairly debatable on how many would go to local schools or bigger ones I think, but in the end you get the same result - some would go to the bigger schools, some would go to the local ones.

No, you're missing my point with the runes. It's not the language that matters. It's the fact that even in written form, it can hold and be used magically, because Odin performed his ritual. It's so widespread because it's very, /very/ rare to write something in any language and be able to use magic with it. You could not write something in English and then have a magical effect with it. Same with French, Italian, Russian, etc. This is why Elder Futhark is so widely used. It can hold magic because of Odin's ritual. There's just not really any other options in using a written language magically.

Yeah, you're right in that everything feels entirely too British, even worldwide. Luckily, we can make our versions of stuff, haha.

************ But the problem still is those languages are all related in same language family.. In say China they propably would have invented simliar thing long ago and would be using theirs. Further away you go from the place of origin more likely it is that those people would have invented simliar thing, because untill relatively recently people didn't really travel around the world as they do now. And if there where pockets of isolated populations they also propably would not use them, because they would have their own or because they wouldn't like that something is forced upon them.

There are also lot of runes etc on shamanic rituals in different cultures, and as IRL their purpose is "magical" with HP universe they propably also would be counted as one..

Within Finland there propably would be some difficulties with using those ruins you mentioned, as we have language from different language family, they would still propably be what we use because we where under Swedish rule for hundreds of years. But in Asia, Africa or say any Aborginal people, it's really unlikely.. Same with it's really likely say Ancient Roman Wizard or Egyptian Wizards also had similiar runes invented as they where far away, and they would have been before Vikings in general where around.

************* Yes, they all had their own languages, magical and otherwise. No, they could not write them down and use them for magical purpose in their written form, because no language in it's written form can hold magic. Only the fact that Odin performed his ritual and powered it through his sacrificial death meant that magic was bound to Elder Futhark - no other language. So unless someone figured out the incredibly difficult ritual he performed, and sacrificially slew themselves (they couldn't sacrifice another life, intent is imperative in ritualistic magic), then it is impossible for another language to be used magically in its written form. There is a reason you can't just write 'fire' in any language and expect it to generate flame when magic is applied. It is not a language that people speak, it's merely a way to channel magic, that just happens to be in the form of Elder Futhark because of Odin's ritual - a ritual that is unknown and has never been replicated.

It's odder if Odin would be only person to ever done this, the ritual doesn't have to be same, but people do similiar things, even if they never where in contact with one another.. Trying to make it so only Odin did it, wold also be kind of insulting to other old religions and their believes, as those type of things propably would have happened all over the World (not same way but same outcome)

I can definitely see Salazar employing the same ritual to bind magic to the language of serpents AND give snakes the capacity/intelligence to use aspoken language... it explains neatly the whole 'snakes aren't smart enough to have their own language' outcry we see in fanfiction. The nature of the ritual means that a magic-user has to manipulate their magic to enable the ritual's effect, something only a Parselmouth could do with Parseltongue. So when the ritual's effects are invoked, the snake being spoken to gains the boons of the ritual (obviously doesn't apply to magical breeds of serpent).

Powerful spells, both offensive and defensive can be invoked, BUT the drawback is that you can't just cast it instantaneously as if it were an ordinary charm. This is why it wouldn't see any use in the heat of battle - all the parselmagic would have been cast beforehand. Similar to bloodmagic.

**** I'm only using 1 (Erra, god of wrath and disease), but he figures into a really cool myth. It's technically 'neo-Assyrian' mythology; I've had to research my buns off! Even read an academic dissertation on the mythos haha.

In sum, Erra gets bored one day and kickstarts a war between Babylon and its enemies. When the foreigners invade, he strikes down their army to the last man. Anu (the 'overarching' god figure) grants Erra the service of the Sibbittu (The Seven) who are his champions. Each represents a different martial energy, though the record of the myth is incomplete and only 4 are named. The Sibbittu and Erra get caught up in bloodlust and turn on Babylon, at which point Marduk (the protector god of Babylon) flees the city in the face of Erra's rage. Slaughtering friend and foe alike, Erra ascends to the throne of the empire until the other gods eventually talk him down.

It's a pretty badass myth. Wish there was a completed surviving version!

***** That sounds really interesting actually. In context of HP magic, I wonder if wrath and disease could be attributed to some sort of aura manipulation?

Perhaps the 'wrath' spectrum causes those who's magic is affected to lose reasoning, cohesion? Similar to a Siren's song? Disease on the other hand... hmmm. The first thing that comes to mind is how the Dark Arts stain a person's soul - the /inside/ of a person themselves. Perhaps this... plague magic? works similarly but affects the exterior of environments. The stain of Dark Arts use, but personified upon the world. Extraordinarily difficult to pull off, but equally as difficult to counteract.

^ That explanation depends, of course, on the assumption that Erra is an 'evil' or 'bad' entity. Otherwise, I'd have to think of a differing explanation for the disease aspect of his powers. The Sibbittu, on the other hand, I have no idea about. What are the four martial influences that are known?

****** I'm not at my computer (replying from phone) so I can't recall all four, but the two off the top of my head are fire and "bearer of arms" - which i am going to interpet as some kind of blademaster type.

Love your ideas, especially RE: the siren's song! For disease, I had planned on a miasma type effect, and of course, a 'god' the caused disease could also cure it, so I'm giving him a kind of universal panacea, a cure-all.

The Mesopotamian myths are really ripe for use IMO. Lots of stories that are largely unknown in the West (outside of the djinn's and the Epic of Gilgamesh), with some neat demonology thrown in. Because there were so many different empires/cultures in such a condensed area, there is a TON of stuff to choose from.

******* Interesting. I wonder if you could interpret fire as being part of the natural four elements, or fire as in 'fire of one's self/fire from within'. A weaponised form of Haki, I guess.

A blademaster... perhaps a swordsperson using magic internally instead of externally, to bolster speed, strength and perception? Internal magic is something we haven't really seen anything of, so I'm very interested in perpetuating some wider examples of it in the HP universe. This would be a nice place to do so.

I love the Epic of Gilgamesh.. it was never determined whether or not he was a deity or a human, but perhaps Gilgamesh was a sorcerer, and thus the rumours of God or Man abounded... it's really so much fun to look at a myth and slide magic into the equation. And demonology is always interesting... clearly I need to do some in-depth research into Mesopotamian myths and history. :P

EDIT: In regards to the disease sphere of Erra's powers being a tangible miasma, if what I'm imagining is at all similar, it's close to what I was thinking about being an external version of the Dark Arts effects... did you envision this miasma to affect the very environment it's in, or just the people it contacts? Call me curious. :)

** This brough to my mind the Finnish Mythology and Väinämöinen, who was kind of like god (or demi-god), who used singing and Kantele (Finnish instrument) to sing spells and do magic that way..

So I like to think that ancient Finnish witches and wizards sing their spells and used Kantele as the "wand" and then later on propably after we become part of Sweden we would have gotten the say wands and so on..

Though in this way other Finnish Gods like Ukko would be a different kind of Wizard, and then would Finnish bears be magical or something, since we though of them as holy and taboo, we didn't call them by their name, and have many many different names for bears because of that, even the main word for it today is one of those synonyms that where used.. So I would like to think that there is some type of Magical bears in Finland and areas close by...

*** Putting some thought into the idea of singing and magic together, I kind of guess it would be similar to how Tolkien describes it in LOTR and The Silmarillion - Arda was sung into existence by the Valar.

In a similar vein, perhaps magic-users who could shape and change their magic and will through song could do so... the question comes in what the effect would be.

Large effect? Shaping rivers, carving valleys, raising mountains?

Smaller, more subtle? Bewitching, similar to a Siren's song? Something similar to how a bard in RPGs buff and give bonuses to their party members? It's very interesting now that I think about it.

A further point I would make is that I don't believe that a magic-user who wields magic in this way would require a wand, or any other foci. A wand is (in my opinion) used to shape and direct magic from a wizard. A magic-user who directs their magic through song would not need a foci to shape and direct their magic, their voice and songcraft does it for them.

Edit: In regards to Finnish magical bears and the unwillingness of the people to use their names... perhaps a Taboo was cast on the name of the magical bear, bringing bad luck and devastation whenever the name was spoken (perhaps one of these bears was summoned or attracted to wherever the name was mentioned), leading to people eventually catching on and never using the actual name. Not unlike the case of Voldemort's taboo on his name and the You-Know-Who euphemism catching on.

**** Tolkien got inspired by Finnish mythology so that would be right. (Gandalf has similarities with Väinämöinen, World creation was also sung in our, Elven language is inspired by Finnish, Iluvitar is kind of like our god Ilmarinen etc)

With the singing I would think that it would be kind of like the magic words would be the songs (like there is no reason Finnish people would use latin to say spells, as Finnish is not related to latin at all, more likely we would use the super old spells from our paganism or the ones that where translated in the books)

Kantele could have been kind of like an amplifier to spells, like usually we would sing them, but the instrument was used with the singing to make them stronger etc..

I would think the things about the bear would be more about them being say magical bears, and then people muggles and other wise would think of them as some type of holy or godly things becuase of their magicness..

What would you say about the internation statue of secrecy, in reality it wouldn't make much sense for it to be truly international when it first happened (for example Korea and Japan that came to mind), as when it happened some places where closed to outside world and if you look at their culture, they had like Shamans and what not, much after it should have taken place. And some cultures within Europe propably also where kind of separe from the bigger europeans countries that they wouldn't have taken to it untill more recently, same way as how even though some Finns where turned to Christianity they would still practice their paganism and oral traditions so they would survive long enough orally, to have them written down...

Like this international statue of secrecy was more of a "European thing" at first, than a World wide things.

***** Ahh, that explains the similarity.

I would say that ultimately, the words/language does not matter. Intent and will is the true factor. The words are a tool to help shape, which a truly accomplished magic wielder would not need, in the end. I think the Kantele being an amplifier is correct, I imagine wands, staffs, staves and other foci to function similarly. A crutch, but if constructed/used correctly, any tool can bring to bear greater might.

Thinking about it, the Statute of Secrecy would have been primarily a western thing to begin with, but I think that as similar events to the witch burnings happened across the world, the other magical nations would follow suit. Things like Salem, the witch trials that happened in the Middle-East (their hatred of magic was/is legendary), perhaps similar events to the Rape of Nanjing, but earlier and not as well known?

But, we agree that it was started in Europe.

** That's a really cool idea. Also Jesus changing water into wine soumds very Wizardlike to me. He'd have to be a hell of a necromancer ro reawaken the dead though and idk if this fits his image. Anyways. I really like the idea of sacrifices granting (more) power. Like so many cultures sacrificed animals or humans. Like Aztecs or Celts. I also feel lile people who could foretell the future were held in a higher regard back then. I also like the idea that becoming an animagi comes from the idea of having a spirit animal. Or that it's a practice that comes from Native Americans or so.

What's also interesting are the European witch hunts. I mean Harry learns in his books that it wasn't really a problem for witches if they could do the firefreezing charm but it wasn't just witches who they hunted. Many people back then were accused of being a Werewolf and Witches were often also hanged and tortured till they confessed. I feel like these times should have a lot more worldbuilding behind them since they are the reason that the Wizarding world went into hiding eventually. Werewolves and other magical creatures being hunted for sports. (By muggles and Magical beings)

Maybe a part of the magical community went into hiding a lot earlier than the rest and they were only known as sidhé. (Fae folk in - i think Ireland) They are said to be living under the hills.

*** Jesus multiplying food, water into wine... does sound very wizardlike... perhaps a primitive Draught of Living Death was involved in his 'resurrection'?

Yes, the Aztec lands in particular I think would have a very... charged, feeling. A wizard sufficiently tuned with their magic experiences a heavy, skin-crawling sensation. Whether or not the Aztec priests themselves knew what they were doing by committing so many sacrifices? Debatable. They achieved some feats with their actions, certainly... but there was much-wasted potential. Even so, centuries later, the magic lingers, ready to be unleashed, if only a sufficiently knowledgeable sorcerer uses it.

The Witch Hunts are an interesting one. My thoughts are this: the Statute of Secrecy was engineered by the traditional Purebloods to remove as much contact with Mugglekind as possible - not out of fear. Think about how removed wizards are from Muggles in the 90's. Even in the Founder's time, wizards looked down heavily upon Muggles. In the Middle Ages/Renaissance, wizards would have utterly dominated Muggles, number advantage or no. Obviously this is a different story in the modern eras, but when wizards went into hiding, it was only to cut off contact with those deemed filth by the upper class in wizarding society.

I feel that wizards/muggles hunting werewolves and other magical creatures is something that needs more thought before I put forward anything about it. Interesting concept for sure. Same thing in regards to the Sidhe. I know more about Seidhr (bit of a Norse mythology buff), but I doubt they're at all similar, so more research is needed.

**** Oh yes. Though in regard to the seperation of Wizarding and Muggle world I think that not all of the purebloods were supportiv of this. For example the Malfoy family would have lost a lot of potential wealth by having to stop mingling with royal Muggles etc. What is also interesting is the one Aunt Sirius mentions in the books who wanted to legalize Muggle hunting. Now I ask myself if this was a sport that was practiced too by some purebloods

***** For sure, I have no doubt that there wouldn't have been total suppprt. In regards to the Malfoys, although we don't have much if any background on them prior to Abraxus Malfoy, it's feasible to say that their traditional stance and pureblood supremacy/anti muggle position isn't a new thing. I'd personally say that they'd rather cut off all contact with those they consider animals and deal with purely pure folk (see what I did there, heh).

Muggle baiting is a crime against Ministry law iirc, so it's not a stretch to say Muggle hunting is a thing. Dumbledore's father was sent to Azkaban for muggle hunting, wasn't he?

****** Yeah. And even if Muggle hunting was officially illegal I think that those families practicing had enough influnce to have it being an open secret. On Pottermore I think there is an Article about the Malfoy family and their involvement with Muggles prior to the separation. But even if they looked down on Muggles I think they would've used their connection to influental Muggles for their own gain. I mean Malfoys notoriously do what's best for them and even Lucius denied his connections to the dark Lord in order to escape prison.

Oh, I'm sure Lucius was always in it for his own gain, and never truly held any loyalty to Voldemort, only wanting the results of what the Dark Lord would bring. But yes, the Malfoys are big opportunists. Perhaps they did have dealings with Muggles... but I'm unsure how likely it would have been that they would vote to remain in contact with the Muggle world.

*** Continuing your experiment: Lets say the Titans are in fact eldritch Magical beings that embodies forces of nature, the first Magic Users (Olympians) are humans affected or accidentally created by them, and the Titanomachia begun as a fight for survival of the latter, resulting in the Titans being sealed off thus making the world more habitable for men. Atlantis is the first city created by the demi-gods descendants of the Olympians, later destroyed/sealed off because they tried to pull a "Olympiamachia" on the gods and they were not happy about it.

**** Whilst I'm aware of the differences between sorcerors and wizards, I think that in the HP universe they'd not be different in that way. After all, Tonks is born a metamorphagus and isn't classed as a sorcerer because of it (keep in mind this is just my own opinion).

I'd rather say that a sorcerer is classed as a wizard that is so in tune with their own magic that it comes easier and more powerfully than a wizard not in tune. I.e. the more in tune you are, the greater/stronger your magic will be. A wizard enough in tune can direct their own melody, thus performing extraordinary feats (Flamel and his alchemical achievements, Odin and his ritual, etc.) Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Voldemort would also be examples of this.

In regards to the Greek Mythologies, I've already come up with what I believe an interesting twist on how what become known as the Titanomachy and the reign of the 'Gods' came around... but in the end, they were all just sorcerers, powerful, almost beyond belief, but still human. It might be what I post next. ;)

** A bit of head canon that I would like to see more explored is the impact of True Prophecies on the world.

A True Prophecy will always come to pass, though the majority of the time it will only become clear what the prophecy meant after the fact. Beyond that, the more people who believe the prophecy to be true, the more overtly the prophecy can twist events and choices to see itself to completion.

Now think of Harry, who the entire British wizarding community believes to be the vanquisher of Voldemort when he's a year and a half old, and then look at how nearly every book a confrontation occurs between him and Tom.

I think it's an interesting concept anyway

*** During my worldbuilding, I've been considering magic alike to music, and song. A True Prophecy would fit into this as an equivalent to predetermined lyrics - events that cannot be changed and will come to pass regardless of the prior notes/happenings. Even someone aware of the music and lyrics cannot change it, regardless of how hard they try. However, someone skilled/wise enough could change the prior events/lyrics to twist the overall meaning/result of the prophecy/song. A step-in editor of the overall melody.

I guess that means you could call the overall songwriter... Fate? Destiny? Who knows. ;)
