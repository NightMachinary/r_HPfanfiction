I'm new to the Harry Potter fandom and I'm finding it overwhelming searching through thousands of fics, many of which have 100k+ words. Hopefully you can give me some pointers to some good fics that I can invest some time into.

I'm looking for Drarry fics wherein Draco is reformed and/or has some character development and realizes + proves that he actually is a good person. I especially will love it if the fic features a scene of Draco apologizing to Hermione and/or Ron for his past behavior.

Other tropes I've liked (but unnecessary): time travel, eighth year, and Narcissa being reformed too

I've read some popular fics, like Remember Me, And Then Came a Mist and a Weeping Rain, and (my absolute favorite so far) Tea and No Sympathy, and I've really liked them, so I'm eager to dive in more. Thank you!


** Fortunately you have really mainstream taste (as do I), so it will be really easy to find fics that fit this specification. I've never read Remember Me, but I have read the other two and can confirm that almost everything by those writers (FaithWood and who_la_hoop) is good. I read Star Quality by WLH recently and adored it, but they're my two favorite writers for the ship other than zeitgeistic, who is a lot less fluffy but specializes in more intricate plotlines.

I'd recommend just going on ao3, sorting kudos or bookmarks high to low, and scrolling until you see a fic that looks interesting. Drarry is so popular that there's a ton of good material. If you like a fic, check out the others by the same author and their bookmarks.

*** Thank you! I've tried sorting by kudos/bookmarks but a lot of what comes up are things I haven't been able to get into, or are unfinished, and I'm a bit wary of starting them.

Also, I'm not sure if I know enough about which are the right tags in the fandom to get fics that I'm looking for. Not to mention how many fics there are.

** You might want to try [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] too. There are also tons of existing Drarry rec threads you could search.

Some of my favourites are: linkao3(All Our Secrets Laid Bare; The Bucket List by GallaPlacidia; A Hag, a Hex, a Tale of Redemption). I was going to recommend Tea and No Sympathy but I see you've already read it.

  Draco will die in six months if he can't get Harry Potter to fall in love with him. Since that's not going to happen, he might as well spend his last days working through his Bucket List. Tap-dancing lessons? Rock climbing? Poetry-writing? Threesomes? Cocaine? Getting to know his adorable cousin, Teddy Lupin? Draco will try them all! Feat. Cheerily pessimistic Draco, devoted bitch queen Pansy Parkinson, and a Harry who can't help but notice that something seems DIFFERENT about Draco, these days.Inspired by a lovely piece by khasael called Somebody To Love.

  A fuck-or-die fairytale in which Draco Malfoy lives a despicable and unapologetic life --- that is, until he's cursed to die unless he can fall in love with and fuck Harry Potter.

** I really don't have any fics to recommend as I love Drarry more as a side ship, but some of the best Drarry fics come in the fashion of Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived fanfictions, some Tomione fanfictions, and I even read one cursed fic of Lumione (Lucius x Hermione), so these are just some categories you can look for if you want Drarry and even if the fictions aren't the particular ship, you'll get a great read out of them.
