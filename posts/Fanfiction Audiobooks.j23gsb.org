I know that there are audiobooks for the fanfictions of HPMoR and Alexandra Quick*, and I assume a few others. What are those others, and does anyone have a recommendation for me to make one? I've been wanting to for a while. Thanks!

** Honestly, I dunno if there is but any of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach's Blot's]] stories like Make a Wish, or Old Soldiers would be an interesting audio book I think.

**** I recommend starting with Make a Wish linkffn(2318355) then. I think most consider it a classic but that could be just me.
