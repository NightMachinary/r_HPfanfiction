** Harry Potter and the Years of Rebellion by Full Pensive is the story that got me into fanfiction. It was last updated in 2009 with the author's notes released in 2012. Unfortunately, it was taken off Fanfiction.net. This is the only [[https://fp.fanficauthors.net/harry_potter_and_the_years_of_rebellion/index/][link]] I know works.

*** Yeah, that story marked me something fierce. I caught it as it updated back in 2005-6 or so and every chapter felt like a punch. It was the first time I saw writing of this quality in fanfiction.

On the plus side: Full Pensieve beat cancer! His [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/798752/FPyearsofrebellion][ff profile]] was updated a couple of months ago.

Also there is linkffn(12069764), if you want another tense, angsty (but its the good kind of angst) H/Hermione story by the same author. (if you haven't read it already ofc)

When Ron was gravely injured, Harry and Hermione continued the horcrux hunt across wartime Britain. Reckoning with the last horcrux will change everything.

** While I have a lot of fics that I would love to list here, 3 of them stand out over the others....

Linkffn(havoc side of the force) : a SW/HP crossover with harry transported to sw verse during phantom menace (comes with a companion piece)

Linkffn(a difference one man can make) : another crossover this time with ASOIAF, where harry is transported just beyond the wall, and after a talk with benjen, decides to go live amongst the wildlings soon enough leads most of them into a proper community.

Linkffn(I still haven't found what I'm looking for) : sw/HP crossover... Massive fic which may yet be updated by Kathryn518. Though if I have to nitpick , the fic was leading upto harem/multi which doesn't usually float my boat, but its still one the best HP crossovers out there.

There are quite a few fics by esama on Ao3 which are incomplete including a deleted HP/ Stargate fic which was about a magical exodus through the stargate to Atlantis with wix being the successor to the lanteans

Edit: Sekrit project was a great Ron & harry bonding fic which involves marauder map shenanigans.... I'm pretty sure that was abandoned and I wouldn't mind if the author comes back to it.

  Annabel has a bad day, and she tries to deal with it as best she can.The last thing she needs is to meet someone else who has hurt her, someone who she hasn't seen in many years. Or is it?Do people really change. Has James Sirius Potter finally grown up?

** Forging the Sword has already been mentioned and is a good candidate, but the one I'm really holding out for is Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past. It updates about once every three years.

Unfortunately FFN deleted it due to a bogus copyright takedown claim, but you can still get it from a few other places; the most complete is the [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][PDF/eBook on Github]], which includes up to chapter 43.

Several of the plot elements were fresh at the time but well worn by now. However, I really enjoy it because it's a time travel that a) balances foreknowledge with the butterfly of doom quite well, and b) focuses on relationships with people, so Harry being somewhat overpowered (because he's magically an adult with 13 years' experience of war) doesn't break it.

  Last year, a chance encounter brought together Harry Potter and Fleur Delacour, while her father exonerated Sirius Black. Now, events at Hogwarts will test friendships old and new, as Voldemort conspires to make Harry the Fourth Champion of the Tri-Wizard Tournament. It's a race against time as Harry's allies work to hunt down Voldemort's darkest secrets...but will it be enough?

  Response to whitetigerwolf's Polyjuice Cat challenge. When Hermione is told her Polyjuice problem is permanent, Harry refuses to let his best friend go through this alone.

** A true classic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/604661/aulizia-and-kirixchi]]

Anything by Aulizia or Kirixchi separately also falls into this category... Tainted Love by the former is a gem

At least Under Obligation has a semi-satisfactory conclusion despite the ominous drift-off...

****** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/414370/1/][*/Pawn To Queen/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/114057/Riley][/Riley/]]

#+begin_quote
  A somewhat Nietzschean twist on Snape/Hermione. The Potions Master and his best student find themselves entering into a partnership that neither of them could have expected, courtesy of Lucius Malfoy. NOTE: chapter 3 updated again: Hermione's now 18.
