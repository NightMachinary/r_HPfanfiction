** I actually had a friend send me a text when Jude Law was cast as Dumbledore where she typed "Fantastic Breasts and where to Find Them". I still havn't let her live it down

** I actually thought this said 'Fantastic Beasts and how to bind them'. Beasts, not breasts.

I was expecting some very kinky furry-fandom stuff...

** Okay, I opened this because the title made me laugh.

Is writing in present tense a stylistic choice, or did you not realize that past tense works better?

*** While I do prefer past tense, it's perfectly OK to use present tense. As far as I know, it's a little bit jarring at the start--mostly for the people accustomed to past tense--but it doesn't make much of a difference after a while. In fact, quite a lot of books in YA use it.

That said, the writing has a lot of problems even if it's not to be taken seriously. Several people speaking in the same paragraph and dialogue attribution are the worst of the lot.

**** I love reading/writing first-person present tense. I remember loving Tiger Eyes by Judy Blume and the usage of that particular style blew my 14-year-old mind.

*** It's meant to be through Harry's eyes as what is happening to him in the present, set between HBP and TDH.

** Reading black text and then having it turn red out of nowhere is quite possibly the most jarring thing that can happen holy fuck
