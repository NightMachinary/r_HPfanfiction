:END:
So I don't know if I am supposed to stick to the canon ships or if I can ask about non-canon ships. But the one I'm looking for is a Charlie and Hermione and they have a one night stand Hermione gets pregnant flat out refuses to tell Charlie until she hast to go to mania for work and she's seven months pregnant when she goes and still refuses to tell him the truth and she only tells him right before she goes into labor or as soon as she goes into labor I don't remember which one but I've been looking for it for about three days now and I cannot find it anywhere. Help would be greatly appreciated and thank you in advance!


** Ok I had to go look for this with ao3 tag search. My first time trying that. They actually work pretty well! I looked for Hermione and Charlie, and added a pregnancy tag.

I think the story is "How to Tame Your Dragon", [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21280616/chapters/50670506]] .

I'm reading it now and it looks good!
