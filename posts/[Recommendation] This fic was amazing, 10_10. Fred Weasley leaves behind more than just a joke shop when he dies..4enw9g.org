*** I enjoyed it, but was left with one question - why did Tom, after appearing to take a fatherly interest, tell her to stop writing? Why not at least inform her Fred was dead, because I assume her letters were asking how to find him.

**** Considering that Fred Weasley was on the Undesirable List for most of the Wizarding War and owls were being intercepted left and right, Tom would likely do whatever he could to get the message through that it was not safe for Clara to continue correspondence without being specific about where his loyalties lie (especially since it's quite possible that the DE led Ministry was looking for excuses to round people up and kill them).

Fred would not have died at the time she realized she was pregnant, but the war would go on for another year and a half, and Fred would be a known Order member and be in hiding for most of it.

***** Awesome, thanks! I thought it might be something like that. I just thought for some reason he died that very night haha.

**** Part of me is worried about continuing a story with a prominent group of OC's, but I suppose that if I received enough interest, I'd be willing to revisit it.

***** Well I think it gives you a lot of creative license with Clara, Rick and Ryan. And you still get to have fun with the Weasley clan, all of the characters around Hogwarts. They're a unique situation: half-bloods, raised in America, knew nothing of magic before they got their letters. But at the same time, they come from the most famous wizard family in Britain (at least that's how I assume they are treated after the war, since they are half of the Order of the Phoenix that wins the war), their father is a perished war-hero, they are nephews to Harry Bloody Potter. So it's this adjustment to England/adjustment to Wizard life/adjustment to being in this super famous family. I'd like to think that Clara's loose ties to home due to her shit mom would eventually lead her to move across the pond... Just a lot of things you could do with this. It would be a fun read.

** 7-8/10 for me. Good story but it was a bit too OOC for something that seems to be trying to be non-AU. Unnecessarily American OC and I would have thought Fred had enough experience to not cause accidents. And I just didn't find it very intetesting.
