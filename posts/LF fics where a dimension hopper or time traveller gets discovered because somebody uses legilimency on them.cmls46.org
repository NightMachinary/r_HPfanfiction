Bonus if the person who first discovers the secret initially believes that the dimension hopper/time traveller is just so good at occlumency that they made up an entire fake backstory.

Thanks in advance!

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

*** I didn't think about the hat, because that happens every other time travel fic, lol. I should have specified that it was a person who discovers the dimension hopper/time traveller, oh well. Thanks though. Already read it, but it's a great work.
