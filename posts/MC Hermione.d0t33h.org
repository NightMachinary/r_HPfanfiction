Basically the title. I want Harmony fics where Hermione is the MC, kinda like Daphne in Importance of Intent. I haven't really read much from Hermione's POV, but I like what I've seen.

Preferably slower-burn, on the longer side, and pure Harmony. Two girls is maybe fine, preferably nothing more


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Mostly Hermione's perspective, also Harry and Ron's perspective sometimes.

Hermione is expelled and homeschooled while Harry and Ron stay at Hogwarts and train for fighting Voldemort and becoming aurors. Meanwhile Hermione trains to become a professional thief to get revenge on Malfoy.

Post Hogwarts Harry and Hermione date, he's an auror and she's the thief he's hunting which makes things a little awkward sometimes.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

** I'm a bit late seeing this but I wrote DG and the Importance of Intent and am now writing a Hermione/Harry story from Hermione's perspective in a similar style to Intent.

It's called Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift and is available on FFN. Apologies for not linking but I'm responding on my phone.
