** Not quite the same, but I feel like I've read a story where Luna Lovegood ends up with the diary and befriends diary-Riddle. He then sees the fight against Voldemort through her perspective and I think ends up helping to defeat him. It's not a story I have saved, but maybe it will be familiar to someone else who can link it!

** for a moment I thought it meant Tom Riddle changed Harry's mind about Voldemort and was confused as to why they would destroy the horcruxes then.
