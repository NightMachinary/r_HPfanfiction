Summary: Daphne having been killed at the battle of Hogwarts has been reincarnated as James Potters younger sister. She is determined to stay as far away from the war as possible, but a certain regulus black seems to have others plans.

feedback and advice very much appreciated :)


** Sounds similar to most fics I've read. The character gets reincarnated into a family heavily involved in the war, starts loving the family she is reborn into and wants to save them but falls for a character who wants to fight the bad guys, so she reluctantly joins the fight.

It definitely sounds interesting since Daphne is the protagonist but sounds like the plot for most reincarnation fics if you have been reading fanfiction for a long time.

*** Honestly why I wanted to write this doc. It's not really going to go in that direction you just described but it's fun to think about.

The trope is there but playing in it and making it your own is what I'm aiming for in the story.

** I'm not 100% sure the kids are acting their age, but this line from Regulus, while sounding rather like 2 yr old babble, is hard to understand. Is he just straight up talking about his death? But all she said was his name.

*** The first part where he says his name and smiles happens and then there's a line about how he plays the part fine but she catches little slip ups that kinda confirm her suspicions.

When he's talking is really just the final slip where she just loses patience and asks. He's not talking about his death but a story.

** Not something I'm interested in reading at the time being, but upvoted because self-promotion should be much bigger here than it is. Shame to see it at 0 points, like almost every s-p post ever.
