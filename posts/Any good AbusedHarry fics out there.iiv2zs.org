Looking for fics that explore more of the abuse that Harry suffered at the hands of the Dursleys. Physical abuse is heavily implied throughout the canonical books, but never depicted directly. For example:\\
(HBP, chapter 3) "Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, *as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm's reach of his uncle whenever possible.* There in the doorway stood a tall thin man with waist length silver hair and beard. "

The fact that Harry is still cautious of Vernon's behavior, even in Dumbledore's presence, is a clear red flag.

Of course, it would have been difficult for JKR to detail any further abuse in the books without alienating young readers and their parents. Which is where fanfiction comes in...

Any thoughts? Looking only for well-written fics.


** Linkao3(Grey Space), if you haven't read it, is an AU where students start Hogwarts at 14 rather than 11. It shows the three extra years Harry spends at Privet Drive before getting his letter.

** Here are another two! Both Pre-Hogwarts and really well done. Both are really sad, but “Alastair's Cupboard” has a truly devastating (albeit poetic) ending. “Hello Journal” isn't finished, but the current ending feels complete as it is. Linkffn(13657777) Linkao3(1136716)

  Oneshot, Abused!Harry. Before Hedwig the owl, there was Alastair the spider. In an unforgiving household, 10-year-old Harry has no one else who cares whether he lives or dies. He'll need every ounce of vigilance if he is to survive. Warning: descriptions of physical child abuse.
