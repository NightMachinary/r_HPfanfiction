so the harry potter world isn't very thought out, there are dozens of threads on it but to keep it small here's my thought on Taboos. The idea of a Taboo has some fundamental problems as shown in universe since its incredibly easy to steer around as the whole country eventually stopped saying the word. But before Voldemort started using it for terrorism it had to have some use unless he came up with the entire branch of magic. Now since language is complicated and changes over time the idea of creating a Taboo for something like sedition or crime would be a huge largely fruitless undertaking. Modern computer algorithms and censorship can't do it yet and they're using written documents let alone speech in secluded corners of the country.

But a Taboo on spells might just work. Especially spells that even the most powerful wizards seem to have to say the whole incantation, no silent casting for these spells. This Taboo might also be a good way to differentiate on why these specific spells are labeled unforgivable. Not be cause they are in themselves the worst wizarding kind has come up with since bloodboilers and fleshrippers are around but simply do to legislation for them having the Taboo applied.

And with Wizarding legislation being what it is more obscure curses or spells with utility outside of killing people would never get added to the list. Obliviate due to its use in controlling muggles would never get added as only letting ministry designated people use it would cripple the Wizarding worlds ability to protect itself.

Now with the Taboo in place most low level criminals or professional hitmen would never use the Unforgivables outside of heavily warded manor houses or if they were to apparate directly afterward. it deals with how inherently overpowered the spell is to a certain extent. Voldemort and his followers however were brazen with its use not just setting up ambushes for incoming aurors but leaving their callsign on those scenes the authorities were too late to arrive at.

The only scene I'm not sure would work with Taboos in place would be Riddle killing his parents. But then again three muggles dead in the countryside in the midst of WW2 and Grindelwald's actions across the continent. With no registered local wizards I don't really see them doing a full manhunt.

honestly their just needs to be a need for wizards when dueling for real to do anything other then avada kedavra

In Canon, the murder of the Riddles was immediately detected because of the activation of the Trace. When the Aurors (or whatever magical authority) arrived in Little Hangleton, they found a wizard living there: Morfin Gaunt, whose wand had been used to cast the spell. The man had previously been sentenced for Hexing the same Muggles, and quickly admited the crime (being even able to descrive the events). Because of it, Morfin Gaunt was quickly convicted to Azkaban where he died years later.

I fail to see how the existence of a Taboo on the Killing Curse would change anything in the way Morfin Gaunt was condemned or Tom Riddle got away with murder.

**** That's because the Trace didn't pick Morfin, but Tom. In Canon, the Trace cannot identify /who/ used Magic, only that Magic was used in the proximity of an underage witch or wizard.

In CoS, Harry received a warning because of that. The Ministry saw that a spell was used in Privet Drive, knew that Harry Lived there and decided he was responsible unless proved otherwise.\\
Also, while the idea is never explored in Canon, Harry should be able to use Magic in any known Magical location (the Burrow, Diagon Alley . . .) without any repercussion because the Trace is ignored from these locations. Since it's impossible to know if a child really used magic or it was just his parents, the Ministry consider that the parents are responsible for their children.

Anyways, the point is that the Ministry saw the Trace being activated in Little Hangleton (and maybe that the Killing Curse was used since CoS ministry knew what charm Dobby used). In the absence of known children living there, they went to investigate and quickly found that all the proofs blamed Morfin Gaunt so they arrested him.

***** right so an alarm went off only indicating that magic in the presence of a traced wand went off in the riddle house. and then they dont look for the traced wand which is again the problem.

the situation being caused by the trace doesnt make sense it would make more sense with a taboo on the spell.

the only way it works in canon is if Morfins wand has the trace for riddle to activate which is possible or the aurors completely forgot to look for the magical child who was in the building with all the corpses which based on the circumstances could be dead. the only other way it works is if he goes to morfins house sets it up cast the avada kedavra with it multiple times to put it on the wand and then goes and uses his own wand to kill the riddles to activate the trace

****** The Trace isn't on the wands, it's a charm that detects magic done around children within the borders of magical Britain. How the fuck would the Ministry detect accidental magic done by children in Muggle homes/spaces if it were on wands?

******* If it works like that hagrid casting magic would have set it off in the first book and Arthur Weasley fixing Dudley's tongue in the fourth

******** Arthur literally got a license to temporarily connect 4 Privet Drive to the Floo network so he could go get Harry. On the books, an adult wizard is going into the house of an underage wizard. It stands within reason that magic may be performed. For Hagrid, the Trace wasn't a thing yet in the first book, so it doesn't count. But even so, I'll humour you and say that the Ministry had no way of knowing who was there, since it wasn't an official residence of the Dursleys.

******** Legally speaking, Hagrid and Mr. Weasley are adults so they would likely assume that the magic done was theirs. Or the adults would be responsible for the magic done by the children.

Mr. Weasley has a bit more to defend with regarding Dudley's tongue. As he is a Ministry official - and in charge of misuse of Muggle artifacts - he's likely authorized or well-known to go to Muggle households and fix the problems done by magic

** I think, overall, the books and the HP world is very well thought out. We do not know where the taboo originates. It could be that Voldemort invented it during the second war. I doubt Dumbledore would have encouraged people to say Voldemort's name if the taboo had been used in the first war. I think if they put a taboo on words like Avada Kedavra, people would learn to do it nonverbally or just come up with different spells. I also think that AK isn't all that easy to cast - Harry struggles with Crucio on people he hates - which would still mean people need other spells in duels.
