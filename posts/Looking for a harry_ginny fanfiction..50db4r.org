I'm looking for a good Harry and Ginny fanfiction. I like stories where Harry's a single dad or something and Ginny's not the mom and then they meet. But I'm basically looking for something about them where they are both adults. I like Ron and Hermione pairing as a side thing but if it's not I'm not too concerned.

This author may have other fics with similar theme.

*** Ehhhh all the conflict in it was really fake. Like there was no reason for Ginny and Harry to get together but the author just wrote in a bunch of ridiculous circumstances that would never happen in real life because people actually communicate and don't just make wild assumptions based on bits and pieces of information.

**** I sent a review along the same lines as that. I had been enjoying the story up until that point and the response I got was "Why are you still reading then?"

I always hate when authors try to force relationship drama through ridiculous situations that any normal people would resolve in a short conversation. Especially since if she wanted relationship issues this story had several she could touch on that are natural, like Harry and Ginny having two different parenting styles and the two styles conflicting or she could have Harry in a relationship with someone the girls don't like and instead have Ginny enter the picture who his daughters like and then have a Parent Trap situation go down. (A little tropey as well but kids not liking their parents significant others in these situations is something that happens often)

*** pottermum is excellent! And yes, she has a number of other fics which fit your request (though I'd recommend pretty much all of her fics, there are very few I didn't like, which is saying something with how many she has!) linkffn(11920258, 10985124, 11222350, 11423633)

  AU H/G fluff. Ron forces Ginny to go to a boring Department dinner to make up numbers. She realises it's a set up. Unfortunately for Ron, Ginny enjoys the company of a lovely black-haired man, not the man Ron wants her to talk to.
