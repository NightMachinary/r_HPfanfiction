The reason I ask is because in one of the sorting hats song it sings about how Hufflepuff took the student that none of the other founder wanted.

I like the idea that helga hufflepuff didn't originally pick the house traits of loyalty and hard work, but came to value them because of how hardworking the students in the general pool were and because Hufflepuff taught them when none of the other founder were interested in them they became loyal to her.

I imagen She came to value loyalty when the student in the general pool that would one day become Hufflepuff house got offers to leave the general pool and be taught by one of the other founder they stayed in the general pool showing loyalty to her and there fellow students.


** The sorting hat implies that the other founders were picky with students and she chose to take the rest instead so they wouldn't feel unwanted, she could probably have reduced the students to only to the best but than there would be children left over who nobody wanted to teach. I guess it was more her being affectionate, then her drawing the short straw.

the song literally says

  So how could it have gone so wrong? How could such friendships fail? Why, I was there, so I can tell The whole sad, sorry tale.

  Said Slytherin, "We'll teach just those Whose ancestry's purest." Said Ravenclaw, "We'll teach those whose Intelligence is surest."

  Said Gryffindor, "We'll teach all those With brave deeds to their name." *Said Hufflepuff, "I'll teach the lot And treat them just the same."*

  These differences caused little strife When first they came to light. For each of the four founders had A house in which they might

  Take only those they wanted, so, For instance, Slytherin Took only pure-blood wizards Of great cunning just like him.

  And only those of sharpest mind Were taught by Ravenclaw While the bravest and the boldest Went to daring Gryffindor.

  *Good Hufflepuff, she took the rest and taught them all she knew,* Thus, the houses and their founders Maintained friendships firm and true.

**** Maybe she showed loyality towards the school through taking the rest of the Children. Hardworking.... I don't know. Maybe they had to work harder to earn their place than the rest? Maybe Helga instilled a hardworking and loyal philosophy into her Students so the could still stand out amongst others.

** If you're running a school, you /want/ the kids that are hard-working. Moreover, you rather specifically /don't/ want to have to deal with the kids that identify as 'Brave,' 'cunning,' or 'intellectual'.

I think Hufflepuff was the only one of the four that actually knew what they were doing, TBH.

I think that the way the founders split the student was that:

Slytherin -the wizard raised

Gryffindor -the Muggle nobility and ones that were training to be Knights (the Pages and Squires )

Ravenclaw -got the Ones that were going to be Scholars and who could already read (and probably the female nobility)

Hufflepuff -got the Muggle raised who weren't training to be Knight, or nobility and couldn't read.(pretty much the student who had to start from scratch , meaning that they has to work harder than all the rest to catch up)

It would even help explain some of the animosity between the Gyffindor and Slytherin students with the Wizards raised not being subordinate to the Muggle Crown and nobility which would offend the Muggleborn Nobility

**** OK my headcanon for the founding of Hogwarts was just a disorganized mess of four powerful wizards deciding hey lets teach.

And Gryffindor was like 'ooh i want the cool ones the ones that like stabbing'

and Slytherin was like 'I want the ones who are smart enough to understand that /sometimes/ you can't just stab your problems away'

and then Ravenclaw was like 'I want the ones who want to know what they're doing.'

and then Hufflepuff was like 'I want the ones that will actually work hard and together and just in general get things done'

and then the other three founders felt like idiots.
