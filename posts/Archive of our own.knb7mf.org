Okay so I found this story on Archive of our own and I could have sworn that I bookmarked it but now I can't find it. Basically what happened was it's in the middle of the first wizarding war and Sirius goes to check on Peter once he realises what Peter has done only to end up being tortured by Peter and then Remus comes to save him and they have a special bond Remus and Sirius. Can someone help me please!?


** Honestly you should repost this with the tag What's That Fic? and a title that's a quick summary of the story. You will probably get more replies that way as people are more likely to read the request with a relevant title. Good luck!
