*** Is it any good? I'm a bit hesitant to read a sociopath!Harry, considering the ones I've read before were rather disappointing.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12025821/1/The-Unbroken-Saviour][The Unbroken Saviour]] by ElegantlyDone. It get's into Voldemort's mindset and made him so persuasive. Enough so that it makes you want to side with him. However, Harry's mindset is so innocent at times. Then there's Dumbledore's POV where we can basically feel his conflicted thoughts. However, it starts jumping POV's in later chapters.
