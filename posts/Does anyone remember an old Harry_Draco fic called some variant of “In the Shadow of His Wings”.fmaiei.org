:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Like I said, fic name was “in/under the shadow of his wings”, it was privately hosted on a website called “house of hobbits”, I believe the author was “mirabella”.

First chapter/prologue has Percy interviewing Lucius in Azkaban.

This is a very old fanfic, I think abandoned in 2007 or so, and was only hosted on a private website that has long since gone under.

Does anyone have a spare copy, or an internet archive link? I know I found it on the waybackmachine a while ago, but having trouble now.


** [Found it, kinda]. It's in the “non LoTR fanfic” section. Does anyone know how to actually make that link work or access it? It doesn't work for me.
