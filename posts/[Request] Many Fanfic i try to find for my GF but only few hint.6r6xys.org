Hi !

As the title said, i try to find some fanfic that someone tell me few thing about. I hope you all can help me.

(My english is not good and i know HP by the french word, so some translation may feel weird. Sorry)

1- Harry potter choose the "faction" of ministry of magic and work with Dolores Umbridge against Dumbeldore

2- Harry at Hufflepuff. I know ! I suppose there are a lot like this but it seems like this one is well rating (and well writed) by the most ...

3- Harry got the sharingan. fanfic not that good but fun if you forget your brain

4- Severus snape is send to the past after harry sacrifice him self, severus try to play 3 games at once (Harry, Voldemort, Dumbledore)

5- Harry is stuck in a loop where is start over every time he die, and he did that like billion time but now he have to win because if he loop again some "time monster" will eat his souls.

I hope its not to fuzzy, thank you for helping me.


** Number 2 sounds like it could be linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff by BajaB).

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.
