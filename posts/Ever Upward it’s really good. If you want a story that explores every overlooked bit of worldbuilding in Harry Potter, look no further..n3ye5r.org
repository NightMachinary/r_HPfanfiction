House elves, centaurs, acromantulae, basilisks and other snakes, mers---everyone is explored and fleshed out, their cultures delved into and the nonhuman people actually given their own agency. There are quite a lot of characters, which is great because character interactions are where this story really shines.

There is also revolution.

*** It's mostly gen. There is a romance at the (very) end, but it isn't central - the identity of the romantic interest is, however, kind of integral to the themes of the story, and it would be both giving away a lot, and simultaneously somewhat meaningless, to disclose it before you've read it. I'm guessing that's why the author isn't clear about it. Also because, again, it's really 95% gen.

ETA: But if it matters to you either way, the story is very, very LGBTQ+ positive, and issues of...redressing power imbalances maybe? Hearing those whose voices have been minimized and disregarded... is a huge focus of the story. Romance is not; the series starts when Harry is maybe...6? and ends when he is about 14 or 15, if I remember right.

You're saying that not wanting to read a romance between a human and a different sentient creature is racism, and if you want to hold centaurs on a pedestal as an example, then you also get to include tentacle monsters, sentient trees and whatever else you can dream up. Whether there's sex involved or not doesn't change the fact that calling /that/ racism is downright insulting to PoC everywhere.

And yeah - pretty sure that any relationship concerning a centaur (or sentient tree) constitutes a kink.

(And if the story had romance between a sapient tentacle or tree and you called either of those scenarios a kink, it'd still be racist (or racism-adjacent) in the same way if there was no erotica involved.)

Oh dear. First, fetishes and kinks are not the same thing. Second, they're not inherently bad (or even bad /most/ of the time). I mean, getting hot and bothered by touching a woman's nipple is a kink.

A kink is something that'll arouse you. A fetish is something you /need/ to get aroused. THEY ARE NORMAL. So no, calling something a kink isn't being racist or racist-adjacent.

And yeah, I'm going to stand by calling a relationship with something that has the body of a horse 'arguably bestiality' since the definition of such involves intercourse with an animal. Sentience or not, a centaur has the body of an animal.

Finally - I'm ace, and quite frankly the secrecy around the 'surprise relationship' at the end of a gen fic made so many warning bells go off it ain't funny. I asked a simple question, and in return I got a 'NO, SPOILERZ' and some fluffy shit about how it means nothing. No - just spit it out. Say what it is, and say that the romance is barely there otherwise people are going to think the worst. As I did.

********* Racist is totally apt. Maybe your avatar should be Lucius Malfoy. Do you think the same of the parents of a character like Flitwick, who is part goblin? Or Hagrid, who is half giant? They are the product of relationships between intelligent, sentient, thinking, feeling people who happen to have different genes and appearance. To call it bestiality certainly reveals the same sort of bigotry that motivated the Malfoy and Dolores Umbridges of fiction, and in our world, those who once similarly labeled relationships between those of different human races. I feel no qualms about calling it racism or calling you out for being "uncomfortable" with it - I've heard that excuse before. Get over it or keep it to yourself, but don't spread that poison around.

Your virtue signalling is appallingly misplaced, as comparing interracial relationships like *the one that produced me* to a human getting knocked up by a *goblin* is so fucking insulting I can't even.

I'm well aware that it was bigotry to say that my mom's people were less than human savages when they were, and still are, human.

A goblin, a giant, a centaur, and elf... they are /not/ human by any stretch of the imagination. Why the fuck is sentience a big deal? I don't want to read about inter-*species* relationships. Race and species? Not the same thing.

And yep, I hereby give no fucks about calling taking a horse cock up your ass bestiality, whether said horse cock belongs to a centaur or actual horse.

************** Because I have two people losing their minds over the fact that I'm not interested in a cross-species pairing, who are telling me it's exactly the same as an interracial relationship. If a goblin is a person, bully for them. I'm still not interested, and I'm not sure why you care so much.

The Flitwick thing isn't canon, but if it was I'd consider both him and Hagrid hybrids. I don't particularly care about it, nor do I want to read about it. No, I don't consider them products of bestiality. It's no different than Spock - they're all hybrids, and I guess they deserve cookies for that?

Anyway - Horse cock just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Spent all day today pulling cock at work, must've been on my mind. (It's usually called 'dacron' after one of its brand names in polite company and its stuff that looks [[https://www.swagelok.com/downloads/webcatalogs/en/ms-02-316.pdf][like this]]. And is colloquially known as, yes, horse cock. So installing it is generally referred to as pulling cock. Sadly, it isn't even the only thing I can think of with that particular nickname.)
