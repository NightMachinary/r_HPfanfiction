The fic I have in mind is Harry gets kicked out of England right after he defeats Voldemort. He becomes a treasure hunter or curse breaker(I can't remember which). I remember him having a team to help him that are all OC. His only friends from England are Hagrid, Dobby and Winky. He and his team have to open this tomb that has some gem protecting it and while breaking the protections Harry becomes pregnant. That's all the farther I got I think. Thanks ahead of time for any and all help.

While I was real into the description up to this point, I have to go "wtf?"

And while the set up does sound interesting, I doubt you are going to have someone identify it here. Lots of people don't like manpreg.

**** That's too bad. Until the mpreg, that summary the OP gave is quite intriguing.

***** It's not your typical mpreg - barely any time is spent on the pregnancies or births, it's not fetishized, it comes about via a curse rather than /luuuurrrrvvvee/, and most of the plot is actually about the cursebreaking and the setup of this little self-contained society. I would recommend it to anyone, even people who don't like slash or mpreg - while warning them so they don't nope out.

Of course, it does have a lot of /kid/ stuff so people might dislike it if they don't care for kidfic.

**** Same here. It's a great story up until point. I had a request out for another story and one of the one recommend sounded familiar. I thought it was this one. But I was wrong thankfully.

  Coming as it did a scant 10 hours after his defeat of Voldemort, the Minsitry's exile of Harry Potter must have come as a crushing betrayal...
