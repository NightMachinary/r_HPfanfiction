** In a way, life is like an unfinished fanfic. You'll never get to know the ending, but you can enjoy the ride as best as you can, and dream of how it might have gone on.

It's always sad when you get to the last chapter of a story you enjoy and there's no more updates. But to come to terms with incomplete fanfiction is to become the Master of Death.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.
