I think in this one HP and friends decide to start a band. The very day they make that decision, Bill & Ted arrives at Hogwarts (in their time-traveling phone booth) because in order to win the Battle of the Bands, /Wyld Stallyns/ needs to learn from the most legendary band in history.

I'm hoping someone can remember this, because googling doesn't help, as Bill W. and Teddy keeps spamming the results. That, or I dreamt this.

Speaking of dreams, I also remember the Muggleborns at Hogwarts somehow turned Darth Vader into some sort of boogeyman and the ignorant Purebloods in Slytherin are afraid to go to sleep at night.

And I'm not sure if this is in this fic or some other one, but there's a running gag where Harry & Hermione convince Ron that towels are a Muggle secret weapon, and of course Ron finds towels increasingly useful--like, /deus ex machina/ level utility.

There's also a gag where one of them tries using fake name from /Ghostbusters/, but everyone recognizes it, even people who shouldn't, like Salazar's ghost or something.


** I started writing a story named fred and george's excellent adventure the other day... not sure if I will publish though.

*** Sounds fun. Fred and George are about to fail their History of Magic class and borrow Hermione's Time Turner (and Ron's Chocolate Frog Card collection) to make the greatest wizarding history presentation Hogwarts has ever seen?
