LP- Basically fics where Harry's family meet him post-war could be anytime. Could be a onseshot or anything. Any pairing is fine.

** Wynnebat posted a 4 chapters fic where Harry travels after the war, ends up in NY, and open his bakery with Dudley. It's a bit short and takes a second place after the start of the romance, but it's interesting to see Dudley talking about bettering himself, defying his parents authority/expectations etc, and Harry teaching him bits about the magical world and his own story/experience.

(It's on AO3, it's called something like Fantastic Treats).

** There are zillion “Dudley has a witch for daughter” (almost none of them good; OK, two exceptions) and they usually deal somehow with the post-War period in few sentences.

Some more treatment of this trope:

- linkao3(11676102;12305793;11676102) from GoF onwards from Petunia's point of view, perhaps the unique pairing of all. The last story is still WIP
- linkao3(Dudley Dursley and the Bee Hive by Jmso) nice idea (whole Dursley's hiding from Dudley's POV), but it is in dire need of cutting down to five chapters or so, 54 is just full of hot (or not so hot) air
- linkao3(Friends and Foes by Northumbrian) the first three chapters (which should be really separated as a separate work, F&F should start at the chapter 5)

There are many more (some of them even good), but I need to get to work :(

#+begin_quote
  This is the story of the Dursley familys perspective of things. After a small chapter of the Order planning for the Dursleys safehouse, it starts off with Petunia Evans´s childhood and what happened to her back then that made her behave so unreasonably strict towards Harry Potter. The main story however, tells us what happens to the Dursley family after they left no 4 Privet Drive to hide from Lord Voldemort. They were leaving with a witch and a wizard and something were bound to happpen between them.The story mainly reveals where the Dursleys went and who they met. How they would endure to be surrounded with magic, and what they did on a day to day basis. It contains a bit of magic, just enough to intrigue some family members and scare another. Some known names from the Potter books are mentioned, together with a couple of new introductions I made up. The story includes the Dursleys dealing with magic, oversized bumble bees, a murder, and a battle amongst other things.
