I pretty much got into hp fanfics a month ago and the ones I've enjoyed most are: harry potter and the accidental horcrux (and its sequel) on the way to greatness, dark as night, with a forked tongue I lie in wait. and the seventh horcrux

Harry can be neutral/grey or dark. I'd also prefer it if Harry is not friends with Hermione and Ron. It kind of annoys me when Harry is supposed to be in a different house and still becomes best friends with those two or sometimes he's dark, hates muggles and isnt a good person yet still decides to rescue hermione. Not that I hate them, admittedly so I've found myself to have started to like bashing on Dumbledore and the Weasleys.


** He isn't necessarily light nor grey or dark, so far, he isn't leaning to anywhere, imo, except being against Voldemort. but I'm curious why no one mentioned linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). It is, together with "On the way to greatness", the best "Slytherin Harry" in my opinion. Extremely slow paced, but so oh well written.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I like Lomonaaeren's "Other People's Choices," currently a WIP (Lomonaaeren is a powerhouse/workhorse and reliably completes her stories, although the word counts can go very high - currently at 44 chapters and 133,956 words for this one). Harry's resorted into Slytherin when the Hat falls on his head in the Chamber of Secrets. It's a spin on the different-House trope and is a good read so far.

"Burnt" by lastcrazyhorn has its flaws, but is an interesting take on a disabled Slytherin!Harry. "Better Be Slytherin!" by jharad17 is a great read, and I'm very sorry to say the author didn't continue the series after first year. Same for the Harveste Addams series by Kyaru, a fascinating and unusual HP/Addams Family crossover that is stalled in sixth year (even unfinished, it's a genuinely fun read - the first story is called "Harveste," and IMO the series really hits its stride around PoA).

My favorite non-Harry reSorting stories are "The Green Girl," by Colubrina (Slytherin!Hermione) and "The Changeling," by Annerb (Slytherin!Ginny), if you're ever looking to branch out.

"Seventh Horcrux" is my personal favorite, of all the Slytherin!Harry stories I've read. I'll have to check out the others you've listed!

** linkffn(Magical Relations by evansentranced) has a Harry in Slytherin, mainly because Dudley was also magical and got into Gryffindor. I remember liking the story a lot because of its exploration of Harry's friendship with his housemates and eventually, Dudley and other folks in Hogwarts. 1st year up to 5th year have been completed (69th-70th chapter). Unfortunately, the story updates slowly these days so it's currently stuck at the summer before 6th year (70th and 71st chapter).

I second the motion on [[/r/andante528][r/andante528]] 's recommendation of the Harveste Addams series. It's one of my favorites and I am deeply saddened that it seems almost dead. Read it on AO3, rather than FF.net. The author has uploaded an edited version of the series AO3 back in 2015 so that the unfinished sixth year story doesn't feel like it ended on a cliffhanger like the one on FF.net. linkao3(Harveste)

** Not sure it counts, because it's /very/ AU, but I can't recommend enough linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter) and its sequels. It's one of my favorite series EVER, even though it's a Fem!Harry and I usually hate genderbends of any kind.

Ron is super dumb and hates everything Slytherin, and Hermione is all the way over in America, so no worries there. There's no bashing, though. Harry is a pretty forgiving person. And she tends towards gray, I think.

And the best Pansy Parkinson ever in the history of Pansy Parkinson.

** linkffn(10267302) Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise is about a Harry who is three years older than in canon (everyone else is same age), Neville is the BWL, and James was a death eater. He isn't friends with Ron or Hermione. It was pretty good take on Harry as Voldemort's loyal death eater except for some bad grammar.

linkffn(11896247) The Serpent's Gaze is an extremely good read. Very good with character development. His best friend is Hermione but she isn't written as a Mary Sue and there is no romance between them. Ron isn't bashed but he isn't close to Harry. The story is 100+ chapters and still updating. I think we're on 6th year now. It doesn't follow stations of canon so it is interesting.

** linkao3(Session Transcripts by lastcrazyhorn) hasn't updated in a while but has really good writing in a unique style -- it's mostly interview transcripts. Ron is a friendly face in this one, and Harry is friends with Hermione. This fic's summary really doesn't do it justice.

linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectere) features Harry and Hermione in Slytherin, and friends. Can't remember what Ron's role was. It has great characterization of Snape and Aurora Sinistra.

I'm also working on a series which has Harry, Ron, and Hermione all in Slytherin. Not sure if that's what you want, but it does justify the three of them being friends (although, they aren't only friends with each other). It's a political AU with worldbuilding. linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) linkffn(The Chessmaster: White Knight)

In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy. However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

** They shook hands by Dethryl is the best one I've ever read. It sticks to the original writing style and so far has gone to the sixth book. Sadly, I think he's finally grown tired of writing or hit major writer's block while working on year 7. Great read for the first six books nonetheless.

*** Ah man, I'm midway into Philosopher's Stone and really, really frustrated with the Weasley bashing. The author keeps hinting in the AN that there's a reason for the way they're acting, but I'm losing hope (and interest). Does a reasonable explanation ever show up?

**** Yeah it does. The Chamber of Secrets pretty much deals with it.

I tend to agree with you, although I'd point out that it's not bashing /all/ the Weasleys: Bill and Charlie are good guys right from the start (plus Ginny of course), Fred & George come round so it's only really Ron and Percy.

I can live with a bit of bashing sometimes. What I found more annoying about these stories is the way we keep getting the fourth wall broken by real names. Head Boy William Windsor and Head Girl Kate Middleton, ffs. Totally unnecessary.

Ugh, I hate stuff like that. I recently started branching out a bit into RWBY fics and a bunch of them have Oum or Monty be the equivalent exclamations to oh god or Jesus, so dumb(Monty Oum is the creator of the series). Also a bunch have pop culture references from earth when remnant is a completely different world and should therefore not share any of our pop culture.

  A pre-Hogwarts tale that will be the first of eight books retelling the tale of Harry Potter. An exploration of the Many World's theory where changing one thing changes everything and at the same time changes nothing. HPMD sets the stage for a different Harry as he embarks on the journey of a lifetime. Rated M for language and later content.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.
