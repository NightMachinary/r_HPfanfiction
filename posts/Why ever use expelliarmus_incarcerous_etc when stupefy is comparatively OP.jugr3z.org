** Because The Stunning Spell has a major flaw.

Twelve Grimnauld Place, OotP:

#+begin_quote
  Tonks apologized over and over again, at the same time dragging the huge, heavy troll's leg back off the floor. Mrs. Weasley abandoned the attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down the hall, Stunning all the other portraits with her wand. Then a man with long black hair came charging out of a door facing Harry
#+end_quote

A few lines later in Order of the Phoenix, OotP:

#+begin_quote
  "Let's get downstairs, quick, before they all wake up again.”
#+end_quote

The portraits were all screaming the next day.

I didn't know this until I read it a few days ago, but I've always wondered why the Death Eaters didn't relent in the DoM; it was like they were down then back up again.

*** The Death Eaters had friends who could cast renervate. Simple counter to stupefy

**** No, not all spells wear off. Pretty sure most of them don't.

There's a reason to disarm a foe in all instances. You disarm them and now they're wandless. I believe you cannot disapparate without a wand and most people cannot do wandless magic to summon it.

** I would assume since incarcerous/disarming are first and second year spells where as stupefy is at least a 5th year (since harry only learned it for the tournament) that the formers are comparatively easier to cast.

Also in group brawls a stupefied opponent can be revivified by an ally meanwhile an opponent without a wand is a liability at best.

**** Summoning requires some level of committed concentration but I would just be making stuff up on which is easier to do.

A disarmed opponent would also have to actually let a friendly know that they need their wand back which wouldn't necessarily be the easiest thing in the world. (Hey Ms lestrange, could you summon my wand for me in between flinging crucios at Sirius?)

Also it's shown that powerful disarming curses can fling the opponent backwards so you might be able to get disarm them and incapacitate them in one go

** Mainly to advance the plot. I.e. keeping Pettigrew around and letting him escape.

If you want a real reason, maybe because it's such a widely known and basic spell it's super easy to shield against like you mentioned?

Or maybe most wizards are used to standard dueling, not fighting. (I love when fics point out the difference between those two)

I read a fic where dueling involved strings of spells so that one spell movement flows into the next seamlessly. Maybe stupefy doesn't mesh well in that flow of things?

The last point made me think that you'll pull a Harry and get too predictable if you just keep slinging the same spell in open combat.

Idk those are just some excuses to use a plot device.

** Safety? When using stupefy, your opponents drop unconscious to the ground and hit their head. I've heard of people who died from that, so maybe there's risk in using that spell.

*** I'd like to contest that. If being hit on the head with a metal pan (Harry), dropped from the upper floor window (Neville) or hit by a speeding iron ball (every quiddich player ever) was not lethal, then that small a drop will not do much damage to a wizard.

​

One thing against Stupefy is Rennervate, a spell that instantly reverses it's effects with no lingering grogginess or anything like that, which is also easier to cast.

Expelliarmus is useful because most wizards are effectively removed from the fight the moment they lose the wand.

Incarcerous is useful at higher levels, because it produces a physical binding at the cost of a charm, instead of conjuration. That means summoning, portkeys, curses... etc.

** I would assume the power of certain spells are different. Or there might be easier counters to different spells. Or the spells themselves travel at different speeds.

An Incarcerous summons animated physical objects which are different to defend against than spell energy.

Because of the many different types of spells, it is good to mix it up and keep someone off guard.
