#+TITLE: One day while young Harry was running from Dudley and his gang he tries something desperate to get away. He paints a black circle on a building and jump right through. Turns out the power the dark lord knows not is the power of bugs bunny and the loonytoons. Chuck Jones would be so proud.

** Voldemort screamed "Avada Kedava!" and a brilliant green beam shot towards The Boy Who Lived. Harry calmly lifted a U-shaped pipe from nowhere and caught the deadly curse, sending it right back at the Dark Lord.

*** From linkffn(The Fall of the House of Potter by Bobmin356):

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort's smirk changed into a snarl and his wand whipped up, casting a killing curse.

  Harry, already enraged, replied with a simple transference spell. It created two spheres, one in front of him and another behind the caster of the incoming spell. The killing curse entered his sphere and vanished.

  Voldemort stared in shock at the black hole that his curse had vanished into. He started to turn just as the curse blasted out of the second hole, hitting him in the back. He crumpled to the ground, then a second later both spheres exploded. The spell had not been designed to handle the kind of energies generated by a Dark Lord.

This occurs in the opening action, so I'm not giving away the main plot.

  AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks.

***** Works out about the same if you're doing a "cartoon power" sort of thing. Looney Toons, Tom and Jerry, Flintstones, anything with cartoon-style gags.
