** I mean, if someone wanted to explore it Tonks & Teddy can be good characters to explore at least some aspects of changing gender identity, given their metamorphic abilities.

** The consensus in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gyetow/operation_trans_canon/][last thread]] in this sub concerning the issue was that it's unlikely that trans people exist in the HP universe.

The main reasons are:

1. In-universe, if someone is in the "incorrect" body, then magic can likely fix this pretty easily, potentially even via a child's accidental magic when they are very young.

2. Out-of-universe, the nature of the HP books is that they use magical analogues for real life social issues: blood prejudice for racism, lycanthropy for HIV/AIDS. Meanwhile the wizarding world has no interest in a person's skin colour or gender - those prejudices are held by Muggles, not wizards. Therefore, if one were to write a story about trans issues, then to fit into the HP thematic framework it should be about a magical analogue of the issue.

*** I wonder how many people discussing that thread were trans? There seems to be a lot of well-intentioned yet misguided stances.

1. In my own story the dysphoria is corrected via magic, however that doesn't make the character no longer trans. Whether you transition via hormones & surgeries, via magic spells in fantasy, or you don't outwardly transition at all, a trans person is always a trans person.
2. Blood prejudice may be a magical analogue, but it doesn't mean that there aren't black people. So even with a magical analogue, that means trans people should still exist in-universe. And actually, metamorphmagus is a pretty good analogue anyway.

The real reason that it's unlikely that trans people exist in HP canon is that JK Rowling is transphobic. However, she has also said that she would include trans people in her fictions and attempt to be true to our experience. I'm not sure how she can do that with her current prejudices, and in fact the one time she tried it was a transphobic depiction anyway.

**** Question, if you can biologically change a person's gender(as in remake their body to a completely working one of their gender identity) what would make them trans? The psychological factor?

Have you ever read the Magnus Chase series? They have two characters there(I think only two) who can change their forms at will, including female and male(Loki and his kid, a demi-god) and both consider themselves gender fluid, because they don't have a set gender(Loki is actually the mother of the kid, despite his well-known form being male).

I found that an interesting prospect.

Now, Metamorphmagus seem to have a base form, it's just they can spend long amounts of time with another form, so your mileage may vary.

And wizards don't seem to care about gender and race that much, I don't recall even much sexism other than regular kid 'girls' stuff. Heck, MACUSA had a Black Woman as a president and The Ministry had been having witches as Ministers for ages, and no one makes a comment about their gender being a problem. Malfoy also never goes after anyone because they are a foreigner(the Patil twins) or of a different color(again, the Patil twins and Dean Thomas)

I normally steer away from these issues because some people from all sides, get overly stressed when even talking about it, but I find it an interesting sociological issue. And because I can't properly represent them in writing because it's not something I deal it.

***** I'm familiar with Loki's gender fluidity, yes, I think it's super interesting how gender is portrayed in all kinds of mythology actually not just Norse.

"Wizards don't seem to care about gender and race that much" well that's the Thermian Argument, which is flawed because it ignores the potential bias of the author. JK Rowling is a woman of many privileges and she wrote a very white-centric, hetero-centric, cis-centric universe. Sure there are a handful of tertiary characters who are POC, but none of the main ones, or even secondary.

She's not alone, most cis-hetero white authors do the same. Male authors have a tendency to write male-centric universes, notably LOTR. The handful of female characters got a serious makeover for the movies. Just like you said, you write what you know, and if you know cis-hetero white male culture, then that's what you have a tendency to write about.

I don't think it's beyond your or any one else's capabilities to write outside of that paradigm, but it takes a lot of research to get it right. I've wanted to write Maori characters in my own books, for example, but I'm worried I'd do something wrong, so I would just need to be careful and have plenty of beta readers and ask for feedback.

Even with my own fanfic, I made sure to have trans beta readers so that I was representing a more broad trans experience and not just my own. (I also had cis beta readers who helped me identify spots that trans people understood but didn't connect to cis people)

Are you interested at all in reading it? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

****** I liked it. It's hard to relate sometimes, but I do an exercise where I try to forget society's common axioms and just reverse them for myself. (What if me being attracted to women was considered wrong?)

I like it how everyone was supportive, found funny on how some were like 'Eh, so what?'

I found myself empathizing with the plight of the feeling of not belonging, it's a very human feeling but I think in this case it may be among the most intense.

I at first was curious as to the MC being combative, but I understood they were arguing with themselves too.

Umbridge's argument is another bad mark against her, as far as I can see, whatever uber spell Dumbledore used(transfiguration? Using the Elder Wand power?) gave the MC a new completely female body(I think it's just too OP to do that in a single spell, but maybe it requires someone of Dumbledore's skill or some wizards and witches went through a lot of work to optimize it). She became a woman for all intents and purposes.

One problem I see with today's arguments is that, ok, from certain points of view, we can't actually change biological genders completely.

Of course, for most cases, this shouldn't matter because it's not them and doesn't interfere with them, and for those involved who accept it everything is okay too.

But when things like sports are involved it does matter (men are just biomechanically different than women, up to a point where our science can't compensate).

What I am trying to say, is that I don't think society should butt in on this, for the great majority of issues, but when you involve things like sports, I also don't think trans women should compete with women because they tend to be much superior physically and it defeats the purpose of the competition.

In this case, the MC stopped being a biological boy and became a biological girl, it's something unprecedented, but I guess would be pretty liberating for the person. And makes Umbridge even more wrong(she would be wrong either way), however, if there's someone who would react like that, it would probably be her.

Basically, I like your fic, technically I thought it was a bit too fast-paced, but it's a one-shot, and I just read some fics who would probably drag the issue for some chapters for drama.

I think I would like to see a longish fic about it.

******* Thanks for reading it! Yours is a very valuable perspective for me.

Other cis people also related to the feeling of not belonging. For myself, I haven't felt like I really belonged anywhere for a long time, in any friend group or community etc., in large part because I was putting on a facade of what a boy behaves like to fit in. Any deviation from that, people would notice and often tease or even shame me for it.

In large part, it's because trans people have been rejected by mainstream society, so I guess I never felt a part of mainstreams society. Thankfully things are much more accepting of trans people, and I'm starting to feel like I belong. Writing this fanfic actually did a lot of inner processing on this.

Regarding sports, I don't really know too much about the science. I know my body has changed a lot and I have lost a lot of muscle mass since transitioning, even though I work out a lot still. But is it comparable to what a cis-woman would be like? I think I would have to read up on what the science says and defer to experts. There is a lot of armchair biology that gets thrown around on this topic.

And Umbridge's argument is essentially JK Rowling's stance. I actually red through her infamous essay before finishing the fic. Regarding transphobes, it feels like even if you could literally change your body down to the chromosomes, it still wouldn't be enough for them. Phobias are by their very nature irrational.

I obviously invented the /Genus Permutio/ spell, but yeah I thought it would go quicker and easier if Dumbledore helped with it. It's probably realistically much more involved without it involving the most powerful wizard using the most powerful wand.

Regarding the pace, that's sort of my style. I tried to be as brief as I could and cut out another three pages or so. If you'd like to see a longish fic about it, I am actually writing an original fantasy that is also a transwoman. Much different story than here.

Also, there's someone who is compiling trans-centric harry potter fictions, and wanted to include mine. That's cool that you want to read more about it!

That sounds terrifying, I am glad you are being able to overcome these feelings, and also that our society is improving in how we deal with this.

I had a debate with family and friends the other day, so I did some research, the medical consensus seems to be that for many purposes, even heavy hormonal treatment can't 'remove' the advantage, on running, for example, the very way the bones and muscles are organized and move favor men to be faster and even run longer(IF they train the same of course). You can see in many sports where transwomen steamrolled their competition and broke records from the get go.

On strength sports, even with hormonal treatment, male biology can on average produce denser muscles faster under proper training and nutritional regimen. It also tends to have more muscle and less fat on average.

Of course, this all talking about /athletes/, who practice, train, and eat properly constantly.

Now that's just ignorance, the only other argument is religious and that one shouldn't be used to settle civil matters.

Can you provide your resources? I'd be interested in reading them as well. I kind of avoid the sports debate because it seems so much less important than other trans issues. Like the bathroom issue affects all trans people, but the sports thing only affects ones interested in sports, and even then usually olympic level, etc. I also have never had any interest in sports. But I speak openly about trans issues & it keeps coming up so I guess it's time to get educated on it lol.

In general I don't think the male privileges I had growing up were erased when I started my transition. For example, I was in boy scouts, which was way more outdoors-focused than my local girl scout troop, which was all about cookie sales. It's not like I forgot all that when I transitioned lol. But also, there are a lot of changes that cis people generally don't see or understand, and there are some papers on transgender identity that have been published that have been later found to be extremely prejudiced upon a rigorous peer review.

What do you mean by "Now that's just ignorance"?

If a person says they are female, and their down to their chromosomes they are female, then they are, for all intents and purposes, biologically and I would say legally, female.

*********** Also another thing I wanted to say is even if what your saying is true, be careful because regardless, it gets used by transphobes to spout pseudoscience. You agree on one thing, and then they can radicalize you on other issues if you're not careful.
