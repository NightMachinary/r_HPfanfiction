** Don't know of any fics with them as the main pairing but linkffn(Breakfast in New York) has them as a secondary pairing (and has quite a nice portrayal of them once you get past the initial misgivings).

  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.
