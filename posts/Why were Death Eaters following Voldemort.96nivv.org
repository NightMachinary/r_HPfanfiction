I haven't read the books in a while so for the past years I have been under the impression that Voldemort was this charismatic leader. However I re-read today the first chapter of book seven and then the "The Death Eaters" chapter from GoF and I realized that Voldemort was really not charismatic at all. He was in fact a prick who humiliated his most loyal followers, always acted disappointed with them, was eager to accuse and hold over one's head their mistakes... exactly the opposite of a charismatic leader. He has absolutely nothing inspiring... all he talks about is himself - how he went where no other wizard had gone, how it's going to be HIS ministry - and doesn't even bother to hide it that he is not fighting for a common goal as his followers (as typical charismatic leaders do) but only for himself.

It could be argued that he was charming and pleasant until he broke someone but even so, with the attitude described in the books, no wonder the Death Eaters were unmotivated and were consistently fucking up. Actually I am surprised that there were no attempts of an internal revolt. Maybe I am reading too much into it not realizing it's supposed to be just an adventure story with a very evil villain but I was wondering if you also knew of any good fics that treated a little bit more accurately the relationship between Voldemort and his followers.


** We saw in book 2 that young Tom Riddle, the future Voldemort, was handsome and charismatic, and he even complained about it- having to pretend to care and shit.

Beyond that, fear is a good motivator- Hitler comes to your house personally with a rifle and says join or die, most people are going to join, reluctant and self-hating they may be- even if you're a racist prick like a lot of purebloods appear to be you don't usually want to fight in a war... so he picks em when they're young n dumb, the inner circle were his school mates mostly, he picked Draco while he was in school, along with presumably Crabbe and Goyle, I doubt it was just a one off, kids are more hotheaded than adults. (Bit disturbing Dumbledore did the same with the Marauders come to think of it, right out of school isn't much better, then again, that's how the real armies of the world do it too.)

The allure of power lured more than a few I imagine. Whether Voldemort planned on delivering that power... I doubt it, most Death Eaters were incompetent, though he gave even the snatchers jobs where they could abuse what little power they had in gangs- bullying people can feel good, it's wrong obviously but it's true.

And of course the fear of being hunted down, tortured and killed if they abandoned him- and most wizards weren't able to ward their homes- they had specialist wardbreakers- I imagine wardcrafting was a specialist occupation as well- only freaks like Dumbldore and Hermione are not only talented at so many different magics but presumably willing to put in the work into it- so no where to hide, he can track em down through the dark mark presumably, that or the masses of people wanting the leaders favor.

Edit: Not sure if it's canon or not, but I've seen more than a few fics where the excuse was "Muggleborns are stealing our magic" - usually they're not, and/or "Muggleborns and the blood traitors are trying to destroy our culture and replace it with Muggle culture"

The latter... has a point, just look at Granger, hears about house elves and immediately goes on a crusade to free all of them- no reading books about elves as far as the books said, no asking elves what they wanted save Winky- who is made more miserable because of it- but that doesnt stop her. She asks none of the what they got out of the bond- for all we knew in the books free elves slowly died in agony because they gain sustenance from Wizard's magic- or ward stones or whatever. But she rushes in because the little mudblood /knows/ slavery is wrong.

*** Thank you for the response. I think you are right about Voldemort mostly corrupting children. Most of the Death Eaters that are present in the books are more or less from the same generation as the Marauders. While in the sixth book is stated that he had followers from his generation such as Lestrange Sr or and old Nott, they are never mentioned in Harry's time even if they could still be active by wizard standards. So I like to imagine that there might have been an internal revolt at some point before Voldemort decided to impose such a strict discipline among his followers. Also Abraxas Malfoy and the Blacks are not mentioned as having any allegiance to Voldemort despite being Pureblood supremacists.

However I still remain of my opinion that Voldemort lacks any charismatic traits and is just a selfish asshole. Even Hitler - whom Voldemort is often compared to - knew how to be inspiring and I'm pretty sure he did not threaten for the slightest mistake or treat his inner circle like slaves.

Well yeah, he gets reborn as a snake man and doesn't bat an eye. Clearly either the Hocruxes unhinged him- a popular theory that they cause insanity and he made more than anyone- and with the pieces left behind- perhaps containing weak emotions such as love, compassion, respect of others and such... he also left behind some of his supposed cunning. Perhaps in the Hocrux in Harry? Oh, Harry wasn't all that cunning- but then his Mother's love possibly stopped it from influencing him mostly aside from visions and scar pains.

More, maybe he just decided he was too powerful to bother. Think about it- he thought he was immortal, and he was a decently fast caster- and most people were too terrified of him to put up much of a fight against him, so he decided to throw away being a kind leader for being a feared one. Hell, his tactics have always been that of a terrorist- he'd probably have gotten much further revealing himself as heir of slythern, showing off the Chamber of secrets and gaining whatever power- political, influential or otherwise that would have given him, that and his talent could have been a lever to move the world.

Fan misconception. Everything points to Voldemort already having looked pretty much the same in 1981.

I prefer the interpretation that simple psychology did it. Tom Riddle in the 1940's had to /pretend to care/, to pretend to be a regular human, to be charismatic. And he /could/ do it, because he's that clever, but he loathed every moment of it; it was a chore. As soon as he had established himself up as a god-of-evil-esque figure that could attract followers through fear alone, he gladly let go of all inhibitions and just raved and wantonly-murdered to his heart's content.

Ah, though there's still a point to be had- a normal person may have hoped to have been restored to a more human appearance.

I'm not a fan of that theory, but to each his own. Then again, I'm not the biggest Voldemort fan, it's a good thing Harry usually kicks his ass.

***** That could justify it indeed. Most of the Death Eaters were pretty broken by the time of his return and of course he was so terrifying that people didn't even dare to speak his name.

But then when he is at his weakest and Wormtail is the only one seeking him out. At that point Wormtail is truly his only hope of ever getting a body. Yet he still treats Wormtail like shit constantly calling him stupid, coward and useless. Way to motivate your followers, Voldie! Especially when your stay in the limbo depends on it.

****** Ah, he had an excuse with Wormtail... No one knew about him, he could have sought out Voldemort ages before. That and someone that's able to betray his very best friends... is liable to betray anyone, including perhaps Voldemort if some things had gone differently. Wormtail only resurrected Voldemort for protection as well when Sirus escaped and nearly killed him.

Still, after disposing of Wormtail- or giving him the job of recruiting in Morocco as a reward- keeps him out of direct fighting /and/ he might actually convince a guy or two to join up, what I would have done is figured out a way to somewhat automate resurrections, maybe stocked up on some blood of the enemy, bone of the father dust, and minion flesh, the ingredients get added to a cauldron in which is a baby under drought of living death which gets revived and possessed triggering it all- perhaps with a word, wraith voldemort could still speak.

That or getting some sleeper agents whose only job is to resurrect Voldemort and lay lower than low the rest of the time, and rewarding them richly for success.

Edit: That or Inferi they seemed able to follow simple directions and they lasted ages in the cave.

**** It's thought by some that Voldemort's death/creating his Horcruxes caused him to go insane. He was most definitetly charismatic as Tom Riddle at least.

I prefer the interpretation that he /could/ be charismatic if he wanted to, but /hates/ it, as it goes against his every impulse. Tom Riddle in the 1940's /had/ to /pretend to care/, to pretend to be a regular human, to be charismatic. And he /could/ do it, because he's that clever, but he loathed every moment of it; it was a chore.

** I could go into all sorts of elaborate explanations, but I think I should let Dumbledore speak for me:

HBP Ch. 17:

#+begin_quote
  "As he moved up the school, he gathered about him a group of dedicated friends; I call them that, for want of a better term, although as I have already indicated, Riddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them. This group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle. They were a motley collection; a mixture of the weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they were the forerunners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

The Death Eaters were humans, plain and simple. They served for there own reasons. Some from fear of Voldemort. Some out of natural inclinations towards violence and destruction. Some from the belief that he would ultimately win and wanting to align with the winning side.

However, all of this can be ulitmately boiled down to a simple reality: Voldemort is more powerful than /all/ of his Death Eaters and if pressed could kill, maim, or imperius them to do his bidding with little effort. And they know this. Compare that with the other side, who has to at least maintain a veneer of justice and impartiality (in theory at least), why not side with the Snake Man?

** The first war is never shown, only recounted through by people who lived through it to HP - and HP doesn't care about anything a whole lot, so info is quite limited. It is quite possible that Voldemort is charismatic, we're not seeing any of those times when he is being favourable to his followers. HP gets the visions when Voldemort is enraged, and this happens only a handful of times.

In any case, a lot of the Death Eaters were very young when they joined Voldemort - Lucius Malfoy is 15 when the Marauders and Snape join Hogwarts, and Voldemort begins his actions sometime in the 70s. Lucius would have joined fairly quickly - when he was in his late teens, which is hardly a time when people are going to be pragmatic. Regulus Black became one when he was 16, Snape probably joined in school or right after he left. Even Bellatrix is in her twenties when she joins them, which is quite young (but she never cared about whether it was morally wrong or not).

The second thing you need to understand is Voldemort is a figurehead - someone to rally behind. Powerful, willing to fight for your cause, and charismatic (as was probably the case the first time). Teenagers and young adults would have flocked to him. The second time around, they followed him because they were so close to winning the first time - it took Deus Ex Machina to stop Voldemort the first time, nobody could have thought Deus Ex Machina can happen twice, but that's fiction for you.

** I think you're underestimating how much loyalty an abusive relationship can still somehow inspire in many people, particularly those without a good support network and a hyper masculine mindset.

Leaders don't come out in the same stamp. Obama and Trump are all different people, as are Dumbledore, Fudge, Harry Potter, and Tom Riddle. They nonetheless all find a way to inspire and lead. Moreover, fear is an incredible motivator, especially when it is mingled with the potential rewards of revolution. While Voldemort hardly seems like a charismatic man compared to Tom Riddle, it's possible that he's simply past that stage with his closest Death Eaters. They are already following him. Now he has to crush their spirits and keep them cowed and afraid of him.

** There's many reasons:

- Charisma (Voldemort was powerful, he knew how to motivate people (before he became cruciatus happy!), he had magical power to back up his claims etc.)

- claim to an old name (Slytherin!)

- magical power (he rivaled Dumbledore and was one of the few people who could duel the manipulative old man! Hell, it might have only been the Elder Wand and his experience that kept Dumbledore alive in their fights!)

- ideology (he shares ideas and ideals and visions for the future of the world with the pureblood bigots!)

- good connections (Voldemort was well connected as a student and beyond, especially since he was in Slytherin and many Slytherins go on to become leaders, politicians etc.)
