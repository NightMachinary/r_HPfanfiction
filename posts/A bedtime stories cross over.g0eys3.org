In the film Bedtime Stories everything the kids include in the bed time stories come true in life. My prompt is a story focused on Luna and her reporting of completely random things she thinks up that somehow become true. Crazy mythical creatures are found using her guides, new zoological facts are discovered such as that music puts a cerbeus to sleep. No ody understands how she discovers this stuff and many ignore them as rediculous but some how they all are true.


** Luna nodded in a satisfied manner as she finished her latest and most fun work. Now she just needed someone with the power to actually pull off the spell. Sure Dumbledore could pull it off but she didn't feel like bothering the headmaster.

Sitting at the table she noticed Harry Potter at the Gryffindor table looking lost. To many wrackspurts were infecting the boy. He was trying to deal with his escaped insane godfather trying to kill him this year.

So she gathered up her things and waited for him to slip out during dinner like he usually did. She had noticed he tended to seek small dark places away from everyone when he felt the need to be alone.

She followed him to the east wing fifth floor corridor. He had found a small closet and was curled up resting his chin on his knees deep in thought.

She opened the door knelt down beside him. Smiling gently she held out her hand.

"I'm Luna Lovegood, this is a rather nice closet. Much more comfortable than I would have thought. If I had thought about how comfortable it was that is. Which I haven't until now. So I guess it's exactly as comfortable as it should be."

She kept her smile up and her hand out as he tried to parse her statement.

Giving it up as a bad job ahead shrugged and took her hand.

"Harry Potter, you don't think I'm a freak for hiding in a tiny closet?"

She frowned as the wrakspurts started returning to Harry. They had mostly cleared out already.

"No of course not, though perhaps I should study the effects of enclosed places and isolation on wrackspurts."

Harry was thoroughly confused at this point and wondered what the girl wanted.

"Well good luck with that. Is there anything I can do for you?"

At that her face lit up and she pulled him into a quick hug.

"Oh yes! If you could cast this spell for me it would make studying the unseen far easier with help! It's a bit beyond my ability to cast. I am sure you can pull it off though."

She was making the understatement of the century there. The boy had enough power to level the castle if it wasn't all bound up in self doubt, feelings of unworthiness, and a near crippling anxiety of wishing to be 'normal'.

She could see the many creatures of the unseen feasting on the boys many mental issues. It was rather sad, she decided that she would help him as well with that.

"Of course I wouldn't want to be seen taking advantage of you. It would be most untoward of me to be taking advantage of a young man like that. Oh the scandal!"

Harry figured she was having a laugh and played along. It was nice to be seen as something so silly for once.

"Of course then, we wouldn't want that now would we?"

She nodded firmly and grabbed hold of his hand.

"Come along, we'll take care of the Unseen Cleansing Ritual first. It will make casting that spell much easier."

He had no idea what was going on exactly but her hand felt nice in his and he was enjoying this short experience so far.

They tramped across the castle until she was in the 9th floor western tower. There she had found an old dying sun ritual room. Designed to take advantage of the powers that gathered during twilight.

She made a few quick changes and got everything set up. She put on her serious face and began explaining what was going to happen to Harry.

"This ritual is an old one. I do it every week myself to keep the mind clear. It was designed to clear the mind of negativity and soothe the soul. It was so popular though that they banned the usage here at Hogwarts as there was no way to let everyone perform it. So to stop the fighting they banned the ritual. It's a perfectly safe ritual, I vow."

Harry thought over what she had said and noticed her words at the end. A given magic vow was not binding but it was not something people would make lightly either. Their magic would rebel against them for using it in such a manner if they did. This made spell casting difficult, near impossible even for weeks after a broken vow.

She really wanted to just help him out and to be honest a ritual to help him clear his head seemed great right now.

Nodding he agreed and smiled at how cute she was. She had started clapping and jumping around when he agreed. It meant at lot to her he trusted her so easily.

She set up the ritual and waited for the right time. When the twilight hit the right moment she coached him through the ritual and soon enough she was staring at him in pure awe.

His magic had taken the opportunity to untangle itself with the freeing of his self made shackles and the the parasites feeding on them.

He felt a sharp pain flash across his scar and suddenly he felt much lighter. Like a headache he had always had but been unaware of was suddenly gone. It was a wonderous feeling. He did not notice the faint green energy the dissipated from his scar into nothingness.

To her eyes he was a blazing star beaming across the room. She walked over to him and gave him a kiss on the cheek.

Luna Lovegood was staking her claim now before he cast the spell she had devised. When others saw his strength they would descend like harpies onto him.

"That was nice Luna, what was that for?"

He felt his cheek where she had kissed him and kept smiling.

"Harry Potter will you be my boyfriend?"

Harry was taken aback, he wasn't sure at first if the kiss had been between friends or her showing interest.

Now he knew it was her showing interest for sure he needed to know why.

He didn't have the normal pervading fear of her being interested in him as the Boy-Who-Lived. He accepted it could be that reason, it would be disappointing but nothing he couldn't handle now. Now that his mind was free and clear.

Her reply was straightforward and swift.

"You're handsome and you trusted me. I could have been lying to you, leading you into a trap, or any other horrible thing yet you trusted be without hesitation. That means so much to me, you're a wonderful soul Harry Potter. I want to know all of it."

He loved the sound of that and replied with a kiss to her cheek as well. Holding out his hand at their redlining faces he refused to look away.

"Wonderful! Now we need to cast that spell soon. The sooner after the ritual the better!"

Harry took the spell and looked it over. It was an area spell unlike anything he had seen before.

"What does it do? Umm... can I call you Luna now that we're dating? It's alright to call me Harry."

She kissed his cheek again and nodded.

"Luna sounds great Harry. The spell is one that let's the unseen be seen. It's rather simple it just needs the right person to cast it. You are the perfect person to cast it."

Harry looked over the notes and he agreed it did look simple enough. Just two words; Apertus Oculus.

He practiced the wand movement a few times and the got used to matching them to the words. With Luna coaching him he had it down in a few minutes.

He felt better than ever and she was good at explaining things in a clear way. He never cared about 'starting at high left centrepoint of the body swish in a counterclockwise direction until level again'.

Point it out, twirl it left and end where you started. Damn that was some easy instructions to follow.

They practiced the mental instructions separately for a bit before they both felt he could bring the two together easily enough.

*"Apertus Oculus"*

He felt a wave of power rush out of his wand like nothing before. It felt warm to the touch and he could see it was letting out strands of silver steam. Turning to look at Luna he was stunned by what he saw.

She had been cute before but now she was stunning. He could see her shining that same silvery light as his wand had let out. It danced across her skin and flit through her hair like a ballet of magic.

He gave her a soft kiss on the lips and let her know.

"By god you are beautiful Luna. Promise me you'll always be mine."

He stared into her eyes as she touched her lips where he had kissed them.

"Yes Harry, now and forever we are together. Come let us see what mischief we have wrecked this night."

*** It is important to note the orginal spell, the one which killed her mother was the infamous Oculis Videre Verum spell.

A spell which allowed witches and wizards to see the unseen. However the mortal mind was mostly unprepared to see the Truth of Everything.

Few survived the spell, fewer were not driven completely mad by seeing the unseen in its raw form. Luna was one of less than a hands worth in written history to have done both, her mother had not survived the experience.

Her newest spell was a much safer alternative than the old spell. It forced them to *see*, but they would *see* through the filters she had built over the years.

It would only drive less than a few dozen of the vilest of them mad. Only those who had twisted their souls in the most horrendous of ways would die from the experience. A few who had started down those paths would be driven to madness.

Overall it was worth it as they only had themselves to blame for performing such acts.

She fully expected Snape to die, so deep into the Dark as he was.

Dumbledore was guaranteed to pass, being so twisted into the light.

Neither of those events bothered her. Nor would they Harry once she explained it to them.

As the scream of horror started up she kissed her boyfriend on the cheek as they made their way into the rest of the castle.

She could see Edgecombe casting scouring charms on herself desperately as she cried in terror. A futile attempt in trying to cleanse herself from the twisted taint that had already begun taking hold of her.

It had always been there, now she, and everyone else who had been in the castle, could see it.

She could see the occasional wrackspurt approach Harry and would give him a kiss to chase it away. After pointing them out to him first that was.

Seeing the inner truth of others and the parasites that fed off their mental issues was hard for him to handle.

He warm soft hand in his with her gentle kisses helped him stay on solid ground.

By his third doubt and fourth wrackspurt sighting he cleared the doubts entirely away.

He never wanted such a creature infecting him again.

Luna smiled and hummed along as they strolled through the castle. Watching the vast majority of the castle loose their shit over coming face to face with themselves.

They found Hermione in the library staring at herself in horror as she saw herself infected with hundreds of small beasts each screaming at each other in debate on who was more knowledgeable and better than the others.

Luna had explained the Unspeakables would likely make their way her by then next morning to cast a school wide cleansing.

By then everyone would have faced their own issues enough to understand them enough for the cleansing to be mostly effective.
