** I don't know anything about Harry Potter smutfic but I'd love to learn some more.

I'm not altogether opposed to waterworks, but setting up Luna to be a moving fountain from the get go was a little ambitious, methinks. You should really ease your readers into it. I mean, I don't particularly care if you have girls literally drowning in a tub of glory if you have incremental development towards it, just make sure there's a logical progression.

Feels odd giving advice on how to realistically make your smut fucked up. Novel experience.

Also, I feel that a lot of your characterization is over the top and unreasonable. Maybe Luna's juices being the nectar of the gods can be explained by magical alakazam, but there's no particular reason Ginny should be in love with her own piss by her second sip. There are censors in the human mind that takes time to breach, and I feel like you're entirely disregarding them in favor of straight up sasunaru-esque sex orgies.

Also, less chat, more smut. Dialogue that overwhelms sex ruins the point of smut, unless you just want it to be an M-rated fanfiction.

On an unrelated note, who the fuck is Fay Dunbar and how have I never heard of her before?

*** [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Fay_Dunbar][She was in Hermione's dorm.]]

She has no real conversations, or presence in the books. Unsure about the movie, in fact I was surprised she had an actor.

It's like Sally-Anne Perks, off handedly mentioned never to be seen again.

It is meant to be pretty mad from the get go, but I understand what you're saying... also that was my first fic, certainly don't profess to be good at writing hah ;)

** I haven't looked at your fic yet, I'll do so and give you some feedback.

My problem with most smut is that the characters are OOC without reason and the situations are incredibly forced and unbelievable. I strive in my writing to at least make the smut believable and each girl to have her own unique personality so you can't just swap girl 1 for girl 2 in any given scene.

Someone complained that my latest story Hogwarts Shuffle! had a bit of the swappable girl going on, but I think they haven't read it correctly if they can't see the differences. Searching for the Power was really hard for me to keep the girls separate but I did it... I don't know why I'm writing another harem fic... because there aren't enough good ones that I haven't read already I guess...

*** I try to stay within character, especially when it comes to dialogue. But there's only so much you can maintain with certain smutty writings :D

** Love smut HP fics. Best one I read so far is A Big Happy Weasley Family by werewolf warrior.\\
I think your story is not bad but needs more seduction scenes. Thank you for the work and best of luck to you :)

***** YOU LIED!!!

I was thinking of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4867943/1/Cuckolding-at-Shell-Cottage][Cuckolding at Shell Cottage]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/881050/cloneserpents][clonserpents]]

THAT one is in fact really, really good.

** Story Ideas:

I would like to see a fic where Harry claims all of the women that were death eaters or married to death eaters to become Harry's sex slaves. Setup as a Harry's Brainy Girls
