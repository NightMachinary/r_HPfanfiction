***** I read it, it doesn't seem to have any of that. That I can remember. It presented the marauders as a war torn but still barely holding on freindship, unlike the amazing thing it was shown as to first year Harry (And I really like how Harry matures as he realizes this). Sirius is mean to Harry, but that's because he thinks he's an everyday death eater who rapes muggleborns and kills babies.

Snape is the normal old git, Regulus is fine in some ways, but still a death eater git as the only reason he really rebelled was because of the horcrux, wasn't it? Voldemort's a little more manipulative than before (But he was a little saner before, wasn't he?).

And Harry's his usual Gryfindor self, he doesn't randomly become a slytherin, even if he could have been a couple of years back.

**** Fun fact: The [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14403330/][Ao3 version]] is two chapters shorter than the FFN version because a few months ago the author didn't feel the latest chapters were high quality and chose to take them down to revise them.

So at least you missed out on that pain of seeing one of your favorite fics had updated, only to find that the update made it /shorter/.

  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.
