** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and sequels have a snarky protagonist who claims she just minds her own business but nonetheless ends up embroiled in a bunch of different conflicts opposing the anti-muggleborn crowd. She's a genuine potions prodigy and generally intelligent, but is surrounded by talented people and she certainly does not lord her knowledge over everyone else.

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom). Harry in this fic is likable, sarcastic and yet not afraid to stand up for his beliefs. One of his best qualities is that he is very personable and strives to help others and so makes genuine friends with many different characters. He is reasonably smart although not exceptional or anything like that.

While he does have a good moral code, he is stuck with Voldemort as his sort of mentor (who is more reasonable and a better leader than in canon). Their dynamic is very well written and somehow works despite them being opposites in many ways and having completely different ideologies.

** The Colours of the World linkffn(11949378)

It's a crossover with FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood, and the MC if from that universe. You do need to watch the anime if you want a really good grasp on what's going on, especially the first few chapters, and it's got some pretty big spoilers for that series in any case.

Even if that wasn't the case, I'd still recommend that you pull up VRV and watch FMAB if you haven't already. Really great series.

Anyways, what I like abot Roy in this fic, is that he's smart and rational, but also studious, hard working, and humble once he realizes just how different the world that he has landed in really is.

He's a sensible character, and it's a very well written fic.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.
