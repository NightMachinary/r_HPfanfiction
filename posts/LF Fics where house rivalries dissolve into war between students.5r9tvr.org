Either open or secret, with teachers supporting, not trying to stop it or trying and failing. And it shouldn't be a normal occurance in the setting. I don't care who's warring against who.

Bashing, slash, crossovers and dark!harry are okay. Please no romance/smut-driven plot, genderbending, pottercest, mpreg or harems.


** "Harry Potter and the Butterfly Effect", linkffn(9065880): [[/spoiler][Baby Death Eaters in the Slytherin House acted as Voldemort's vanguard, leading to the slaughter of ALL Slytherins by the other three houses and the staff]]

"Yes, I am Harry's Brother", linkffn(8192853): The "Brother" was actively inciting open conflicts between houses. [[/spoiler][Many in the Slytherin house and staff members were killed]]

  Minor events can have repercussions far beyond their size and importance. When one of these minor events occurs to a ten year-old Harry Potter he finds his world turned upside-down and it starts him down a very different path than the one he expected to follow.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7092183/21/Harry-Potter-and-the-Summoner-s-Stone][Harry Potter and the Summoner's Stone, chapters 21 to 23.]]

It's a semi-crossover between HP and Final Fantasy in the sense that it uses several espers as main characters; 21 to 23 have a subplot where the Quidditch teams mess up the house-points and it leads to a big brawl between the students (not helped by Snape).

It might tide you over for a little while.

** In Red Headed Stepchild, there is open warfare in the student body later in the story, [[/spoiler][strictly speaking it's along pureblood supremacist vs everyone else lines, but is effectively Slytherin vs everyone else]]. The story features a trans (mtf) Harry figure, but treats her as a student who happens to be trans, rather than a trans pnerson who happens to be a student. In all honesty my only problem with the story is that it has been nearly four years (Feburary 2013) since the last update.
