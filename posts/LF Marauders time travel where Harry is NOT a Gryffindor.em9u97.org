I was wondering if there were any time travel fics where Harry wasn't a Gryffindor? I'm just sort of bored with it and would like to shake things up. I unfortunately haven't found any of those of fics so I was wondering if anyone else has.

I don't care about slash/femslash/het/gen. Anything's welcome.

Also, if you would like to, you can through in some fics where Harry doesn't really interact/tries to avoid the Marauders despite being in Gryfffindor.

But mainly just Harry in a different house please, whether it is because he wants to preserve the timeline, wants to shake things up or avoid those in the past.

Thank you so much!!!!!

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

*** /Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is/ and /The Second String/ are both really, really good imo. But be warned, the Second String did make me ugly cry a couple of times and is a WIP (that updates fairly regularly, i think?).

Linkffn(Broken Reflections by JacobApples)

*** Do you mean fanfictions that are written in French? If you are then it's okay, I still read fan fiction in different languages, I just need to translate the page! (Which makes reading it a little weird as it tends to translate literally, but the different plots are worth it!)

**** Yes There are Really good ones. My personal favourites corresponding to your requirements are "Les Cicatrices du temps" by Ellana-San, "Voyage dans le passé" by LaFolleDeService, "La Guerre de LorMirAl" and "Les Reliques des Aînés" by Coeur de Bouddha, "Les Immortels" by Danse La Mort. There is one in english about a Harry in Marauders era but at one point he accidentally goes in the "futur" that is "his" era (which has changed): "Delenda Est" by Lord Silvere.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10413771/chapters/22996143]]) , Turning of the Times by the thenoacat, shows how being sorted to Ravenclaw to avoid interacting with the Marauders changes Harry slowly. I think this fic takes a couple of chapters to get going, but gets really good with characterization after that. Unfortunately the author has not updated it since February despite having the finished the draft, and with just 4 chapters to go.

** Time to Spare is a fic where while he is in Gryffindor, he doesn't have too much interaction with the marauders. Now the fic does also include Draco going back as well but I feel that it was excellently done and in a way that some-what realistically changed Draco. linkffn(2538955)

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...
