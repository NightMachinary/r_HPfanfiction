So I'm a fan of fics that go back to Riddle's era and I'm slowly running dry...

So I saw Lord of Time and tried to give it a go, only to realise that the first couple of paragraphs were familiar.

I think I've tried to read it three times now and not made it past the first chapter. I just don't think it's written all that well.

Does it get better? Is it worth slogging through if not?

** I can't speak for what might have turned you off from it before, but personally I gave up on it shortly after the Yule Ball scene (Ch36)

The writing quality in the first chapter stays roughly the same throughout the fic. What turned me off is that the fic uses some of the most common and absurd tropes in the "time travel back to teen Tom Riddle" genre: Tom is ridiculously possessive of Harry, but that possessiveness is written as romantic rather than creepy. Harry and Tom are the sexiest young men in Slytherin, and everyone wants them. Harry is OP to the extent that he wipes the floor with anyone who challenges him, and uses his adult intellect to lead Tom Riddle around by the nose, etc.

*** I read it up to two chapters ago, and I liked it, but it was very tropy (not a word). At the same time, without an OP, intelligent Harry, Riddle would have no reason to change the course of his life for a teenager. Again, LF 1940s sane Tom are rare enough that it's become a standard.

**** I've read a few fics of this type where the time traveler and Tom are on more even footing, which in my opinion makes for a more interesting relationship between them. In this case Tom seemed to be outclassed by Harry in every way, which makes Harry look like a Gary Stu.

***** Yeah I think that's the best way to go about a riddle fic. Teenagers being actual teenagers in actions and skill.

****** Eh, I've seen a few fics where the time traveler being an adult actually makes for a great plot. For example, I've enjoyed "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12541396/9/you-belong-to-me-i-belong-to-you][you belong to me (i belong to you)]]" so far.

******* Oh I think I've read where ever that's up to. Think I remember liking it. On ao3 tho.

But I was more so thinking of when teenagers are made OP for no reason.

** There are plenty of well thought of fics that I've skipped out on because they weren't to my taste. You read for enjoyment and you know your own taste best - if it's a chore to get through the first few chapters than there's really no point in continuing to read.
