I read the one with the sorting hat tearing down everyone in a very creative way (was it 'lie I've lived '?) And I was hoping to find more like this.

In canon there's a few witty moments, but in fanfiction it's usually just name calling: death eater, inbred, scar face, weasel, mudblood, potty bla bla bla.

I know they're children for most of the series, but I'm sure there's teenagers around that can be funny or really hurtful if they put their mind to it.

** NSFW takedown of Marge Dursley:

#+begin_quote
  Marge said, "Well, there you go you little freak! See what happens to children like you? The legitimate ones get homes and the bastards get foisted on my overburdened brother, here!"\\
  Uncle Vernon said, "Eh, Marge, perhaps a bit more Brandy--"\\
  Marge said, "Don' interrupt! It's obvious where this one's headed. I've seen it before. If there's something wrong with the bitch, there's something wrong with the pup! No doubt you'll take to your mother's whoring ways like flies to shite!"\\
  I wanted to let Petunia field that one, except all I heard was silence. I asked quietly, "Aunt Petunia, have you nothing to say in my Mum's defense?"\\
  Marge said, "Hah! Obviously she is in accord."\\
  I stopped being non-Holly and rose to my full height. My voice carried well and clearly. "Your obsession with dogs wouldn't have anything to do with your poorly disguised background as a Carnie, would it?"\\
  Marge said, "What?"\\
  Uncle Vernon said, "What?"\\
  Aunt Petunia said, "What?"\\
  I continued, "Well, I've always known you couldn't be directly related to Uncle Vernon. Despite bearing sufficient load to balance a raft against my uncle's girth, your physical resemblance to him ends at the size of your moustaches."\\
  Marge said, "Shut up."\\
  Uncle Vernon said, "That's quite enough out of you."\\
  Admittedly, I was carried by momentum at this point. "Your slack-jawed ramblings in defense of a useless life devoted to raising bladder-emptying mongrels too hideous to be loved as a mutt are only tolerated round here for some leverage you must hold over my uncle."\\
  Marge said, "Shut-Up!"\\
  Uncle Vernon said, "How dare you!"\\
  "I have always conjectured that one of your early show-winners was actually the mongoloid issue of some backseat sweat-fest between you and Vernon back in your school days. Such a scandal might motivate him enough to keep you sloshed on cheap brandy two weeks of the year. Was that it?"\\
  Marge said, "Shut! Up!"\\
  Uncle Vernon said, "I'm warning you...!"\\
  Aunt Petunia said, "Vernon, is there something you need to tell me?"\\
  Dudley said, "Heh, good one!"\\
  "I can only assume you keep small dogs because the big ones can't ram their dog-parts up your constipated arse anymore.”\\
  Marge said, "Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!"\\
  Uncle Vernon said, "That is the last straw!"\\
  Aunt Petunia said, "Vernon?"\\
  Dudley said, "Righteous!"\\
  "How often has Ripper been trapped within your abyssal knickers upon a Saturday night? No wonder he attacks at your command, you've been suckling him on your menstrual discharge until menopause struck, so now he's always hungry!"\\
  Marge said, "Shut Up! Shut Up! SHUUUUT UUUUUP!"\\
  "YOU SHUT UP, you stupid, hateful, drunken, abusive, slack-eyed, addle-pated GASBAG!"<

** Perhaps "Enter the Dragon" linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5585493/1/Enter-the-Dragon]])

Harry and a delightfully Snarky Snape practise creative insults with each other. And of course it's just an amazing story. So sad it ended.

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

  Before Lily Potter, there was Lily Evans. Before a martyr of the Light, there was a little girl that had to find her place in a world at war about her right to live. Lily Evans wasn't just a prologue or side note of other people's lives. She was the protagonist of her own story. This is Lily's story, told in small moments and oneshots.
