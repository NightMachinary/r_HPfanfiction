I'm interested in cleaning fics up for authors, but where do I start? Do I just PM random authors?


** There is option of beta profile on ffnet. Alternatively you can tell authors that their fics are bad and they should feel bad and end up roped in beta-ing.

** I wouldn't advise contacting authors directly to be honest, unless they've specifically said somewhere they're looking for a beta. We quite often get threads asking for help so I would wait for one of those. Also maybe put it on your profile and leave detailed, constructive reviews. They'll come to you.

** That is possible, but you could also simply wait until you get contacted in this thread - or make a thread "looking to beta read".

** Make a note of it on your profile and if people like and admire your writing there's a good chance they will contact you.

** Go on DLP and contribute to the wba. If you're any good there are plenty of people who'd like a proper beta.

** You sound like me, I see a fic with poor spelling and grammar and I would just /love/ to overhaul the entire thing. Spelling always came ridiculously naturally to me, I don't really get how anyone can put something out riddled with mistakes.
