*** Oof, well, tell your younger sibling that there are fanfics out there that have Harry & Lily (mum) and fics that have Harry & Lily (daughter).

Iirc (i havent really used Ao3 in a while), "&" means a platonic, amiable relationship.

Warning: There are many incestious fics (who have tags with "x"), some of which contain lemons.
