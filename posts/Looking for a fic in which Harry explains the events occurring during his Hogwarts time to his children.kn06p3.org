***** So .. you broke into a bank, killed your teacher, blown up your aunt, went to fight against a very large snake which can kill you on sight, broke into a govt facility, destroyed govt property, were on the run from the govt, killed someone and helped people kill others like him .. all of this before you are 17 and I can't stay up after my bedtime? You are a hypocrite dad!
