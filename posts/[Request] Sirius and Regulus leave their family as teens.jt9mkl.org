Hey there! I'm looking for any Marauder-era stories where both brothers leave for the Potters' home instead of only Sirius. Doesn't have to be centered around Regulus specifically, though, would just like for this divergence to be of some kind of significance.

Preferably complete or close to complete, please. I'm fine with slash pairings and time travel, just no incest or werewolf-form bestiality, I've scrolled past a concerning amount of both written on ao3 for our fandom and just nooope.

Please and thank you for any story suggestions!


** Yes, there is. First I'll get the self promo out of the way with linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12960323/1/Love-is-Just-a-Potion-Away]])

There's another one I'm think of but I'll have to hunt for it, it seems

(Also I totally agree about the incest and other stuff. As a regulus black fan it is pretty rife!)

*** ok this still isn't the one i was thinking of but regulus does leave home and head for the potters. It's a bit of a wacky fic but can be quite funny linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11491209/chapters/25775856]])

***** found that fic finally! it's not like, amazing, but seeing Siri's try to be responsible and Regulus having to fully face up to their parents' breathtakingly wrong ideas is interesting
