Looking for a fic, WIP last I checked. The war is over and Hermione accidentally gets sent back in time after an avalanche while skiing. She gets sent back into her own body (retaining her 19 year old consciousness) during her fifth year at Hogwarts. She keeps changing things to try to save people. Fremione. Thanks!!!
