So I've tried reading stories where the romance is during their Hogwarts years and it's cringe worthy at best, it's very difficult to get me to get invested in romance stories during Hogwarts, especially say when it's a canon pairing and we know pretty much what will happen.

So I want stories that focus on them being young adults/adults. Showing realistic struggles that they face. It doesn't have to be romance based, it can be family and friendship based, but I just want more realistic views of them as young adults/adults.

So anything with them out of Hogwarts will be good.

Any rating is fine, am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash.

Any Era is fine, any character can be the main character not just Harry.

I tend not to like Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, but if it's believable enough I will allow it. And any other pairing is fine with me.

Again I'd like to see the characters as young adults/adults here, not in their Hogwarts years.

I've already read Grow Young with Me, and many of Northumbrian's fics (I really enjoy Northumbrian's work).

Can be canon pairings or not.

No crossovers. Can be canon or AU or anything in between.


** "Tomorrowland" by winterfool. A beautiful ongoing series in which Harry is dealing with PTSD, learning to live on his own, and starting his new career as an Auror, and Luna slowly but surely becomes his rock of comfort and kindness.

  In the aftermath of the war, Harry still has plenty of demons left to fight.Post-DH, not compliant with the epilogue.

  One good turn always deserves another. Apparently. Epilogue compliant/AU. HPDM slash but some canon het along the way. Please trust me - I promise the epilogue will not bite you.
