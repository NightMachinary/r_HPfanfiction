*** One chapter to go, and it's the epilogue. Also, the longest chapter in the fic apparently. Hopefully they'll find time to write/edit it soon(ish).

The new chapter doesn't end on a cliffhanger if that's what you're worried about?

**** Honestly if the wait ends up being the same, I'll have forgotten enough by the time the epilogue comes out to justify yet another reread. Mostly I don't want the last chapter to come out and me be in a position where I don't remember enough to enjoy the epilogue, but I remember to much to justify rereading.

***** Makes sense, they gave a bit of a recap at the start of the chapter of what was happening. Rereading is a totally different experience.

Wish you luck with your patience.

#+begin_quote
  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.
