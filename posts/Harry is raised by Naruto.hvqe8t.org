Dumbledore knew something was deadly wrong when Harry Potter's name left the goblet and a boy appeared a sharp knife in hand and a glowing blue ball in the other looking ready for a fight.

​

14 year old chunin Harry Uzumaki was not happy being pulled to an old castle that the the shinobi could only guess was home to some kind of cult with all the robes and the old guy in the throne like chair. He was just enjoying his eighth bowl of ramen with his dad when he ended up here with barely enough time to draw a kunai and spin up a rasengan.

​

"Harry Potter, my boy." Harry looked up at the old man and narrowed his eyes.

"The names Harry Uzumaki old man. Now where the hell am I?"

"You are in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, my boy." Dumbledore replied eyes twinkling.

​

Witchcraft and Wizardry? The shinobi decided this was definitely a cult.

​

"Well I'm definitely not in Konoha anymore,"

​

Dumbledore was worried the boy was still glaring at him and he didn't look like the abused boy that would see him as a saviour that Dumbledore needed. Little did the headmaster know things would only get worse, he had kidnapped the son of the seventh Hokage and that was a declaration of war.

​

Any story with Harry raised by Naruto would be great. This scene just popped into my head so I decided to throw it in and maybe it'll give someone an idea.

​

Thanks for your help.


** Not all of these are Harry brought up specifically by Naruto.

  Naruto finds he is flung back in time and must repeat the entire Chunin exam over and over and over, until he gets it right and possibly saves Konoha in the bargain.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
