I've read several fanfics where characters start panicking once they see Andromeda because she looks so similar to Bellatrix. I was wondering if that similarity in looks was canon. I don't remember reading it anywhere.


** Yes, Harry nearly goes for her in Order of the Phoenix when he firsts meets her because he thought she was Bellatrix.

** She's apparently identical under dim light, but once she steps out into the open, anyone with a decent memory of Bellatrix can tell the difference.

Her overall resemblance is, like, (not a canonically stated number) 60-70% identical to Bellatrix.

** Here's what canon say about their resemblance (Harry Potter 7, Chapter 5) :

#+begin_quote
  /As she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks's resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a light soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder. Nevertheless, she looked a little haughty after Harry's exclamation./
#+end_quote

Harry first reflex when he saw her was to try to go for his wand, so it's understandable that a lot of author use this scene in their fic. But Bellatrix and Andromeda only look alike like Sirius and Regulus look alike. You can't deny the family link, and /may/ be able to fool a stranger (especially in a dimly lighted room), but anyone truly knowing one of them would instantly see the differences.

** Yes, there's a pretty big resemblance between the two of them described in book 7.
