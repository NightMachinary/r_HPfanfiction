Can be a minor or major thing in the story. Anyone can be the MC/Any site/Any Length/Old or New

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash

NO Weasley Bashing. No stories where the Weasley's are using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche.


** Potter's Protector by mjimeyg has Werewolves creating their own village in the Forbidden Forest and the students are told that the werewolves and/or centaurs would guide them to safety if they are lost.

Linkffn(7665632)

Protection: The Sword and The Shield by Bishop2410 has lycans eg werewolves working on acromantula silk farms. Be aware the overall story is more sex then plot.

[[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewuser.php?uid=2292]]

In the story H J Potter by S. M. Ware werewolves are trained and form a security company. Be aware it starts a little slowly.

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.

** What do you mean by "more positive way"? As in not villains or actively evil?

If that's the case, I greatly recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24594295][In Bocca Al Lupo]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/morpholomeg/pseuds/morpholomeg][morpholomeg]] - linkao3(24594295). It explores the conditions of werewolves in the Wizarding World. Great characterizations and world-building.

  When Remus came back to himself, he was in the middle of the Forbidden Forest, naked, shivering with pain and with cold, and he could taste blood.“I don't have the full story,” said Madam Pomfrey. “You'll have to speak to Minerva or Albus for that. But Black has escaped, and - Remus, I am so sorry. You bit Hermione Granger.”or: a story of innocence, experience, and prejudice, spanning the summer holidays after Prisoner of Azkaban.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410]]) has some werewolves, though they're not the focus of the story. They like exist and are great characters. Not sure if that's what your looking for.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  The war was over.Or at least that's what the papers said.They'd been saying it, for months, as if people needed reminding.Maybe they did. ***In which Harry and Draco both run away from their pasts and conveniently choose to hide in the same tiny American town. It's super.

** What do you mean positive? Like guard dogs?

It's a disease that causes people to lose their facilities so it's hard for them to be used as anything. The most you'll get close to canon is probably a neutral as wolf and maybe a tracker or normal person when not the full moon. Unless you just mean not bad. In which case I have some options.
