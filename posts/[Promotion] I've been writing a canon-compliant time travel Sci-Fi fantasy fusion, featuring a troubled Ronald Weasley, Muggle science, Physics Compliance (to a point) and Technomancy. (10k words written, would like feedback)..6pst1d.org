** This is very well-written, and the future scene was an intriguing start- I like fics that give Ron agency, really interested to see where this is going. Also really enjoying Ron's mini-writeups.

So far, my only real issue with it is how closely it hems to the stations of canon while being relatively perfunctory about it- you're basically blazing through Year 1, which is fine, but the way it's treated makes it feel unimportant. Furthermore, almost all the scenes are the same standard routine. I don't really have a clear understanding of Ron's motivations, why he's acting the way he's acting, whether he's actually thinking ahead about being hidden or not, what motivated him to change things. Why is he emphasizing the third year corridor challenge so heavily, and what does he actually think of Harry? Obviously that's coming in due time, but it doesn't seem like he has much that he's doing that different in the long term.

** I like the idea of HP sci-fi a lot. Your writing is generally really good. But why did it have to be first-person?

I really tried, but I couldn't get myself over 2 and a half chapters. I really dislike 1st Person POV.

Oh, and it's not "Trevor's Toad" in the scene where Ron accios the toad to him.

** This story is bloody good. Initially I was a little worried about you repeating Canon stations, but the latest chapter removed a large part of that concern.

** Interesting start -- and you've certainly got my attention by having Ron as the main character here. The first chapter made for a good hook.

There was a minor tense problem I'd noticed in the first part though -- "I grit my teeth" should be "I gritted my teeth" to match the rest. And there's a little /less/ description than I like, which makes things feel a bit thin (and let me speed-read). But the prose is clear and has a very Ron-like feel to it, which is aided by the choice of first-person POV.

*** I'm relatively certain that 'I grit my teeth' is grammatically correct, but I'll look into that. As for descriptors, I know that they are lacking in that department. I had just assumed that everyone reading said fanfic would be bored to tears if I repeated canonical descriptions. My latest chapters shall hopefully rectify that problem.

As for the canon divergence... That will not be a problem. Things are going to get off the rails fast.

** u/Satanniel:
#+begin_quote
  canon-compliant
#+end_quote

Well, the second chapter already contradicts [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/time-turner][canon information]].

And the further the fic goes, the less more discrepancies are there. I don't even know, why you even wanted to claim canon compliancy in a fic with a premise like that.

Anyway, a quick glance to check the claim of being canon compliant was enough for me of this fic. Way too heavy on muggle wank.

*** It's hard to juggle a complex storyline with the intricacies of canon-compliance. Of course there will be discrepancies or differing interpretations of canon, but I do /try/ to keep it within the book canon.

Also... It's called 'Technomancer.' Of course it's 'heavy on muggle wank.' That's the point...

EDIT: I double checked your link. I still comply with canon. Ron does /not/ use a time turner to travel back in time. He relies on Muggle physics to do so... Physics which already exist within the real world, but cannot be applied due to their energy-reliant nature. Furthermore, the issues of temporal travel are explained in depth further into the fanfic in the "Ron's Notes" section.

Further Furthermore: the hour-long time reversal charms on time turners are not set in place by necessity, but by design. Souped up time turners certainly exist (as is evidenced by the horrible fate of Eloise and the events of the Cursed Child). As such, I needed to explain why they are ultimately useless for Ron's uses. Please actually /read/ the fanfic before making sweeping generalizations.

Where in the books you found the idea that there is "magical energy" or that runes are anything other than ancient language?

#+end_quote

The fact that bad ideas come from the premise doesn't make them less bad.

#+end_quote

I meant that part.

#+begin_quote
  It turns out (heh) that time turners become exponentially more dangerous with use and time. At first, the danger did not trouble me, but repeated testing resulted in the occurrence of a certain temporal phenomenon; I call it 'temporal elasticity.' Essentially, there is a set limit to what time turners do and what they can do. Attempting to change the past significantly leads to test failure or manifest destiny (otherwise known as the Nikov Self Consistency Principle). Basically, it means that everything I do in the past already happened, and therefore leads to no significant change.
#+end_quote

Speaks of limits of current magical time-travel, limits that don't exist because there were "successful" tries to send someone far into the past that resulted in changing the future. Quote marks are here because of what happened to the time traveler.

Also, I'm of opinion that fanfics should be held to the same standards as all other written fiction.
