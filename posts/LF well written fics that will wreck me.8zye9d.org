I would love to read a grammatically sound story that will make me ugly cry, but even just major tearing up would suffice. Would prefer little to no slash, pairings are completely open, and length is not an issue.

Break my heart, Potterheads. (Pls :D)

  a bit anti-Weasley
#+end_quote

*a bit*?!?! Holy shit are these people terrible. I was frankly astounded that Harry remained as calm as he was when Ginny started to treat her own daughter as people used to treat you when you had AIDS (when it was still that dangerous and unknown monster) or lepers. Or Molly suggesting to basically cut all ties with Lily. Harry felt a bit OOC there to be honest, the guy is famous for his temper and screaming and yelling certainly would have been appropriate here.

Sorry to go on this whole big rant, but he kinda pisses me off:

#+begin_quote
  Harry can only watch her struggle, listen through her door as she cries in the evenings. He can't even help her with her homework, because the things she's studying now, the things considered important in Muggle society like advanced maths and chemistries and biologies, are things he never had to study. There is a values gap there; if she were able to go to Hogwarts she'd be learning flying and charms and potions, which require only so much math or chemistry as is needed to get the job done. Harry cannot help her with algebra.
#+end_quote

Yeah right Harry, that's way too hard for you. Parents of deaf children learn ASL, which probably requires a bit more effort than understanding basic maths and biology for 11 year olds. The Harry in this fic is pretty pathetic to be honest. Can't stand up for himself and his family and afraid of a challenge.

#+begin_quote
  Ron doesn't visit; it would seem Harry's oldest friend has chosen his sister over his best friend.
#+end_quote

What do you mean "it would seem"? Harry hasn't confronted Ron about it? He should have! What a complete wimp. And Hermione supposedly goes along with this too? How can you live with a person who believes that Ginny is in the right here? Poor Lily, a bigoted and hateful mother, grandmother and uncle and on the other side an apathetic father who just coasts through life.

I don't even understand what the big deal is about any of this. Their children aren't allowed to do any magic until they are 17 when they are out of school. They all survive perfectly fine while basically being squibs during the summer holidays and do chores by hand. Why is it such a big deal when someone "can't" instead of "shall not"? It's not like Harry, Hermione and Ron had any big issues interacting with Magical Society when they were underage. Their society is disgusting.

** Hmm Grow Young With Me from Taliesin19 isn't a sad story (quite the contrary) however chapter 18 is, in my opinion, heartbreaking and the fic is amazing so I'll let this here. linkffn(11111990)

** Cauterize and Stages of Hope are put up and unfortunately the one fic that has caused crying every time I've read it (admittedly at least somewhat happy tears) isn't a Harry Potter. But for emotional wrecking [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12192798/1/Don-t-You-Worry][Don't You Worry]] is as good as anything else I've read

** My main "I wanna cry a lot fic" has already been posted. That's Cauterize.

There's also [[https://snapecase.livejournal.com/50627.html][With Nothing On My Tongue]] which is my favorite Snape fic

There's also linkffn(A Gift Freely Given by Lady Altair) . Really short(500 words), and by the same author as Cauterize. That said, it's fantastic. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4613516/1/A-Gift-Freely-Given][I'll direct link it since it seems like ffnbot is broke rn.]] Honestly just [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/24216/Lady-Altair][anything by Lady Altair]] is probably fantastic.

** I seriously don't recommend it and it's abandoned at an especially bad spot, but linkffn(The Hundred Acre Wood by DracaDelirus) stands a good chance of wrecking you. It is pretty similar to the book A Child Called It.

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12417147/1/The-Second-Son-the-Second-Loved][The Second Son, the Second Loved]] by GoldenFinches. I cried ugly tears reading this. Oh gosh, it shattered my heart.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4045677/1/Foreshadowing-Demise][Foreshadowing Demise]] by Shadowmistress13 is by far one of the most stressful read I had ever came across. Every scene adds another piece to the puzzle and every scene builds up the story. I especially love every character is not exactly black or white, just a whole rainbow full of colors. The story could make you feel amuse to downright tears and every other emotions in between. I just highly recommend this fic. The only downside to this fic is the fact updates are not frequent, however, in the way the story is written, I say it is worth the wait. Plus the author is very persistent when saying to they are not abandoning the story. It updated recently, and I'm content to say that this is one of my top favorite Regulus and Sirius Black fic.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2721217/1/Brothers-just-the-same][Brothers just the same]] by Snufflesforever really hit me in the heart. This fic mainly focus on the Black brothers' story and their relationship.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12224847/chapters/27770244][Toujours Pur (of Heart)]] by Nillegible I started to tear up when Regulus cried. This story was really a emotional rollercoaster that I had definitely enjoyed. It's short and bittersweet, but had a hopeful ending to it for the brothers.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12467737/1/Sang-Noir][Sang Noir]] by Aithne Morrigan actually made me cry. The ending was bittersweet.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5556945/1/Hero][Hero]] by Lady Charity also made me cry. One-shot

For something that is also Marauder-era will make you sob more, I loved Crossroads. linkffn(898884)
