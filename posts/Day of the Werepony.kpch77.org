Harry awakens in a dark and creepy forest, utterly confused.

After stumbling around like an idiot, trying to get his bearings, dawn breaks and the sun's warmth hits him.

/Poof./

He suddenly finds himself as a cute winged unicorn of some type.

...Yeah, his scream sort-of freaked the nearby ponies of Ponyville out of their minds.

Of course sensing something amiss, Celestia and her recently adopted 'niece' Cadence find themselves wandering the familiar and unfamiliar trails of the Everfree, searching for clues.

Eventually, Celestia swaps the sun for the moon.

/Poof./

Harry is now Harry the Human again, and the trail stops cold for the other alicorns to follow. However, they can't shake the feeling that /something/ is watching them from the shadows...

...Yeah, it's Harry trying to not hyperventilate behind a tree. He was only 12, for crying out loud!


** Oh god, this...this should definitely a fic, a funny friendship fic mixed with minor horror on the pony part.

*** There was another one on FFn where Harry accidentally arrives in Equestria by literally dropping from the sky and flattening an emerging King Sombra like a pancake.

This is before Celestia sends Twilight and her friends up, and before Cadence and Shining can take up her birthright (since she's a descendant of Princess Amore of the Empire).

Canon is promptly derailed as the newly liberated crystal ponies make this freaked out alicorn their new king.

Sadly enough, the execution was a bit meh on an otherwise brilliant prompt.

***** There the original and the "continuation" some other guy tried but gave up after like barely a single chapter, IIRC? Great idea, very poor execution, IMHO.
