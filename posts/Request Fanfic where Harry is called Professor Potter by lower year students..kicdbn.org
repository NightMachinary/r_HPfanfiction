:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a story on fanfiction.net where Harry is not made prefect but still helps all Gryffs whereas Ron and Lavender do nothing. Harry is called Professor Potter by all his housemates for his efforts. If anyone knows this fic, please give me the name of the fic in comments Thank you!!
