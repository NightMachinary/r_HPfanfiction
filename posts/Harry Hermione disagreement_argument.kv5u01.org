Any good fics in which these two get into an argument without over the top consequences for Hermione? A lot of the times when I read some like this it ends up with Hermione unable to get a job in the W world because of the argument which is ridiculous. Could be also Harry x Hermiome.

P.S also y'all know any good Harry gets ara ara ed by Narcissa fics? UWU

  After McGonagall's dismissal of the first divination lesson Harry decides to change elective. In the process Harry starts to understand that he can do things without Ron or Hermione and that their yearmates are worth getting to know. A different take on PoA and on. Rating's for safety. Not a Ron/Hermione bashing story.

** Hermione finds out that Harry's a horcrux and wants to find a way to save his life while Harry has accepted his fate and just wants to die. So Hermione (with the help from Ron) uses some unorthodox methods to change his mind.

  Harry is a Horcrux, isn't he? Don't be silly. What a strange thought to have. Anyway. Anyway. During 6th year, Hermione has a realization that Harry is a Horcrux while doing some homework in the library. Things spiral out from there.

  The first time she performs the charm and it comes out negative she rationalizes it, because plenty of women took a few months to become pregnant. The second, third, and fourth time she gets a negative result she tells herself that maybe she needs fertility treatments.

  Just what the world needs, another Harry and Hermione fall in love in the tent fic. But! Hopefully this is done with heart and definitely no bashing.   They were a few spots away from the last location they were together with Ron, but it didn't stop Hermione from glancing up at the sound of breaking twigs, or the rustle of leaves, or the quieter whispers of wind. By some animal instinct, every time she glanced up he did too. He couldn't help but think of frightened deer, their ears pert and rotating, eyes focused, alert, listening for wolves. The main difference for them was that they wanted the wolf to come. His glanced away from the empty forest to Hermione's dark eyes, still searching. "He won't find us." He used the sharp tone again, he still didn't mean it that way. Her eyes moved to his, injured, her mouth bowed in pain. He felt a stab of remorse. To his surprise she moved closer to him instead of turning away. Their spheres of sadness had been separate the last few days, their moroseness quiet, however loud it felt inside his head.

  We all know that Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen to make Ron jealous. But what if she didn't? What if she came to her senses in time and invited Harry instead? As friends of course.

** Almost 300,000 words. It's the most slowest slow burn you will ever read. The plot twists lead to a lot of untold secrets and when everything explodes they have a pretty pretty pretty pretty big fight. Beware tho, this Harry is very out of character. But the fight and everything leading up to it made me cry.

**** It's Independent Harry which usually means that he do his own thing alone without anything or anyone linking him to Hogwarts or the Wizarding World or whatever. Since in canon Ron and Hermione mean so much to Harry to the point where he would never do something without them, it means that something has to separate them and most Indy!Harry have Harry start hating his friends for whatever reasons just so that he can go independant on everything else.
