Where a person write a fanfiction and does very little to put their own spin in the story. Where it wouldn't that mean to much of a difference if they get taken out of the story, like this story linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7765501]]) or like the author stargatesg1fan1 where Harry's in the story but does everything to stay closest to the cannon to everyone else's view in the story, and always explains magic as "exotic energy".

***** I know what it means, like slash fics but it's the same thing as gay fics, unoriginal is one term but is there a specific term for it.
