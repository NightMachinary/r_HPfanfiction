** Good advice:

Make up your mind, is it over powered or overpowered.

Look up the relationship between subject and verb as well as fragment and run-on sentences.

Forefront means the most important, not the beginning.

Makeup is cosmetics. Make up is what your mind does.

The difference between they're and there is a pretty big one, as is do and due.

Best Advice: Write what you would want to read. Figure out what you want to do and do it. If you're pandering for public opinion the story will be worse for it.

Also planning. Planning is king. You should know what happens, how it happens, and when it happens, long before you even put pen to paper to write the prose, as it were.

**** This is actually essentially what I do. Each chapter I write has a one page, hand written summary of what happens in it. It both helps me keep on track while writing, and makes for easy referencing back to past chapters when I'm wondering when certain things happened in relationship to each other.

It's probably the most helpful thing I've done for myself. And the sad part is at some point in the future someone is going to open the folders and notebooks and wonder what all these scribbles about Harry Potter are about. Hopefully my handwriting and cursive is just so bad that they just don't bother reading it.
