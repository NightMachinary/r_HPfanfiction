:END:
I read it YEARS (at least 5) ago and cannot seem to find it anymore... Lost all my bookmarks too. Grrr....

Here's as much as I can remember:

Draco is somehow the devil's son...

Happens mostly at Hogwarts, and Draco has his own private wing of sorts. Ginny becomes more than just a friend and hides in his wing a lot and even Molly visited the wing...

He loves putting peanut butter on popcorn...??

His elf was murdered, head was chopped off to use in black magic...

In the final bate, Ginny “died” (used Draught of the Living Dead in secret to activate Draco's demonic powers) and Draco transformed into his demonic self and had fireballs rain down, and giant spiders (?) hunting death eaters...

After the war, he's in the infirmary and asks if the fireballs have stopped, Molly (?) said yes, and he goes back to sleep... He wakes up and the fireballs are still ongoing. Ginny asks him what he would've done, he said ‘stop' and it stops...

Last scene is at the Burrow. The wives ask Ginny if he's show any other signs of demonic magic. Ginny said only once, when his fingers were glowing at work and he went straight home coz he freaked out... then someone says something to Draco and he shows off his cooking skills using demon magic (floating plates? And self cutting knives?) and says “The Malfoy crest is on the plate tonight” or something.

Thank you!!
