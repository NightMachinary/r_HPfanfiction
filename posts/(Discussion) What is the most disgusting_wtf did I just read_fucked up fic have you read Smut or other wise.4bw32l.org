For me it would be

Harry Potter and the spell book of desires

And the one where Draco fucks Hermione in her nostrils by extending them using magic.

****** Yeah, I find that it's best to stay away from those fics. I think there was one fic where Harry is tortured with needles by Death Eaters and Snape adopts him and Draco, but it was actually pretty good despite that not being a very unique story line. (I meant recover from anything, including rape, though like you said it's usually not done very well and there's no actual story.)

** Pretty much anytime a story delves into the seedier sides of magic.

Forcing people to use love potions, polyjucing yourself to have sex with someone who otherwise would never look twice at you, slave bonds etc.

That kind of stuff just doesn't really sit well with me honestly. I almost have to wonder how good the laws are in magical Britain, because I can just imagine how many times someone has gone to the aurors saying "he impregnated me while polyjuiced as my boyfriend" or "bound me as a slave using dark magic".

** There's a lot. One in particular comes to mind, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11381604/1/His-Hidden-Heart]], in which Harry and Luna are pedophiles (sorry, pedo/sexual/, as the author likes to remind us). They go through the motions of taking de-aging potions and having sex with one another. Harry also tutors a first year girl and looks for ways to have sex with her as well.

Sad part is, it's not badly written. I'm not usually bothered by twisted / messed up content in fiction and this is no exception, but I do wish the author used their writing ability (certainly better than average) to create something a little more... engaging.

Edit: Oh, of course, forgot to mention--just like in slash, when you impose a certain sexual attraction on the main character, /everyone/ shares that attraction.

**** It probably was. What sucks is that I'm pretty sure that if it had been handled differently, it could have made for an interesting story. You know, how a messed up sexual attraction can affect the life of an otherwise normal, decent person. It would have no business being HP fanfiction, but it would have made for an interesting read.

Sadly, the author just took the route of "well, magic exists, so let's fuck kids".

But in a dojin I read the other week a six year old starts to get abused by her grandfather, things progress he starts violently raping her, BDSM gets introduced, parents go out of town, he ties her up starts to rape her, has heart attack and dies inside her, she's tied up with dead granpa on top of her for next 5 days or so untill parents come back, and this was all in a flashback she has while being gangraped/tortured with 2 other children. first time where afterwards I was like "damn what am I into?" forget which but it was from the grievously wounded girls series.

*** I think the coffee one is called, /A Cold Cuppa/ and the second one is called, /Squick/.

I'm not going to look for them or link to them for the same reason you mentioned. It's bad enough to admit that I've read them both.

** I can't remember the name, but there was this fic where Harry and Hermione get in a fight after Ron leaves during the Horcrux hunt. Well, the fight turns violent instantly, and it ends with Harry killing Hermione by strangling her with a rope. Now, I was pretty disturbed at this point simply because of the way it was written (no remorse, full of hatred, etc). Unfortunately, it gets more fucked up. Harry decides "wow, Hermione has a nice ass." After he killed her. Harry proceeds to have Necrophiliac sex with Hermione's corpse. Right when he finishes, Ron walks back in, mumbling about changing his mind. Does Ron freak out? Does Ron try to kill Harry for the sight in front of him? No, Ron says he doesn't want Harry's sloppy seconds, and that he'll take Hermione in the ass instead. This was, by far, the most fucked up thing I've read.

** I don't remember what it was, but back in the day (like 7 years ago?) it was widely circulated as one of the most disturbing hp fanfictions out there. Something about Ginny getting a birthday present for Harry (or the other way around), someone in a wheelchair, and a piece of hair. That's all I remember.

Anyone know what I'm talking about?

** Oh, man. I've read so many bad fics, but one of the worst would have to be where 15 year old Harry has sex with everyone in Gryffindor tower. I mean everyone. Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Ginny, Dean, Seamus, Neville, Lavender, Percy, Oliver, Lee, Katie, somehow Luna and Draco get thrown in. Everyone watched while Harry fucked or got fucked by everyone else. It was so bad
