I haven't finished it, but I think it fits your request. It's a doctor who crossover, but Hogwarts is its main scene.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

*** A Doctor Who crossover? I'm not really a fan of crossovers but in need to get out of my comfort zone :)

Thanks!

*** Oh yeah, the reminder that Weeping Angels are /f/*/ing TERRIFYING/! Of course, there is some humor in the fact that the Doctor helped build Hogwarts just to get around the barrier that the Angel set up to keep him out. (The Giant Squid cheats at poker.)

***** No, that was about halfway through. The beginning of the episode played out a bit like /Blink/.
