So its been a long time since I read HP fanfiction seriously, and I've read a few good ones recently. I'm primarily a Harry/Ginny shipper, but sometime I delve into something else like the above. I've probably read all the above ones on Fanfiction.net so you all will have to impress me with other ones you have hidden away.


** There are a couple smutty one shots of Harry/Katie by MayorHaggar on Ao3 that are all fantastic. However I too have been unable to find any full length stories of that pairing. But those one shots are really well written and I wish he would write full length stories.

** Harry/Angelina smutty one shot. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4994350?view_adult=true]]

** Linkffn(More Than Just Teammates) is bad but meets all of your requirements. Not sure if you'll have seen it because it's not a straight 1 on 1 pairing.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.

  Harry never goes to the Durseleys. He is rescued by McGonagall who takes him to a friend of his father's. There he is raised as their son with their daughter. Harry will have an understanding of magic and won't be fooled. He will grow up being smart and calm and will not be manipulated. Harry/Angelina/Alicia/Katie. Possible harem, maybe not with poking at certain characters.
