EDIT: Basically looking for a fic where harry hides the fact that he is a lord of a certain family because the family has dark connotations, like in Feral.


** I thought Eveningshade was specific from Passageways. Is there any other fic where he's from that ?

#+begin_quote
  Neglected in favour of his younger brother, Harry Potter always was dissatisfied. His Parents and their friends fawned over Thomas, no matter what the older brother did. Harry upped and left; why would he have stayed? 6 years later, Harry Potter found a new home. The boy is in the middle of it all, though. What will his role be? Where will his allegiance lie?
