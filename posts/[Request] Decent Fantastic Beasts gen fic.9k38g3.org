Long version:

Looking for /Fantastic Beasts/ gen fic *without* any romance or pairings -- no f/m, f/f, f/m, or any combinations thereof.

Length, completeness, and main characters don't matter as long as it's readable. One-shots are cool. OCs and self-inserts are welcome. Time travel is fine. Crossovers are fine provided the fic in question doesn't involve five billion other fandoms at the same time.

(And I know I said no pairings, but I might make an exception or two for really well-done Jacob/Queenie because I'm a giant hypocrite.)


** Sorry for not offering something useful but i kinda think its interesting that theres no comments yet and i wonder why? do the writers on the sub not consider this movies proper Harry Potter canon? considering the movie was pretty well received it makes me wonder if fanfiction writers feel like having a deeper connection to harry and his friends compared to the relatively new newt ?

*** Discussion is cool on its own, and it /is/ pretty interesting that there's not a lot of comments -- there usually aren't when the /Fantastic Beasts/ movies are involved.

It seems like a problem with two big parts:

One, /FB/ just doesn't have enough material yet. One movie doesn't provide a lot of world building compared to seven books.

Two, the /Harry Potter/ fandom overall doesn't seem very passionate about /FB/. Some people liked it, some people didn't, but it's very rare to see anyone who *really* loves it or *really* hates it -- at least it seems that way to me. (I could be in a bubble, though.) The continual controversies -- from Depp's casting to the more recent issues surrounding with Nagini -- probably don't help.

(Also, requesting gen fic usually leads to a smaller amount of recs, so that's a hurdle of my own making.)

**** I think the thing about FB is that those who write fan fiction for it are generally Newt/Tina shippers. I happened to really, really like the first movie (minus Depp's casting, but honestly I'm not enraged like some are... but that's another discussion entirely). The only thing I didn't like was Tina. I thought her character was annoying in a way Hermione's character could've been irritating if we didn't have the books. Honestly, I had no qualms that romance was very light in the series, I wish Rowling had kept to that for these movies, because I give zero patooties about anything other than the thrilling story about Grindewald. We've had no building of a relationship over SIX/SEVEN YEARS (seriously the UST between Ron and Hermione makes you want to scream by DH). Even Harry's crush on Cho was a three book arc - he notices her in PoA during Quidditch, has a crush on her in GoF, and sorta dates her in OotP. Heck, in spite of what people say about Ginny - Harry's building up of their relationship starts in GoF with side comments here and there! So I find it inconsistent with Rowling's style to push these two characters together, especially when we know Newt is hung up on Leta Lestrange. Anyway. Most fan fiction of the movies tends to be shipped based and a lot of people on this sub have no interest in the romance in FB. When it comes to Grindewald and his rise, there's already a lot of fics about him already but not under a FB heading. A lot of them were written pre-FB or without FB in mind at all.

So I'm on a high about the Nagini spoiler, because damn, if that isn't world building I don't know what is. I happen to *love* the idea that Nagini was/is a real woman. I think it's ridiculous that she's enslaved to Voldemort, we know nothing about the women Nagini but we know plenty about the snake Nagini. She did Voldemort's bidding without an imperius curse. She was incredibly loyal to him, so I'm just so excited to see the full backstory. In my mind, her blood curse eventually makes her a permanent snake, and she had already met Tom Riddle by then and joined his cause. Especially considering he's a Parselmouth and would still be able to communicate with her unlike the rest of the world, it'd be a good idea for her to be his companion. Also I've yet to really see anyone on *this* sub personally offended by the new Nagini theory. I think a lot of people are intrigued and while they would've have guessed it... everyone knew something was up with that snake. As most say, her attack of Harry and Hermione in Bagshot's house was always bizarrely controlled.

I think we've just reached the point where everyone is irritated with Rowling no matter what she reveals about the world. Even while she was still writing the books she always made it quite clear that she had a fully developed world in her head. Maybe some things have changed over the years, and okay she could've included a bit more "romantic" diversity or whatever. But she made Dumbledore's love of Grindewald really *interesting* and complicated. Also it took place in the 90's... and they were young kids for most of it. But others are irritated that she didn't represent every ant under the sun. But she did a pretty damn good job. Harry's first crush was Asian. His first date (Pavarti) was Indian. One of Harry's best mates was black (and he played quidditch with a black girl... who marries a Weasley too!). Sorry, I'm not going to go on a (longer) rant about the diversity issue in HP. My point was that people have a real issue with *most things* Jo revealed post-DH. So people are just pissy in general, FB or not.

Edit: sorry for the massive rant! :D

*** I mean, we got to know Harry and his world through 7 books and 8 movies. We know Newt from 1 movie only. And we've had years to digest Harry and think of new what-if scenarios to write and read about. With Fantastic Beasts, sure there is plenty of opportunity to write about Newt's adventures and creatures but that is SO open ended it's kind of hard to know where to start, if that makes sense?

When I first saw FB, the first thing I sought out was Jacob/Queenie fanfiction to read one where he gets his memories back and they get together, and I'm sure there are PLENTY of fics about that now and about the Newt/whatshername relationship. But OP asked for no romance so I think that right off the bat eliminates a good chunk of FB fanfiction. But maybe as the movies progress, the fandom will grow and develop as well! I could definitely see more Nagini stories coming out of the second movie.
