So I'm looking for fics where Harry discovers he's really good at a certain type of magic, eg. Necromancy, runes, legillimancy etc.

I don't care about any pairings as long as it's not multi

Thanks a lot :)


** Damn, I read this as socialist Harry...

Time for a new thread.

** [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fTczCpIaLAU][Obligatory P4 jokes aside]], linkffn(Black Luminary) has a Harry who's a charms prodigy, but /only/ a charms prodigy. He successfully creates a portkey on his first attempt, but he can't cast curses to save his life, for instance.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

** linkffn(A Black Comedy) -- Harry specializes in summoning/banishing charms to the point that he basically has telekinesis. (They manifest as magic arms.) He's also /really/ good at the fidelius charm.

Obligatory warning that the fic has a very particular style of fratbro humor and some of the specific gags have aged extremely poorly. (The Potter house elf sings antebellum-era slave songs while working, for instance.) But if you don't mind that, it's got a surprisingly good plot underneath the crack.

#+begin_quote
  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
