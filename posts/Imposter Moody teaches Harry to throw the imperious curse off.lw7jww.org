In GOF, Barty Crouch Jr. as Alastor Moody teaches everyone about the unforgivables. Makes sense. He, then teaches them how to throw the Imperius curse off, which Hermione says is not allowed to be used (which reasonably means, the imposter added it in his curriculum)

Also, when Harry shows potential in throwing it off, he could have simply ignored it and carried on but he trained him till Harry could throw it off perfectly. Why would he do that?


** Maybe it's just something he can't resist doing because of all the years he spent under his father's curse, and maybe wishes someone taught him how to throw it off.

*** This makes the most sense. It is not a logical action but a sort of obsession-similar to his obsession with the dark lord to use it because he has been under it

** Because it's likely what the real Alastor Moody would've done.

** What would do a Death Eater if he discover someone with talent to Dark Arts? Train him.

What would do an Auror if he discover someone with talent to resist Dark Arts? Train him.

Resist Dark Arts is to know Dark Arts.

** Partially because of the time he spent under it, I assume, and partially to keep from blowing his cover.

** Partly it's the sort of over the top thing people would expect of moody, remember he was basically forced into retirement, many people thought he was starting to lose it (and given how easily he was captured and imprisoned despite his paranoia they might be right).

Partly because after years under its influence he probably genuinely dislikes the spell.

** Is it a movie thing? I don't remember this being in the book. He just complimented Harry on resisting the curse.

*** No, it's in the book. He makes Harry do it over and over again until he can throw it off completely.
