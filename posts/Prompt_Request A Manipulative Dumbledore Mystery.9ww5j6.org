You know how in all those Dumbledore-bashing fics where he's stealing money from Harry, manipulating his entire life, buying his friends off with books and money? Would that actually be a decent fic if it was turned into a crime/mystery story? Harry discovers discrepancies in his accounts, for example, and just starts to hunt down the trail, and the story unfolds from there slowly. All the while, he's confiding in his friends or Dumbledore, and they just keep trying their best to throw him off. Obviously, Dumbledore won't be as ham-handed or as incompetent as he's portrayed in bashing fics, but will be a more insidious character. And eventually, the climax is where Harry realises he's been tricked by everyone he trusts.

Basically, a detective story where instead of Dumbledore-bashing being a side helping to the main story, it's the focus of the story.

So yeah, prompt or request if anyone's seen something similar before?


** That sounds much better than we normally get. Which really goes to show that the problem isn't cliches in and of themselves - although overuse of cliches is repetitive, but rather the poor execution of them by many fanfic authors.
