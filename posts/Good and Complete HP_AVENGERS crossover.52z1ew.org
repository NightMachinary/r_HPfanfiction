Just finished reading this fic-- Of Wizards and Heroes: linkao3(4148136). It's an Avengers/ HP crossover that I've never seen recc'ed on here before. It's really pretty inventive and not a rehashing of either canon. In my opinion the writing is engaging and magical, the characters and dialogue are interesting and familiar, and best of all it's lengthy and complete! Full disclosure, it is slash. HAVE FUN GUYS :D and let me know what you think too because I'm curious.

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

**** I'm glad you enjoyed it!! I was so surprised when I read it that I had found something of quality /on my own/ that wasn't (1) a classic/by a well-known author or (2) rec'ed to me. It was such magic that I had to share :D

  Loki's in for it now. Odin has had enough and has banished him to Earth to relearn some lessons. Too bad he hadn't paid attention to where Loki ended up. Now Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, has to deal with memories that aren't his own while he gets his revenge on those who sought to use him as a weapon. Can Harry regain what he lost, or will his past self take control first?

*** Oh yes. I'm sorry! I guess I forgot because I don't normally read slash.. And to be very honest, out of the story's 90,000 words and 22 chappies, there are fewer than 10 scenes that have slash content. At its heart, I really experienced the story as more of an action/adventure epic than a romance.

But for those who prefer to avoid slash (my apologies!), there is a M/M rating at the top of each chapter.

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.
