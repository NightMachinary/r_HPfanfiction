I'm okay with rated T fics, I just feel like there are exceedingly few stories in that category that are comfortable with addressing things like:

- characters that do not have the MC's best interests at heart (What do you mean, Marietta was only dating me to learn more about my group?)
- killing off a character that the readers have bonded with (Sirius falling through the veil? Not allowed! Deus Ex Accio!)
- have the MC pushed into situations where they make decisions the readers don't like (survey says: have a spy trip and break their neck instead of being able to give vital information away after escaping because the MC made a mistake)
- leaving an issue unresolved (it doesn't add depth to a character if they're cured from a painful and incurable poisoning attempt because their blood is a universal antivenom - you might as well not even write it in because this magic blood will never play a role in the rest of the story)

Those are just examples, not requirements - I just want /something/ that doesn't feel like wish fulfillment porn (or even worse, a "well written" story that is just word porn with a tolerable plot). The opposite, i.e. the author just kills the main character and /everybody/ who we spent 20 chapters watching grow from JK Rowling's stereotypes, just to prove that they can be edgy and go against the grain, is also not what I'm going for.

If it's slash, just label it, and I don't have a preference as to if Harry is the MC or not.


** You used the wrong flair, it should be 'Request'.

Otherwise though, i completely agree. Though for me i also like to have the main character be quite powerhungry. Not killing everyone im a d a r k l o r d dark, but just well, likes power and money?

** Linkffn(To Fight the Coming Darkness), while definitely not being perfect, does the gritty realism of war pretty well in my opinion. People die, the fight scenes are great, the romance is kinda weird but not the biggest problem. It was written pre-DH with no Horcruxes, but it has its own reason for Voldemort not dying the first time around. There are smart villain, betrayals, and spies.

That being said, it has its flaws as well, and they mostly come in the form of grammatical/spelling inconsistencies. If you can get past that, it's a pretty decent story, and will probably hurt your heart to read.

** You want fics that /earn/ the mature rating from something other than lemons? Try the Downward Spiral Saga or Black Ink, Red Rose. Both are super super dark works (though there are lemons, what makes it an M fic is definitely the other stuff going on). For the same author's lighter works, there's linkffn(For Lack of a Bezoar). Ron doesn't get saved from the poison in HBP. This drives Harry and Hermione on a much darker path.

Both the Downward Spiral Saga and Lack of a Bezoar have a wonderful sequel called linkffn(Echoes in the Fog) a fic where the Grey!Harry in Bezoar and Canon!Harry (and their friends) end up in a world ruled by Voldemort with the Evil!Harry from the Downward Spiral Saga as is second in command.

For another M fic try ffnet's /Friends/ by the psychotic house elf (formerly known as glue and tar). Luna doesn't become friends with Ginny, Harry, or Neville and slowly finds her way into insanity.

All aforementioned fics include at least 3 of the 4 examples you put down.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance]])

Resistance by lorien829

Basically, what if Voldemort won the battle of Hogwarts, then proceeded to take over Britain, forcing all the good guys underground? A very dark story, with lots of death, and lots of really fucked up things happening. It has some really beautiful moments too, though, but the author does not pull their punches.

It's rated T for some reason, probably due to the lack of excessive swearing or graphic sex, but it has more than enough of the stuff mentioned in your title to count as a mature fic imo.

** This isn't exactly what I look for, but I can provide a few good fits:\\
linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen) is a solid recommendation, a slow-updating WIP with imagination

linkffn(12978018) is only rated T, but it's short and complete so there's not much room beyond getting the one idea across.

linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School by Kwan Li) absolutely has characters not aligned with our protagonists, and they are not shaken so easily

linkffn(The many Deaths of Harry Potter by ShayneT) is also a T and not short, but it's complete and scores very well by your other criteria.

linkffn(Geminio by Portus) has Moody as the focus. More tough choices.

** If you want gritty violence I'd say linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Characters that date people to spy on them? Check.

Characters dying? Check.

Uncomfortable decisions, like if they should hang spies or just Diffindo the neck? Check.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan)

I just caught with this fic being entirely new to the Harry Potter community. From what I can tell it updates twice a week(?) but it matches your description perfectly.

Choices matter in this fanfiction and you will see why. Also it is gritty and dark but not edgy.

But it has a few problems, but they are minor nitpicks.

Hope this helps :)

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
