I'm bored. Who wants to imagine up really vicious spells to use in a duel?


** *Marrowspike Curse*

This spell, if it hits a target, causes little spikes to grow on their bones, which push outwards and break through the victim's skin. The bone spikes don't grow inwards to avoid puncturing lungs, the brain, or other vital organs, but it is incredibly painful when they burst through the skin, and the ripping apart of muscles ensures your victim doesn't move again for a while. Combining it with a wide-angle bonecrusher curse makes for one gruesome fatality.

** Considering the general trend of someone who uses mudblood and dark wizardry, I've always been surprised there isn't a Mudblood Curse, that turns someone's blood to mud. It's the kind of thing I'd imagine a wizard Jack the Ripper would do, but to muggleborns instead of prostitutes.

** Depending on the level (rivalry/schoolyard vs Imma kill you dead):

Lemon Cut Jinx causes hundred of cuts similar to a paper cut to sprout on the body befire a substance similar to lemon juice or rubbing alcohol is put on them.

Contraction Curse Causes every muscle in the body to retract at full strength. Not "try your best to lift this heavy thing" full strength, more "lift the 3 ton off of your baby" full strength. Muscles can rip off bone in cases like that.

*** The contraction curse would be a very painful way to die, assuming it's not just the conscious muscles that contract, but the unconscious ones. Not only are your tendons shorn off their anchorings, with the mother of all cramps, your intestines have ruptured themselves, you've wet yourself, your circulatory system has ruptured (miniscule muscles in artery/vein walls contract together with the heart, severely raising blood pressure) and you've probably broken more than a few small bones.

** What about slow-acting, progressive spells? Where the victim doesn't even know they've been targeted. I suppose they wouldn't have much immediate application in duels. It could start with the occasional feeling of being watched or in the presence of something or someone. Over time, the frequency increases until they never have a moment "alone" despite all evidence to the contrary. Someone could be driven mad or to suicide. The success would depend in part on the spell being rare/unknown or irreversible.

Or Exodontia Excruciatus. The victim's teeth form painful abscesses and are rapidly extruded, leaving behind gaping, bleeding sockets. Try enunciating the counterspell while in the process of losing teeth and dealing with pain

Medusa Gorgos: the victim's hair comes to life and strangles, chokes, or otherwise constricts. Assuming you can keep hold of your wand, good luck speaking around a mouthful of hair while some more chokes you

** Inception: planting an idea in the target who believed to be his/her own

Extremely useful in creating friends, followers, spies, suicide bombers and etc, without resorting to direct mind control (Imperius).

Feasibility is high, given a 17 year old Hermione managed to give her parents a new identity.

** Parvus Tondendas (tiny shear): initiate a tiny amount of nuclear fission in the air between you and your target and directing the resultant nuclear radiation at them. This curse will be completely without signs of being cast, save for the wand movements and incantation. However, the target will, at the very least, be sterilised, and likely get cancer. Because wizards have no idea about fundamental forces, they'd be at a loss of how to treat it, and it would have no magical signature (as the radiation does the damage, not the magic itself), so this is a good curse for causing long-term harm to an enemy. Just weave it into a spell combo in a duel, and even if they do catch you casting it, they probably won't link it to their metastasing liver cancer a year later. They'd just feel a small wave of heat at most, and probably assume it came from a failed incendio or something similar. An overpowered version of this curse would case nuclear burns all over their body, destroy their genome and let them spend their final days in complete agony from extreme radiation poisoning. There's a story out there about a nuclear engineer who was kept alive in such a state for months, in extreme agony, but I won't link it.

** /Daemo Visio/ Aka Boggart sight hex

The hexed individual sees all individuals and/or objects as their worst fear. Neville would see all people as Snape. Harry would see all people as Dementors. It can be fought off the same way you fight a Boggart, the first thing you successfully /ridikulous/ reverses the hex.

** *Aegis Fidelis* - Removes parts of the body from existence so they cannot be targeted. Utmost care is advised to never use this spell on bodyparts requiring an active connection to the brain (the eyes, for example). When speaking the spell, all who hear it will be the secret keepers of the Aegis Fidelis in question.

*Persephones Wrath* - Creates fissures in the ground from which spectral claws emerge. The claws will begin ripping and tearing into any living matter around them and drag it down with them into the fissure after the spell is canceled. The caster is urged to not stand too close to the claws as they cannot be controlled.

*Falx* - Cutting Curse that slices clean through flesh and soft material at impact. Can be blocked by physical means and Shielding Charms, however it will "hook" into either blocking method and pull the opponent towards the caster, with the intent of unbalancing him.

*Occuladetras* - Eyeball Melting Curse. Starts to dissolve the eyeballs at impact. Impact areas include the entirety of the opponents body.

*Kronokis Abysmas* - The Black Void Hex. Creates a center of extreme gravity at impact. The center will drag in everything around it until it reaches "full charge". The Charge will then implode and create a shockwave of lethal power.

*Villuvultus* - The hairdo charm. Adding the name of the hairstyle after the incantation makes the hair targeted rearrange itself into the ordered one. Imagining the exact hairdo will reduce the randomness of the spell. Also works with beards.

*Maxanidate* - The vanity curse. Will increase the vanity of a person and simultaneously worsen their perception of their shortcomings. Attention: Can cause such things as rubbing through skin and muscle to get rid of bad acne, starvation due to perceived overweight, death through exhaustion due to perceived lack of sexual prowess and many more.

*Secupanem* - The breadcrumb charm. Must be cast at the destination first (may include abstract goals) and then on the target person. The charm will drive the target towards achieving said goal by making the target see single steps clearer. Care is advised: Being unable to reach the goal (due to personal reasons or the nature of the goal) the charm may be depression inducing.

** I used to make up really gruesome spells when I was bored! (mainly used/created by one of my characters xD)

1. A Scythe impales the target and instantly retracts, cutting and ripping through the skin. Possible to pull off limbs.

2. A Curse that slowly turns the targets blood into magma. The process is highly painful and very slow. You slowly burn from the inside.

3. A curse that melts the eyeballs.

4. Pulls the spine from the body. There's another spell that forces it into someone else, as well.

5. A spell that removes all bones, causing the target to just become a sludge of skin and organs.

6. A spell that makes the target hear Justin Bieber/Jacob Sartorius all day, no reprieve.

** Aedemio - causes the target to swell into a bloated sphere, somewhat buoyant. Target is unable to grip anything, limits range of motion... and it looks really funny, too.

Prongus - target suddenly grows horns anchored to their skull, until the structure is so heavy that they can't keep their head up.

Purgatorio - forces target to vomit in disgust; for reasons, cannot be blocked by a magical shield or deflection.

Constrixio - causes targets clothing to bind them up like a straightjacket

** A curse I use in a lot of stories is the Flame Flaying Curse. It slowly burns away skin a millimeter at a time across whatever portion of the skin the flame covers. It can take a very, very long time to die.

Though that's less casual duel and more honor duel to the death level magic. Definitely a dark spell.
