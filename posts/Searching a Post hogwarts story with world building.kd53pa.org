Yeah, like basically I want something that isn't the typical 12 or 30 or 50 chapters in a story to beat Voldemort then one epilogue with Harry and Pairings having children and everything is perfect and happy... I want something that changed that idc if big part of the story is about defeating voldy but i want something after that... and changes being made to that society... either by Harry being politician or the leader of a revolution idc about pairing cause it would probably be Hermione or Daphne Greengrass cause they are the only two pairing that would make him care about that type of things... (maybe Tonks) Hell my preference is Harry/Multi Just No slash... idc id Dark, Light or Gray... but if you can I rather a Harry that knows that he has to kill his enemies with lethal force when they use lethal force... I always thought that it was pathetic that the Death eaters use AK with no qualms whatsoever and Harry uses stupefy...


** Well, my story "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief" might fit - it starts in second year and goes past Hogwarts, and the majority happens post-Voldemort.

Chaning society is a common theme in a number of my stories, too - you might also like "Democracy" and "Divided and Entwined".

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.
