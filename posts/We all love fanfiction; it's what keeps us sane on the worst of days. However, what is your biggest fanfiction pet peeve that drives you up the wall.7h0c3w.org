  Why the Ron hate?
#+end_quote

Well, the common answers to this question are:

- He abandoned Harry twice

- He was a dick to Hermione for more than five years

- He was pulling Harry down/encouraging laziness while Harry had a madman after him

- He, and by extension all Weasleys knew about the abuse Harry suffered but did nothing to solve the problem. Sending food is not what you are supposed to do when you notice child abuse. You call the authorities.

- He got the girl while Harry was stuck with the psycho stalker

- He wanted Harry's fame while completely ignoring how Harry got famous

- Ron's tendency to put his foot in his mouth

- The shit he pulled during the fourth year, especially the Yule ball and prior the first task

- Ron's jealousy and attitude are annoying, if not outright signs of a bad person

- Various headcanon reasons: Weasleys are rapists (love potion trope), Ron was just a hired spy for Dumbledore, Ron was a covert Death Eater

How convincing these arguments are is up for debate. I find some (especially the headcanon arguments) utter bullshit but think that Ron is not the friend Harry needed for all the fucked up shit that went on in Harry's life. And in fanfiction he is annoying more often than not.

** Casual Death Eater apologism. You know how in some fics some character will be having a conversation with Harry and patiently and logically will begin to explain just why the Death Eaters were not /quite/ as bad as everyone is making them out to be, that they were and are /quite/ justified in fighting against the Ministry and the other side (including Harry's murdered parents...) is *just* as bad. And so on and so forth.

Unless you have ironclad plot reasons which require the above (like someone trying to manipulate Harry), *don't fucking do it*. It's like the cheapest way an author can use to speak directly to his audience about his shitty views. Most use it as a stepping stone to make the Harry/Draco banging easier, which is extra disgusting.

**** The thing about Snape is that he's such a nebulous character that he can be characterized in so many ways without breaking canon in any way.

Slytherpouf and Teddyradiator both write a Snape who is incredibly emotional, needy and adoring of the woman he loves while still being a snarky bastard to everyone else. Based on his behaviour with Lily and Dumbledore, this behaviour is compatible with canon.

The Problem with Purity has a Snape that is categorically awful to absolutely everyone including the woman he loves whenever he feels threatened . Based on his behaviour in canon (and the way he lashes out at Lily in his worst memory) this is also quite plausible.

Ishouldbewritingsomethingelse writes a Snape that is darkly sexual, confident, controlled and smooth. Considering his demeanour with Narcissa in HBP and how he acts when he's not in serious emotional distress (such as the end of PoA, when Harry gets into his Penseive etc) this is also a plausible Snape.

It's actually very hard to write a Snape who is so completely out of character as to be unreadable.

What's really easy to fuck up though, is his voice. Snape has a very distinct way of speaking - formal, elegant, generally sarcastic. If you get that wrong, no matter how good the rest of your fic may be, you're fucked.

Things like UmBitch, Voldy Warts/Voldy Shorts ect extra; just very immature. Yes they are awful, but it just takes me out of the story when insults like that is in the stories.

Every story that I seem to read seem to have Harry befriend Hermione. Don't get me wrong I love Hermione, but it would be nice to see a variety.

Like you have him befriend Hermione but not Ron? In most Slytherin Harry stories he's friends with Draco and Hermione and not Ron and that's just weird.

I'd love to see him befriend Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott, Justin Finch-Fletchley, be better friends with Neville, be friends with Susan Bones or Hannah Abbott. Just a variety of people would be better then always being friends with Hermione, Ron or Draco in a story; see how different that could be.

Harry having millions and millions of galleons, yes he should be well off but not filthy rich like the Malfoy's.

Stories that suddenly have bashing in it. Normally I hate summaries where it says warning bashing, but that I can appreciate because then I can skip the story, but if the story all of a sudden has bashing in it just for the sake of bashing with no warning I tend to nope out of it. (I've just gotten so tired of bashing stories).

Goblins being nice to Harry just because Harry is nice to them and says some formal words or whatever. I highly doubt that the Goblins would care how nice Harry is.

Ice princess/Ice Queen Persona of Daphne Greengrass. She was only mentioned like once in canon and yet everyone seems to have her as a ice princess/ice queen, I can't stand it because that's not how I see her.

Luna being like a Seer or all knowing or whatever. Luna was just a odd girl that believed in different things like creatures and conspiracies, she was extremely perspective about certain things but she wasn't a seer or anything like that and I hate when people write her as such. (Note Luna is one of my favorite characters in the series).

Overly long showing of a shopping trip in Diagon Alley. Unless there's something specific that happens at the shopping trip then really it should just be glossed over in my opinion.

When all Hermione and Ron do in fanfics is fight. Like I know that they fought a lot in canon but that's not all they did. If you don't have them do something helpful then why have them in the story?

Female Harry stories that has Harry's female name as Harriet. I'm sorry it's a nice name and I mean no offense to anyone who has that name, but I just can't when it involves Harry. It just feels so incredibly lazy in my opinion. I personally try a flower name myself.

Wrong Boy/Girl who lived stories in general, I used to like them but they seem like all the same. I just can't see James and Lily treating Harry badly just because his brother or sister is the Chosen One. I see James and Lily being doting parents to any children that they have.

Harry is suddenly the lord of Potter, Black, Malfoy, Slytherin ect extra and is betrothed to Hermione, Ginny, Gabriel, Tonks, and whoever else. Like yeah no thank you. No offense to those that like that kind of story, I just don't.

Hermione is suddenly not a Muggleborn and is instead related to Malfoy, Lestrange, Black, or whatever other Pureblood. Why? Why does it matter? She has proven that she is just as smart, just as powerful as a Pureblood, so why make her a Pureblood? That just irks me so much when that happens.

** Time to roll out the list...

*World*

- Technology being depicted as able to overcome/get around magic.

- White-washing of Muggle society and exaggeration of the flaws of wizarding society in order to depict Muggle society as significantly more enlightened than wizarding society. The whole point of wizarding prejudices and governmental corruption is to act as a magical analogy of problems that exist in the Muggle world.

- Wizards displaying significant interest in Muggle culture or technology.

- Depiction of the wizarding world as stuck in the past, or having Victorian values. Wizarding society is its own unique thing, not Muggle society 100 years ago. In many respects it is more liberal than Muggle society. In some respects it is more conservative.

- Depiction of wizarding society as lacking innovation/static.

- Ancient magic that is depicted as more powerful or advanced than modern magic.

- A wizarding world with a functional nobility. A defunct nobility is acceptable.

- Backwater Britain (with respect to other magical nations).

- Backwater wizards (with respect to other magical species).

- A magical population that is too large. I feel like 30,000 wizards in Britain is the absolute maximum, but really it should be significantly less. Populations that are too large make the canon world and events increasingly implausible and change the tone of the society.

- A magical economy that is too large or sophisticated. Magical Britain is about the size of a small town. It shouldn't have billionaires, a stock market, or really any kind of sophisticated financial services.

- The idea that “Dark Lord” is a commonly used title, or even a magically real title, as opposed to a made-up title that originated with Voldemort.

- Casual use of the Unbreakable Vow.

- Casual use of Veritaserum.

- Making rare and obscure magic relatively common knowledge, in particular occlumency and horcruxes.

- Related to the above, making rare magical objects into “off the shelf” purchases that verge on mass-produced (e.g. Moody's trunk).

- Depiction of Aurors as magical police who have general enforcement duties, as opposed to specifically elite Dark wizard hunters (and occasionally VIP bodyguards).

- Depiction of Aurors as having a command structure, procedures etc which are reminiscent of Muggle police or military.

- Helpful Goblins who perform a great many functions which would more correctly lie with the government, law firms, and accountants.

- Hogwarts teachers giving their students far too much leeway. In particular, having the teachers permit a teenage authorial avatar to continually undermine their authority.

- The idea that anti-Muggleborn discrimination happens in the open and is institutionalised, as opposed to it being an analogue of racism in the Muggle world: definitely present, but in a insidious way, with institutions being officially opposed to it.

*Magic*

- Any kind of magical exhaustion, including “concentration exhaustion”. Physical exhaustion and general tiredness are acceptable.

- Magic as energy, or as working within the same system of laws as physics (rather than overriding/breaking physical law).

- Non-permanent transfiguration.

- Depiction of wandless magic as equally versatile and powerful as wanded magic, capable of casting all the same spells as you can with a wand.

- Magic which is presented as simple to understand and learn. In particular: wish magic, where all you need is intent and willpower, and dictionary magic, where all you need to do is look up the incantation and wand movements and practice them.

- The idea that a wizard could cast powerful/advanced magic without having studied it in some form, whether that means reading up on it or experimenting with it themselves. Corollary: the idea that a wizard could have studied a piece of magic extensively but not cast it well. The most common and egregious example: Hermione who is an expert in magical theory but not so strong at actually casting magic, as opposed to a Harry who is great at casting powerful and advanced magic but doesn't really understand what he's doing.

- Duels lasting a long time, with multiple injuries being incurred, rather than ending very quickly the moment one fighter gains a slight advantage over the other.

- A Veela's mere presence exerting a magical befuddling effect which they can turn on and off at will (as opposed to Veela having a befuddling effect that is connected to their voice and movements, in addition to general extreme attractiveness).

- Muggles/squibs being able to make potions.

*Harry*

- Characterisation of Harry which ignores his resilience and turns him into a crybaby, a nervous wreck, prone to emotional breakdowns, or infantilizes him.

- Characterisation of Harry that turns him into a genius.

- Characterisation of Harry that ignores the strengths and talents of his canon self.

- Harry who rants and shouts at adults, and generally comports himself like a 7-year-old having a tantrum.

- Harry who tells his life story including extremely private matters to everyone he meets.

- Harry who constantly dispenses “wisdom” to his peers, such as telling Hermione not to believe everything she sees in a book the first time he meets her.

- Harry who ditches Ron and Hermione as friends.

- Overstating the level of the Dursleys' abuse.

- Harry whose wealth is overstated. He should be comfortably well off, but any galleon count that goes into the millions should be avoided.

- Making Harry short

*Other characters*

- Any kind of bashing, especially of Dumbledore. Bashing turns characters into shallow cardboard cut-out villains who exist solely for Harry to knock down easily and thus look powerful/important/clever for doing so. But because the villain has been hollowed out, his defeat of them carries no glory. He's playing on easy mode.

- In particular, stupid/comic/jealous relief Ron, evil or incompetent Dumbledore, scheming Ginny, smothering Molly, “harpy” Hermione.

- Making Harry the only character who is capable of learning. Another common feature of bashing is rehashing the same conflict over and over, where a villain doesn't learn anything from the previous conflict and continues to make plans using their old, now disproven assumptions.

- Genius Hermione. She's undoubtedly clever, hard working, and has a very good memory. All laudable qualities. But she's no Dumbledore, or even a Snape.

- A Hermione who identifies more as a Muggle than a witch.

- A Fleur whose identity revolves around her Veela heritage as opposed to being a talented witch who just so happens to be extremely beautiful.

- Any characterisation of Voldemort which makes his worldview reasonable or removes his psychopathy.

- Characterisation of Snape that makes him too noble, or affable once you gain his respect.

- Characterisation of Snape that makes him a one dimensional evil villain.

- A Grindelwald who is made a 1-to-1 analogy of Hitler, or has functional connections to Hitler.

*Plot*

- Fics without a plot or plot structure.

- Any change made to the HP world which does not have corresponding changes to character motivations and actions. For example, in canon Voldemort could not penetrate Privet Drive during the summer. If your fanon makes it so that him taking Harry's blood does allow him to penetrate Privet Drive, you should also change character behaviours to match - Dumbledore would know this, and act accordingly. When an author changes the world but keeps Dumbledore's actions the same, and then criticises him in the story for those unsuitable actions, what the author is really doing is having the characters criticise their own poor writing.

- Fics that have Harry pick up a book in year five only to discover the “real nature of magic”. He's been at magic school for several years and has been getting pretty good grades. He already knows the real nature of magic. Authors always underestimate the extent of Harry's knowledge. Just because we're not shown it doesn't mean he's not learning it.

- Romantic partners who do not have their own lives, with their own circle of friends, their own dreams and ambitions which may clash with their partner's plans, their own opinions and beliefs which differ in some areas from those of their partner.

- Naive sex god eunuch Harry. That is, having female characters be attracted to Harry precisely because he's so insecure and freaks out at anything sexual. “You behave completely asexually, which is exactly why I want to have sex with you!” said no woman ever.

- Fics where Voldemort just sits around making pointless terrorist attacks but never actually does anything to try to take control of the wizarding world until a “final battle” with no strategic purpose.

- Inconsistency in the abilities that characters possess, especially their level of duelling ability or the use of any special talents. This inconsistency is more often than not used to force the plot in a direction which it would not naturally go, given those abilities.

- Rehash of the canon plotlines with no significant changes. Especially where the divergent elements of the fic mean that events should logically diverge, yet the fic finds ways to force the original canon storyline.

- Depiction of magical warfare that ignores the high mobility and stealth capabilities of wizards, as well as the relative lack of need for natural resources or land. We should be seeing skirmishes for strategic objectives, not significant pitched battles.

- As above, time travel/dimension travel stories where the travelling character very quickly ends up telling their life story to people they barely know.

- Time-travel/dimension-travel stories in which there is more than one travelling character, or the character(s) are able to move back and forth between times/dimensions.

I also picture a single Auror hunting a single Dark wizard full time for several years. There are other parts of the DMLE for paroling, petty crime etc - the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol and the Hitwizards are the two we know of. Plus we know that most enforcement is not done by a generalised police force but rather by the specific civil servant responsible for that domain of law e.g. Arthur is a civil servant who writes the law but also does his own raids to enforce it.

****** This is essentially treating magic as energy rather than as magic.

There are many reasons to think magic should not be treated as a physical force that Muggles simply haven't discovered yet. If it's not obvious from the tone of the magic system in general, or from the fact that secrets, names, job positions, etc are all magically real, or from the fact that wizards show no sign of expending any kind of effort to cast magic, or from the complete incompatibility of HP magic with our understanding of the physical universe, you also have word of god:

#+begin_quote
  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature.
#+end_quote

*However*, if you insist upon treating magic as energy, then there cannot be any doubt that wizards have access to more than enough to stop railguns or any Muggle weapon you wish to imagine. The aguamenti spell creates several kilograms of matter, and transfiguration more generally has been seen to significantly alter the mass of objects. Converting energy into kilograms of matter takes more energy than the largest nuclear bomb ever exploded, and wizards do this with casual ease, with no sign of being tired. Not to mention their ability to bend space and time.

The extreme result of treating magic as energy is, I feel, just another reason not to go down that route.

- Preachy authorial mouthpiece characters.

- Juvenile humour.

- Taking an absence of an explicit explanation in canon and assuming a plot hole that can be exploited, rather than something that the reader just doesn't know. E.g. Magically binding agreements exist in canon but they are not used extensively to guarantee loyalty and honesty across society. Since the limitations on oaths/contracts are not explicitly explained, the author assumes that there are no limitations and wizards are just too stupid to have seen the exploit.

**** The best way I can think of cores is as a conceptual model. If you look for them you'll find them. They have an output you can measure. You can make spells that depend on them. They don't actually exist.

Core Magic is a conceptual model of spell development but it is not the only one. Conceptual models are like different operating systems for computers. The wizard is like the computer hardware and the conceptual model they use is the software.

Also just like computer software the more work that is put into something the better fleshed out it is. Think about what computer games were like in the 90's vs what they are like right now. Conceptual Models are no different. British mages use Core Magic because generations of people have added their works to the system and it is generally the most developed school of spell casting.

That being said there are other operating systems that are completely incompatible. They don't run the same "programs" or spells but they still work. It's why you almost never see asian mages in Britain. The asian countries use a different type of spell casting.

It is very possible to encounter magic that some people believe impossible. Harry's blood protection for example would be his mother dabbling in a different core model, like a Windows user who decided to try out Linux.

****** My favorite interpretation is that magic is technological in origin.

Some race figured out how to cause a set of energies to flow into themselves in a complicated pattern so that the energy no longer flys off randomly like all other forms of energy do. It stays in the pattern that is established. They used this to create pure energy technology. The race eventually evolved so that their bodies also became like this pure energy. Very much like The Ancients from Stargate or the Q from Star Trek or the older raced from Babylon 5, etc...

These Ancients created something akin to self replicating nanomachines from this pure energy. Since they have the technology to create something from nothing, these nanomachines don't even need to consume things to propagate. The ancient beings dropped off a package of them into an empty universe and had them expand indefinitely to fill the blankness with energy. This became the dimension of magic and the energy nano machines because known as "magic".

Magic is not conceptually infinite but it has been doubling in size every few milliseconds for longer than our own universe has existed so it is unfathomably large to the point that it is 'infinite' for all mortal considerations. You can't even really destroy it all, every attempt just creates a super-massive void sometimes bigger than galaxies that will eventually fill itself back in because of the doubling. The original magic creator race discovered how to achieve actual infinity and dropped "magic" like it was old socks because their new socks were better.

Magic has trans-dimensional detection capabilities and looks for certain patterns in living things to become responsive too. This allows access to magic. Magic also has an infinite memory and remembers anything ever done with it. This is why spells work for more than 1 person once they have been invented. To use a formalized spell you have to intentionally invoke it, knowing what it is called and having at least a passing idea of what it does. This is why you can't just throw out magic that any of the innumerable alien races from other realities also use magic have developed for themselves.

This does mean that with the right insight it is possible (but unlikely) to discover anything that is stored in magics "memory" which includes the complete technological databases of uncountable races from uncountable different realities, including the creator race of magic itself. However nobody has even thought that magic itself might contain digital information and so nobody ever looks for it. If they did though they would still need to decipher the alien programming language and every thing else that comes along with interfacing with alien technology.
