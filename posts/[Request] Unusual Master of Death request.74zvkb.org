Where Harry Potter acquires all the three hallows and accends, but here is the twist. Harry finds out the three hallows were just a test and is landed at a school/university where everyone has achieved the hallows. The university/school is a mastery/finishing school where you learn the deep and fine points of magic regardless to a creatures race or type of magic.

Any ideas redditors?


** How exactly would that work? The Hallows are pretty big, powerful and somewhat famous, so multiples of them in a single planet, never mind coutry, would be tricky. You could go nexus of alternative universe, out-of-time school where once you are in the Hallows are scrambled back into the world, or maybe the hallows are the HUMAN's test and other races have different hallow-level quests? There are options but they seem awfully complicated for a plot that is somewhat simple.

Personally I think it sounds fun and interesting but too hard to play out with 'everybody has hallows', specially since.... WTF do you teach someone with an elder wand?! They can likely use Accio and fire AKs anyway. A more possible angle, IMO, is the Hallow's ownership AND the whole Horcrux hunt being enough 'display' to put the golden trio in for the double secret Hogwart's unspeakable training collegue or something.

*** It would be that the mythical powers the Hallows have are just that, a myth. There just artifacts or powerful portkeys triggered by the three hallows being in close range to each other. This is not a Canon compliant fic idea. Or at least this is how i perceive this. Any version of my thought bubble above is welcome.

**** One way I suddently had pop in my mind is an option... Sure, the Hallows are nothing but a tell, here is an idea, they are really three needed keys to go to higher schooling but you have to be legancy to event go anyway.

The Hallows are the 3 key artifacts of an ancient powerful potter that got stolen off, while many other people have different keys. This would rule out Hermione but may allow Ron to go, and many others half or pure blooded casters of around Harry's age yes? Is an option....

*** It strikes me as something of a Discworld thing. Done that way, I'm sure the result would be fun. And the mysterious powers of the things don't even have to be anything all that great (or even at all real), especially with the fact that two out of three don't seem to have any ownership requirements and the third one can be taken with something Harry learned in his second year.
