So I finally got around to actually uploading the next chapter of my HP/DF crossover story. You can find it [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10375041/1/][here]].


** The problem with crossovers is that the two worlds don't fit together. Taking one character from either is doable, but anything more than that isn't because it brings up all sorts of questions. Such as...

Considering how hard they shut down Kemler, why didn't the Council kill Voldemort?

Why aren't slaughtering the Ministry wholesale for the rampant abuse of memory charms and the like?

The magic systems don't work together. Harry Potter magic does things by itself, whereas in Dresden Files its just energy harnessed by its wielder.

You could possibly make the two worlds work together but I don't see how. Or why.

In terms of writing, you have a bit of an issue with tense. It keeps switching from past to present.

** I'm actually in the middle of planning my own HP/DF crossover. Completely different concept then yours but this looks interesting. My biggest problem so far is figuring out all the details about how the two magical worlds will fit together. I'll leave u a review once I'm done what you've written and let u know what I think. :)
