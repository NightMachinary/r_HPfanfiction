To kind of get away from that shy girl, who is obsessed with Harry Potter Boy Who Lived image, she wants to become friends with Harry more, maybe she does it through Hermione, and Ron.

It can become Harry/Ginny eventually, or it doesn't have to be.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather not have the whole soul bonding thing happen, if possible, though if done in a interesting way, I'll allow it.

Can be on ANY Site.

Bonus if Harry ends up with someone else, and Harry and Ginny are still friends, but not mandatory.

Would rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine.

** *Ginny Returns* linkffn(4740107)

Harry/Ginny. Time travel (just her). She forces her way into the trio. Skips a year. Has /some/ pureblood etiquette, but it doesn't control the whole novel.

  What if the war was over, but the only ones left were Ginny and a paralyzed friend? When Ginny finds a ritual that will send her back to an earlier point in the timeline, how will she change things to come out for the better? HP/GW
