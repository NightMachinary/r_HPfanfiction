It's been a while since I read the books and I'm not really certain if I'm mixing up fact and fiction.

Is the Wizarding World really as fickle as portayed if fanfiction? I mean, sure, the students turned against Harry in CoS pretty quickly but c'mon they're children, they don't necessarily have the most stable of personalities. And when they turned against Harry and Dumbledore thats kinda understandable, no one really wants to hear it when two supposed incarnations of all that is good and light start saying that the one who killed their families has returned.

So, am I missing any plot points or is the rest actually fanfiction?


** To be honest it always read as authentic to me. People will believe whatever they read in the daily mail.

*** Yeah, I concur. I have seen public opinion change dramatically very quickly on people after bad press (or even good press). Harry wasn't able to show his side of the story, and when he did the opinion swung more to his side.

**** Meghan Markle is the most recent example I can think of. Also do you remember when they got that guy arrested for murder in Bristol? Because he looked odd and lived near the victim. That was years ago but I still remember it.

****** If I remember correctly it was the murder of Joanna Yeates. Her landlord (or maybe just a neighbour?) was quite an odd looking bloke, but other than living in the same building as her didn't really have any connection. I was quite young at the time, definitely in my first few years of secondary school, and I remember reading this huge article about what a weirdo he was, with loads of pictures of his mad hair and stuff. Pretty much everyone thought he had done it based on his appearence and the sun posting loads of photos of him. The police eventually arrested him and then released him without charge because there wasn't any evidence to suggest he was involved. Turned out to be a different guy and the sun got sued for libel.

** The wizarding world is not supposed to read as particularly fickle... all the stuff about the Prophet is supposed to be a criticism of real life British culture and journalistic standards.

** I don't read it as any more fickle than real life/muggle world. Not everyone turned against Harry, but a lot did. Not everyone believed the Prophet's words whole sale, but a lot did. That's more or less in line in my opinion what happens in real life. Someone can turn from being publically adored to hated after a few bad press.

** Couple more examples:

1. Goblet of Fire, Rita Skeeter writes an article about a love triangle between Hermione, Harry, and Viktor Krum. Hermione ends up getting a shit ton of hate mail, and Mrs. Weasley gives her the cold shoulder until Harry straightens her out. Really, I could just say Rita Skeeter in general, because whatever she writes instantly becomes the truth for everyone.
2. Chamber of Secrets, I have only two words: Gilderoy Lockhart
3. Prisoner of Azkaban, we have the whole mess with Sirius being proclaimed a dangerous dark wizard with zero evidence

As much as I'd like to say it's fanon, there are enough examples throughout the series that we can pretty much assume that the wizarding world is actually the wizarding world of sheep.

***** Sirius is a special case. Part of the hysteria was because people think he killed a lot of Muggle and was the right hand man of Voldemort. But the true problem is, he escaped Azkaban. From what we heard (which may not be the truth), he did something litteraly nobody had done before him, and the Ministry had no idea how he did it. Just for this I think the hysteria is kinda justified.\\
As for the Muggles, they just followed Wizard instructions. Wizards told the Minister that the escaped convicts is extremely dangerous and must be dealt with most care, they just relayed the information.

** I'm reading the books with my kids now (officially old) and yeah, even in Canon it seems like everyone just follows the Prophet. And then in OotP Harry gets a letter from a random wizard explaining how confused the population is because Harry is god-like but everyone is in denial about Voldemort.

** Eh a lot of people want to believe what they're told by the people in charge/news especially if even a small part of them can believe it since it makes them feel smart or right. People also don't want to believe the people in charge would lie to them and if it doesn't effect them they don't care enough to dig. Harry wasn't seen in the wizarding world except in hogwarts. That means people are going to think. “Well I haven't seen any evidence saying he's not an attention seeker so this is just icing on the cake.”
