I haven't published it yet, but I'd love some help with it. The basic premise is this, "In order to cope with his life on Privet Drive, Harry Potter takes to the OG." I might change the summary, but the idea is that Harry becomes somewhat of a stoner and how it is at Nugwarts-I mean Hogwarts. It's gonna be a bit of a comedy, but I don't want to really call it a crackfic.


** Huh. When I saw the title, my imagination went to 'After Aunt Petunia swings a pot at Harry's head one-too-many-times, accidental magic makes sure it connects, and sticks to his head so she can't swing it anymore. Harry goes through Hogwarts with a pot for a helmet.'

** Dana Larsen, a Canadian pot activist, released a parody of Harry Potter that was all about weed. It was a legal download but is rather hard to find now. I've got a copy of it somewhere. If you want I can dig it up and post a link. Might help with some ideas. The pictures in it are amazing.

** Read Runic Animagi by Kassien. It's a good story, where pot is a turning point for Harry.

**** Well it's not done the way I imagine you want to write yours. Even though it's a plot point that led to heavy changes on Harry, pot in Runic Animagi isn't a central point. Besides him being concerned about how his plants are doing.

**** I can't think of any rune-centred fics right now, other than Basiliskbor, linkffn(10709411). However that one still doesn't focus 100% runes. But uses runes and rituals as a centre. It's interesting. Has a great concept, but can get a bit tropey. Also, I think the chapters have now been beta'ed so it may be better than when I was reading through it.

By the way, it is still ongoing. But has a good deal of close to 50 chapters out.

** Try to vary the humor as the story goes on. Most of these funny premises fall short because there's only so many ways you can write "ha ha weed 420 blaze it" before people get bored and move on.

** Don't try so hard to be funny. Stoner "humour" is pretty crap, and unless you want the fic to wear the crackfic moniker (and deserve it, to be honest), cut the dumb pot puns. They're boring, and overdone, and irritating. Also, coping with life by self-medicating with pot is kind of a dark place to take things. The need to escape from reality into a haze of drugs is a particularly nasty strain of toxic masculinity, and not really all that funny. It ends up sounding kind of desperate and depressing.

If you're going for funny, steer clear of the self-medicating, the dumb stoner puns, and the other stuff that makes it irritating. If the dude discovers that Wizarding Britain doesn't really frown on pot use, and that teachers use the stuff to relax, and Harry manages to get his hands on the Herbology department's stash once in a while, fair enough. If he and his best friends occasionally sneak off to the edge of the Forbidden Forest and indulge in a bit of pot smoking, sure no problem. If the trio manage to convince Dobby to make them edibles, and have to somehow hide the results of them, great.

There's a million different places you could take this that doesn't end up cringe-worthy, cracky, or depressing.

*** I was using the whole coping thing as how Harry got started smoking, not as the depressing subject. I mean, personally, you smoke weed to expand your mind. Not in the intelligence way, obviously, but the creative, feeling way. Do I make sense? I'm a bit tired.

**** If you ease up a skosh on how heavy-handed the Dursleys are (i know it's out of character, but you get where I'm going), then Harry smoking a little pot to relax from his stress doesn't come off as quite so depressing. You know what I'm saying? Like, if they're the level of extra they are in the books (locking him in his room, the under the cupboard shit, etc), and he's starting to take drugs to cope with it, the whole thing sounds depressing. If they're just assholes in a general sense, and he's a bit stressed out, but not developmentally damaged in any way, it's more like, "Oh he's like a typical high school kid whose life kind of lowkey sucks, and he just wants something to relax with". Get where I'm goin'?

***** Yeah, but the coping thing was only how he got started, not why he continues. He just continues for fun, ye ne? I was thinking that the Dursleys take hit ganja, start smoking it, and become all chill like. But don't tell anyone that. It's a surprise!

******* That would work. I think I could do that.\\
Harry carefully tip-toed through the halls, making his way to the garage. Occasionally, the floorboards would creak, making him freeze on the spot, wait a minute, then slowly continue. He was only a couple steps away from the garage door now. Reaching out, he turned the doorknob, not too fast, but not that slow. After what felt like an eternity, Harry had the door ajar just enough to slip through. Taking out his weak flashlight, Harry pressed a button, and the light came on.\\
Only two minutes later, Harry found /it/, the air-tight, green metal box. It was about a 2 foot big cube, with a flip open lid that required a key to unlock. Luckily, Harry had unlocked the box before he went to bed, when Uncle Vernon was in the bathroom. He only had a minute, so he could take anything.\\
Harry grinned as he used his empty hand to slowly open the box, the dank smell emanating from the container.\\
Weed.\\
There was a large mason jar in one corner, nearly full with weed. From what Harry had learned, he could tell it was high quality. There were two multi-chambered bongs, recently cleaned, right next to the mason jar. Next to those were 4 grinders of different sizes, with a water-pipe resting on top. Scattered around the rest of the box were several pipes of different sizes, an herbal-vape, a pack of RAW rolling paper, RAW pre-shaped cones (making it easier to make a joint), and *lots* of lighters.\\
There was still a lot of room, but Harry was certain all the other contents were scattered about, in a car, in Uncle Vernon's bedroom, etc, etc.\\
Harry filled half of a small plastic bag with weed, grabbed a few rolling papers, a lighter (which he made sure was pretty full). But then he realized a grinder would be noticed if missing, even with the Dursley's somewhat shit memories. Harry sighed as he took the weed out of the bag, and spend a couple minutes grinding it all. Then he smiled as he realized how much kief was in the grinders. He took as much as he could, making sure to leave enough to avoid suspicion.\\
So here he was, in his bedroom, a towel stopping the smoke from going under a door, his window open, and lavender-scented spray. /Damn/, Harry though with a grin, /this is gonna be a fantastic summer/.

HOLY SHIT! All of that was on the spot by the way. Thanks for the idea.
