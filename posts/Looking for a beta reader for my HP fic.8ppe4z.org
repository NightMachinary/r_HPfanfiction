Hello, I currently writing my first ever HP fic called Crossroads of life, and I am looking for people to beta my fic.

So let me tell you a bit about myself, and the fic. So let's star with me: I am new to writing fics, and to writing stories as a whole, so i don't think my grammar is the best to be honest.

So now let me talk about the fic: this will be a considerably long fic, and it is a dark Harry au. It won't be horribly dark, and unrealistic- so we won't see Harry go ballistic and kill everyone type of dark. But i will say that this fic is canon divergent, since Harry will be raised by the Malfoy's, and the Potters are still alive.

Also, I have already posted my fic in FF and it's already on chapter 6, so i would need someone to read, and edit the first few chapters. Of course i will give that person time, but I will also, keep updating the fic until eventually they catch up.

So if anyone is interested please let me know.


** I would suggest dropping a link preemptively so people can read and see if they're interested in the story as well.

** Some advice to you...

Don't ever put down your own writing skills. Even the greats make mistakes. As long as you learn from them and correct them, there's no reason to apologize or put down your writing.

If you want me to interact with your story, you should provide us with something that will hook us! Think of it as literary clickbait, but actually tell us what's so great about your story and why I should be reading/beta-ing it. Think of it like providing your summary on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]. You want to draw a beta reader in, so give a reason to stick around!

Finally, add your link, that way I don't have to go searching on my own for your fic out of the hundreds of thousands that exist.

I wish you the best of luck on your story and I will certainly check it out!

** I don't really have time to beta, but I gave your fic a quick look. Your grammar is, for the most part, okay, but you need to work on your punctuation, particularly when speech occurs in the narrative. For example:

#+begin_quote
  Narcissa nodded, before explaining "She was mostly ready..."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  "I am sorry Cissa, it won't happen again." He said softly...
#+end_quote

These should really be:

#+begin_quote
  Narcissa nodded, before explaining, "She was mostly ready..."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  I am sorry, Cissa, it won't happen again," he said softly...
#+end_quote

I added a comma before Cissa. Also notice the comma after 'explaining' and 'again' in the first and second example respectively. That's how speech should be punctuated when dialogue tags (i.e., the 'Narcissa nodded, before explaining' and 'he said softly' part) are used.

Unless you don't use a phrase like 'said', 'explained', 'whispered', 'yelled', etc., in the dialogue tag. So for example:

#+begin_quote
  Narcissa nodded. "She was mostly ready..."
#+end_quote

I hope that makes sense.

Fix those things, and your technical writing skills will be leagues above a good chunk of the [[https://FFN.net][FFN.net]] writer population.

Maybe also consider switching up your paragraph lengths. Just from a quick scroll through, I can see that your paragraphs are weirdly uniform, most around similar lengths. Consider drawing more attention to important parts you want to highlight by putting them in a short paragraph, because /all/ readers skim unless they are compulsively trying to read every single word or their grasp of the language isn't very good. It might also help build tension.

I think a really good example is your first paragraph. My first thought as I'm reading it is, wow, you really want us to know that it's dark. In fact, you spend so much time on it, that I'm starting to skim because I'm thinking, well, okay, it's dark, I get it, I'm moving on. Then at the end of your paragraph you go: 'except for one person...' And I do a double-take and have to re-read it again. So if you want to draw attention to that person, you could maybe start it in a new paragraph. For example:

#+begin_quote
  ... Everyone was enjoying the comforts of their own home.

  Except for one person who appeared to be unfazed, and pleasantly walking about outside.
#+end_quote

This draws attention easily to the individual.

Another issue is the use of adverbs. Specifically, anything that ends in '-ly'. A lot of established writers advise against using adverbs because they are often superfluous. The general rule of thumb is one every 100 words, but I personally find that rule a bit too restricting and tend to use adverbs as I like. I think you need to tone down the adverbs a bit though. Your first sentence:

#+begin_quote
  It was horribly dark outside; barely anything could be seen without a source of light.
#+end_quote

I think you should cut out 'horribly'. One, it makes the tone sound lighter than maybe it should, like how people say, "Oh, it's horribly rainy today, isn't it?" It sounds like slang. It doesn't sound like it's actually 'horrible', but just conversational/exaggerated. Two, it's unnecessary, as you immediately go on to tell us that 'barely anything could be seen'.

Essentially, be stricter with your adverbs.

Well, that was actually quite a long post. I hope you don't feel discouraged by the length of this post. Your fic does seem interesting and my impression of your characterisation of Lucius and Narcissa is as good as a quick skim of your first chapter can allow. If you're willing to work on these things, you might have a pretty good fic on your hands.

*** Hey thank you for commenting, and don't worry about the long post, since i am not at all discouraged. I mean i'm a filmmaker so i had to get used to constructive criticism, and i tend to like knowing where i'm making mistakes. Also, a few of the things you said, I noticed but i just didn't know how to fix it, and now I do so thanks.

Lastly, English in actually not my first language so you can tell that i struggle with it, specially with the adverbs as you say, because in Spanish they are used quite often due to our over dramatic way of speaking. But i'll work on that for sure, and make changes when I can.

So thanks for your feedback it helped a lot.
