** It is a different character, but there is a story with Daphne Greengrass secretly writing Harry Potter fanfiction. Surprisingly, it isn't even crack.

  After the war, what's left is picking up the pieces. Harry continues the only way he knows how and takes solace in reading stories on the internet, not suspecting it would take his life in a whole new direction... Post-Hogwarts AU.

** It would obviously be crack. And Hermione bashing. Because she is born from the enemy. Rotfang conspiracy! Maybe some Sweeney Todd vibes? I vaguely remember something about Fudge and Goblin pies. Throw in the Goblins being ever so grateful for stopping the evil Fudge that they helpful!goblin the scarcrux off of Harry.

The Power He Knows Not turns out to be a ritual to summon the great Crumple-Horned Snorkack. The ritual involved a lot of pentagrams and the intact removed scarcrux from Harry. Turns out that was a bad idea, as that was a mistranslated ritual. And Voldemort was /consumed/ by a gigantic... snail creature. (Oorn from the Cthulhu mythos). Get it, those eye stalks are pretty crumply.
