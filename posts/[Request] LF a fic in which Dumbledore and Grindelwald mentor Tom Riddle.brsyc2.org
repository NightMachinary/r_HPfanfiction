** Don't know a story exactly like that, but in linkffn(Realignment) both try to mentor him, just not at the same time and not exactly working together. Dumbledore mentors him like he does Harry in HBP, while Grindelwald sees his potential and tries to recruit him for his cause.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
