I've just finished S2 of /Schitt's Creek/ and I'm wondering if there are any similar stories where, postwar, a pureblood family (Malfoy's or others, no real preference) loses everything and ends up living Muggle but is totally clueless about life in general?

I'd love to read something a bit more humourous or slice of life rather than dramatic, if there is anything! If not, I guess I'm going to have to write it myself...
