Since their first meeting on the Hogwarts Express, Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass have been practically inseparable to the point where one followed the other into the same House.

People in all four Houses, and even some of the more 'in-touch' teachers', are in on multiple, concurrent betting pools on when and how they finally begin dating.

Unfortunately for everyone involved, Harry and Daphne are each denser than a neutron star. Everyone is frequently frustrated by the oblivious pair's constant teetering on the precipice of mutual realization.

...They both may know and may just enjoy trolling the ever-loving fuck out of people.

Edit: It doesn't have to be Daphne Greengrass: I just used her as a personal choice/example. Any girl is an option.

*** It doesn't have to be: It can be any girl, really. I just used Daphne as a personal preference. I should have noted that in the OP: Oops!

But, yeah: Pansy could be a fun choice, too. Or one of the girls that would have been in Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff.

****** And Daphne isn't overdone/generic? Not to hate on your personal preference here, it's your prompt. But when you say "overdone" or "generic" I can say Daphne is just as overdone and generic. At least Hermione has a personality, Daphne is (pretty much) just an oc, the only thing she has is a name assigned to her, not a backstory or anything else.

******* I used Daphne as an example: It could be any girl in his year, and while that includes Hermione, she is overdone in this role. Hermione being Harry's first friend on the train is actually a pretty common plot element -- unfortunately, it's most common in rabid Harmonian fics,"Weasley Bashing" stories, "Hermione Mary Su", or time-travel plots, but yeah -- very common. And kinda boring, IMHO. Thing is, Hermione at that age, especially as shown on the train, was... pretty annoying. She actually was insufferable, and Ron's dislike of her was pretty valid until she mellowed out later on in the year and they bonded over the Troll Incident. Even Harry, while not actively being an ass to her like Ron did and was uncomfortable with Ron's attitude, was actually pretty passive/uncaring about it all: He kept her at arms length, too. ...Until the Troll Incident. If that never happened, I can safely say Hermione wouldn't have been friends with Harry or Ron.

******** Oh I agree, Hermione is overdone, but my main thing was pointing out that Daphne is also pretty overdone as well.

But yeah, it's rather annoying that pretty much every story has Harry and Hermione become friends no matter what. (Even though I like Hermione).

********* As I said, I just used her as an example, and personally I do like the concept of Daphne: Just that the Ice Queen stereotype that's become boilerplate is completely overdone.

********** Yeah, I don't mind the ice queen stereotype, but I like some different stuff when it comes to Daphne, since ice queen is pretty much the main thing with her.

** In the end, both Daphne and Harry go their own way, never dating, but living with the regret of "the one that got away". Harry goes on the Horcrux hunt and then, when he comes back to Hogwarts, he is in love with Ginny. Daphne, out of spite, stays and fights on the Death Eaters' side. Eventually she survives and gets sent to Azkaban for life and her only visitors are Harry and Astoria.

Eventually Harry and Astoria develop a bond and end up cheating on their respective partners.

** Plot twist: They're not romantically inclined, just good friends, and they have a secret agreement with the Weasleys who run the betting pool and make tons of money. Or in one word, they're Slytherins.
