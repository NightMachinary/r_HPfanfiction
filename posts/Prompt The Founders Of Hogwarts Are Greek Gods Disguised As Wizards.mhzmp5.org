Examples could be Athena for Ravenclaw, Hades for Slytherin, Zeus for Gryffindor, and Demeter for Hufflepuff.

EDIT Some people are kinda pissed off right now, so I just wanna say that these comparisons don't need to be perfect, because that's unrealistic. The ones I listed are just some of the larger gods I thought of off the top of my head.


** Zeus wouldn't be Gryffindor. He'd be Slytherin caused he'd try to Slither into female chambers.

I'm so sorry for the pun

*** Not exactly untrue, though: most of the Greek gods were rape-happy.

I mean, Apollo basically chased down a woman he liked, and she only "escaped" by turning into a tree (legend of Daphne).

There's actually a twisted one-shot on FFn somewhere about this: basically, Apollo shows up when Daphne Greengrass is 17, threatens to burn her family to a crisp and make them suffer eternal agony unless she goes with him, and it's implied she ends up basically being his possession/rape-slave... because her name is Daphne, and she's blonde. That's all.

Worst still, it was in-character for the mythological Apollo to pull that shit.

Then there was Zeus, who like raping women in the form of a swan.

***** Yeah, the Greeks were disturbing like that.

It's fascinating to look at how they evolved, too: Artemis was originally a mountain spring deity from North Greece, and Aphrodite was actually a form of Ishtar, from the Fertile Crescent, that island hopped during/after the Bronze Age Collapse.

This sort of logic is why I'm an atheist: every religion, even the modern ones, can be traced back to being the mutant, bastardized offspring of another.

If there is a god of some type, it's nothing like how organized religion portrays it as: it'd probably be some Eldritch Abomination, like the depictions of angels in the Old Testament, that'd make our brains dribble out of our asses on being around them, or something, haha.

****** To be fair, you're looking at one very specific branch in a localized area. The Hindu or Japanese gods for example, tend to break off this model. Now, there is a theory for an ancient Proto-Indo-European mythology, but as with all things ancient and religious, it's hard to definitively prove

******* Honestly, given that it seems to be partially derived from a pattern from mankind's psyche/psychology, I daresay other pantheons in other areas of the world follow the same model of coming from another pantheon.

At its distant root, I believe European religions came from one source or another, be it basic sun worship or believing in nature, and it sort of snowballed from there.

********* I think it's a little bit of both: due to how a human's mind operates, no matter where they are in the world, people had the same parallel thoughts -- that something "higher" must be directing various natural functions and the like, as well as there being some sort of afterlife because of the fear of death - but initial individual cultures expressed them differently.

Over time, however, as both new civilizations and cultures emerged from other or older ones or as these religions/beliefs spread, they were reshaped over time to suit new groups' culture.

An example of this is European folklore, surprisingly enough: supernatural beings like nymphs and faeries have a shared creative ancestry, but as they spread west and south, the Greeks, Slavs, and German cultures/tribes had them all change over time in their own beliefs/cultures.

Another, smaller example is in Asia, where the kistune is seen is a malicious man-eater in some cultures ("Livers, yum!") but just a chaotic neutral prankster in others (with no taste for eating people).

Irish mythology, IIRC, is heavily influenced by pre-Arabic Iberian Peninsula invasions, too (but I don't know much about it, to be honest).

Yahweh, the Jewish god, was originally one god of many in the Canaanite pantheon: however, one religion/racial group made him their central god, and eventually elevated him above the others until finally they became monotheistic.

Proto-Christianity was spawned from Judaism and a little bit of the Roman pantheon (which came from Greece, which in turn itself was an offspring blend of native beliefs and Fertile Crescent religions' spread), and from Proto-Christianity came things like Catholicism and Protestantism, and the hundreds of other splinter Christian sects, such as the Orthodox Church -- the three giants also had Pagan and native rituals and holidays adopted into them, as they were part of the cultures they settled into (Halloween/All Hallow's Eve, Christmas/Winter Solstice, et cetera -- heck, even the names of the days of the week, like Saturday (Saturn's Day) were adopted.

When Roman religion began to spread in the UK, the UK natives began to blend it with pre-existing Celtic gods and goddesses (which originally came from pre-Roman Europe and Scandinavia), such as giving them different appearances and suffixes/prefixes/altered names; the Egyptians and Greeks did this too with various deities -- cult centers dedicated to various gods and goddesses, as "aspects", were found all over Egypt and Greece.

Islam? Another spawn from Judaism that integrated Arabic culture, traditions, and mythology/superstitions.

So, yeah. Looking at the histories of religions is fascinating stuff, but it just reinforces my own personal belief of atheism.

If there is some sort of Eldritch-like deity and it reveals itself to be the real deal, then yeah, I'd probably be signing up to their cult, heh, but, otherwise? shrug

...Also, did not expect to have a fascinating conversation about real-life religions in a HP FF thread of all things, haha.

** I think this is harder than it looks. Most people are going to be really judgey on the ancient gods bc based on modern ideology they were mostly horrible people. Ancient societies were filled with and in many cases built on a patriarchy that viewed women as chattel. Even as citizens women rarely had rights. You see many of those views reflected in their deities. I mean how many women did Hera destroy for carrying Zues's children? Usually not of their own volition. I can't recall I single time where she held him accountable. So we have sexism, rape, victim shaming... Well it's a long list. However that's the world that they lived in.

That said if the Greek deities modernized as society did you wouldn't find it so awful. Though in most of the societies that were on and around what we call the british isles were also patriarchal and sexist. Hell is centuries later now and we're still dealing with it.

Also as a side note the celtic and nordic people who populated what is now scotland had a very different cultures and mores.

Anyway super interesting topic. Who chose to build a school of magic in Scotland would depend on how they got there (probably the romans?). I think Athena as the goddess of knowledge seems a shoe in for RAVENCLAW. Though she doesn't have an element. Ravenclaw would've been air. I think zephyr was a god of wind (north wind maybe?). We could also include lightning based on gaming knowledge. So Zeus is an option.

HUFFLEPUFF is earth so of course there is Gaia. Demeter is the goddess of agriculture essentially and the seasons (plus her son in law is death!) Hardworking and loyal? Hephaestus is a pretty good option even though he's fire. He works twice as hard as any other god.

SLYTHERIN is water. There are a ton of water options. Of the Olympians Poseidon would be the most prominent. Slytherin would appreciate his prestige. Cunning is a bit harder to define with this lot. A quick Google search showed me Dolos, god of treachery, cunning, guile, craftiness, and trickery. Also Metis was a goddess of wisdom and cunning. These last two are titans technically. I'm not sure what happened to them with the rise of the olympians. I want to say Zeus ate her and then he birthed Athena from his brow.

GRYFFINDOR is fire. Apollo is god of the sun which could count as fire. I mean it burns afterall. He's also a fantastic archer which works with the founders martial bent. Hestia is pretty tame as the goddess of the hearth and home. There's also the titan Helios (literally the sun). Courage is easier to see in greek heroes. Though I suppose Heracles did achieve his godhood eventually. Another Google showed Arete the goddess of courage. Wikipedia hints that sometimes Arete is seen as a god. Or perhaps that's her roman equivalent.

***** Percy Jackson's depictions are very much toned down from their characterizations in Greek mythology. They aren't the same.

The Greek and Roman gods/goddesses from myth were even more of dicks/bitches than the negative traits sprinkled in Rick's characters, and in many cases their histories are vastly different.

Now, if the OP meant a PJ crossover, then yeah, but that wasn't in the OP's post, so I presume he meant actual Greek/Roman mythology.

In that case, Hestia would be the better Hufflepuff. Artemis would end up turning most men into swine or other animals to hunt, while the more sassy girls/women would end up either killed, press-ganged into her Hunt/service, or be cursed if they slighted her in their eyes.

Then again, most of the time a woman was punished by Artemis, it's because she did something Darwin Award worthy, like grab her tits and then boast her own were better. Yeah, not exactly a good thing to do.

****** Actually the difference is exactly what I wanted to point out.

But from what I searched Artemis didn't really have a full on hunt like in the stories, but rather a bunch of hounds that went with her and occasional companions such as Orion.

Then again, that maybe makes her even less fitting, especially considering I forgot all her cruelty.

Honestly I just wanted to have all four founders being both children of Zeus and fitting in their jobs. Which is why I didn't choose Hestia for Hufflepuff, albeit I honestly can't think of who will fit for Slytherin as Hades isn't as cunning or ambitious but rather grumbly and honestly Rick Riordan a fairly accurate depiction

He was also surprisingly very fair, even when his brothers acted like complete and utter cunts.

Apollo, who noticed his disadvantage made one of his children get a false prophecie.

** Ehhhhhh, it's a somewhat interesting idea but barring Rowena the other comparisons seem off to me. I think a far closer analogue to Gryffindor would be Ares, always the first to charge in and reckless. Hufflepuff would without question be Hestia, loyalty and family always. Slytherin is harder to place without getting into fanon characterizations of him but I think placing him as Hades is something of a stretch beyond the “dark” connection.
