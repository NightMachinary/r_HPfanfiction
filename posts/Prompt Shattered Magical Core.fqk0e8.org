During Harry's childhood, the Dursleys attempts to "Stamp the Magic out of Him" seemed to work in a way. The strain of constantly healing his injuries and protecting him caused his magical core to fracture, leaving him essentially a Squib. But he's not powerless, not at all. Instead of using a reservoir of magic in his body that refills, Harry now has the ability to absorb magic from his surroundings to fuel his spells, similar to a D&D Sorcerer.

This causes a few disturbing effects to happen when he uses his magic. Plants die, the air grows cold, ice spreads out along the ground from where he stands, and anyone standing too close can feel their own cores get siphoned off to fuel Harry's spells, leading to many to avoid him and shun him for his unnatural ways


** I would 100% read a KOTOR 2 ripoff of this where some old wizard or witch, disillusioned with the magical world, takes Harry under their wing to try and kill off all magic in the world
