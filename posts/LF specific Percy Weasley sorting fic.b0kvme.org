I want to say it was on FFN and it was basically just a really short, well written one shot of the conversation Percy had with the sorting hat. It stood out from the other fics because it emphasised all the reasons Percy should have been a Slytherin and his resigned sadness as he eventually steps down to the Gryffindor table with his family.
