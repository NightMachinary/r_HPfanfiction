** Personally, I like blood magic because it's interesting and pretty much entirely fanon, so people can go in entirely different directions

But the limits, I think should be that it's more big rituals or stuff with larger magical implications, like instead of using blood to make something levitate, instead you should be using blood to create portals and such, or communicate with the dead, or make a child biologically yours without having conceived them, something that's larger and that you're not really able to do with normal magic.

I also feel like if it's a ritual for intentions, it shouldn't react right away. Like, if it's a ritual to give yourself everlasting good luck, it should start small and then slowly get bigger, you know, building up.

** I consider Ritual and Blood Magic as canon because, in my opinion, both Voldemort resurection and Lily protection were a kind of both, which means that they are already part of the magic system.

But even if they exist, people almost exclusively use wands for a reason and rituals/ blood magic should either be significantly weaker than wand magic, or only useful in some /very/ specific situation. Which is why people generaly don't bother anymore, not to mention a lot of rituals would use "sacrifice", which are kinda banned by the Ministry (if not the ICW), the trade off sacrifice/ benefice is also rarely worth it.

As an example, someone may be able to create a source of water, but the ritual takes around 10h and necessite to burn several materials, which makes it kinda useless when /Aguamenti/ exist. Another wizards could also raise his physical strenght using a Norse ritual, but it would take a month, necessite a loooooot of ingredients plus the sacrifice of a beast. But any error during the ritual would kill the wizard, he would also take some mental characteristic of the beast making him more savage (a berserk), and the physical increase is kinda negligible (like +10%), for a ritual than can only be done once.

So yeah, I have nothing against rituals, I even like them a little but it's a bit boring in a fanfic when Harry just have to draw a circle on the floor and say 3 sentences in Gaelic to "multiply by 2 his magical core". I prefer when they are generaly a chore and only useful into a very specific situation where the average wizard would never find himself in. I really like the fanon explanation how what Lily used during Halloween was a ritual, where she sacrificied her life (and maybe James' too) to protect Harry againt one thing : Voldemort.

*** I like some of what you say here but I definitely think ritual magic can be stronger than their wanded counterparts. Obviously everyday magic would be stupid slow with ritual magic (can you imagine molly weasley cleaning with ritual magic?! Lol ). Some rituals would benefit from the use of a wand, while others... Actually I lost my train of thought. Lol TL:DR rituals are a fantastic way to add magic to the hp world. Also I agree it was Lily who is the savior. Oh and I'm thinking the ministry either bans or at least derides rituals as dark magic bc you can't track it like you can a wand.

** I personally /love/ rituals, but only as long as they focus on the cost of it as well. Even non-dark rituals. In my current WiP, all wizards age extremely slowly, with the most powerful ones aging even slower, and Dumbledore pretty much cut his lifespan 90% to bind with a phoenix so he could defeat Grindelwald.

However, I feel like freely using them makes a character boringly OP unless they're up against similar opponents (the Black Queen series by Silently watches comes to mind, Jennifer and Dumbledore combined can't stand up to Voldemort, and her ritual worship fits in very nicely with the plot). My story's Harry will never use them because he's aware that he's nowhere near smart enough to not get fucked by them.

I generally feel like to have rituals you have to have some form of magical deities, and their potential power directly linked to said deities, which have their own restrictions. So for instance, a ritual to death could piece Voldemort back together or raise a whole graveyard of undead, but it couldn't bring back the dead.

It's something that fanfic authors tend to forget often - unless it's the main focus of a story, unlimited power is only interesting for about two chapters. And rituals are one of the things where authors tend to forget this, simply using them as a metaphorical rock falling from the ceiling to crush Harry's problems.

** My thoughts on ritual magic:

1. It can do things that ordinary spells can't, especially from a single caster.
2. It's difficult and complex - you might end up reciting minutes-long incantations, and even one flubbed syllable could break the whole thing.
3. It's risky - there's a lot of power involved, and if you screw up that power still has to go /somewhere./
4. It comes with a price, whether in the form of symbolic offerings or actual sacrifice.
5. The cost and complexity of the ritual can be used to offset each other - the more you're willing to sacrifice, the simpler the ritual becomes. Conversely, a particularly skillful ritualist can get away at minimal cost, because they're effectively sacrificing the time, effort, and risk required to pull off something so complex.

   1. Voldemort's resurrection ritual was kept simple by heavy-duty sacrifice: Pettigrew maimed himself, plus took Harry's blood; Voldebaby got dropped in a scalding-hot cauldron; the potion in the cauldron was probably made using evil like human sacrifice or rendering a unicorn down into a liquid (yes, I'm taking that from a fic, A Marauder's Plan IIRC).

** I like them quite a lot - I think they add a lot of potential/depth to the world, and should certainly be a part of the magic system (they are in canon), though not necessarily explored in great detail.

In terms of how they operate, I tend to view them as distinct from wand magic - perhaps predating it on the whole. But where the idea is that it's using magic in different, more complicated ways - where there's potentially a lot more potency than the wand magic generally taught at Hogwarts (eg - Voldemort making himself an entirely new body), but also a lot more inflexible (the specific requirements to make said new body, and a ritual like that presumably needing specific changes if doing, say, a body for an animal or a clone or the like, whereas a wand spell would be more flexible).

There's a lot of methods to make them work - one that I particularly enjoyed was in linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings), which uses a mix of runes, blood magic, and rituals for its main focus (basically, rituals done under the sun/moon at specific times that include carving runes with blood magic on the user, with a lot of it being around intent). It's interesting - powerful, but also with extremely obvious dangers and shows why it's considered dark/why most people would stick to wands.

Not all rituals and blood magic need to be powerful/huge things, either - by predating wand magic, perhaps there'd be a lot of inconsequential rituals that people still do from time to time, or that are still in the books. Like instead of being able to unlock a door with a simple spell, there'd be a ritual that takes some circuitous route to doing the same thing - or instead of the patronus, maybe there was some earlier, less convenient way of driving dementors off. It's similar to the potential of runes as a system (which I view as working best when having a lot of those same constraints).

In general though, I think authors should not make them super powerful and with no drawback - wand magic is the core of Harry Potter magic, and any other type being used should have some consideration given to why it isn't the default kind.

** I personally find them very interesting and love reading about them in fics.

The general understanding I have of rituals is they need blood of course and any sort of blood magic (or majority of blood magic) is Dark magic which is why they aren't taught in school and I think the only person we know who used a blood magic ritual in canon was Voldemort. He wasn't the one to actually perform his resurrection but the fact that we see no one else ever performing rituals in canon, I'm lead to believe it's either really difficult to do or super risky (which makes sense why Voldemort would do it, he loves to perform complex magic that is not recommended to attempt).

Another thing I noticed about rituals is they're always performed on special grounds. Voldemort's resurrection was performed in a graveyard, I read a fic where it was done in the Death Chamber at the Ministry. Most that i've read in fics they are done on earth either deep below ground or in a forest clearing, so I'm assuming the earth element is either a requirement or increase your chances of success. So I guess some area heavy with the presence of death is ideal for resurrection but otherwise the earth element is also a good source?

Sorry for the rambling I just dumped all my observations about rituals and barely answered any questions you had 😭

** In linkffn(Double Time) blood magic is described by future Hermione as a very grey area, which is looked down upon because of its /potential/ dark use. In a later chapter, blood magic is put into a good light when it's used to cleanse the Locket of the Horcrux (using 30 millilitres of virgin blood, iirc)

I really liked this interpretation. It makes great sense imo

** Personally I feel rituals should always pay little bit of homage to pagan rituals, and blood magic should toe the line between horrific backlash if done wrong and always has a price ,do not preform the magic unless you are willing to pay the toll. I also feel ritualistic magic and blood magic are not everyday Magics they should be portrayed as what, they were thought of back in the day. Magic that is to be feared and respected and not used for trivial things.

** There has to be a real reason why it's not used by everyone. In my headcanon 95% of ancient rituals have a modern spell equivalent that's just as good if not better and way more convenient. Basically it's easier to flick your wand than to dance in a circle for ten minutes. The few legal use cases for rituals are mostly very specific things that aren't needed often enough to be worth the effort of developing a spell.

The rituals that do have powerful effects have to be very costly in terms of sacrifice and everything with living sacrifice would be very illegal.

Dark magic refers to several things that are illegal, have negative effects for the user, are only usable for evil purposes, and/or combinations thereof. Many powerful spells need certain emotions like the Patronus requiring happiness. The spells needing anger are the easiest to master because it's easy to be angry and they yield powerful destructive effects. Most don't even magically corrupt the user, just the pavlovian conditioning of connecting being angry with success is enough to wreak havoc on the users mental health.

** Like is the general consensus ritual magic in the hp universe is awesome. I'd love to see more non blood related though. Like hangovers from a pre roman/pre christian era. Like it always makes me sad that there is no samhain celebrations/rituals that honor the dead. There are lots of inspirations. Course this leads me to a frustrating pack of wizarding culture. Boo. Anyway. Rituals are awesome.

** I quite like it.

I think there's few limits to what it's possible to achieve with it, but conversely, the more the ritual do, the harder it is to do it or the more it takes from you.

Lily's ritual imprinted her protection on Harry's blood and it required her willing life to work. It protected him from an unstoppable curse. Voldemort, on the other hand, was semi-alive and "only" needed a body, so a life wasn't needed in exchange. Yet, he needed bones from a dead man HE had killed, a maimed hand and blood from his enemy.

I also believe it shouldn't be used lightly. The character doing it needs to be magically strong, mentally strong and smart. I don't see it as dark magic necessarily, but just like the unforgivables, intent in required for it to work and the stronger the wizard, the stronger the ritual. They should be magically strong because it's ancient magic, wands won't be used, and mentally because it will probably take a long time in preparation, require attention to the smallest detail.

One more reason why I don't think it should be used lightly is because it will probably require a sacrifice of some sort, which is probably illegal, so I'd say it's a greater need kinda thing.

Again, there's already a ritual to create zombie like creatures, to anchor your soul, to make someone semi-invulnerable, to bring back to life... I think these pretty much show how there are few limits to it. But i also don't think they'd be able to make someone more powerful, or more skillful, it wouldn't conjur an army, or erase someone's existence. It works with things it can be connected to: a corpse for an inferi, an object/being for an horcrux, a body to the homunculus, a protection to a child, a house for wards, blood for protection, someone's magic/life for a promise...

And lastly, authors just make it more interesting, expand the possibilities. It's already cannon and part of the magic system of Harry Potter. So yeah, I'm all for it.

As for blood magic, there's an argument for it. The concept of blood having power is not new to fantasy or even mythology. Pretty sure a voodoo /fetish/ with the blood of the person your making it of will stronger than if it's just the /fetish/.

I think it's limitations should be like that. Offensibly to directly affectva person. Keying things to an individuals blood is not a nee idea, but is probably fine, though a ward blood-keyed might be immediately dangerous to *anything* not of that blood. (Rip stray kittys). Tracking. Blood trackers are also not new in "fanon". I could see blood as a fuel for runes as blood would contain magic used to power/charge runes. I don't think it makes sense for blood to power up normal spells. Though it could be a component of a spell. Think the Blood Gorger from "Wind Sheer" by Chilord. It was a spell that targeted blood, drained the victim of their blood and the used that blood to "reach" more victims.

In the end though, fanfiction is a realm of infinite possibilities where the limits are only defined by yourself. If you think it makes sense and can justify it, go for it. "Fanon" is a bs word that shouldn't exist. You do you, and people will either hate or enjoy your work.
