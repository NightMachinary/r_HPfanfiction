I got the idea when re-reading control, haha. Looking for a fic where Harry basically enslaves creatures and forces them to work for him, maybe even having them fight for him.

Over 70k+ words.

** It was said not to long ago that linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) can fit into any request, and it really can.

Throughout the story, Harrymort uses Dobby as a slave, making him steal from the Malfoys (generally food and the like). For a closer fit to the request, in Chapter 6, HP vs Alastor Moody (Pt 1), Harrymort starts a production line of house elves to put his name in the Goblet of Fire an absurd amount of times.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** not at all what you're looking for, but linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff BajaB)(or maybe it was one of the sequels) has a bunch of House-Elves that throw themselves at Harry to work for him. Not a major point, but it's noted a few times. And Hermione doesn't like it, surprising no-one.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
