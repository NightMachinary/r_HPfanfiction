My ranking of Badass Hermione:

1) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]]: brilliant, brutal, powerful, and ruthless, this Hermione generally makes the right political and strategic moves.

2) [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: she seriously outplayed Riddle, and piled up a huge body count. The world should be grateful that she fell in love with the easygoing Ron Wellesley. (Harry was also an extremely dangerous person in this fic)

3) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]]: she had great success early as a guerrilla leader, but Harry shined in the second half.

4) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]]: horribly traumatized, this Hermione became a somewhat unhinged, but very powerful warrior.

5) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]]: she's adorably dark here.

*** Don't forget the spinoff where she's a dermatologist and starts a beauty product line out of Hogwarts.

** I recently started [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8xgz0i/hermione_being_feared/][a thread for fics where Hermione is feared]]. Almost all fics recommended there also feature her being a badass.

*** I started reading the fic, and it reads like one of those where plot exists to set up porn. (Specifically, it is revealed that magical children who remain virgins until they turn 17 get a power-up, but only after they have sex for the first time, and the person they lose their virginity to also gets a power-up. Apparently, the nature of magical adolescence in this AU is such that very few manage.)

Is there more to this fic than that?

**** I don't actually recall that much explicit sex, though there is some. I liked the story for its a) length, b) higher quality writing, and c) lots of little sub-plots that are all Hermione centric. She is definitely overpowered and brilliant and does some amazing/astonishing things.

***** Thanks. I'll give it a try. The story isn't too preoccupied with the question of who will the lucky guy/gal to get the deflowering power-up be, is it?

****** There's a bit of "the one I love will never love me so I'll just be celibate forever" in maybe the first half...but I feel like there's enough other stuff going on to keep it interesting. It will be immediately obvious who the lucky guy/gal is anyway.
