*** That is a great fic. Here are a couple more along the same line of Harry raised by Sirius.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3673549/1/The-name-is-Potter-Black][The name is Potter Black!]] Sequel to “First Day of class” where Sirius was never arrested and was able to adopt Harry at the age of 21 months and starts teaching at Hogwarts. How would things go differently with a Hogwarts raised Harry. No need to read First Class first.

Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story.

** Not it, but looks like a good read! The one im looking for has Sirius in love with a south American woman, I believe harry does some form of martial arts. I remember they may have spent some time in the US also.

*** I'm not sure if this is a reply to the comment about the story being The Wise One, because that seems to be it. Harry is raised by Sirius, they travel, Sirius falls in love with Catalina and Miguel teaches Harry martial arts
