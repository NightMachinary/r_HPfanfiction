Fics where the basilisk is sentient and will speak to Harry. Being an incredibly ancient and deadly creature that seemingly only two people living (disregarding possession) can speak two it boggles the mind where it's continually treated as a relatively simple obstacle rather than a possible resource.

It also always made sense to me in that Salazar would put his knowledge into something only his heirs with the fortitude to command a basilisk could learn from. Seeing as their is no mention of a written form of parseltounge.

A nearly immortal extremely dangerous snake sounds so much more secure then writing things down or placed in painting that would degrade with age. Especially if such paintings existed back then seeing how most portraiture was definitely much simpler in the muggle world.


** linkffn(Antithesis) has the basilisk as a major force behind some of the plot. The whole story does magic creatures really well.

linkffn(Basilisk-Born) also has the basilisk as a character, though not really in the way you're thinking.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

The Basilisk in this one is... Actually pretty nice. It teaches dragons how to speak Parseltongue, and reads novels with Harry via a blacked-out communication mirror.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

*** Very fair about not being able to turn it off. But Tom directed it multiple times to attack but not kill students in the 50s and again in the nineties indicating it's not unreasonable to interact with it. What's more is he would have to figure out it was a basilisk in the first place without it killing him.

Secondly for as much of a dick Salazar supposedly was his main ambition was the creation of a school. The man clearly felt like teaching people. Shitting on his own life's work because of a disagreement on politics with his cofounders is just as unreasonable an idea. It having an actual purpose and it being perverted by Tom would go along with all the other instances.

It's also only been opened twice supposedly and both by Tom. It's actual purpose could very well have been tossed out by him.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

Because if what you want is a basilisk that knows all the important stuff, you could do worse than A Brother To Basilisks. It basically ticks all your boxes except it's not exactly the basilisk from second year.
