  Harriet Potter knew she shouldn't have picked those three Hallows... but she did, and now, she's immortal, and the gods have a proposition for her : help the heroes of other universe to save her mother's soul. And to help her, they'll give her a tool : the Gamer's Ability. First stop : the Mafia World. fem!Harry, MoD!Harry, gamer!Harry

  Prophecies where tricky things and lies are even tricker, Sirius's death becomes a catalyst and Dumbledore's lies crumple like a house of cards. Harry is left with a burning question...Who is he really? Crossover with Katekyo Hitman Reborn! Co-written with the lovely Araciel, who got me back into writing, go read her work, all of it is amazing!

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

*** Seems interesting but wow does this have a lot of tropes and fanon elements. And it would be better with half as many words used to cover the same events imo. Will probably continue reading though.
