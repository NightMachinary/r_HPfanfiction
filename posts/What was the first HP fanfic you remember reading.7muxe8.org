**** It's what started my love of time travel fix-it fics, though I've since pretty much broadened out into general AUs (and also predominantly Hermione-centric fics, at least in the past year).

****** Hmn, let's see. I haven't read all that many recently, so let's see if I remember all the ones I have enjoyed. I know for a fact I've read more than this, but I'm really bad about bookmarking ones I've liked. I'd be much better at recommending more general AUs than time travel fics at this point.

Linkffn(Backwards With Purpose by Deadwoodpecker) was one I enjoyed when I read it. Can't remember anything about it because it didn't really stick with me, but it was a good read. This one is actually finished as well.

Linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches) is one I'm currently reading, though it has the whole harem Harry thing that I don't usually like. The worldbuilding is enough to keep me going with this one.

Linkffn(Again and Again by Athey) is good, if you don't mind HP/LV shipping (though for once, it's done in a way that makes sense). Again, solid worldbuilding.

If you don't mind Naruto fics, Linkffn(Legacy Undone by LD 1449) is probably the best Naruto time-travel fic I've read, because it doesn't hit exact stations of canon and isn't another freaking Chuunin Exam Groundhog Day fic.

******* I read BWP way back and enjoyed it, but couldn't get back into it when I tried again :\ Might need to give it another shot.

I've tried DPSW several times and just can't get into it. I still can't articulate why though. I think I need to just sit down and read through at least 10 chapters or so before putting it down.

I haven't read Again and Again yet, so I'll have to check it out!

I'll check out Legacy Undone, but I'm a bad Naruto reader, because I barely watched past the Chuunin exams in canon, so I really don't mind fics that are heavy on the exams :P

******** Fair enough on all those points. BWP was one I read once and never felt the desire to read again.

DPSW is only interesting to me for the politics reasons, in all honesty, but that's because I'm a sucker for terrible wizard politics.

Legacy Undone is a pretty heavily AU story, so it only really requires basic knowledge of the original plot (like, you could get most of it off a glance at wikipedia probably).

Also, I forgot to link linkffn(Oh God Not Again!), since that's the best crack time travel fic.

I'm also now skimming through my browser history. There was a decent fic where Hermione is sent back in time and becomes James's twin sister. linkffn(Roundabout Destiny by MaryRoyale) That had been an interesting premise, and the writing was good enough. A couple character choices I wasn't happy with (I hate most nicknames for Hermione that fanfics tend to use), but overall a good fic.

** linkffn(Centrifugal Force by Melindaleo)

I read it in freshman year of high school (roughly 2004) and I'm pretty sure that I found it on mugglenet, but I'm not sure whether they had a link to the ffn page or if it was in mugglenet's fanficion section. I loved the fic so much that I printed it out and gave the pages to a girl in my Enlish class, even though the only thing that I knew about her was that she had read the Harry Potter books.

** Ugh I had to look up the title but, as embarrassed as I am to say, it was "The Greatest Scandal in Hogwarts History" the big clusterf*** where Harry gets Ginny pregnant at Hogwarts and it becomes this epic journey with unconditional support from all the professors, parents and other adults who are 110% on-board with teenage pregnancy for some crazy reason. I can't believe I'm still a fan of H/G and Ginny overall today, after subjecting myself to trollop like this, and worse convincing myself I liked it.

In my defense it was first posted back in 2001. Canon was only up to Book 4, which had been released the summer before, and the first movie premiered right after the fic had started to be posted. I shared an old desktop with my entire family and our rural area still only had 24k dialup. It could take a good 30 minutes just to get online and upload the newest chapter. There wasn't much in the world of HP fan fic, the fandom had yet to really develop. I was also still in middle school and still wrote SI fics of my own, so my taste left something to be desired.

I almost don't want to link it but here it is:
