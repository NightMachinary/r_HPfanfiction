Voldemort dropped one of his horcruxes inside Mount. Ebbot. Harry and friends need to go through the underground and survive.

** Imagine Dumbledore tracks one to the underground and goes to find it with Harry before the locket debacle. Then they get fucking trapped for like a week. Voldemort is halfway to taking over completely. Hogwarts is being defended tenuously by the staff. Suddenly the monsters of old are back and with them a small child who can control time. What the hell do you do with this if you're Voldemort. There are now two prophecy children here to kick his ass. I would fucking surrender. (Maybe Voldie's super secret caveâ„¢ got flooded and the locked was washed Underground. Idk.)
