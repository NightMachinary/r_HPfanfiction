** Interesting idea, but that'd bring to question, why Harry didn't see the Thestrals, when he was in second year, since he saw his parents, or at least, his mother, die?

I know it's a prompt, and it's a interesting one, but just a thought, that I had.

Mhm... maybe because the ScarHorcrux blocked out the memory, or something? idk.

*** JKR said that Harry's Mum death doesn't count, because he was too young to understand what really happened at the time. You must mentally process the death event as such.

**** When did she say this? Once she starts with the Pottermore stuff, I'm incredibly iffy on, if she said this, as she was writing the books, in an interview, that'd be something I'd be okay with.

So Colin, would have to be at that age, where he could mentally understand it, but doesn't remember, who he saw die.

******* She said it because people were questioning how Harry didn't see the Thestrals on his way to the train GoF so it was mostly to close a plothole.

*** I read a fic once (can't recall the title or author, sadly) in which it's standard practice for the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad to Obliviate everyone involved in an incident, including Muggleborn children and their families. Repeated memory erasure has long-term effects on someone, especially during their formative years: Colin photographs everything because some part of him feels the need to store memories somewhere less vulnerable than his head. Hermione obsessively hoards knowledge, forever trying and failing to find whatever it is that she /knows/ she should know but doesn't.

** When an excited Dennis plead to his big brother that show him some magic stuff, Colin levitated him, but get distracted and let him fall and broke his neck.

Terrified, accidentally banished his body.

(Colin recall perfectly, but is lying everybody)

EDITED: I decided that was too sad. I prefer that Colin and Dennis killed someone together.
