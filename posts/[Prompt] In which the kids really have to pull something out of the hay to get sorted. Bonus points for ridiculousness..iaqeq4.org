*Hat - - Sorry for the typo in the title, which I sadly can't edit.

Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house. Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly.

Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.

"When I call your name, you will come forward to pull something out of the hat to be sorted," she said.

"Abbott, Hannah!"

A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, walked towards the hat, put her hand into it, frowned, then reached deeper into the hat, somehow fitting her whole arm into it. There was a moments pause before she pulled out her arm to reveal a piece of parchment with the word "HUFFLEPUFF" written on it.

The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.

"So we've just got to pull pieces of parchment out of a hat!" Ron whispered to Harry. "I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll."

From a distance Harry heard Hermione Granger muttering, "That can't just be it; it seems too mundane."

Harry smiled weakly. Yes, drawing lots from the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but why did it seem like the rest of the school was watching this task with great anticipation?

"Bones, Susan!"

The young girl reached into the hat and pulled out... a fluffy ball? The Hufflepuff table cheered once more.

"That is a powder puff Ms. Bones. You now belong with Hufflepuff," explained Professor McGonagall, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.

** "Abbott Hannah !"

The girl put one hesitating hand into the hat and searched for about ten seconds before extracting something from the old cap, it was a small chubby brown-furred animal, not a rabbit, Harry realized, a badger. "HUFFLEPUFF" announced loudly Professor McGonagall.

The hufflepuff table cheered enthusiastically. The same scene repeated itself with "Bones Susan!" as the red-headed girl removed another badger from the hat, hers was a bit bigger, fur black striped with white and grays.

As more names were called students were sorted into the four different houses pulling from the hat different versions of badgers, birds, snakes and 'lions' well, of course, they weren't real lions but rather large exotic looking cats.

"Malfoy Draco!" was called and the pale boy that had introduced himself on the train stepped forward, he didn't even fully stick his hand into the hat that to his enormous satisfaction a light-colored slim serpent surged forward and started wrapping itself around his wrist, he grinned arrogantly as he made his way to the Slytherin table, the snake still wrapped fast around his hand.

"Granger Hermione!" the bossy girl with the frizzy hair reached into the hat and once she found what she was looking for her hand came out holding a fiery red cat with a rather ugly mug in Harry's opinion, but Hermione looked enthusiastic, as she neared the Gryffindor table he heard her whisper "I'm gonna call you Crookshanks" while petting the ugly fat cat.

"Longbottom Neville" the boy who kept losing his toad and Harry's friend "Weasley Ronald" both ended up in Gryffindor looking rather relieved when their hands came up with two large exotic cats.

Finally it was Harry's turn, as "Potter Harry!" was called murmurs invaded the silence of the great hall, Harry felt everyone's eyes on him as he neared the podium, he quickly got his hand inside the hat hoping not to come up empty-handed, but he should not have worried for as soon as he dropped his hand he felt something touching his fingers, he felt different things, at first something fluffy that felt like fur, then something sleek like a feather and even something hard that could have been a beak or a scale, slowly all those things retracted until Harry could only feel something scaly circling his fingers, "Grab me" it seemed to say, but Harry was now pretty sure what it was and he didn't want to. "Not Slytherin" he whispered "Please anything but Slytherin" Harry repeated and after what felt like a bite to his pinky finger, the snake retracted and in its place, Harry grabbed something fluffy and black-furred, a cat. "GRYFFINDOR" McGonagall exclaimed joyfully as Harry made his way to the table clad in red and gold.

(Afterwards they are told that they can chose to keep the animals and name them or free them into the forest where they will live with other of their species. Harry and Ron decide that their cats will be happier in the forest, same with Neville, as they already have familiars that they are rather attached with. Hermione instead keeps her cat and officially names him Crookshanks) .

** ‚ÄúHARRY POTTER!‚Äù

Upon hearing his name there was a ripple of whispers across the great hall, but Harry ignored them as he crawled into the haystack.

Again, he couldn't help but think that this was a rather silly way to sort children, how was he supposed to find anything in here amongst the hay. Not even moments after thinking that, he came across some slips of paper. After grabbing a slip, he made his way back out, wondering briefly if the haystack was somehow bigger inside than it looked when you were standing beside it.

Brushing some stray hay from his robes, he handed the slip to Professor McGonagall. She looked pleased as she announced, ‚ÄúGRYFFINDOR!‚Äù

Sorry, I had to lol

** Harry approached the hat with some trepidation. He gingerly reached in and clasped... something. He pulled. Slowly he pulled out a handkerchief. It was tied to another handkerchief, and another. The muggleborns started laughing and... WAS THAT HIS PANTS?!

Harry looked down and tried to peek into his trousers without being obvious about it, but things certainly felt a bit breezier than before.

He continued pulling, his face burning, and even the unflappable McGonagall appeared a bit baffled. None of the other sortings took this long. This was getting absurd.

He kept pulling. There was now a pile of handkerchiefs, pants, and knickers at his feet, and quite a few students shifting uncomfortably at the tables.

Finally, at the end of it was a handkerchief tied to an arm. It seemed to be stuck in the hat. Harry gave a sharp tug, and suddenly a very gaudily dressed man popped out of a hat that in no way should have been able to contain him, the bells on his jester's cap jingling as they swung wildly.

"PEEVES!" bellowed McGonagall.

The now named figure simply blew a raspberry at the professor.
