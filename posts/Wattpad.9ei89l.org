I'm yet to see a well written fic on there, the writing quality there is actually /gross/.


** They're written by hormonal teenage girls. I'd say they put their first fics there, and then move on to AO3 and FF.net when their technique improves. If there is a site out there that's dominated by teenage guys, it's probably just as bad.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say I don't think there are too many teenage boys who write fanfiction. There could be an exception to the rule, but all the male fanfic writers I know didn't get started until they were in college.

**** Oh I know that. Not about the ages of male writers but the numbers of them. That's actually really interesting. Were they reading fics long before they started writing? I've been reading for years, but never worked up the energy to actually start writing myself.

Anyways, say there is one mythical site actually out there. It's probably just smutty, harem pieces with OP male protagonist's and no plot. Throw in sub-par grammar and there ya go. Trying to think of others things but I'm blanking.

***** Nice to meet you, young sir! I do hope you weren't offended by my comment. Sadly, there's a lot of teen boys out there who don't get into reading, let alone writing, to the same extent that teen girls do (if at all). As a librarian, I've seen it firsthand. Glad to see someone such as yourself standing out from the crowd.

****** Yeah, I'm fairly unique as far as these things go. I've seen one, maybe two others who even write fanfiction, neither of which are a boy. Sadly fanfiction has a bit of a bad reputation that makes people not want to write it.

** I've been intrigued by a couple story ideas there, but can't get more than a few paragraphs in. I've given up on Wattpad. I read mostly on ffn, sometimes on ao3, used to do hpff before it went down, haven't been back on it since it was reinstated though.

** Irrestistable Poison (i'm fairly sure that was the name) is pretty good. Its a drarry fic, lots of very poetic, flowery descriptions though so don't bother if you don't like that kind of stuff.

** I agree. The layout of the mobile app is great, easy to use and beautiful to read on, but the quality of work there is questionable at best. That said, check out SilverAconite's â€˜Bound'. It started on Wattpad and is now also on AO3. Pairs Hermione Granger with Lucius Malfoy and Severus Snape, but is more than just smut and shite. I can link if you'd like, but I just don't feel like going over to the app and then back here..
