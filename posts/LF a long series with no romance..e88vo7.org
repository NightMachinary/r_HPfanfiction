I love the wizarding world and would like a long fic or series in which i can immerse myself. Kinda bored with being forced to sit through a romance in every fic i read though, if any one can find me a fic or series meeting these requirements then I would greatly appreciate it! (newer fics/series are probably better due to me being a long time reader)

Thanks guys :)


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

Great read. 100 some chapters and no romance. Yet. The author did talk about thinking of adding some in but that's nowhere in the near future.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]])

So this is super long. It's been a bit since I've read it but iirc he hooks up with a few people but it never lasts very long and doesn't get much focus. There's hints of a future HHr or Harry/Luna pairing but it's abandoned before it gets there. There is over a million words of it though (about 20% more than canon) and quite a lot of cool worldbuilding/characterization/magic crafting.

There is also a sweet romance between Snape and an OC but again, it's not a big deal.

*** I am curious about this story. One thing im unsure about is the Nondark harry tag, yet mentor voldemort. How does that work? Do nondark just mean not evil in this case?

**** I'm not certain nondark is correct. Voldy is... more sympathetic than in canon but still extremely dark, and Harry mostly goes along with it. He has a lot of conscience despite this but he's at least a dark grey.
