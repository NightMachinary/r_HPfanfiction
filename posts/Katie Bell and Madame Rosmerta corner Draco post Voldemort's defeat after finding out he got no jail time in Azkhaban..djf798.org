Katie was cursed and nearly killed while Rosmerta was imperiused for nearly an entire school year. He also poisoned Ron. I can't imagine they'd be pleased to find out Draco got off with little to no punishment.


** This can be very well the canon. In addition:

- Ron and Slughorn cornered him about the poisoning plot.
- Ginny, Hermione, Dennis Creevey (In for his brother Colin), Justin Finch-Fletchley, and Penelope Clearwater cornered Lucius Malfoy for attempted mass murder.
- An unknown number of Lucius Malfoy's victims from the First War cornered him.
- Harry Potter cornered Lucius Malfoy (and Cornelius Fudge) for bribery, corruption, and slanders.

If there's some justice in postwar Wizarding Britain, the least the Malfoys have to suffer is to pay most of their wealth as reparations and punitive damages. Lucius Malfoy must NEVER again have the gold to bribe anyone!

*** Auror Harry Potter looked at his old teammate, Katie, who was staring at him with wide, innocent eyes.

"So.... you're saying that Draco Malfoy fell down a flight of stairs, despite this being the middle of a wheat field." he grumbled.

Took another look at Katie who was still giving him the doe-eyed look.

"Then he fell into a pond, filled with fire crabs... in the same field."

Katie could only nod.

"After that he was struck by lightning, every hair on his body was pulled out..." here Harry sighed and looked at Katie who still didn't break character "... after that a cow defecated on him and a horse somehow peed on him. Is that all that you witnessed?"

"Exactly that. It was quite the coincidence." Katie replied while nodding vigorously.

Harry looked at the poor sod, who was whimpering pitifully while being looked over by a healer from St. Mungo's. It was not a nice sight. He pinched the bridge of his nose and after a couple seconds looked at Katie.

"Listen, this needs to stop happening. This is the third time this month. I know you're still pissed at him for almost killing you, and at me for testifying in his defense. But please, for the love of Merlin, Katie, I can't keep covering this up... someone will eventually find out." here he looked at her pleadingly.

Katie, still not dropping her innocent look, turned away and said: "Sure, Harry."

She began to walk away.

One of the junior aurors walked up to Harry.

"What do we do with her, boss?"

"We let her go. It was obviously an accident. Malfoy never had much luck."

"Riiiiiight." the younger auror replied "Sooo... how long will we allow this to continue? It's not that I like the guy, but aren't we supposed to stop things like that?"

"I'll talk to her. Maybe she'll let go of her grudge... Maybe." said Harry in a resigned tone and disappeared from the idyllic wheat field with a loud crack,

Take a second to imagine the real life counterpart, Malfoy holding an innkeeper at gunpoint or otherwise coercing her (we have no mind control) into attacking one of her customers in order to rope her into an assassination plot.

*** Coercion is not a valid legal defense when it comes to crimes against life. Coercion only works if the thing you were threatened with was worse than what you did. "Steal that car or your parents die" would be fine, but "kill or your parents die" would not. Because that would, for example, excuse any war crime committed by the Third Reich as they all were being coerced (insubordination would mean execution).

**** I hate to say anything that could be construed as my defending Malfoy because he /really/ doesn't deserve it (I maintain that his emotional breakdown in book six is more cathartic than tragic), but that might not necessarily be the case in the wizarding world, or even just in wizarding Britain. We never get a clear picture of how their legal system works beyond "not well," so I'd totally believe that, between the the threat of him and his family being murdered and the fact that he was a minor, Malfoy wouldn't get much more than a slap on the wrist, if that.

And again, I'm /not/ defending him: he /should/ go to prison (and frankly, given that one of the people he was trying to protect was a willing and enthusiastic Death Eater who almost certainly murdered loads of people in the first war and very unambiguously tried to murder a bunch of children in the second, that excuse is pretty pathetic), but I'm not sure that the Ministry would necessarily agree with me on that one.

That is a dangerous myth. A small but noticeable minority of soldiers refused to obey criminal orders, and nothing happened to them. Christopher Browning discusses this in his book /Ordinary Men/. In one unit, the commanding officer said that anyone who did not want to participate did not have to, and several took up the offer. They hung around the town, watching people get marched to their deaths. Some of the soldiers agreed to take part but changed their minds, sneaking back. Nothing happened to them, either.

***** The penalties for insubordination got significantly worse as the war progressed. Early on, yes, you could sit out. Sometimes, even entire theatres refused (eg Rommel refusing to execute exile Germans who had been captured as PoWs in North Africa). Sometimes, there was no one who could carry out the sentence (eg the surrender of Paris). It obviously depended a lot on the commander, but insubordination was severly and often fatally punished.

The difference between killing Dumbledore and those things wasn't that he had a conscience get in the way, it's that he had to face a powerful wizard directly and knew there was a good chance he'd die if he really went for it.

*********** I advise you to read the books again. Draco was cruel, a bully, discriminatory and all around a terribly shitty human being.

But the whole difference between him and real death eaters like his father is that he can't commit to real murder, and just a month or so into year 6, he lost all his grandstanding and bragging when he realized how deep in he was l, how inescapable his situation.

Up until beginning of year 6, he loved the idea of being a death eater and seeing mud bloods dead. After a few months in voldemort's service that has changed entirely. From that point on, he just wants his parents back.

Both Ron and Katie were not purposeful targets of him, but as Dumbledore put it - desperate attempts to get to Dumbledore in order to save his parents. Rosmerta was under the imperious, but there's no proof she was tortured or raped. He had a weakened Dumbledore disarmed at wandpoint.

Hell, in deadly hallows he claims to be uncertain about recognizing Harry because he's just not comfortable with being to close to a murder, even if he despises the person.

He did bad things. He deserves punishment. I'm not an apologist. I despise Draco. But he certainly no lestrange. He doesn't do truly evil things just because he can. Partially because he's a coward, partially because he's just not up to the task.

************* Honestly, by the end of the series all I wanted for Draco was for him to be given another chance. For someone to pull him aside, tell him they knew he wanted out of Voldemort's army (he clearly did) and give him the means to be safe from Voldemort. I wasn't a fan of how the movies handled the books but I did....enjoy?...appreciate how they portrayed Draco from Half-Blood Prince on. He was simply nothing more than a tortured, desperate child who wanted away from Voldemort but didn't have the courage to die for it. All his life he was taught to honor and revere Voldemort, although having Lucius as a father probably added a certain mercenary selfishness to the mix. That's not something someone can break away from without a lot of bravery, and Draco didn't exactly have that in spades because he had nothing left to believe in.
