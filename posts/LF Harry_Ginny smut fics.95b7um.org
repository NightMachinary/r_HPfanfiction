it should be similar to "clause 13", so Ginny wants to have sex with Harry, but he is to occupied with Work (or some other things), so she thinks about ways to seduce him, even by magical possibilities.

Would be good, if its around or after the Epilogue.

** Immediately after the epilogue, or is 30 years later also okay?

**** Do you normally find that being rude is a good way to get people to help you? Personally, I find it best to not help rude people at all. Here's an example of me doing so by not telling you about any of the fics that meet your request.

***** i tried to soften my "rudeness". But, honestly, i wrote the "Epilogue" request in my Start post and said explicit "after the epilogue". So how can you not think i wouldnt be interested in fics that happen "immediately" or "30 years" after the Epilogue, when i already stated in the beginning "after" the Epilogue?! Would you please explain this to me? My "rudeness" comes by the fact, that the Gellert's question was so easy to be answered that i initially thought, it was a troll.

Again: AFTER The Epilogue means all Fics, that come after it. Credits of a Movie come AFTER a Movie, and not a couple of minutes after the last scene ended and the space is filled with a Blackscreen
