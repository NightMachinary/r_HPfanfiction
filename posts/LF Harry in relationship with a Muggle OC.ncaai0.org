Pretty much what it says in the title. Just read Behind Blue Eyes ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2095661/1/Behind-Blue-Eyes]]) and really enjoyed the concept of Harry finding someone outside of the Wizarding world.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]: This is a very different Harry Potter fanfic. James and Lily are alive here, there is no BWL, Harry never goes to Hogwarts, his wife is a Muggle, most of the story happens after 2008, and Voldemort is neither a snake face nor an Avada Kedavra addict

*** this story lore wise and magic wise is amazing however the author literally tries to justify wide scale genocide and very nazi like ideology which did read very weird
