** 1. I'm a bit more weirded out by your spelling of Alexandra.

2. There are reasons he took that fic down...

** There actually are kids who "date" at that age, that´s really uncommon, sex at that age is even more uncommon, but happens and I guess if you want to write about unhealthy relationships or uncommon sexual behavior without fetishizing it, it could be interesting if it´s researched well I wouldn´t touch it with a ten foot pole, but I can´t say it wouldn´t have some educational value. But I wager that´s not a story like this.

I'm not going to argue about whether or not it's grammatically correct, because there are a bunch of fucked up rules that I couldn't possibly remember even as a native English speaker. However, I /would/ argue that hitting on three distinct points in a single sentence is probably not the best way to make a fluent-sounding statement. I'd try to hit them all separately.

"There actually are kids who 'date' at that age, but it's really uncommon - let alone sex, but I suppose it happens. I guess if you want to write about unhealthy relationships or uncommon sexual behavior without fetishizing it, it could be interesting so long as it's researched well. I wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole, but I can't say it wouldn't have some educational value."

** They weren't really giving blow jobs. That violates FFN's ToS. So it wouldn't be on the site if that's the case.

I mean, in general Taure is a pretty strange looking fella, but that's about as far as the oddity goes.

**** If it was too troubling, I'm sure that it would have been reported. As it is. The fic never depicts 11 year olds giving blow jobs. The OP is a sock account and they're trolling for trollings sake, probably because they've got something against Taure.

OP and then post 1 was likely made by the same person.

***** Yeah, I kind of noticed an explosion of posts from this "person". I've never heard "sock account" though--is that like what a boy of a certain age might use a sock for?? :D

When I started posting again, I checked out FFN's TOS and decided against posting there since I write about adults doing adult things and posted on AO3 instead. Then reading here and seeing what's recommended on FFN, I decided to give it a chance. So far so good, but if I get nuked, then I still have a home on AO3 which remains my primary depository and gets my first postings.
