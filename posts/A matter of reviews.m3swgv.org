First of i want thank all you great people out there writing/reading/reviewing for the great stories and community around it.

Now to my question, when i read a story, most of times i only review the currently the last chapter because most of the times my questions are answered later in the story and to prefent telling each chapter, great update/chapter etc.

How do you writers and readers stand towards this let me know am curious


** Tbh most writers are just absolutely ecstatic with any positive engagement (yours truly included). When I review, I tend to take notes on stuff that caught my eye as I read, then comment it all on the last chapter.

** First of all, thank you for taking the time to comment on people's work. It really means a lot to writers. Every time I get a comment, it makes me grin like an idiot!! I like to reply to comments (as much as humanly possible), so it makes it easier if people comment on the most recent chapter. My work is currently floating at chapter 32, so it makes it A LOT easier for me if it's on the last chapter. That being said, if people want to leave a comment, I don't really care where they leave it. It'll make me happy all the same! :)

** For popular fics I just leave kudos. I review chapter by chapter on fics I like which are not on the beaten path. Because these fics don't always get a lot of kudos boosts from the community I try to do my part to write more reviews and encourage those writers.

** Agree with any review is a good review, even if critical. Flames are less so, but come with the territory.

I admit i DO like people that give reactions as they read, though.

** I'll review any time I have a thought.

So pretty much every oneshot I read ills review.

If it's a multichapter fic I won't review every chapter but I will end up spamming every few chapters with just incoherent yelling of approval... I'm sure those authors hate me as they wake up with 10-20 emails of just me....

But yeah, I know how just stoked I get when I get a review on my story so I'll always review other people's. It's just polite.

*** I'll be honest I'm perfectly fine with 27 reviews from the same person (assuming their positive)
