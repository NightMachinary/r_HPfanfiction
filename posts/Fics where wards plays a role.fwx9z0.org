Looking for well-written fics where there's either an emphasis on wards, or the wards are interesting enough to be significant in the story in some way. Unfortunately it's not something that's often tagged explicitly, so I'm having a bit of a time trying to find them, especially ones where Harry isn't ridiculously OP.

Good examples include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10487644/1/Courage-and-Cunning][Courage and Cunning]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14695419/chapters/33957573][The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles]]. The whole war wards of Hogwarts thing in Courage and Cunning is especially interesting (though the fic was seemingly abandoned before that could be explored further).


** "A Black Comedy" by nonjon on fanfiction.net. Harry and Sirius are burglars and they have to get past various ward sets for their crimes. A word of caution though...do not try and read and drink anything at the same time. I laughed so hard in spots that I shot soda out of my nose and that HURTS. Having said that, I recommend almost everything by that author.

** In Linkffn(faery heroes) Harry, Hermione and Luna travel back in time and do Robin Hood business and break wards extremely effectively and then rob the snobby death eater purebloods clean

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort]] has wards featured quite prominently if I recall. There are better examples but they slip my mind at the moment.
