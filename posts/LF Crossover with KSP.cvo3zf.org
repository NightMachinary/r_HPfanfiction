** Hilariously, my first fanfic I've written was for KSP, and I'm working on a HP one now. Can't think of much way to cross the two universes over though.

**** If you really want to read my first foray into fanfiction, very well! Be warned, it does suffer a great deal from 'unplanned ending syndrome', I kept changing what I wanted out of the fic and so didn't manage to find a good conclusion.

** Everything was ready.

=T-5 Minutes.=

Head Unspeakable Weasley-Granger listened to the broadcast over her Wireless and looked towards the horizon in anticipation where the newly modified shape of Azkaban Tower was clearly visible.

After almost twenty years, the Azkaban Issue might just get solved today.

The Issue had been a major topic since shortly after the War, when it had become clear that Dementors weren't the ideal guards for dark wizards.

After all, the only reason they had worked with the Ministry had been that they were allowed to feast on the happiness of prisoners and the soul of the occasional high profile dark wizard, and Voldemort had been able to simply offer a lot more souls to get the Dementors to change allegiance.

When Voldemort was finally defeated, most Dementors that had changed allegiance tried to go back to guarding prisoners. But going back to the pre-war situation wasn't really an option, so the decision was made to construct a new high-security Dementor-free prison.

Which left the question of what to do with the 500 Dementors that only stayed in Azkaban as long as they had happiness to feed on.

Luckily, Dementors had more weaknesses than just the Patronus. For once, they aren't ghosts cannot go through solid walls. In 2002, a massive force of Patronus-capable aurors (most of which had learned the charm in the DA) managed to drive all the Dementors into the lower leveks of Azkaban which housed no prisoners and seal off the staircases.

But the Dementors being sealed behind several feet of solid transfigured stone was only a temportary solution, and everyone knew it. After all, all it took was one dark wizard blowing a hole in the wall to release a horde of angry Dementors.

In 2008, after years of experimenting on one of the few Dementors not sealed in Azkaban, the Department of Mysteries made the discovery that while normal sunlight was only a minor inconvenience for Dementors, light had the potential to completeley kill them if amplified by several orders of magnitude.

Project Gandhi, the plan to permanently get rid of the Dementors of Azkaban and the tower itself by means of an alchemically created 10 Megaton thermonuclear bomb was abandoned as too difficult to hide from muggles in 2010, and for the next 3 years nobody had any feasible idea how to deal with the Azkaban Issue.

Everything changed when on October 25th, 2013 a muggleborn student at Hogwarts jokingly suggested to solve the problem with "needs more boosters".

=T-1 Minute.=

As it turns out, enchanting a bottle to be always full of a simple nonmagical substance like water is a millenia old invention.

Rocket fuel is a simple nonmagical substance.

A rocket engine with infinite fuel can easily push something pretty much anywhere in the solar system in a reasonable timeframe.

Azkaban Tower is a thing.

Dementors are vulnerable to sunlight.

The sun is in the center of the solar system.

/This insane plan might just work./

It had taken almost six more years to confirm the viability of the idea, convince the Ministry to fund the project, develop massive magically powered rocket engines, attach twenty of them to the sides of Azkaban Tower and to reinforce the stone structure to stay in one piece.

Now, launch was just a few more seconds away.

=T-10 seconds.=

=9=

=8=

=7=

=6=

=5=

=Ignition sequence start.=

Twenty Protean Charms triggered the enchantments in the massive cylinders surrounding Azkaban Tower that started to produce thousands of tons of liquid hydrogen and oxygen every second.

=4=

=3=

Massive plumes of fire erupted around the Tower. Even at the observation platform five miles away, the sound would've been deafening if it hadn't been for magic. The Tower started shaking but the reinforcements held.

=2=

=1=

=All engines running, and liftoff!=

Hundreds of spectators watched as the massive tower of black stone that had stood at its place for centuries, filled with the worst terrors of Wizarding Britain, started to slowly rise towards the sky.

=All systems nominal. Acceleration at 1.5G.=

Inside, hundreds of Dementors were confused. They had known of unusual activity and happiness on the outside, but had no idea why the castle was shaking or why floating felt more difficult than usual.

=Approaching Max-Q.=

Relief was felt by many Unspeakables when the massive and highly unaerodynamic structure made it through the sound barrier without issue.

=AT is leaving the atmosphere.=

As the tower ascended faster and faster into the vacuum of space, confusion amongst the Dementors skyrocketed just like the Dementors themselves. None of them had ever experienced how a vacuum felt like before. At least the shaking had stopped.

=Escape velocity reached.=

All around Wizarding Britain, people listening to the broadcast cheered at the announcement. If anything failed now, Azkaban would not crash back into the Earth. The Dementors were gone for good.

=Perihelion below 500 thousand kilometers. Engine cutoff sequence start.=

The tower shook again as the engines shut off and the Dementors inside that believed that nothing could confuse them even more than the previous events were proven wrong as they started to experience zero-G.

=All engines shut down. Perihelion is at 476 987 km above solar center. Approximate collision at T+126d.=

Azkaban was now on a collision course with the Sun. 4 months later, it was gone.

** Is that even plausible? I mean, you can write anything, but for it to have even a lick of sense...

Perhaps a young Harry, 1st-year-ish, gets transported to the Kerbal planet? Then he works with them to make the spaceships? ... I'm officially lost.
