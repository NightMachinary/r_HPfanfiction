I dont known if someone already asked this but why do people like hermione and draco together. Draco is a spoiled rich daddy's boy who bullies and hermione could do better. Hell i dont like her and ron either. My fav pairing is harry/hermione but if she isn't with harry i could see hermione being asexual or gay


** -The bad boy thing

-Devil redeemed (her bringing him to the light)

-The arguments/banter

-Fanon Draco is diff from canon Draco

-He has a different sort of intelligence than Ron.

** Another thing that maybe a factor in some people's choice: Tom Felton, Malfoy's actor in the movies. It's hard to deny that the man is handsome, so of course people will remember what he looks like, regardless of his similarity to book Malfoy

*** aka "The Emma Watson effect"

I think a lot of people who love Hermione do so because of the movie version. If you go back and re-read/re-listen to the books picturing movie/Emma is really discordant. Because book Hermione spends a LOT of time being, for lack of a more precise term, c*nty.

For the record, I'm a big fan of Hermione in general, and H/Hr ships in FF. But I'm pretty aware it's because of the EW effect.

** Women love red flags.

Just kidding (sort of). I'm a Dramione shipper (though tbh I'll ship anything) but it comes down to all the crazy situations you can put them in and the unfolding angst and drama. There are some wild stories out there that just wouldn't work as well with another pairing.

We also only see Draco from Harry's point of view in the books so it's a rather limited perspective...so I think people enjoy adding depth to him, suggesting there was more to him than what we see.

Finally, there's the fact we don't see Draco after he's 17 (or 18?) and I dunno about you, but I am unrecognizable from the shit I was as a teenager. So, the idea that he grew up and managed to be more is intriguing.

** A lot of readers confuse characters with the fanon versions. You read some Draco redemption fic you really like, then another, then another, and eventually your view of the character gets skewed to match the fan-establish narrative. That's how someone like you or me tries to pick up a Draco-centric fic and find that, despite it supposed to be school-era canon divergence, Draco is this witty and nice kid who just needs to be nudged in a direction by fucking Hermione or Harry. It's weird because a lot of authors in that fanbase tend not to include real character development and instead lean on bashing and "they were always the good guys" garbage. They just lean on the fact that Draco's totally a nice guy and expect you to already have that viewpoint.

** Not a fan at ALL of Draco. Don't read anything with a Draco ship if I can avoid it, and in general I prefer FFs where he gets served his due comeuppance. That said, the beauty of FF in general is that ANYTHING can work if it is written in a way that works for you.

I read a two shot where Ginny potioned Harry and got caught, then they found out that Ron potioned Hermione. That led to Hermione + Draco and it was quite an enjoyable read despite not liking Draco.

But with you being a H/Hr type to begin with, it is pretty normal that you wouldn't want to read Dramione. Just skip those. Not all that hard as it isn't one of the more popular ships.

  Not necessarily. Canon Harry was willing to go out of his way to save Draco, and testify at his trial. I can see Harry being more open to Draco than Ron.

****** Can you link that? The Wizarding World/Pottermore page doesn't mention this:

[[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/draco-malfoy]]

Just that Lucius avoided prison by betraying his old friends. The only real thing it says is that Harry and Draco will never be friends:

#+begin_quote
  For all this, Draco remains a person of dubious morality in the seven published books, and I have often had cause to remark on how unnerved I have been by the number of girls who fell for this particular fictional character (although I do not discount the appeal of Tom Felton, who plays Draco brilliantly in the films and, ironically, is about the nicest person you could meet). Draco has all the dark glamour of the anti-hero; girls are very apt to romanticise such people. All of this left me in the unenviable position of pouring cold common sense on ardent readers' daydreams as I told them, rather severely, t*hat Draco was not concealing a heart of gold under all that sneering and prejudice and that no, he and Harry were not destined to end up best friends*.

******* I never thought he had a heart of gold, I think Harry'd be more willing to grudgingly accept Draco dating Hermione than Ron would, not just bc of Ron's interest in Hermione but also Ron's immaturity. Hardly a novel insight
