Otherwise known as having the #1 amount of favorites on FFN. I've had some problems getting into it, because of the lack of Harry being the main character. I don't mind Draco/Hermione but I've never read a story with that as a main point, so I figured, hey, why not the top of the whole site?

My question is, how much, if any, is Harry in it? Is he an active character, sort of like Hermione and Ron in the main, or is he mostly mentioned? I think knowing this before hand will help me get into Isolation, because I won't get my hopes up for something that not there.

Thanks in advance!


** Harry and Ron definitely aren't main characters and don't really show up until Hermione is reunited with them. Draco and Hermione are the main characters all the way through.
