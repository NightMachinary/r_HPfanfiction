** From the title, I was thinking that you'd want people to bond over mocking Drarry. Which is something I have included in a few throwaway lines where Harry gets teased for having Malfoy confront him again and again as if he was crushing on Harry.

** I don't know why this is a prompt when you've clearly written some great ones! You should write this!! haha. I love it! Comedy and wit of the British variety are so hard to execute properly imo.

*** Maybe it is less of a prompt and more of a request? I'm not sure! xD I just like to put up fanfic ideas I have that I can't do because I'm too busy with other stuff... you know?
