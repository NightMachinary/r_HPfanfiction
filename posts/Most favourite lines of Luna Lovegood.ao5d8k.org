Be it fanfic or canon? Mine's definetly :

Luna, meanwhile turned to Harry. "The good part of Doreen knowing now that you're a wizard is that you won't have to sleep on the couch anymore".

Harry cocked an eyebrow at her, encouraging her to explain that statement.

"You can simply transfigure it into a bed," Luna said.


** Yeah, it's my own, but I love it anyway:

#+begin_quote
  "Um, Luna. How did you cast those spells without saying anything?"

  Luna looked down at her wand and thought. She replied, "I spend a lot of my time Not being Noticed. It really isn't that difficult- most adults get by with only speaking aloud the most aggressive or least-practiced spells, while their regularly-used repertoire can be cast with barely an afterthought, much less a spoken incantation."

  "I hadn't noticed before, but yeah, you're right. So, how do I do that?"

  "You just think the words. After all, you're not saying the words at your target."

  "You're... I'm not?"

  "No. You're saying the words to your wand. If you get along with your wand, like friends might, you'll work out how to communicate a lot with just a look, a familiar noise and gesture. You and Hermione do that all the time, don't you?"

  "I never thought of my wand as a person."

  Luna gave Harry a confused look. "Of course not, Harry. Why would you do that? It's a wand. You tell it what you want and then aim. If it understands you properly, it produces what you intended. I can't get that sort of response even from my father, and he loves me."

** One of my favorite of her lines is actually from the /OotP/ movie, during the scene with the Thestrals.

/"Well, if I were You-Know-Who, I'd want you to feel cut off from everyone else. Because if it's just you alone, you're not as much of a threat."/

Actually, that entire sequence is one of my favorites in the movie(which is by a long way my least favorite of the films).

As for from fanfics specifically...I can't think of one offhand.

** If we allow for a liberal definition of "line" to include "a character's thoughts of Luna" then my favorite is by far from /Faith and Understanding./

#+begin_quote
  Ginny often got her guessing games wrong. Who could really predict someone like Luna? She seemed above earthly things as much as she seemed to understand them better than anyone.

  It didn't matter, though. When Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party, Luna's smiles were brighter than ever as she bounced around wondering whether she should wear her butter beer cork necklace while Ginny assured her that there wouldn't be any Nargles at the party. Ginny couldn't have been happier for Luna, and so it was all right if she didn't understand the Quibbler's latest theory about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

  “You know,” said Luna, “I can hear you all. And, also, I think it's quite alright that I ‘forgot' my shoes. At least I didn't forget my manners, after all. I'd much rather have those, than be a rude person with shoes who repeats things they heard but don't understand.”

  “Merlin, you're a brat,” Ronald muttered. Luna smiled and slowly blinked her eyes at Ronald. In cat that meant “I love you”, but in cyclops that meant “I am your superior”. Luna only opened one eye after she blinked a few times.
#+end_quote

That's from linkao3(The Fire that Swallowed the World by RowlettLesbian) and Luna appears to have a sibling-like relationship with the Weasleys, or at least Ron.

  Harriet Potter died at one year old. What was left of her slogged through life, alive in body and mind but not soul. Six years later she was finally cremated. This is not the story of Harriet Potter. This is the story of the brilliant flame who inherited her place, and her journey in the strange world of humans.*****Harriet is trapped, surrounded by humans, and painfully easy to extinguish if she doesn't keep her flames hidden. After the Dursleys, Hogwarts is a step up for her, but now she has to unravel the mysteries surrounding the body she stole and fight to survive against a monster who may be even less human than she is.As friends of Harriet, Luna, Hermione, and even Draco are playing with fire, and the price of failure is greater than they ever could have known.

  "Hey, guys," said Luna. "How is my one big happy Weasley family?"

  While Harry seemed to sink into his hands again, Ron smiled at her und shook her hand, of which she wouldn't let go for a second too long.

  "We are..." began Ron, then stopped and thought for a moment. "Well, one big happy Weasley family, right?"

  "Yes you are!" confirmed Luna cheerfully. "And I would've loved so much to be a part of it."

  "You could still marry George or Percy, you know?"

  "That's actually a great idea. If we go on like that, we could have Hogwarts full of a single, one big happy Weasley family one day," said Luna full of excitement. "Or even the whole wizarding world. Wouldn't that be cool? There would only be muggles and Weasleys!"

  19 years after Hogwarts, the world is perfect. The only selfish, power-crazed person that ever existed was defeated, all the deaths the whole affair brought about quickly forgotten and the happy, naturally developed couples were eager to get started on making babies and giving them awful names. And of course it all worked out exactly like that, duh! What an epilogue!

** "And in the end, love will always be more powerful and more terrible than any other magic in the world."

linkffn(Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm)

​

It's a simple quote, but it resonates with me in an oddly powerful way. Love /was/ the power-he-knew-not, in the original series, and while one might think it sentimental and inane and cliche for /that/ to be the power, there's a /reason/ it's cliche. The things a parent might do for their child, a lover for their partner, a friend for a friend---it can be amazing and terrifying and inspiring in the most compelling of ways. I forget that, sometimes, and it's nice to have be reminded of love and what it really is---if only for a moment.
