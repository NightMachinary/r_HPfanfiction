A while back I came across a fic where Harry was sent back in time as a baby and grew up alongside Tom Riddle at the orphanage. I remember a certain part where Dumbledore comes to collect Tom for Hogwarts and they have to convince him that Harry is a wizard too since he wasn't on the school list. I've been searching but can't seem to find it again. Anyone know the fic I'm talking about?

  Harry ends up back in time on the steps of Wool's Orphanage. Raised in institutional squalor with Tom Riddle, he has a very different attitude toward magic, Hogwarts, and friendships. dark!harry, brotp!tomarry.
