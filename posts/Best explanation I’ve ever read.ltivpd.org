I'm currently reading linkffn(Harry Potter - Three to Backstep by Sinyk) and am currently halfway through. And Sinyk wrote something that just resonates with me. If I ever get the motivation to write a HP fanfic, /THIS/ will be my headcanon magic explanation.

Excerpt from story (I cut out parts to not give spoilers without ruining explanation) :

"People tend to think we are what you see before you; the flesh and blood and personality; and that we have souls. I believe that is incorrect."

Seeing the confusion he clarified. "I believe we do not /have/ souls; we /are/ souls, and we /have/ bodies.

"Now, think about that for a minute. If I'm right... and I believe I am... it answers a lot of questions concerning why, for example, Dementor's Kiss Syndrome has the effect it has; and what the Killing Curse actually accomplishes."

"You see, the Dementor's Kiss strips the soul from the body. If you are the soul, as I believe, it explains why Dementor's Kiss Syndrome leaves the body functioning but there being absolutely no response from the person within. The reason is because there is no longer anyone there to respond.

"The body has what're known as autonomic functions. The heart beating, the lungs breathing, food in the stomach being processed, the liver and kidneys filtering your blood, et cetera, are not controlled by the person. They all happen apart from conscious thought. That is, they are not controlled by the soul within. However, while food being processed in the stomach is automatic, the act of eating and drinking is not automatic; that requires conscious thought. You have to be in control of the physical body. So, with no food or water going into the body, it soon dies. It also explains why the Imperious curse doesn't work on someone who's been Kissed.

"As for the Killing Curse, it works by stopping the body like snuffing a candle. It snuffs out life by making the body instantly unable to sustain continued life. That immediately renders the body uninhabitable for the soul. The soul is driven out and lives on, but the body doesn't. In a way, it is the exact opposite of the Dementor's Kiss.

"Now, the proof. If a person didn't exist within the soul, rather than the body, then you wouldn't have ghosts. They would be impossible to exist. A spirit, without consciousness, is impossible. And we know ghosts have consciousness; they think. We can talk to them and they will talk back to us. Ergo, you are the spirit, the soul, not the body you currently inhabit. That is only a physical shell you inhabit to interact with the physical world.

"Secondly, it explains how Voldemort... Riddle... is going to come back. At the moment he is a spirit... a soul without a body. We three know he is going to create himself a body for that soul to enter and remain inhabiting. ---(Part cut out here)---

"You see, our sex is determined by our physical form - male and female. But, our souls are not, except for physical shape. Our souls become shaped due to the physical form, which is why ghosts always have the shape of their body at the time of their death. That includes defects such as Nearly-Headless Nick's near total decapitation, Moaning Myrtle's glasses, Professor Binns's aged frailness, and the Bloody Baron's blood upon his robes, to name a few.

"And the physical form, through body chemicals, impresses on the thinking; and, therefore, the person - the soul. That, together with society's mores, is how man becomes attracted to woman and vice versa. However, sometimes, the body chemicals do not impress fully upon the soul because the chemicals are weaker... or, the soul is simply stronger... and you occasionally have homosexuality. ---(Part cut out here)---

"Does anyone know the reason why only magicals become ghosts? Or why, after centuries of searching using vivisection and the like, they've never actually been able to find what it is in the physical body that makes a muggle different to a magical?"

After head shakes all round, he explained. "Both those subjects have, essentially, the same answer. It's because witches and wizards don't control magic with their bodies; they control it with their souls. And that's because magic is channelled through the soul; not the body.

"When you think about it, the proof is before you when you meet a ghost and discover that only magicals can become ghosts. A ghost, as you now know, is a soul that has yet to pass on to the afterlife. And, it's only through their ability to wield magic that a soul doesn't immediately pass on with the death of the physical body.

"If magic was part of the body instead of the soul, then as soon as the soul departed the body it would be no different to the soul of a muggle. Therefore it would, just as muggles' souls do, pass on.

"I started thinking about this at the end of second year when the piece of Tom Riddle's soul that was locked into his diary began to draw off the life force of Ginny Weasley, before I destroyed the diary.

"Even before that soul piece was fully corporeal, Riddle was able to wield and use Ginny's wand. He used it against me. If the magic is channelled through the physical body, that should not have been possible. So, too, should it not have been possible if magic is not channelled through the soul.

"Next, ghosts can talk. We can hear them. That should not be possible without magic. Air does not pass through lungs and out over vocal chords to make sound; sound, which we hear as speech. So, it must be magic in the soul of the ghost that allows it to talk to us. Magic recognises the need and replaces the operation of the vibrating vocal chords.

"It also explains muggleborns a lot more thoroughly. It makes no sense, whatsoever, that there is continually occurring the same genetic... alteration... that causes a muggleborn to suddenly occur across very diverse people. However, it becomes obvious when you understand the number of children born to magicals has substantially dropped off. Those souls waiting to be born have to go somewhere. So, it's into the forming bodies of muggle foetuses they go."


** I forget, isn't three back step a triad fic with hermione and daphnee? I got no problem with that just trying to remember, Im pretty sure I heard it was a triad. I plan on reading it when I finish the current haphne series I'm reading

** In the anime series Jujutsu Kaisen, one of the antagonists has the ability to transform humans into monsters by manipulating the shape of their souls. I wonder if that would make part of an interesting explanation for werewolves.

*** I feel like for werewolves it would be more like a human soul and a wolf soul connected. I kinda imagine it like the human having a connecting magical line to a wolf soul. After all, how would the souls of animagi look?

**** I've seen that sort of thing hinted at before ("The wolf was close to the surface, because it was near the full moon"), but something about the idea of a connection between a werewolf and a wolf soul doesn't feel right to me.

Would a wolf animagus have a connection to a wolf soul? In that case, you have to come up with an explanation for why the effects of having a wolf soul or a connection to one are different for a werewolf and a wolf animagus, because the werewolf transformation is described as difficult and painful. I don't know what canon says about the animagus transformation, but I've seen stories in which the animagus transformation doesn't hurt at all, and other stories in which it hurts the first time or first few times you transform, and after that it's not a problem.

I suppose you could posit that going through animagus training appeases the "wolf spirit," while having the connection forced onto you offends it (or something), but I think that leads into the question of the origin of werewolves and why there aren't other types of weres corresponding to other animal forms, or at least, why we don't see them. I think it would be hard to avoid becoming a were-mosquito, if they existed.

I have read stories (not HP fanfiction) with other types of weres - besides the Anita Blake books, which went overboard with various types of weres, I've read stories with characters who were werewomen and weredachshunds before.

On the other hand, if a wolf animagus does /not/ have a connection to a wolf soul, then how do they (and other animagi) learn how to handle their animal forms? How do they acquire the instincts of their form, or do they?

I suppose it all comes down to a matter of what kind of handwaving explanation fits your head canon.

***** Well I guess my theory was that werewolves were started at one point way in the past with a wolf animagus who was cursed. The curse twisted the animagus form to being tied much closer to the human and forced transformation (maybe permanently since it was the first werewolf). A form of rabies could become the reason for transmission to others. And since other humans weren't inherently wolf in spirit/personality it caused the transformation to become painful because the wolf was taking over the other spirit form to force transformation and stayed. Also, some people have the inherent wolf spirit they would be more inclined to being a werewolf (Fenrir Grayback?) Lots of possibilities but that's kinda the top of my list.
