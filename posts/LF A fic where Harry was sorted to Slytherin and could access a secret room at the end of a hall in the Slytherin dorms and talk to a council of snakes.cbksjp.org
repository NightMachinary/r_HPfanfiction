I recall there being power plays in Slytherin and he used his abilitity to get in this room to achieve power and win some of those maneuvers.

Thanks!

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** High key. One of those fics that really exemplifies why fanon is such an awesome thing. This would never work as an independent book, but I'm more likely to reread this than I am the actual books. It's so clever.
