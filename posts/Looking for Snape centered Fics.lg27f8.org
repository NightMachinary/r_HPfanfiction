I'm looking for fics where snape is the main love interest. :)


** I don't like Hermione/Snape either, don't even try reading it. This isn't that but it's one of the few Snape stories where I find him likeable.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but for what?

** Shameless self-promo. I'm [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/jalapeno_eye_popper/profile][jalapeno_eye_popper]] on AO3 and all my fics are Snapefics. Most of them are SS/HG, but I've also got some SS/SB and and epic SS/OC. My bookmarks list is also 92% Snapefic, so that could be a good place to start trawling.

**** Great! In addition to classics of Snamione, here are two of my most favorite fanfictions. I absolutely love them and I think they are the very best two stories of this couple.

Here are my recommendations:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17960324/chapters/42418760][Time Mutable Immutable]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16780603/chapters/39378724][The Poison Garden]].

Please let me know what you think. And I am always happy to suggest more!
