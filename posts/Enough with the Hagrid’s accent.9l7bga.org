For the love of JK please stop writing Hagrid with an overrated accent. I understand that he has an accent but it's not that bad. There are some fics that I have to decode what Hagrid says. Tone it down a little bit.

** Last one I saw nearly gave me a stroke trying to read it.

As far as I can tell, the author attempted to phonetically write down the thickest Glaswegian accent known to mankind, mouth frozen and fresh from the dentist.

** I actually usually end up writing Hagrid out of things because I'm scared of getting the dialogue wrong. I've looked up in the past if someone made a collection of quotes from him and studied them to get the "formula" or how JKR did it. Like what rules did she follow for how he spoke that we could follow and get it right.

If anyone has the ability, skill, desire to do that I think they'd be doing the fandom a tremendous service.

** I might be wrong but doesn't the accent intensify in the books when Hagrid is agitated or sad or drunk (in general when he is influenced somehow)?

I always pictured him to be mumbling a lot into his beard, losing a few letters in the process. I didn't really think he would have an accent because back when I read the books I didn't know about different English accents.

*** The use of his accent in fics is likely (largley) a result of the movies. I dont think the books ever explicitly say that hagrid speaks with a scottish accent, but everyone remembers Robbie Coltrane's hagrid and uses his scottish accent as a basis for hagrid.

***** /Did/ she die? I thought she'd simply run away because she couldn't bear to have such a tiny son. I could be misremembering though.

Either way, /Mr/ Hagrid might have lived long enough with Fridwulfa to catch the Giant accent, no?

****** Oh yeah, my bad. She was of course alive.

However, she did leave when he was a baby, so I reckon that no, he wouldn't have adopted a giant's dialect/accent.

Besides, young accents are pliable. I spent a significant period of my formative years with my Glaswegian grandmother, with very little to show for it linguistically.
