With the news about the Cursed Child play, it's got me into the mood for exploring some next-gen fics.

Anything goes, but I'm not really a fan of OCs as the main character (OCs as side/supporting characters are fine, but not when they're right there). I'd prefer to read about the nextgen characters that have already been established by JK Rowling.

I've already read linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided) and linkffn(11226787), the second one I really liked.

So, could you guys please pass your nextgen fic recommendations my way? Thank you :D

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

  When Rose resurrects her brother, she pushes the world to the brink of another war. Meanwhile Albus, cold and brilliant, may just be the second coming of Tom Riddle. Forced to work together to unravel their parents' suspicious deaths, they must solve the past if they want to survive the future. And answer the question: Just why does history keep repeating itself?

** I have some listed [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3an5ot/great_fics_from_hpff_primarily_oneshots_minor/][here]], if you haven't read those! I also have a complete adventure-comedy [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][here]]; technically an OC lead, but it's largely ensemble (rotating third person PoV). Tell me if you find something you like! :)

** linkffn(Albus Potter and The Global Revelation) is part of my favourite next-gen series. A lot of OCs, and the author isn't the best at characterization (at all. Seriously, only Albus has any character whatsoever), but it's worth a read for the quality of the plot alone (at least up to 5th year, where the author seemed to get bored).

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.

** This one just came out, and it's pretty good: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11520431/1/Whispers-of-the-Dead-Lords][Martyrs of Dead Lords]]

#+begin_quote
  Twenty-one years have passed since Lord Voldemort's final defeat at Hogwarts, and the wizarding world since has enjoyed quiet stability. Lily Potter, youngest child of Harry and Ginny, has watched her two older brothers head off to Hogwarts and eagerly awaited her own opportunity -- but as Lily takes her first step in her formal magical education, an ancient horror awakens from its forgotten slumber.

  Lily faces the trials and tribulations of boys, grades, and school trouble as Hogwarts both tantalizes and troubles her, but as part of the magical community, she'll have a part to play in the unfolding of a dark plan long in the making. The cruelest wizards of the modern age, Grindelwald and Voldemort, may be dead, but some horrors have no qualms about shattering the wizarding world's fragile peace. Some horrors know nothing of humanity, and Hogwarts, again, will host a struggle between good and evil.

** Hey, shezwriter here. If you liked Clash you might like linkffn(Ignite by Slide). Characterizations and tone are massively different, but there are definitely some thematic similarities. And it's got the whole large scope plot thing going for it.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

** I'm in the middle of writing a massive Next Gen exploration. The main story is called [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/674219/chapters/1233745][Pieces: A Story Cycle]], with each chapter focusing on defining moment for a new Next Gen character, but all the Harry Potter fics I have on my profile at Ao3 connect back to that universe.
