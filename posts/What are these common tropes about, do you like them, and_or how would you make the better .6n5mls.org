** Well, where Harry/Daphne's concerned:

*Contrast* - This is arguably the most prominent and somewhat practical quality that might attract readers to the ship. From what we can gather, the Greengrasses are the prejudiced sort, since Astoria has been confirmed as the black sheep of her family for harbouring pro Muggle-born sentiments.

So if you want to extrapolate from that, you've got the whole "school jock cum freedom-fighter dating the kinda racist would-be socialite" trope right there. And Harry's a half-blood, so there's the whole rebellion angle there too. Amusingly, the more I type, the more I'm reminded of those fics where the Grangers don't take an immediate liking to Harry for every reason under the moon. The overbearing parent thing is far more applicable to the Greengrasses, IMO

There's also the hot-blooded lion cavorting with the cool-headed serpent thing, but that's been talked about to death.

*Magic* - This reason makes a certain amount of sense, but it's also pretty silly if you give it some thought. Daphne is, of course, a pure-blood, and likely a "traditional" one (whatever that means within the context of canon), so one might expect the encounters in a Haphne fic to exude that extra flavour of magic... or something, Ã  la /Unatoned/, /The Legacy/, or Republic's fics, above all others.

Now that's all well and good, but why should a Harry/Ginny fic be any less magical? Or Harry/Hermione, for matter? Hermione hearts the ever-loving gauno out of being a witch and doing witchy things, so you could expect her office, her favourite haunts and /especially/ her marital abode to be replete with all sorts of magical trappings and the like.

But this is about why you /would/ read such a fic, and fandom logic dictates that Daphne is more "magical", so it is what it is.

*Distinction* - This is really it, to be honest. Excepting /Ice Princess/, I have yet to encounter a fic where Daphne's family possesses less than a relatively moderate degree of wealth. No matter how she's written, Daphne tends to be bougie as a rule. It isn't her fault; Slytherin House radiates that sense of elegance and stature because of their professed values. So if you're looking for a fic where Harry's trying to pursue (or is pursued by) the more patrician interest, then Daphne's likely your witch. So yeah, it's shallow.

Me? I like the name. And all of the reasons above, when tempered well.

*** Thanks a lot ! It's exactly the kind of answer I was hopping for in this thread, but wasn't sure if I explained enough. I see the appeal ! In fact, some of these things can be applied to some of the fics I read (SS/HG for example). I never read any fics where the parents are important characters but I get why it's relevant in these fics. Thanks again !

  5) I enjoy badass women that take down dark lords.

I can definitely agree with that ! But it's Hermione in AU fics for me. All of your points make a lot of sense, and I think that I'd like fem!Harry fics if I read Harry-centric fics. I'm a woman and I read mostly Hermione centric fics because she's more relatable and I always enjoyed the character, but I totally get your point. Had I preferred Harry while growing up with the books, fem!Harry would have been on my reading list for sure !

** - *WBWL* - I don't read a lot of these fics so I'm kind of hazy on this, but it seems to be a combination of things. First, if the Potters were alive, then it'd be a different kind of story, so obviously there must be something to keep Harry being canon Harry, at least in the "raised by the Dursleys as a outsider" kind of way. So it's necessary to give him a sibling who is (wrongly) the focus of the wizarding world's adoration. There are other variations on this theme, but the point of it is an AU story that has a neglected Harry, one who might be independent or "grey," who ultimately turns out to be the real hero.

- *fem!Harry* - For me, ideally, the appeal is reading something from a witch's perspective, along with all the little changes that would make to the story -- little changes that would potentially ripple out into bigger differences compared to canon. Butterfly effect, man. (Ideally. But in actuality ...)

- *Harry/Daphne* - For when you want to pair Harry with a Slytherin witch who isn't painted with the "ugly" or "bitch" brush. [[/u/Ihateseatbelts]] has a good breakdown of the different aspects and appeal of the pairing.

- *Slytherin Harry* - Some of these fics try to have their cake and eat it too by making him friends with people from other houses. Yeah, some of them are Dumbledore bash fics, but not all. It's like any type of fic -- there are lots of crap ones and a small but precious amount of gems. (There's a reason why this sub and DLP are my filters for searching readable /Harry Potter/ fics.)

- *Dark Lord Harry* - Same as above on the bashing. Joining Voldemort or becoming a Dark Wizard in his own right seems to be a toss up ... There seems to be more of the second in more recent works, however. (Or maybe I'm just deliberately skipping over the first type, idk. My pickiness is almost automated these days when I browse.)

- *God-like Harry* - Sometimes you just want Harry to beat the ever-loving snot out of everything. His proactiveness is the appeal (but the repetition and lack of challenges can drag). It'd categorize these as part escapism, part guilty pleasure.

** While the other answers are all right technically I think there is one thing missing. Over half of all fanfiction stories written are people trying to 'fix' things. What does that mean in the context of your post, well; Daphne and Slytherin Harry can be rolled into one for this, Dark Lord Harry at a push too, Harry in canon can be seen as 'weak' by those sitting on the outside, reading from a comfortable spot. The question asked is why doesn't Harry realise a great but terrible wizard is after him and become a bad-arse himself? Harry can be very hard to relate to for cynical or overly competitive people. He seems content to just let things happen. Therefore when they 'fix' the story they either have to make him more cunning and involved (read: using the benefit of hindsight having read the books) or if they don't want to go all the way back to the start then they give him a guide (Daphne, who has to be crazy intelligent so she can pre-emptively guide Harry away from the pitfalls of canon.) That way they can put their own spin on events and approach it from a more 'Slytherin' angle. Then remember that most fanfiction authors are actually not very good at writing. We love the effort they put in but its not often great qualitly. One of the most common traits in a beginner in anything, especially say cooking is knowing when to stop, say this is enough. They keep adding more ingredients, in fanfiction terms, we get ridiculous plot twists every other chapter, relentless power-creep and a bank account with more digits than there are wizards in the country, people don't just make innocent mistakes they become intentional and evil. Its not hard to see where the tropes come from.

Fem!Harry. Contrast, different pairings, or to make a clear divide. In some reality swapping stories a fem!Harry will be used to make a clear distinction between the travelling Harry and the Harry of the alternate world. Having a girl means they're not going to be called Harry and it makes it much easier on the writer and reader to keep track of who is who. It also gets more sympathy for the Harry. Almost certainly a slightly sexist view but an abused girl gets slightly more sympathy on an instinctual level than a boy. We're preprogramed for it, logically there is almost no difference but it makes it easier for a grown up Harry to care for a little girl at the Dursleys than a clone of him. It also opens up those slightly unusual stories where you get Harry/Fem!Harry pairings.

** -wrong boy-who-lived: Usually involves the adults (dumbledore, potters, etc) thinking Harry's sibling is the boy-who-lived for some arbitrary reason, when it is actually Harry. Sometimes involve nonsense like shipping Harry off to the Dursleys Because Reasons

-Girl Harry: Kind of. It's weird. Like, it seems like a crapshoot whether the author simply wants femmeslash between Hermione and fem!Harry, or wants a relationship between Harry and Ron but doesn't want it slash, so they change the gender. It's kind of contrived.

-Harry/Daphne is kind of a plague that won't go away. She is mentioned exactly once in the books in a throwaway line with some other characters. She's a blank slate that has since grown into have a common set of fanon characteristics which are all bullshit. (she's also been later expanded upon by JKR as part of her usual fan pandering). The Ice Queen is part of the fanon character sheet that she's been given, and is a lazy way for authors to include a character without actually having to give them characteristics. She's usually Slytherin, Pureblood, very intelligent, beautiful, etc, basically Hermione on overdrive.

Slytherin!Harry is usually done in one of two way. This worst and most common way is that he's sorted into Slytherin, yet nothing changes. He has the same friends, goes through all the normal canon events, and is pretty much a waste of words. They might even play up the fact that other people don't think he should be in Slytherin, that there's a mistake, or whatever. The second way is usually a set up for him to have a new set of friends, show off a rather bad "slytherin house rules" system (must stand united in front of the school, house rivalries, ect ect!), and really badly written junior politicians. There's like three good Slytherin!Harry stories, so when you see that tag it's pretty safe to just avoid it.

Dark Lord Harry. This is a pretty outdated trope. It's been years since I've actually seen one. Sometimes, it involves Harry joining Voldemort, sometimes for the sake of learning his secrets to eventually overcome him. For some reason, there's a lot of slash involved with it (I'm not sure why people are obsessed with Lucius, Draco, Snape, or Voldemort wearing leather pants). Other times, Harry simply starts his own faction because the "dark arts" are "misunderstood" and that he's simply doing what needs to be done. Also, there's a subset where the wizarding world turns on him because of an arbitrary reason (his parseltongue ability used to be a popular reason), and would call him the next dark lord and stuff, usually leading to the betrayed!Harry trope. This will eventually lead to him being what they thought he was all along, because he snaps and stops caring.

-OP!Harry These are usually written by people with no sense of what character balance actually is, and is a thinly veiled exercise in wish fulfillment. Usually written by anime fans. Most of the good stories in this branch usually are disguised as comedies (such as Make a Wish), since the trick is that you actually need a competent badguy who acts as a foil, and most people for whatever reason would rather just bash every character instead.

*** Thanks ! That's a great explanation. I think WBL Harry might be something I'd read when I have absolutely nothing left... Right now I'm kinda reading the same fics I already know so I may branch and try some, maybe the most ridiculous even, because it'd be for fun. I'm all about AU fics, but I usually prefer EWE where what happens differ a lot from the books, school years fics aren't what I usually look for. It's pretty interesting to learn about all of these tropes I never read about. Thanks again !

  Spinoff to 'HP: The Lone Traveller'. The story of Harry James Potter, the brother of the supposed BoyWhoLived, and his friends... My take on the old 'Harry the brother of the BWL' & 'Harry the Slytherin' plotline.
