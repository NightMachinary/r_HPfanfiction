So the fic starts out with Harry staying with Hermione for a little while. The chapters progress and it turns out her grandfather passes away and the Granger parents must leave to attend the grandfather's passing, eventually Harry and Hermione get down to the dirty. It's a multi-chapter fic.

It's a sensual fic, none of this written-by-a-12-year-old bs. Any hell would be greatly appreciated!
