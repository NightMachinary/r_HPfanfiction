´Sup guys,

I remember reading a Fanfic where Harry reads the Sherlock Holmes Books and starts to think like him but I can´t remember the name of it. It would be great if one of you knows it. Thanks:* MineTree out!


** You might be thinking of the fic Chronicles of Harry Holmes by ZenoNoKyuubi, unfortunately its seems they took it down. Someone named Wassa110 reuploaded it as one big chapter though, so you might want to check that out. Hope this helps.
