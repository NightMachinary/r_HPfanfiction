preferrably them as main characters or just ending up together


** ??? It looks like you picked names from HP characters from a hat to get a pairing X). How would they even get to interact?

Good luck on your request

[EDIT] added little smiles because I wasn't trying to sound aggressive but without it, it seems I was.

*** I've seen them end up quite a bit in Post-Hogwarts fics, just wanted to see if there were any that had them as main characters or get a bit more screen time.

**** Oh sorry I didn't mean to sound like that. Wasn't meaning it as an insult but I was finding the concept funny. Didn't know it was a thing though. Fanfic will never cease to surprise me with thair pairing.

** Provocative_envy has two one-shots for the pairing, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4083577][Monochromatic]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15024923][Fixer Upper]].

There's also a longer WIP under [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2137167/chapters/4667919][Dames and Dragons]].
