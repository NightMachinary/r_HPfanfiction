I was looking around for some H/Hr fics and decided to finally give this fic a go after putting it off for a while. But then I realized that it was from Portkey. And Portkey is dead now.

With that in mind, does anyone have a copy downloaded or something that I could get a copy of or something? I already checked on archive.org, and they don't seem to have it.
