Lately, I have thinking about post owls and recalled how I used to read a series that involves owls. This then led me to think about the Guardians of Ga'Hoole series I used to adore during my elementary years. Out of nostalgia, I attempted to search for a crossover between the two worlds. To my dismay, that crossover is sorely lacking any well written fics. So, I was wondering if any writers here would be able take this challenge and make a one-shot or something about the crossover. Any kind of story could be fine with me.

A few ideas in mind might be post owls origins or how owls have their own society within the society of the Wizarding World. It has been awhile since I have read the Ga'Hoole series, but I recall owls have their own form of “magic” as well, I think. I remember embers with different properties. Any of these ideas or something original. All I request is a crossover between the two series.
