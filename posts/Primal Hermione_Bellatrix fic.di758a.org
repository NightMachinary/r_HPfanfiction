:END:
I remember reading a fic 5+ years ago that had the above premise. There was a prophecy and some of the Order were basically evil. I can't find it anymore by searching on FFN but I know it was there that I read it

#+begin_quote
  On September 19th, 1979, the life of Bellatrix Black was forever altered. 16 years and an Askaban stay later, Bellatrix is tired of waiting, and begins the process of claiming her witch. Hermione Granger receives a ring and innocently slides it on her finger, changing her life as she knows it, and paving her path to destiny.
