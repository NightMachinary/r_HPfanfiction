:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
(Disclaimer: I'm new here; don't quite know how this works)

So I'm posting this because I am annoyed and can't find a thing. Honestly, I don't even know if this fic exists or if it's just a dream I had considering I fell asleep reading fanfiction. Warning, most of this is copied from a doc I made before I had an account.

The fic I am looking for is a Hp fanfic where the scarcruxâ„¢(scar horcrux) is sorta conscious and is sorta the "voice in your head" for harry. But, he understands what love is and shit bc he's been stuck in Harry's head(his soul shard possibly having to slightly merge with Harry's soul for a bit to stabilize itself?). Possible Tomarry, but vague remembrance so... Tom turns gray bc he's stuck with Harry's pureness(Harry might turn gray too later on?) Harry is less sassy but instead he's just adorable, think a slightly toned-down version of Hadrian from All It Takes Is A Dream from ao3, which is a creature!Harry fic. I vaguely remember Tom being mad at Snape and possibly Draco bc of how they treat him. I read up until the end of first year, forgot to bookmark/it was a dream maybe considering I fell asleep reading FFN.Net, and now I can't find anything remotely similar. Harry and Tom were planning to find all of the Horcruxes so Tom could be whole again(Tom is sane by now). I might have read a tiny bit of second year(though it's not clear) bc I think Tom combined with the soul shard in the diary and he became somewhat corporeal? 

Only remembered line(I think it pops up a few times):

"Congratulations Harry, you managed to single-handedly turn the most feared dark lord gray"

(or something along those lines)

I can't find it and don't know if it's even real. If it is, please tell me the name/send me a link. If not, tell me so I can write it to the best of my ability bc I'm sad it seemingly doesn't exist.

For why I said possible Tomarry, Tom and Harry are really close and it's currently more like Tom's the big brother but it's bordering on Harry lowkey crushing and Tom finding it adorable(and also being smitten but he's better at functioning like a normal person unlike Harry who's just so adorable and super happy when around Tom).

And before you ask, it's not 'my friend Tom'. I found that one while looking for the one I'm talking about.

I'm frustrated and need answers. Please help!

*** Someone said it might be Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux but I haven't had time to really see if they're right.
