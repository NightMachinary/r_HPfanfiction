** Hmm...if I remember correctly, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation]] has a subplot with various Hogwarts graduates (Slytherins, mostly) being murdered with Sectumsempra curses.

The fic is Hermione Granger centric, as I recall.

*** Is it worth giving a read? I've never really read many Hermione centric fics

**** Well, I haven't really read it for a long time, so I can't say if it meets my current tastes. But it was good the first time I read it.
