:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I read a fanfic many years ago, and I really want to read it again but can't seem to find it.

Plot I remember: Harry never went to Hogwarts, instead he runs away to Diagonally and starts living in a hotel. But it turned out to be more of a brothel. I seem to remover the name Maggie. Harry does some sort of apprenticeship with an older man, could have been in potions can't remember.

He really likes to research the lineage of his family, he accidentally meets Draco Malfoy in a book shop or a library... and they become friends and Draco helps Harry with research. Might have been some dark magic involved as well. this is all I remember, I would be so happy if someone could help me with this.
