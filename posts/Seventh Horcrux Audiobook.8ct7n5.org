Hey guys, I've decided to start doing a reading of Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes on [[https://youtu.be/rA8l3IoK3No][my youtube channel]] 'cause I've got to procrastinate somehow and I'd really appreciate feedback. Only done chapter one so far, but I hope to get the rest done soonish. Enjoy!

EDIT: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIQBacVdjcM&list=PL3BQwj37zyopMszvEHjBEUr1X21RMtFMv&index=3&t=0s][Chapter three is done!]]


** sounds amazing, but don't you dare stop half way like trans neptunium panic zone did. I will be very peeved

*** Cheers pal! Don't worry, I plan to finish. Do you think I should post a new thread here when I finish a chapter, or would people get annoyed by the spamming?

*** ok so I have no involvement with TNPZ but if I had to guess he probably struggled getting all the different readers' parts together and edited. seems like it'd be a lot of work, so I'm guessing OP will have an easier time with 7thH as the only reader

** Great job! I haven't done a re-read of 7th Horcrux for some time, so I'll do it in audio, thanks, I'm looking forward to listen to the rest of it!
