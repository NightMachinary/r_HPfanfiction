I love Severus Snape; yes he can be harsh and rather rude and cruel but I don't know, I love his intelligence and his wit and sarcasm. It's quite difficult for some people to write him and I can be kind of picky with how he's written. Of course if he was a real person there's no way that I would be able to stand to be around how he acted, but still for a reading I love him.

But I'm looking for any well written Severus Snape stories. He can be the main character or a side character or whatever. As long as he's written believably.

Can be as Canon as possible or as AU as possible or anywhere in between.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash. Would rather like it completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

I've read quite a lot of Slytherin Harry and Severus mentors/raises Harry stories, so if you recommend me any of those, maybe give me some that aren't recommended a whole lot. Any other plot is okay.

Very little to absolutely no character bashing.


** Resonance by GreenGecko. Sequel is Revolution. But final book Resolution is incomplete. Great writing.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) has one of the best Snapes in my opinion. Snape features quite a bit as a mentor for Harry, especially since this is a WBWL story (where James/Lily shun Harry). If you want to get a sense of his character in the story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/32/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Chapter 32]] is a good indication of his character (but big spoilers for the first year).

Here's the author's thoughts on Snape in canon vs his Snape:

#+begin_quote
  I had some concerns about this chapter because my version of Snape is, I think, the most OOC of any major character in the fic (although none of you have seen Lockhart yet.:)). To be perfectly honest, I think canon Snape is kind of an awful excuse for a human being, and if he hadn't been played by an actor as charismatic as Alan Rickman, I don't think anyone would have bought his heel-face turn for a second. In particular, I think it's kind of horrible that he only felt remorse over revealing the Prophecy to Voldemort after he learned that it likely applied to the son of literally the only person in the world he cared about. From what I know of canon-Snape, if Lily hadn't been pregnant, Snape would have happily stayed a Death Eater and never spied for Dumbledore.

  Setting all that aside, however, I think the only clear explanation for Snape's actions and character in canon stem from the simple fact that Lily died despite all his efforts to save her. He foolishly drove her away in 1975, foolishly endangered her life in 1980, and failed to save her in 1981. Then, Dumbledore manipulated him into swearing an oath to protect her son - the son who looked exactly like his hated rival James. More importantly, Harry was the son who, arguably, was the real reason she died since Lily would not have been targeted if Harry had been born even a day later. I think that's also the reason why Snape was so hostile to Neville - if Neville had been the Boy-Who-Lived, Lily also might have survived.

  In this story, however, Lily lived. More importantly, she lived and continued to hold a grudge against Snape for the next ten years despite his sacrifices on her behalf. And she raised one of her sons to be the same sort of James Potter clone that canon-Snape believed canon-Harry to be. And she sent her other son to be subjected to the same sort of abusive upbringing that ruined Snape's childhood. And yet, despite all that, Harry has somehow grown up to be the Slytherin wunderkind that Snape wishes he'd been. It was a big giveaway that in their very first interaction, Snape (who is notorious for his own greasy hair) basically orders Harry to improve his appearance. In Snape's head, Harry, Hermione and Jim are replaying the old Snape-Lily-James triangle, except this time, mini-Snape is charming, good-looking, popular and able to defend himself against bullies; mini-Lily has an extremely adversarial relationship with mini-James; and mini-James was so obnoxious from the first day of school that even his Head of House won't protect him from the consequences of his actions. If nothing else, it's highly unlikely that Harry is ever going to lose his temper and call Hermione a "mudblood." As for Neville, now that Snape doesn't subconsciously view him as part of why Lily died, he can look at Neville objectively (and even with a tiny degree of fondness due to the interaction with Frank Longbottom that I invented for this chapter).

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I have a fondness for redeemable assholes, so Snape is absolutely my favourite character in the series. Most of my reading for the past few months has been SSHG, so that's what most of my recs are.

You might enjoy linkffn(Camerado by Milliejoan) which is, imo, fantastic. It follows the sixth-year occlumency trope I adore, and follows canon up to the very last chapter, except for the Epilogue of Which We Do Not Speak. This is very much canon Snape - temper of a rattlesnake and social skills of a mongoose, but a good guy deep down. Way deep down.

I see someone else has recommended Twelve Years in Azkaban's work, which I second - it's probably the most beautifully written Snape I've ever read.

Lena1987 writes a lovely Snape as well - her Snape is a bit less vicious than canon Snape, but wonderfully shy, and I adore it.

Linkffn(Bound to Him) has an excellent Snape as well. He's in a shit situation and has a serious case of foot in mouth disease, but he's trying really hard to be kind to Hermione because he's very concerned about her mental state. The Mcgonagall in this story is an absolute jewel and I adore her beyond reason. The author also wrote a lovely Marriage Law fic that tales place after DH.

Linkffn(The Plight-Trothed Bride by Beaweasley2) has a very canon-accurate Snape. Very ambiguous as well - I left the story not entirely sure whether he actually loves Hermione or is jus making nice so she'll let him back in her knickers. He acts like an utter titweasel for about half of the fic. I mean, when Lucius Malfoy starts telling you to take a look at your behaviour, you might have some issues.

There are a couple of really good mentor Snape fics out there as well, let me know if you want recs.

*** Thanks for the recs appreciate them. I love some of your descriptions: temper of a rattlesnake and social skills of a mongoose, He's in a shit situation and has a serious case of foot in mouth disease, I mean, when Lucius Malfoy starts telling you to take a look at your behaviour, you might have some issues.

Those descriptions made me laugh, so thank you for that. And sure feel free to rec me some good mentor Snape stories, but just be warned ahead of time that I might have already read them since Snape mentors stories tend to be my fave.

**** Thank you :D

I don't read a lot of mentor Snape because they usually ship him with someone, so I can almost guarantee that you've read everything I've read in that genre :)

  Pre-Hogwarts. Harry has been tasked with a quest by his Aunt Petunia to discover himself and who he is as well as find the school which he will be attending. (If this fic had a song, it would Mordred's Lullaby, by Heather Dale. No Beta, but fixing chapters as I go along while posting. Chp. 1-8 fixed)

** Loten's stories on FFnet (notably Chasing the Sun and Post Tenebras, Lux).

The Phoenix trilogy by Grangerous (ffnet, named Phoenix song, Phoenix tears, and Phoenix fire - 3rd story is marked as uncomplete but the only chapter missing is an epilogue so you don't miss anything really). I recently liked stories by Camilo on ffnet.

Sin & Vice by mak5258 on ffnet is one of the best one I have ever read.

Ms-Figg (ffnet) longer stories (if you want plot, the short ones are mostly smut).

And finally (for tonight, I'm tired), A chance for Hapiness by corvusdraconis (AO3), which I loved.

(all of them are Hermione/Snape)

** [[https://lilith-morgana.livejournal.com/244459.html]]

This fic is twelve years old but it was and remains one of my favorite stories about Severus, written from the point of view of his mother.

Here are two short pieces that lent a lot to my own voice for Severus and some insight into his character:

** Have you ever read linkao3(In Between Days by atrata)? It's Snape/Harry, and the version of Snape is brilliantly done: ruthless, cruel, ambiguous, morally damaged, super-intense, brutally intelligent and sarcastic, and determined above all to destroy Voldemort, at whatever cost to Harry. Snape takes advantage of Harry's severe depression after Sirius's death and basically kidnaps him, and for most of the story it's only the two of them cooped up together. Their verbal sparring is tense and amusing and excellently done, and Snape is a right bastard who lies to Harry and manipulates him and uses sex to confuse and control him. But he's also, as in canon, not as evil as he seems. It's a fantastic portrait, and the main difference from canon!Snape is that atrata's Snape is more autonomous and self-sufficient and serves his own ends rather than anyone else's.

Content warning: it's a Stockholm Syndrome fic, and Harry is underage. He starts at fifteen and turns sixteen partway through, and there's plenty of sex along the way.
