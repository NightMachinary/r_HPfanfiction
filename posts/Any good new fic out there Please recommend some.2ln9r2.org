** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10724650/1/Death-Before-Dishonour][Death Before Dishonour]] is a Slytherin Harry AU picking up in sixth year. The plot idea and characterisations are unique, though the there are some typos and a fair number of technical errors. It's essentially about Harry and his Slytherin friends running minor criminal enterprises out of Hogwarts, and looks like it will develop into a kind of organised crime origins story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10557311/1/The-Magnate][The Magnate]] is a "Voldemort won" AU where James didn't marry Lily but a pure-blood woman. Harry is unaware that Lily is his mother and that he's not a pure-blood like his brother. The fic starts with James arranging for Lily to tutor Harry and then moves on to Durmstrang, where Harry is sent because Snape is Hogwarts headmaster.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What you leave behind]] is an AU where Harry is a year older than canon. A fresh twist on the trio rehash, with the focus now on Cedric, Cho and Harry. The author writes each character very well and it feels like canon even though it isn't. Plot isn't moving too fast atm (only 3 chapters in so we can cut him some slack), but its an interesting read.

** Might help to be a little more specific. Narrow down your timeframe, like "started in the last month" and some genres/situations that you like.

** Rather than repeat a bunch of links, I'll point you to the most recent stories in my C2, ordered by publish date in the link (which includes the two that Taure proffered, recommendations that I second): [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Good-Stuff-Edited-by-Perspicacity/93584/99/2/1/0/0/0/0/][link]]. The C2 has stories from a variety of fandoms.

Over on fanficauthors.net, a few new stories by authors of note have been posted: Jeconais's [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/Chapter_1/][Blue Steel]], Kokopelli's [[http://kokopelli.nsns.fanficauthors.net/By_right_of_conquest/index/][By Right of Conquest]], and Deluded Musing's (aka Clell's) [[http://deluded-musings.fanficauthors.net/Peril/Hufflepuffs/][Peril]] and [[http://deluded-musings.fanficauthors.net/Inspected_by_No_13/A_Bureaucrat_is_Born/][Inspected by Number 13]]. None are particularly remarkable, but they're at least serviceable stories by writers who have done decent writing in the past.
