Apologies in advance for the poor formatting of this post - I'm just trying to get all my ideas down in some sort of order.

Theoretical Title: "Neville Longbottom and the Rememberall"

Where this idea came from: A headcanon that a rememberall is actually a device to tell you that you have been obliviated and an aid to help undo the obliviation.

Why this caused a plot bunny: What reason would Augusta Longbottom have for sending Neville an obliviation detector? What has been obliviated from Neville? Why would someone obliviate an 11-year old near-squib?

Off the wall answers: Augusta is as paranoid as Moody. Actually no, she IS Moody. Time travel fic time! Moody travels back in time, and raises Neville after Augusta dies in the attack that sent Frank and Alice to St. Mungo's. Why would Moody travel back in time to raise Neville and obliviate him? He wouldn't! He'd go back with someone better suited to be a time-travel centered protagonist than Neville. Neville died with Augusta! Harry and Moody travel back in time and assume their identities! Moody weaves a complicated obliviation on Harry that strips away bit by bit in order to stop him accidentally/deliberately altering the timeline too much. The rememberall is to help him relive his school years as accurately as possible/undo the obliviation at the right pace. This fic could be canon compliant. Canon!Neville doesn't git real gud until he gets a new wand after 5th year/start of 6th year - Neville!Harry could not be OP in the beginning of the story because he's using Frank's old wand, which is as poor of a fit as possible for him. Neville!Harry actually does a lot of work behind the scenes helping Canon!Harry do his thing.

I want to write this but I'm never going to so I'm sending my disparate ideas out to y'all instead

** I swear I've read a story with part of this. Like I remember it was revealed Neville had been obliviated. I don't remember why she sent it but I think a lot of pure bloods had them. I can't for the life of me remember the story title though or if I remember the rest right. Ill look for a bit to see if I can find it when I get home. I'm pretty sure it's not all of what you wrote but it is some of it.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** I think that story is where the spark for this insanity came from. You know when you read something in a fanfic, you integrate it into your headcanon, and then it rattles around loosely making noise for a bit until something warped pops out?

That might just be me but that's what happened here

**** I will admit that I like the idea of Remembralls being a way to know if you've been Obliviated or not, and gives them a use beyond being the item Harry catches during his first flying lesson that gets him a place on Gryffindor's Quidditch team.

***** Yeah, I mean it's practically one of the only "appears once, does nothing, is never mentioned again" magical artefacts in the entire story and I struggle believing that something so patently useless in universe is well known and sold enough to be identified immediately by several people.

Hell, even Harry's pocket sneakoscope got some sort of mention later in GoF

** If you're going with time-turner shenanigans, why not have the rememberall be a device that Neville (time-travelled Harry) use to remind himself of things he's supposed to ensure happen...

He has to fall off the broom, so Harry will get to be seeker. He has to forget passwords, so that he's conveniently locked out to delay Quirrell He becomes Snape's worst student so Snape doesn't focus on Harry He gives the trio someone to stand up to, so they're already energized and have their wands out...

His boggart is manufactured - something that allows him to make Remus Lupin look cool...

In year 5, he starts getting better so that Harry gets confident in teaching, and at the same time has an opponent who he has to keep improving against... He makes sure to drop the prophecy so no one hears it during the fight in the Veil room...

And of course. Kill the snake.

I could go on!

*** Thats the sort of thing I was going for with the bit about stripping away the obliviation at the right pace!

Congratulations, you are on a very similar wavelength to my fucked up mind

** I've had a headcanon that Neville was Oblivated by Augusta after his parents being tortured but it sort of backfired (that might not be the right term) since she wasn't very good at Charms.

** ... Oh my god, I love the remembrall headcanon so much. Did you come up with that part too? Cause I may not necessarily write this story but I'm interested in incorporating the headcanon into my own story where I have several characters afraid of getting Obliviated.

*** Yes/no/maybe? It's the same sort of thing that I've headcanon'd in the past and it definitely did pop into my head unannounced the other day, but there's a very non-zero chance that I read it elsewhere, accepted it, and then temporarily forgot about it. Which is fitting, considering the subject matter
