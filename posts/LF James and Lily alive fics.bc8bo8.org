Hello! Im looking for fan fics that James and Lily are alive and raise Harry, as well as Remus and Sirius. I recently read this: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1746629?view_full_work=true]] and it was very good but it follows the books exactly which I didnt mind but I'm looking for someone AU.

What do you got? Preferably something long! Thank you all!


** Problem of the most "Potters are alive" fics seems to me the same as for most "Dudley has a witch for daughter" (BTW, always witch, never wizard; why?) and "Peter Pettigrew is discovered and Sirius saved": it is a lovely premise, makes one or two good lovely chapters, but then what? Either there is no idea at all (in case of Dudleys-daughter-is-a-witch) or the structure of the HP universe is so unravelled that the result is massively AU, and most authors have no idea what to do. Just two examples for many:

- linkffn(A Different Halloween by robst) ... sugar sweet start, all Potters and all Grangers (and Dudley; surprisingly Dursleys are ones who die here) live together as one happy family with many other magical friends (Susan Bones, Neville, Luna). Sweet. And the rest of the story is show of inability for put together any plot. Voldemort is truly dead (by some quirk of magic horcruxes don't work) and the author was not able to come up with anything better than a heavy Dumbledore-bashing (evil sclerotic dodger muttering “/Für das Größere Wohl”/; the phrase which in canon he mentions only once as a teenager, and then spends his life regretting it) and general silliness.
- linkffn(One World by Stellar Magic) ... not exactly “Potters live” (they actually do not), but “two Muggle dentists pick up Harry from the wreckage of the Godric's Hollow home, and Harry grows up with Hermione, and Sirius lives”. Again, lovely written beginning (really), and it has some beautiful moments afterwards (everybody loves MI5 Agent Kim Hunter and her putting down mythical Albanian monster), but the result is the same: original plot is shattered, and not everybody is JKR to be able to built a new one, which apparently even the author found out and the story has been abandoned.

The only story from this category (although very limited one, *only* Lilly lives, no, even Harry is dead) is linkffn(6622580), which is one the best written fanfic stories of all, but it is completely different from whatever you have read. For one, it is actually a tragedy in the Aristotelian meaning of the word.

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.

***** Quite certainly, I like it very much. Especially linkao3(1143960) --- Orwell's “1984” with Dementors is just too exquisite combination (actually, I am 48-old guy, I never cry, but the scene with “The White Cliffs of Dover” got me). OTOH, linkao3(3721315) is probably one of the scariest things I have ever read; I really couldn't sleep for week straight. Really really good.

**** Holly is one exception, and I would like to mention here another one, which is probably the least known (also on Wattpad, which seems to be less mentioned here). [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/12122491-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation][Dursley]][[https://www.wattpad.com/story/51279347-dursley%27s-dilemma-sequel-to-dursley%27s-daughter][']][[https://www.wattpad.com/story/12122491-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation][s Daughter]] (and its sequel [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/51279347-dursley%27s-dilemma-sequel-to-dursley%27s-daughter][Dursley's Dilemma]]) is lovely in being completely unpretentious. This is just a High School story not trying to be anything else: no Dark Lords, no weird quasi-mysthicism, no angst. Just crushes (or lack of thereof), struggling with Qudditch captaincy, dealing with the post-school work aspirations, etc. Yes, I like Kipling's “Stalky & Co.”, and so what?

** That's the problem. There is only 2 possibilities with the Potter alive :

- Either Voldemort chose Neville, or someone else dies for Harry (like his grandparents) and you follow the same plot. It is kinda silly, mainly because it's strange that some events happen with a well raised harry (for example he should not as close as the Weasley since they don't have to act as a surrogate familly, yet sometimes he does).\\
- Or Voldemort is trully vanquised, but then you have to find a plot. Who is the new enemy? What are his goals? Why are the Potter so deeply impliqued in the fight with him?\\
You can find some idea : Grindelwald broke out, Albus prophecy obessed, Death Eater remnants or even "Marked as an equal Slytherin Harry struggling to not fall in darkness. But having an idea is one thing, making 7 years worth of plot is another and lots of Eater end up without plot.

** Well this is AU and commonly recommended, so not sure if you read it already. It's a WBWL, but the relationship with his parents and twin isn't antagonistic, which I like because the in-family antagonism aspect is what annoys me about most WBWL fics. The relationship between the Potters isn't a focus of the story, but I was not sure if that was a qualifying factor for you.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
