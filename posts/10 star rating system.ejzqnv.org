I wish [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] and AO3 had a system in which we could rate fics out of 10. It's so much easier to be able to tell the quality of a fic at a glance than to have to sift through all the reviews.

You could not even touch the 1 and 2 stared stories and read the description of the others to see if they catch your fancy, and if they do, sift through the reviews.

â€‹

Then it would be a lot easier to find good fics.

*** 100%, so much room for abuse, and it would not be a reliable indicator of anything.

** You vastly overestimate the tastes of the average reader. Keep in mind that a lot of the "popular" stories on FFN are tropefests with lots of bashing and a lot of the popular stories on Ao3 are porn. A star-based rating system would add very little unless you somehow create an elite pool of reviewers, which would just circlejerk according to their own tastes.

** Review where people explain what they liked and didn't like about a story are infinitely more helpful than just a number out of ten.

Not to mention, that style of rating would be rife with abuse. Any unpopular ships, for instance, would be bombed with one star reviews regardless of quality.

*** The reviews should still be there, but ones with really bad ratings probably have them for a reason. But what you said, about the unpopular ratings, that makes sense.

** Meta is for talking about the sub rather than talking to the sub. You would use it for example if you said there are far too many prompt posts and I really wish we had a weekly limit since they're reducing the amount of interest I have in the sub.

Misc is for when you're not quite sure where it would all go. Maybe you want a discussion but you're also asking for fics that fit the discussion whilst recommending one or two yourself.

*** Thank you! Now I won't get confused, AND now I know that I can use mis to make a mesh of a discussion, prompt, and request!

** Star ratings never work. Look at RoyalRoad. People instantly 5star stories they like, and 0.5 star thinks they don't like.

Then you have the people who review bomb enemy stories.

It's just not worth it. I go by a mix of favs + look through the middle of the reviews. AND THEN~ I go to the last chapter and make sure it is actually the end, and not the author marking it as completed even though it is really dropped or abandoned.
