:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Pretty much all covered in the title, I know harry dabbles in runes, ends up with Luna, Nymphadora, and Fleur (and also has Narcissa and Professor Vector as mistresses?). At some point they create a philosophers stone, and the story ends with Harry and Luna being immortal and handing over the ruling of their island to their son.

ETA: apparently this fic falls under rule 8, never mind!


** That's "For the Love of Magic" on FFN. There's a sequel to it also iirc, but I haven't read it.

*** Personally I think the sequel was better than the fist fic bc Harry comes of as less of a jackass.

** I think the one you're describing was disallowed under rule 8 after much heated discussion.

****** I may be wrong, but I think the rule allows us to say the name and author of stories, we just can't post a link to it and the "I could tell you but it violates Rule 8" is kind of a courtesy "Is this the sort of story you're looking for?" check.
