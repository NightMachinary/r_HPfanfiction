Hello fellow fans. I was wondering if any of you know of a fic that includes harry potter or the whole school becoming catholic. You guys make my life wonderful. Also I highly recommend An Accidental Animagus.

  Do you want your little ones to read books; and they want to read the Harry Potter Books; but you do not want them to turn into witches? Well-this is the story for you! This story has all the adventure of JKR's books; but will not lead your children astray. For concerned mommies everywhere! Blessings! Grace Ann
