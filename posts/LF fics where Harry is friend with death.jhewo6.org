  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** Fair Lady by Kideaxl is one of my favorites.

This is a crossover with Sandman, but I've never read even a page of Sandman and I still loved it. Death is different than in most stories. It's written like a series of one-shots with gaps in between, so every chapter feels interesting and meaningful. And it's complete, too.

  What if that night in Godric's Hollow went differently? What if Harry did die? What if Death stepped in and made a deal with the Savior of the Wizarding World? How different would Harry's life be after that deal?(Or, Harry makes a deal with Death and in exchange gains something Voldemort has fought his entire life for. Immortality. And a strange friendship with Death)

** There is also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11494031/1/Fair-Lady][Fair Lady]], where Harry tries to woo Teleute. Since the story starts a few years before Hogwarts and he's trying to seduce an aspect of existence, it starts off as an easy friendship.

******** Its was probably a deliberate creative decision. Because the movies never went into exactly how insanely old the asgardians are, like Loki doesn't have ANY children in earth 199999 (MCU) and yet has all the children from myth in earth 616 (main comic earth)

Would be alot of extra details that would go over the head of most movie viewers.
