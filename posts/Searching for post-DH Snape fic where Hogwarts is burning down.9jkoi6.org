Hi everyone! I am searching for a fic where (I believe) Snape is in a coma and during this time, Hogwarts refuses to let anyone access the dungeons (by blocking up the entrance) and the Headmaster's office. Hogwarts is also burning up and dying.

I remember two scenes in particular.

A group of them is trying to lay the foundation stones(?) for what is to be the new Hogwarts. However all of them fail as the stone refuses to go into the ground. Snape claims it is easy but when he does it the stone bounces off the ground.

The second is a scene from towards the end of the fic. Snape disappears and later it is revealed that he has decided to sit in the Headmaster's office and to die/be with Hogwarts during her last moments. However, because of this, Hogwarts finds a way to release/get rid of the fire that is killing her from the inside out.

Fic might or might not be slash.

Thanks so much in advance!!
