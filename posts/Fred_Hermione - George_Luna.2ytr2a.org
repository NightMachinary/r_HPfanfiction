I've been looking for some good fan fiction about the twins and a huge plus would be if they were coupled with either Luna or Hermione. Thanks!

*** I tried giving this a go, but by the second time the author mentioned that "it's similar to this other story but not the same' I gave up. I'm sorry but if you need to mention that every 2 chapters, it's clear you've not made much effort to put your own spin to it. That, and it had very mediocre writing. :(

**** Sorry. Its been a long time since I've read it, and is the only W.Twin/Hermione that I've read that is longer than a one shot that I remember.
