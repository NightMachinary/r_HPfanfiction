I've been reading all these fics where Snape is written like a Byronic hero, and while it's fun every now and then I really like to read him as creepy or downright nasty. BUT: I'm not looking for character bashing fics. I don't mind if it's romance (preferably Hermione or Lily if it's het, and Remus or Harry if it's slash). I just want to see Snape being nasty to people, perhaps behaving like a greasy pervert, or humiliating those around him. Something along the lines of that.

Kinda fits what you want, although only in the start really. Snape does soften abit towards the end, but hes still no push over :p

Snape is slightly AU in this fic tho

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2159217/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Final-Straw][Harry Potter and The Final Straw by Bellerophon30]] Decent focus on Snape in this but he's definitely not a good person. Pretty evil in fact, i'll not give anything away but his ultimate fate is needlessly brutal and fantastic. Actually scratch that he fucking deserved it.

This is one of my all-time favorite fics. It's only a oneshot, but I think it fits the description of what you're looking for. Let me know if you like it!
