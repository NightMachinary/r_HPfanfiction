** I don't know who, but I think it's a very legitimate prospect. If James survives, he's just 20 years old. Consider this - the average wizard lives to be over a 100 years old, and some as long as 300 years old. James has more than 10 decades left in his life, why should he remain celibate? He can remarry and still love Lily.

With his survival comes a serious amount of fame. With that fame comes people who are more interested in James's fame than James himself. So I imagine if he remarries, it's someone that he would have known for a long time.

** obviously he would have caved to all the UST with snape.

But more seriously, i think he would have remarried, but i dno't think we know enough about his relationships to make a good guess. Although amelia bones is often a common pairing for sirius, that could work for James based on the same logic. but at the end of the day it could be anyone (except snape)

** It depends on if you're viewing this through our real world lens or Rowling's universe lens.

If James was real, he'd remarry. It's quite common for widowers to eventually remarry, especially if they are that young.

But in the wizarding world, it doesn't seem so common. First, Rowling's pairings tend to be that true love, soul mate type. There are lots of long-term relationships that started at a young age. Not every relationship, but a majority I'd argue. And for those who lost their partner, you really don't see many examples of them remarrying. I think Blaise's mother has several husbands, but it seems clear she was never marrying for love.

So within her universe, while I wouldn't say James absolutely would never marry, it would be unsurprising if he never did.

** I've been wrestling with an idea for a one-shot chracter study based on him surviving and Lily not. Quite a few fics with just Lily surviving have her celibate and completely devoted to Harry and defeating Voldemort. Id give the same thing to James, after about 20 years (he focuses on the recuperation after the war) there's nothing left for him.

He lost the only woman he ever loved, one of his friends betrayed him, the other died fighting, and the last after living most of his life in pain and self-sabotage finally found happiness only to die, leaving his son behind. With the war and his own son no longer as a distraction, James is forced to confront that he's lost nearly everything he holds dear. What he does from there (co-parent Teddy with Andromeda or try to heal and move on from Lily) im not sure.

** I think he would have remarried. We don't really know enough characters in his generation for me to guess who. Tonks seems like an extremely fun pairing. She's younger, so he would have had time to get over Lily and be ready to move on by the time Tonks became of age. And we already know Tonks had a thing for older men üòè

*** I think that's a bit too unrealistic -- remember that she's only five years than Harry. With Remus it's a little different bc he didn't have any children himself, but with James it's likely that he'd be unable to separate her from the girl that likely had playdates with Harry or hung around the other children whenever he visited family friends

or on second thought that might just make for a entertaining sappy romance lol

** It's tough but I don't think he might have remarried atleast until he defeats Voldemort

One thing people underrate in James is his loyalty .. he was extremely loyal to his friends who were actually a neglected rag tag group filled with a disowned child, a werewolf and a boy with no confidence

He was ready to be an aimagus , he supported Sirius financially and he basically believed that wormtail might be a good keeper

If lily had died , James would have made it his mission to defeat Voldemort and his loyalty to lily might have deterred from getting romantic to anyone

Snape not moving on from lily borders on obsession but James might have done the same

** I think he probably would. Most people who are widowed young eventually date or remarry, and men tend to move on faster than women. I think he'd take his sweet time, but he strikes me as a family-oriented romantic; aside from being lonely he'd probably want Harry to have a mother (and maybe siblings). It would make sense for him to struggle with the fact that whoever he's seeing /just isn't Lily/, but I do really like the idea of him being able to eventually let her go (in contrast with Snape's 20+ year long obsession).

This is my favourite scenario for James/Sirius tbh. I'd like to try writing it but it's so hard to get past he thought of killing off Lily :(
