I'm looking for decently written first-year fics (Harry or any other character centric, I don't care) that are preferably completed. I would like them not to be super repetitive of canon, but really anything is fine. Any recommendations?


** linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville) was one I enjoyed a lot.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

**** *Completely different first-year plot:*

[[http://tinyurl.com/jkc2qeu][Alexandra Potter]] - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in a more magical Hogwarts. It focuses on school life and author's variation on magic system. Only the first year is complete, but it stands on its own and theoretically, there is a new version planned. With theoretically being the key word here.

Original Description:

#+begin_quote
  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - Non-BWL Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindelwald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. Strong wordbuilding, slow pacing. Just came out of hiatus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505][Wit of the Raven]] - Heavily AU fic, with an interesting alternative system of magic and more meritocratic Hogwarts. Strong focus on school life and especially school competitions. Dead.

 

*First year plot starts similarly, but spins out in a different direction:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815956][The Leapling (prologue to the series)]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739][Weasley Girl]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9932798][Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past]] - "For a want of a nail" type fic with Ron's gender (we have Ronnie here) being the point of divergence. Stays very close to canon in terms of characters, settings and initial plot, but manages to spin in interesting and original direction. Ongoing, rare updates.

 

*Base plot of the first year close to canon one, but different enough to not be considered rehash:*

Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse, and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of either. Matou Shinji, the protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him a failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets a letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focuses on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements of both settings with author's original ideas. Features Mahoutokoro, Durmstrang, and original magical school. Ongoing, with currently irregular updates.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861][Applied Cultural Anthropology, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus]] - Hermione wanted to be a great witch, and there is a house for those who want to be great - Slytherin. There is just one problem, it may be not the nicest house to be in if you're muggleborn. Nice story about Hermione getting more hardcore thanks to fighting Slytherin bullies. Sadly on hiatus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] - Heavy AU with a Slytherin Harry who has a twin who was raised by their parents. Contrary to what you may expect it's decent. The fic is held down, by using quite a few bad ideas in worldbuilding (though they are mixed with good ones), and weak technical writing in early chapters, but the plot is strong enough to warrant the read. Ongoing with irregular updates.

 

*I have no idea how to categorize this:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469][Lily and the Art of Being Sysiphus]] and its many side stories - An absurdist fanfic with all that it entails. Eleanor (femHarry) is the Death of this world, and so she can't die. With Wizarding Lenin in her head, Uncle Death (of the different world) in the afterlife's waiting room and Rabbit (who is eldricht abomination turned rabbit/Albanian) she lives her rather crazy life.

** Well, quite a big part of Harry Potter fanfiction covers all years at hogwarts(or most likely never gets past year four). So it's more a question of what you want specifically.

Linkffn(pureblood pretense) a fem!Harry, almost OC but very amazing! Just the first that popped into my mind.

*** Newish genre for me. I used to avoid first year fics like the plague because I thought they were repetitive. Then I read a good slytherin story, so I wanted more stories like that I guess. I really don't know what is out there

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!
