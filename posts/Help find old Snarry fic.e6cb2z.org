Can you help find a fic? It's really irritating because I know the plot, but can't find it.

After the war, Snape feels he is entitled to whatever he wants, which happens to be Harry. He seduces him during a ministry function (?) and brings him upstairs. He isn't gentle with Harry. Afterwards, he retires/goes on vacation to a different country.

When he comes back he runs into Harry somewhere, and he has a child with him. Eventually, he manages to find Harry's house by the coast which is very well warded. When he mocks Harry about the child Harry snaps and reveals that it is his kid.

What follows is a really angst slow burn where Snape tries to redeem himself and gain a part in his son's life, and also a part in Harry's. At one point Harry tries dating someone else, and Snape gets jealous. At another point, Snape angsts for a Very Long Time about how he hurt Harry that first time together. I think the ending scene was on a beach with the kid, and also Draco was paired with one of the older Weasley's. Maybe Charlie? Possibly the surviving twin?


** Have you tried Snarryficfind on either Livejournal or Dreamwidth? I'd be curious to read this fic! Someone will probably also tell you to check the HP Slash Reddit too.

*** Thanks for the advice! I didn't realize either of those were a thing that existed. I'll definitely check. I'll update my post if I ever find the name of the fic.
