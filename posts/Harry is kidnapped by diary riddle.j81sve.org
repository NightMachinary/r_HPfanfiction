:END:
Okay. Some time ago I read a fanfiction where riddle wins in the chamber. Escapes and brings harry. When harry reaches his 7the year I think he returns to hogwarts with riddle who is teaching defense. He slowly talks to his old friends, Ginny died. And they end up defeating voldemort (diary riddle is another person than voldemort)

Any help would be appreciated.
