It might just be the way I see Snape, or just the way my mind works, but I've never been able to see Snape as a love interest for most of the characters. Theres one fic I've read in which he has an OC wife, and I enjoyed that, but I don't see it working with other characters.

**** Yarglethatblargle may be right about Rickman's impact on some of the fandom, but I started out in a LiveJournal corner of Snape-fanciers who preferred the book character, and Rickman!Snape bore very little (as in, no) resemblance to him. (I have to pause here and say I loved Alan Rickman, enjoyed him in several movies, and considered him wildly if unconventionally attractive. But as Snape, he was wrong, wrong, wrong.)

I think a lot of people are drawn to acidic, sarcastic, self-destructive, sacrificial characters because they carry around their own electrical charge and create narrative tension wherever they go. Snape is extremely smart (which is sexy), a bundle of contradictions (which is intriguing), self-loathing (which implies backstory hurt), a /highly/ entertaining arsehole (which is vicariously satisfying), cruel and spiteful (which sets up retribution and consequences), trapped by his own mistakes (which I can sympathize with, while knowing quite well he brought it on himself), and loyal to a fault (which is an unexpected virtue in someone so emotionally damaged). He's also intense as fuck, which is something I appreciate in fictional characters. And while the books harp on about his ugliness, most descriptions of him fall along lines I find attractive. E.g., in canon, a large hooked nose is obviously meant to be an unfortunate facial feature, but I'm a fan of hooked noses in real life.

None of this is really an explanation, and I have to add that I'm a slash fan so my criteria may be slightly different from het shippers. But the very fact that Snape is such an unholy mess is part of what I look for in fics about him. I want the relationship to be a struggle, and I don't necessarily want romance. Redemption, perhaps. Possibly tragedy. I want a skinny, unkempt, bitter, intellectually brilliant and emotionally fucked-up, grudgeholding, vicious, desperate, formerly working-class, touch-starved, overworked, thirty-something rage-a-holic whose life has been a nonstop shitshow and who tends to take his thwarted hunger and guilt and grief out on the people around him. I want competence porn, in which Snape is very, very good at what he does, balanced by incompetence porn, in which a stronger and more emotionally stable character backs him up against a (metaphorical) wall and breaks him or seduces him or sends him into a frothing, helpless rage. I see Snape as an obsessive personality, and I like dysfunctional relationships and emotional addiction (in fiction! not reality!), and oh boy does he deliver.

Also, it's important to remember that the mystery of Snape's behavior was a thread that ran through all the books, and fans loved speculating about his reasons for allying himself with the Good while not being good himself. Mystery adds an extra dimension, and many of us formed our sense of Snape before the last book dispelled the mystery with a romance-novel clich√©.

I somehow doubt this long ramble helps you understand, and apologies if it bored the pants off you. But for one fan, this is an incomplete summary of things that make me passionate about Snape as someone I like to read and write about, and whom I ship with a fair portion of the Potterverse.

***** I would give this comment more upvotes if i could

I can't stand FF where Snape suddenly becomes a great romantic hero who was pretending all long. He's not like that at all - he's creepy, emotionally volatile, vindictive, cruel, sarcastic and has a poor grasp on personal hygiene (although I think he knows, he just doesn't care or is so depressed he neglects himself)

He's also incredibly brave, brilliantly clever (hugely sexy on its own), passionate, inventive, loyal and has a great capacity to love. After a crappy childhood and extensive bullying at school, he made a series of bad decisions as a young man and spends the rest of his short life actively making amends for it.

That's why I love Snape so much. He's a complex and intriguing character.

And Alan's portrayal of him was almost perfect. Almost.

***** I rather disagree with your assertion that Snape is "loyal to a fault." I feel like it's anything but - he betrayed Lily to look cool to his death eater pals, he then betrayed those pals to try and get back with Lily, and now he just lives his self-flagellating life as some sort of penance for getting her killed. Sure, that might make him an interesting character, but I think it's a huge mistake to call him loyal.

****** Oh, absolutely no question he betrayed Lily - not deliberately, but that doesn't make it any less of a betrayal. I don't think he did it to "look cool," but because he was trying to prove himself to Voldemort and climb the social ladder, since Snape's childhood ambition was to be powerful. He wasn't there to have fun, he was there to "better" himself. He didn't realize the prophecy pointed straight at Lily. (He was a callous shithead and a bigot, yes. He wasn't intentionally disloyal to Lily - it reads to me like he was too emotionally immature to understand why she objected.)

And he didn't defect from the Death Eaters to "get back with Lily." That seems to be a widespread misconception these days, especially on Tumblr, but it's not supported by the text. He was /trying to save her life,/ full stop. He was terrified that he'd put her in the line of fire. There's absolutely nothing about getting back with Lily, possessing Lily, fucking Lily, any of the things people say about his motivations. He didn't want her to die. He doesn't ask for a reward (except to beg Dumbledore not to kill him). However creepy or unworthy his love might have been, Snape did love her, and it's pretty apparent in the books that JKR straight-up intended her audience to take that love at face value. He's not a creepy stalker, certainly not while she's alive. It's only when she dies that he become obsessed and consumed by guilt.

I was thinking more of his loyalty to Dumbledore, actually, because I do think Snape's refusal to run away when he could have saved himself and left Hogwarts in the lurch was more than self-flagellating penance. His extremely cranky concern about Dumbledore's cursed arm, his reluctant agreement to kill Dumbledore despite the potential damage to his own soul, even his acceptance that Harry had to die when his original vow had been to protect Harry for Lily's sake, all suggest that he grasps the stakes in a way he didn't before. The line "Lately, only those whom I could not save" imply to me that he's fighting for other people now, too, not just Lily's memory.

However, this is just how I interpret the bits and pieces of Snape's backstory, and I can certainly see how it might look different to someone else.

******* In my view, as soon as he joined Voldemort, he betrayed Lily. It doesn't matter whether or not he redeemed. By the way, which he did. But it doesn't alter the fact, he betrayed initially. It's similar to Dumbledore and Ariana. He atoned all rest of his life but it doesn't change the fact he caused the death of her sister.

******** Yes, I know. And I agree, although stories can play with the redemption theme in different ways. Snape made horrific and unfixable mistakes at a very young age, but that's part of what's interesting about him. He left Voldemort's cause after Lily's death, subordinated himself to Dumbledore, indentured himself to a job and a place that stirred up all his pettiest and most painful memories (not counting whatever happened with his family to turn him against Muggles), renounced all his ambitions, and kept to his promise, even though he must have understood it would lead to his death. His dedication didn't change his personality. In fact, the circumstances of his promise probably cemented his inability to change.

That's a complex and fascinating character arc, and there's a lot of room for development and speculation within it. Harry's POV is necessarily limited and inexperienced, and Snape's relentless animosity guaranteed Harry would never see past that side of him.

Snape's got dramatic and narrative potential up the wazoo, is what I'm saying, and that's like catnip for a lot of writers and readers.

**** We only ever see Snape through Harry's eyes so we see the worst of him - they hate each other and Harry is obviously (and justifiably) biased. Harry's hatred of Snape makes him an unreliable narrator

We don't see Snape interact with his other classes, with the Slytherins in private and with his colleagues without this bias. I imagine he would have been a difficult person to get along with but not impossible as long as you didn't annoy him. His colleagues had enough respect for him to be shocked when he killed Dumbledore.

Disclaimer: Yes, Snape is an utter bastard. He treated Harry and Neville like crap and thoroughly deserved Harry's hatred. He was foul to Hermione on occasion (the teeth incident) and biased against the Gryffindors. He needed to grow up and move on.

*** I'm going to disagree with you on this one.

I adore Alan Rickman but I feel he did more harm than good to most viewers perception of Snape. Alan was at least two decades too old for the role and as a result, a great many viewers walked away with the impression that Snape was "old" not just "older". It's an impression which is hard to shift for many readers of fics.

On a personal note, Snape inside my head looks more like Adam Driver who is also about the right age (33).

*** I didn't watch the Harry Potter movies after the 5th one, mostly because by that point I was so spoiled by great fanfiction reads, after which canon- with all its constraints, plot holes, and subjective mistakes- really paled in comparison.

So as a straight guy, I can honestly say that while I wish there was a way to filter them out, I don't really /mind/ gay fics. Live and let live, right?

But the whole Snape character is just so nasty (usually) in both fanon and canon, and in both personality and appearance, that he will always be rather disgusting to me... even when he's the tortured good guy, he's still really disgusting in appearance.

QED, gay pairings with Snape are really nasty to me. Especially since most if them are with characters that have a huge age difference.... So Snape is also a pedophile. Ugh.

** I like Snape as a character. It's really that simple.

I was already an adult (and parent) when the books came out with all the life experience and emotional mileage that comes along with it.

For mine, Snape is interesting because he is morally grey, like the world. His character is developed enough to inspire strong feelings - for good or for ill. Enough is known about him, his character, his past and his actions that all sorts of stories can be extrapolated, without too much being known and boxing you in.

#+end_quote

Do you mean "because Lily rejected him?" Nah, I don't think that's the case. Canon makes it clear that young Snape was mesmerized by the Dark Arts, had a gift for Dark spellcrafting, and liked the idea of being part of a secret society that considered itself special and superior, a group that validated his anti-Muggle resentment and promised him an escape from a miserable childhood. He was already on track to mess up his life, and it's /why/ Lily could no longer be his friend.

Which certainly doesn't make it better from a moral standpoint, but I don't care about that. This is fiction, not reality. Snape's reasons for joining the Death Eaters are complex and tangled, probably having to do with his father and his home life, his poverty, his own personal weirdness as a lonely, funny-looking, neglected, magical child living in a bleak and probably rough Muggle neighborhood, and so on. I love fics that explore Snape's background because we get to see his moral deformity take shape.

There's also the curious detail that he styled himself "the Half-Blood Prince" in school, merging the contentious halves of his heritage into one grandiose title, flaunting his halfblood status alongside his wizarding lineage. It's pretty clear he never shared this fantasy with anyone, but it's a fascinating psychological splinter of insight into the turmoil of student Snape's mind. He was conflicted, and he wasn't /entirely/ averse to claiming his Muggle ancestry, at least for a short time during school. It leaves the question of his identity issues and motives a bit more open to interpretation.

Sorry, I just keep seeing this from a writer's point of view. He's great fic fodder, and whether or not you agree, bastard!Snape is like a magnet for my storytelling impulse.

** I will try to leave the "It's an interesting twist to the story" aside, because, of course it is, and no one can deny that. What makes your question interesting, however, is exactly because some people will never think of this kind of relationship when seeking ideas for their fictions. And it's a really interesting point to explore. What makes certain people interested in writing, or reading, fictions that glamorize villains or, at the very least, anti-hero characters?

I am not a huge Snape shipper, but I am a Tomarry or Harrimort fan, and this is my honest answer as a reader of such fictions.

Most of the stories picturing characters like these have "glamorized" the flaws.

Voldemort, for example, is not a psychotic and psychopathic megalomaniac, but rather a misunderstood vigilante operating from the shadows. Maybe not always to that extent, but most of his flaws are greatly diminished, especially the insanity part. Some will keep the psychopath part, but even then such stories are hardly faultless, as relationships featuring psychopath almost always delve in a terrible abusive relation that can never, truly end well. As such, most fic will smooth the edges of the Villain unless they are picturing an Horror or Tragic story (Butterfly Heart, Verdict of Their Vagaries and Pianissimo comes to mind).

As for Snape, his bitter and vindictive personality will usually not be as pronounced, or at least not as malicious as it is portrayed in cannon. There will be a dry humor, or even a sort of protectiveness to those flaws that makes the character more "endearing". They will twist the character personality to make him attractive, relatable and endearing to the reader if, of course, the wanted result is a fulfilling and healthy relationships. Like Voldemort/X fictions, if the purpose is some sort of tragedy, then it is most probable that Snape will not be glamorized, but the reader, in that regard, is not asked to empathize and relate to Snape, as he will be featured as a villain of the story instead of a Hero.

Outside of the glamorization, another important aspect to understand beneath those relationships are the authority aspect. Snape is pictured as a powerful man with a commanding presence and incredible control, of himself and his environment. Someone you look up to. Most fictions I have encountered with Snape as a ship has undertones of BDSM underneath. The MC paired with Snape will usually relinquish control one way or the other. He will seek protectiveness, attention, security. Something that Snape, being in a position of Authority can provide. (There are exceptions of course, but regardless this is my observation). People are reading, and possibly writing those fictions, as an escape from reality. A fantasy where they can "let go" so to speak.

On another aspect, power is also important. Snape is often pictured, in cannon and in fiction, as a powerful figure, tightly linked with his authority, but also in term of prowess and abilities. This can also contribute to that "relinquishment of control" that I spoke of earlier, but can also serve as a nice stepping stone for an MC to be seen as powerful, especially when put as an "equal". Someone who can snark back, retort and give as good as he gets when interacting with Snape will not be seen as meak, powerless or timid, but rather as fierce and brave, possibly intelligent and witty too. It can be used as a plot device in such manner, although the relationship can also be antagonistic.

I think there was something else... but I just can't remember it.

*** I appreciate the thorough answer :) I hadn't thought of the authority/BDSM figure, but the lessening of the more caustic characteristics is why I can sometimes like him.

**** To be fair, I never particularly cared about that point.

It will either never be mentionned in the fic, or it will be half-heartedly justified with "I never knew them, therefore, I don't care." or "down the line it's dumbledore fault".

I'd rather not have Harry's parent mentioned than have those kind of lame excuses. My interest lies in the character development (usually insane or dark!harry) and the subsequent plot than his link to the past.

Another way to bring this is simply throw every character in a Major AU where Voldemort is not responsible for Harry's parents death (Death of Today, the Train To Nowhere, and the Ouroboros comes to mind). Featuring Time Travel, with baby harry thrown in the past (The Time of Loves and Rogues) so that he just never learns about his parents, or it's truly inconsequential to the story, or simply have Harry born at the same time as Voldemort (Rebirth). Having him being much, much older so that he just "doesn't care" about anything is also something used often (Again and Again, October, Stand against the Moon, The Nightmare Man).

I find that these plot devices are actually the best way to make the story slightly more plausible when related to the cannon, as Jame's and Lily's death truly becomes irrelevant through the story, rather than attempting to shoehorn a lame excuse in the middle of it, when the author remembers who is his characters.

But, sincerely, I just ignore or forget that fact in most LV/HP. It will be, down the line, irrelevant and you kind of have to make do with it as the relationship itself is so far from the Canon, it's laughable.

EDIT: Also, you get desensitized to the whole plot holes the ship inevitably ends up being the more your read stories about it. It's kind of like easing yourself into fanfictions for the first time. You may start with almost canon!rehashing until you slowly introduce yourself to more divergent ideas and stories. Progressively you can delve deeper without feeling shocked by it all.

It was kind of the same for me. I think the first Harrymort I read was Death of Today, which is so far from canon that the ship was not so jarring to wtiness (the writing itself is masterful and story was a delight to boot), as none of the possible plot holes (beyond age) was relevant. I then pursued until I fell into more disturbing and clashing fictions (Butterfly Heart, The Courtesan, Pianissimo, The Time of Love and Rogues, Hauntingly, etc.).

** He's one of my favourite characters, but I do not see canon Snape as a love interest at all. He's great in comedy fics like the one where Slytherins are talking to him about careers or the ones where he's interacting with Lockhart because it's like watching Gordon Ramsay yell at people. He's also a good dramatic character and so central to the plot with such an extensive backstory that a lot of interesting material could be drawn out of him.

In most Romance fics, Snape is incredibly OOC like a shitty romance novel "dark and broody" character. I've seen one where he wears a ribbon in his hair, plays the piano and drinks whiskey by the fireplace. I think /Why the ladies love Snape/ sums it up pretty well, and he's also probably attractive to BDSM enthusiasts because frankly the canon version seems like he would be way into that. He's just... gothy.

** I actually see Snape as analogous to Darth Vader. Dark, menacing, competant and ruthless. He isn't the real big bad, but he is nasty enough to substitute when Sidious/Voldemort are taking a break. Of course, both characters got redeemed at the end, and both ruined their lives out of love.

Now disregarding all of that, I really don't understand how people are able to romance him. I grew up with the HP books, and I have a very strong separation from the movies. Yes, they were decent enough, but book Harry is very different from movie Harry, and so Alan Rickman, while an amazing actor, never was able to become "Snape" for me. So if someone only saw the movies, I could maybe forgive the constant "Snarry" bullshit floating around, but otherwise, I personally cannot feel any kind of sympathy with him, not enough to enjoy romance involving him at any rate.
