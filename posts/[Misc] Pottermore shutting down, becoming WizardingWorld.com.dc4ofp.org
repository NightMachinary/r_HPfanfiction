Thought it was relevant.


** u/Taure:
#+begin_quote
  Here you can delve deeper into J.K. Rowling's stories with articles on wizarding world themes, *from a broad range of authors offering their thoughts*
#+end_quote

Hmm... if articles don't indicate whether they were written by JKR or not, this definitely complicates the canon status of material on this new website.

** A name change desperate to once again make those awful FB films relevant.

You know, the ones so bad where the lead actor was so bad at playing "shy" everyone thought he was playing a stereotype of autism as oscar-bait...

** So it's validating /everything/ as canon, even though FB contradicts the original information...

Well, I never paid much attention to Pottermore anyway. This doesn't really change anything, except for adding to my disappointment in JKR.

**** By changing the name from just ‘Potter,' she's saying everything is canon, not just the books. It's a slap in the face to everyone who said, “um, really?” to FB and CC. She didn't get the reaction she wanted so now she's forcing it upon us.

** Somewhat frustrating that it insists on linking your new account to your old Pottermore account, so you can't take the new sorting unless you've never taken it before.

I even went so far as to delete my account, then went to create a new one. But nope. It remembers your old account and basically reactivates it.
