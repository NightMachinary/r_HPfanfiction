So I just discovered this subreddit today after finishing (the four that have been so far completed) the James Potter Series by G. Norman Lippert.

I was looking for some story recommendations and found this subreddit. After looking through some of the previously posted suggestion threads and not seeing G. Norman Lippert mentioned anywhere I thought I'd do a search to see what other people on this subreddit thought of it. I searched and searched but found only one mention of the series at all on the entire subreddit.

Am I just not using the search function correctly or is this really the case? I'm confused because as far as I can tell not only is the James Potter Series the largest (word count in the first four books alone nearly equals the entire original series) fan fiction I've ever come across, but it's also one of the only ones I've ever seen that is written as well as it is.

I would happily discuss why I feel it is the best Harry Potter fan fiction that exists (at least as far as I've read) if anyone is interested in that, but what I really want to know is why it seems to be not mentioned anywhere on this subreddit? I was under the impression that it is also by far the most read Harry Potter fan fiction. I mean his stories have been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times from his own website alone, and thats only the people that found his website and downloaded from there, I torrented all four books before discovering he had a website.

Additionally, it is without a doubt the only HP fan fiction I've seen to achieve the level of media attention it is. It spawned a long running rumor that JK Rowling herself was writing them. The author was interviewed about it on the local affiliate of Fox "News" and further aired by multiple affiliate news stations across the world. Then it was almost shut down for copyright infringement before Rowling herself read the first book and decided not to sue.

(DISCLAIMER: There is some debate as to exactly what happened with that, the official statement is that Rowling never read the book herself for legal reasons but had members of her "team" read it and made the decision after discussing it with them. That said, I can't think of a single "legal" reason she wouldn't be able to read the book, I choose to believe the other story that she herself read it and enjoyed it so much she wouldn't allow it to be shut down as long as it was not being sold)

While I obviously immensely enjoyed the stories they do have some personal failings for me. I'd have preferred more "mature" content and less focus on American Wizards and their odd fascination with combining "Muggle" Tech with magic (It was cool at first, but to much of a good thing quickly becomes boring) for example.

All that being said I guess I have two questions for everyone.

1. Why does it seem like no one ever talks about what is if nothing else the most widely read HP Fan Fiction ever written?

2. Can anyone that might have read this series suggest something similar in length, scope, and writing talent? Preferably with more mature adult content (I'm not looking for literary erotica, just more realistic content).

TLDR: Why does no one talk about the James Potter Series by G. Norman Lippert and can anyone suggest any HP Fan Fiction of similar length?


** On the whole, this forum doesn't seem to care much for next gen fics. Harry-centric stuff seems to be sought after most commonly. This is likely why there's nothing much about this series.

As for "by far the most read fanfic" -- doubtful. Do you realise how long the HP fanfic community has been active? How many fics have been written? How many BNFs were writing stories that were getting HUGE readerships back in the day when BNFs were a thing? (I mean, they might still be but I never see them talked about.) The JP series might be popular where you're hanging out, but that's hardly reflective of the entire fandom. As a whole, we must be one of the biggest fandoms to exist online; there are going to be a lot of people that have never heard of this series. I've been in the fandom for over 10 years now I've only seen it briefly because I never had any interest in reading it (next gen isn't really my thing) so I never got into the circles where it was talked about and hyped over. Media representation is also not that indicative of quality or fame because it really depends on WHAT media is covering it and what kind of audience that media reaches.

As for length, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2ytpy0/whats_the_longest_completed_fanfic/][this thread here]] has multiple fics just as long and longer. When someone writes a fic longer than the [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sacrifices_Arc][Sacrifices Arc]], then I'll be impressed. (By the way, the Sacrifices Arc is over 3 million words and contains mature content, if you wanna go check it out. Also AU and slash, just in case they're not your thing, and multiple warnings for psychological child abuse, rape, torture, graphic gore and violence, and major character death.)

** When DH came out I was intrigued by the next gen and read a few fics by some of the big name authors I followed. But I decided it just wasn't for me. The next gen kids are just... Lacking in canon characterization that it made it difficult for me to read any fics with them. This is similar to why I don't read marauder fics. I also rarely read anything about or from the pov of an ancillary character. Or gen fic really either. We all have our preferences, and sadly I think next gen just isn't a popular genre to really be discussed here too often

As for the length, there are tons of long fic out there. Maybe not as long as the one you're talking about, since I have no idea how long it is. You could check on ao3, and use filters when searching. I like to search for a minimum of 40k word count and then I sort by kudos. Not sure if ffn has similar search features.

** I've read the first book, and I often rec it on here when people occasionally ask for Next Gen. Haven't gotten around to reading the others. I liked the story, but I felt that the plot was very dry. In fact, I rolled my eyes at the arrival of Merlin. That was weird. Here are a few other good Next Gen fics to read:

#+begin_quote
  1) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] by Inverarity. It's about Teddy and his first year at Hogwarts. The author also writes this really good series about an American witch named Alexandra Quick. None of the Harry Potter characters ever show up, but there are little mentions from time to time (Weasley Wizard Wheezes, for instance, made it over to America).

  2) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8255131/1/Ignite][Ignite]] by Slide. I found this one to be very engaging, and the characters were interesting.

  3) [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=240987][Delicate]] by padfoot4ever is a cult favorite. If you can get past the poor writing at the beginning, the author really improves and gets better over time. This story pretty much started the Rose/Scorpius hype. It's got a sequel that's worth checking out as well.

  4) Anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] is worth a look. He's got a gazillion stories all in the same universe. Whatever you want, he's probably got it.

  5) Similar to above, you should check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]]. She's got a ton of stories about life after Hogwarts, but they are a little more fluffy if you are into that sort of stuff.
#+end_quote

All in all, you shouldn't restrict yourself to just Next Gen. There's a lot of great fanfiction out there, and the community is absolutely huge! HOWEVER, a lot of these guys seem to be dissing the stories that don't focus on Harry...and they clearly don't seem to understand the point of fanfiction. Fanfiction can be whatever you want. In fact, I rarely ever read stories with Harry as the main character. He's still my favorite character, but I read seven books about him so I want to know what people think about other characters. Sometimes it's Next Gen...sometimes it's random people like Percy or Luna. My favorite stories are about Harry's parents, and you don't see much of that on here either (lots of Snape defenders). Just because it isn't the most popular on THIS subreddit doesn't mean there aren't people who like it. Sometimes this subreddit annoys me because they think everyone should agree with them (as a Ron/Hermione shipper, I feel very vulnerable), but there great writing tips and discussions sometimes.

As for James Potter being the best? I don't know. Maybe I should read the other books before I can agree or disagree.

I don't really talk about it because I didn't find it all that interesting. Same for why I don't recommend it. It's also pretty well known so I don't bother as it's likely they've already heard of it. You don't see Methods of Rationality recommended much here for probably the same reasons.

My go to author recommendation is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]], especially [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9992917/1/Friends-and-Foes][Friends and Foes]].

*** I second this, Strangers at Drakeshaugh is fantastic. It is post war, with a mature (as in sophisticated) writing style and characterizations. I feel like it's HP fanfiction all grown up. The plot is mellow, but also is tense and suspenseful at times. Comparable to a good quality BBC Drama/Mystery show. Northumbrian is very refreshing author. I know my description sounds a bit pretentious. but it is a good read (WIP and worth it).

******* Ah, I missed that, sorry. I think you're right though, Northumbrian's updates are not too slow.

I enjoyed it. It feels a bit wrong to read a chapter of HP fanfiction that is 95% OC, but darn it, Northumbrian writes good characters.

Two questions on Camelia if you're up for it:

1. I don't think JKR did much of anything in canon with Vampires. Specifically I don't think their ability to turn into a bat/cloud of bats is ever mentioned. If it's not, I've got no problems with it. It is a very Bram Stoker style interpretation of vampires that I haven't seen in most fics. Your thoughts?

2. Do you think Northumbrian is referencing literary character [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmilla][Carmilla]] in Camellia? Young, female, classic style of vampire written just before Bram Stoker's version.

******** 1. I agree-I don't think JKR said much about vampires so I'm wide open to his interpretation. I think the whole cloud of bats thing is a little bit cheesy, but it is nice and old school! It gives a retro vibe.

2. I haven't read that so I looked it up on wikipedia. It does look like it could be a nod to it but it could be a coincidence :) Carmilla was born in 1698 and Camelia says [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8458913/1/Killers][she was born in 1766]] so I guess they aren't meant to be the same.

You bring up a good point about the OCs and it's awesome how he writes them. They're more fleshed out than most of fanfiction's Harry, Ron, or Hermione.

********* 1. A bit cheesy, yea, but to some people all of HP would be cheesy. I do like the retro feel. The geographical isolation of the setting, the mythos of the moor and the more classical characters gives it a richness.
2. Carmilla/Camelia could be a coincidence. I don't think they would be meant as the same person, just that the author might have named their character as a reference to a vampire classic.

I think fanfiction is essentially an assisted-daydream. We don't require (or don't mind) that canon characters aren't fleshed out, because they already exist in our memories. Fanfiction is a literary skeleton, /what if:time travel...what if:Indy!Harry/, that is mainly held together not by the fanfic-author's writing skill but by the reader's imagination and memories. Most of the effort put into a fanfic is by the canon author. They created the characters we love, that fanfic writers just tweak, and are always relying on the reader's knowledge and love of cannon to fill in the gaps. I know that it takes a lot of time of skill to write a quality 100K+ word fanfiction, but it's always dependent on canon as it's foundation. That being said, a compelling OC character is a credit to the fanfic-author. It is their own talent that has drawn us into investing in the character. Especially if it is a muggle character, which is the case in /Strangers at Drakeshaugh/. With a muggle character, JKR has no claim over any of their attributes, and there are no flashy qualities to attract the reader i.e. having your OC be a mystical mage, or anything that's specific HP magic system. Northumbrian does flesh out his OC's amazingly. I know a lot of young families like the OCs, and I was drawn into the character's experience as it mirrors real life so closely.

** The reason its not really showcased on this Subreddit is a multifaceted answer. This subreddit leans extremely toward Harry Potter gen fics. NOT next-gen. Also, G. Norman Lippert's work is harder to get a hold of than the works that are common here. We can type our title into a bot command and have it linked. that is much more difficult with his work. Also to be fair it is NOT the most read fanfiction on the internet for harry potter. That title goes to Methods of Rationality. Lippert's work is the most *downloaded* work. since you can only read it by downloading. Which oddly enough this particular subreddit is not a major fan of.

** I have read james potter and I think there are several strikes against it. One is that it's a next gen fic-- this IS the Harry potter fanfic subreddit. Next gen fics always seem to get a little bit short changed. I don't think this is anything against the fic, just the fact that it moves it's focus away from Harry lowers its appeal. Secondly, it's not finished - I know that the individual books are finished, but when people set out to read a million words, you know, they want to get to the end. And there are LOTS of fanfiction, even if you're only looking for completed, well written fics of more than 500k words (I chose that number because that's the word count of war and peace) you have lots and lots of options. Third (and this is a personal peeve of mine, so forgive me if it's a little petty) but I read fanfiction on my phone and the fact that there isn't a way to read james potter other than on a pdf drives me nuts.

As for your other request, this subreddit has new thread titled "I need good long complete Harty potter fanfiction" every two weeks. Keep an eye out for them. This was the most recent one. Should keep you busy for a while.

*** All of his books are available directly from his website and now conveniently come in epub editions. Which can be easily read from your phone using multiple free apps. So that takes care of your third strike at least ;)

As to the second strike, personally I don't mind waiting for a book to come out, it's not any different then when I had to wait for Rowling to finish her books or any of the professional authors whose works I read. That does apply only for works in which at the very least the writing skill of the author is enough to be considered "professional" which if nothing else I think this series is that.

As to the first strike... I don't understand the fandoms love of rewriting the original canon. To me I would call that AU more then I would "fan fic" although there really is not be all end all definition of fan fiction. I guess partially because I love the original series so much that I prefer to keep it the way it is, my only problem with the original series (and Rowling herself) is that the story never really felt finished to me. There was/is so much more to be told, the immediate aftermath of the battle for Hogwarts, the complete dismantling and rebuilding of the Ministry of Magic, Harry and the gang becoming aurors (or not and pursuing different careers). Those are just a few off the top of my head.

Thank you for the link, I will be checking that out for sure.

**** Your preferences aren't uncommon; large parts of the fandom prefer non-rewrites of original canon. But that's the thing -- everyone has different preferences and every community has their leanings as well. I read little of what's most popular here, but I'm glad to see this subreddit diversify as it's grown, and there are people to give recs for any kind of fic you'd like. On the rare occasions people want light minor character/next gen fic, I'm here.

*** I'm relatively new to the "fandom" I read each book as it came out and I've probably read the series itself a dozen times or so, but I was never really into the fan fiction stuff until very recently. I mostly read epic fantasy by authors like Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson, so I prefer a more epic scale and lots of well fleshed out characters. Well written battle scenes are a must for me as well. Nothing makes me give up on a story quicker then poorly written action.

I enjoy what I guess would be called "next-gen" I like leaving the original books and canon the way they are and focusing on new characters, although preferably related (doesn't have to be by blood) to the original characters and with good cameo's from them.

I saw the Alexandra Quick stories but did not check them out yet, are they worth reading?

** I've been reading HP ff for over 10 years and I've never even heard of the stories you mentioned. I'm a member of multiple forums and actively search for new things to to read and not seen it mentioned.

For the most part I only read Harry centric stories so that is possibly why I've not come across them. It's called "Harry Potter" and I'm not particularly interested in the story of his son who is only present in one scene making him as much a real character as Daphne or Tracy or Eloise Midgen. Any story about the next generation has left JKR's world and started making its own.

*** That is a fair point, although one I disagree with. A fan fiction does not have to focus on the main character or even a major character of the original content in order to be good or considered in the same world. Any story written in the same world as the OC should be considered a fan fiction of that original story.

Personally I prefer fan fiction that takes place post HPDH and focuses on either new characters or the original characters lives after the events the original series.

That said was down voting the topic itself really necessary? Even if the topic is not your cup of tea the down vote (when talking about threads) should really be saved for topics that do not pertain to this subreddit, not just ones you don't like. It reduces the visibility of the thread, meaning people like me who care about this topic have less of a chance to see it.

You didn't even make any suggestions as to fan fictions to try out. If you're not going to contribute to the threads topic and instead are just going to post negative remarks why even bother responding in the first place?

********** Yes, slash usually means m/m relationship.

The only fully next gen one I can find is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4215748/1/The-Comprehension-Series][The Comprehension Series]]. 157k words. It's Albus Severus/Scorpius eventually. No real summary given though and I can't remember what it's about.

There's also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/608957][The Price We Pay for Wings]]. a short one, at 13k words, but really unique. It's kind of preslash Harry/Draco but the next gen kids play a big part of this story. One of my favorite fics, and it's worth the short read if only for the lore the author brings into it.

You can also search by tag on AO3. You just click a characters names, or a pairing, or a keyword and it'll create a search for you. I made a search for you based on [[http://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=word_count&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=0&tag_id=Harry+Potter+Next+Generation][Harry Potter next generation]], and then sorted it by word count for you.
