Edward Dawn, Pureblood, second child of the Ancient and Noble House of Dawn, son to Benjamin Dawn and Celia Dawn n√©e Greengrass, brother to Ethan (the heir, Ravenclaw, and three years older), cousin to Daphne Greengrass, meets Harry Potter on the train to Hogwarts. He gets sorted to Gryffindor. He's bold, outspoken, troublemaker (much to McGonagall's exasperation), and very smart. He's a friendly rival to Hermione, fighting each other for the first place. He is a transfiguration prodigy, and gets an apprenticeship with McGonagall in fifth year (after taking his OWLs and NEWTs early in the subject). Later Prefect and Head Boy, and he becomes a transfiguration teacher and head of Gryffindor House. He's best friend with Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom.

He teaches Harry about the Wizarding World (being the heir to House Potter, traditions and etiquette), helps him deal with the fame, as well as, dealing with the Dursleys with help of his parents. Benjamin and Celia become the parent figure Harry always wanted. They teach him a lot of things (Benjamin being a former Ravenclaw and Celia a Slytherin, he learns plenty), and Ethan becomes his honorary older brother. Harry and Edward starts liking each other, which everyone can see, and eventually they start dating in fifth year. In the future (after the war and everything), they become happily married with Edward taking the Potter name to continue the line.

Harry/OC, Neville/Hermione, Sirius/Remus (or not), Dumbledore bashing (manipulative, not evil), No Weasley bashing, though they're not much relevant (except maybe the twins when Edward helps with the pranks), Malfoy and Snape are still assholes, Mpreg.

Note: If this fic gets written and reaches to the end, don't name their kids James or Lily. Be creative.


** Since it appears that you're Sirius (bc I honestly thought this was a troll earlier)...why not a surrogate and a canon OC in all but name or a minor character? You have McLaggen, Boot, MacMillan, and Goldstein. Maybe Diggory or Eddie Carmichael.

What you've presented here is a super Mary sue and almost everything that makes a Haphne/Harmony/Snarry; sinyk/robust story horrible.

*** I hardly think Ronald taught Harry anything, much less wizarding tradition and etiquette, nor was he particularly bright. He's my least favorite character, and prone to jealousy.

**** Quick question: Are you talking about Movie Ron or Book Ron? Because if it's Movie Ron, that makes perfect sense, but if you're talking about Book Ron, he wasn't /exactly/ what you want in this fic promt, but he is definitely supportive, loyal and smart.

And the jealousy happened only twice over seven years. The first time was because of a bunch of crap being piled on him over three and a bit years and being in the throes of puberty, which only lasted less than a month. The second time, a horcrux was involved, and he was immediately regretful of it. I think that's a pretty good track record.

***** I suppose it's a bit of both, but I still don't like him. I had this in my mind for so long, and I don't think I have the necessary writing skills to write it. It would be cool to read how Harry and the Dawns figure out Dumbledore's manipulations, and what to do against him while also helping Harry gain independence and teaching him his heritage. It's not particularly unique or anything, but I like that they're going to be a couple. üòÅ

****** Okay, mate. I'm going to be blunt, so sorry in advance. Barely anyone is going to want to write about someone else's Mary Sue, fix-everything OC unless they're paid or something.

Hell, you could make a ‚ÄúNice Draco Malfoy‚Äù fic and still achieve the same story beats that you've outlined.

The best thing to do is to write it yourself, even if you think your writing's bad, because that's the only way to improve.

And a few tips when making an OC or just a character in general. Ask yourself the following questions:

What flaws do my characters have? - How does this affect them? - Do they see it as a flaw?

What do they desire? - How do they go about trying to get it?

What do they actually need? - Do they know what they need or not?

How will my character grow and change over the course of the story? - Do they change their desires over time? - Do they learn something about new themselves?

You can find a bunch of videos on YouTube on character analysis that can really help you out.

Again, sorry if I've come off across as rude, I'm just trying to offer advice which you can choose to ignore if you want.

******* No, you're right. If I want to improve my writing skills, I have to practice my writing. And as you've said no one would do something for free. Also, I'm not offended, I'm actually grateful for your advice. It might help me in the future, and I'll definitely be following it. Thank you for replying.

** I do kind of like the idea of Harry being befriended by the kind of Mary Sue, Indy!Harry trope character (sans nigh-obligatory edginess) and actually being slightly overshadowed by him before they start to balance each other out in the dating stage. It'd be an interesting opportunity for deconstruction and trope-flipping/fuckery.

** I kind of like it, if the someone write it with good balance between the OC's strenghts and flaws it might be good, because admit it, the too great characters make the story too boring and unreal. It would be nice reading it.
