If you don't know, a Jarvey is a type of magical creature that swears and says other rude things. A lot.


** This series I recommend and it has a (Fairy God-)Jarvey Narrator. The others below just reference Jarveys or they are not the narrator.

** I don't know any fics where a Jarvey is the narrator, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/25789][evansentranced's The Library of Elvish Lore series]] has a great and hilarious Jarvey.

linkao3(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them by evansentranced) is the first installment of the series.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.
