Update! the fic is called The wicked stepmother by excentrykemuse, however is not available on ao3 would anyone have a pdf? The marauders dare lily to attend an exclusive pureblood club where upon entry you receive a coloured card according to your magic. Lily receives a Black card the only other one belonging to Tom riddle. Thanks for any help ðŸ˜Š


** Well, I did find just about all of their [[https://web.archive.org/web/20120723155341/http://www.fanfiction.net/u/383313/excentrykemuse][stuff]]. This was the last the site the site was updated before they deleted everything. As far as I can tell, I find no record of a fanfiction under that name by that author. If you give me a bit, I can try Ao3.

Update: Tried to find the Ao3 archive, but it was only scanned once, in 2014. By that time, all their works had been deleted. The places I can usually find archived fics have a noticeable absence of them. I think I might just start my orn fic archive for all my favorite fanfics so that I can post them if they're ever lost.
