** In rough order:

Chapter 1

- I know the acronym "DADA" is standard in HP fanfic, but I dislike it. The natural way to shorten "Defense Against the Dark Arts" in speech is to call it "Defense".
- Gabrielle idolizing Harry Potter when she's eight years old is fully understandable. Ten years later? Not so much. Moving to Scotland to follow him? Not without some other compelling reason. With this start, I'm quite scared that you will not treat Gabrielle as a real character.
- When you're in your mid-twenties, you don't think of someone your own age as a "young woman". That's reserved for people at least five years younger than you.
- "Nymmie" -- it sounds like Harry uses that to rib Tonks frequently. It would lose its sting with overuse, though, and I would expect a gentler reaction.
- The age gap between Tonks and Harry is seven years. A bit much for a relationship. With Harry apparently being Tonks's boss up until the start of the story, their relationship strains credulity. Not impossible, but still.
- Harry being promoted from cadet to head auror in seven years? That would require him to seriously lean on his political capital.

Chapter 2

- As an aside, if I had a little stick that I had to hold onto or be nearly defenseless, I'd put a bloody strap on it and tie it to my wrist. Nobody does this.
- Real teachers probably wouldn't call their students "exceptionally beautiful" unless it's in private and they're trying to have sex with them. And real students following British cultural norms would not kiss their teachers.
- Having your first class session be a live fire combat exercise is dangerous and disingenuous.

At this point, none of the characters have given me a reason to care about them. There's Harry, apparently a brash never-tell-me-the-rules bastard using his fame to get jobs and avoid punishment, something of a womanizer. There's Gabrielle Delacour, who has nothing more important in her life than a ten-year-old crush with someone who met her once ten years ago. And Daphne Greengrass and Nymphadora Tonks have been mentioned once or twice, but there's not enough there to catch interest.

On the plus side, your grammar and spelling are head and shoulders above average. It's refreshing.

*** Cool, thanks for the feedback. The story is currently in its infancy, so I'm still fleshing out the characters; once that's done, it'll hopefully make the relationships more realistic.

** Hi all, please let me know what you think about my story and how you would like to see it play out. I don't really have any defined plotlines for the future, so all suggestions are welcome! Thanks, mnidl

** Also, this is completely unrelated, but if anyone can recommend stories that make your heart ache (my favorite stories & authors show some that I love already), that would be greatly appreciated. -mnidl
