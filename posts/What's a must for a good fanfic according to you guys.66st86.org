I don't know why but the quality and quantity asides a really good fanfic for must have, at least at some point, a Harry/Daphne pairing or be a Slytherin!Harry fic. Preferably both, but not neccessarily. Don't get me wrong. A fanfic can be amazing to me without containing the above (ie: HPMOR) but if I was given to equal in quality fics, with one of them containing the above and the other not, well I'd give the prize of best fic to the first one. What provokes a simillar reaction to you guys?


** Some thinks that IMO Make a good fanfic (regardless of shipping) 1. The characters must stay at least in the beginning in character, for example not a nice snape without a reason; of course the characters can and must change in the fic but it has to be believable 2. No god deus machina nor asspulls to save or doom characters just because, if something happens it must be believable 3. At least IMHO self-inserts are a big NO also it's NOT a place to rant about racism or homopohia etcetera. 4. If possible it must describe the area and objects,specially if they're new (but it's not really that important for me)

*** I will add to the third point that, in my opinion, self-inserts are not a bad thing in and of itself but the fact that it is a character that is supposed to be the author's avatar makes the overwhelming majority of people write them as better than they are (so that they'd be seen as better, I guess; not like people ever think that the author is the same as their self-insert), to the point where they are Mary Sues. And Mary Sues are shit that almost certainly make for a lower fic quality with their mere presence.

** My number 1 requirement is that the fic be either complete or is actively updated. I don't read abandoned/dead fics because I don't see the point in only reading half a book.

Everything else, such as pairings and whatnot, is mutable. I'm not one of those who hate certain pairings, except for maybe LV/HP, and I'm willing to read very bad fics if the premise interests me.

** Well, to make it readable there has to be no bashing whatsoever. No one dimensional characters. 2D is baseline. They don't have to be super complex or nuanced, but I have to recognize them as people.

To make it actually good, they need to take that step up to 3D and understand the circumstances and motivations of the characters they are writing. They have to gain insight into how characters might react to situations and then extrapolate how they might react in other situations. They have to understand how characters interact, and how situations produce unintended consequences.

But that kind of thing requires lots and lots of self-awareness and empathy. So I'll settle for 2D most days.

** At an absolute minimum:

- 99% error-free writing and readable formatting.

- No bashing (of characters or societies).

- No glorification of Muggles/science/technology.

- Harry-centric.

- Harry is not emotionally weak.

- Harry is at least above-average at magic.

- Magic has not been nerfed.

*** I have to protest that list. Having “Harry-centric” as one of the points of “an absolute minimum” is kind of nonsense if you are talking about objective (or anything trying to be objective) quality as opposed to personal preferences. Take “Cauterize” by Lady Altair, for example; do you want to say that this is a bad fic because it does not fulfil that particular arbitrary requirement? Or “My Master's Bride” by Paimpoint. Or “Last Chance” by Laume. None of them are objectively bad stories, and I would even wager a guess that they do count as good, and yet none of them is Harry-centric; in the first one Harry is just one of many characters and the only importance he has is that we know he was a main character of the original series, and he isn't in the other two at all.

As opposed to the example of Harry/Daphne given by the OP?

I'm not sure that you've read the OP properly. It's entirely about personal preferences.

***** What is wrong with that one arbitrary requirement is that this is something cannot, in any way, be chalked up to being in any way related to the quality of a story. It is not, in any way, related to that; it is something you can require from a story to like it, but not something you can set as a requirement for the story to be good.

That is what the problem is. That, and the fact that I expected better from Taure than not to know about that.

This has to be one of the most annoying things. What exactly is the idea behind writing a fanfiction in a magical universe just to jack off to not magic feature all the time?

However what I find intresting is the

#+begin_quote
  Harry-centric.
#+end_quote

I mean, the question here is, what a fic needs to be good, and you say thats part of your bare minimun. Does that really mean you dont think a non-centric Harry cant be good? I understand the appeal of following the main Char (hell I share that appeal) and yet I know quite a few good fics wich focus on someone else, or is it more like a, "I can count the number of enjoyable non-centric Harry fics on one hand"?

And to continue on that point, do you think fics which are written from someones else point of view, yet are focus on Harry are Harry-centric (Fics like Ginny Wealsy and the Half Blood Prince)?

**** According to the reply I got from Taure, it would seem that this list is not a “requirements for a story to be good” list but rather a “requirements for a story to be liked by Taure”. It did not seem to me to be something Taure would do, but it seems that it indeed did happen, and that's the answer to the question of it being required.

I have no idea about the other one so you'll just have to wait until you get a reply from them for that one.

** As a general rule, it has to be decently written, grammatically sound and should feature a modicum of good storytelling and character development. Since fanfiction is written by someone who expects no financial gain from it and does so in her freetime, my general rules are a lot more lenient with the craft of writing featured in it.

After that, I only have preferences, not downright disqualifiers.

- No canon pairings. I don't like Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny as they stood at the end of DH. If authors add to their relationships, then I may come to like them, but just canon-wise I don't.

- No slash. Just not a big fan because of the common(, often pretty cringey) way authors handle the relationship.

- No Bashing. Full Stop.

- No wanks. That includes the glorification of muggles and their technology, the weeaboo creamfest that happens when Harry goes to Japan or the "'Murica, fuck yea!" bullshittery that some fics in the States feature.

- No preaching. I don't care if you want to save the environment, think the libertarian way of life is the best or drive the vegetarian lifestyle wagon. Don't preach to me!

- I like Bellatrix. I think Bellatrix was awesome in the books and she's one of the few characters that got enhanced by the performance of the actress in the movies. Frankly, a well made backstory of Bellatrix Lestrange can make me blind to a lot of stuff.

- I'm also a sucker for fic that take a traditionally bad trope (Lord Potter, for example) and give it an entirely different spin into something great, or just fun

- What will also hold my attention longer than normal are fics exploring the Harry Potter universe. Doesn't really matter /what/ the fic explores, as long as its something new and required some worldbuilding, I'm into it.

** If it's only one thing then I am going with CREATIVITY (ok: Coupled with good writing)! So:

No retelling of canon (if it goes to a certain point? Fine, but IMHO canon in a fanfiction makes no sense because IMHO the ripple effects of changing a small thing, like say making Harry more driven, would change a lot of things (a driven Harry with a self-preservation instinct might not stop Voldemort in first year because he would probably not confront him (as he values his own life and knows that he doesn't - objectively - have a snowballs chance in hell to survive an encounter...he doesn't know of the protection, canon Harry only went because he kind of sees himself as worthless and has no self-preservation instinct!) - hell, be creative about it if you don't want Voldemort back after first year, either have Dumbledore come back early or make Snape more effective in his attempts at stopping him etc. etc. but don't expect a non-canon Harry to do what canon Harry did!))

But I like my fanfic to either fill a void left by the original series (ie, the events at Hogwarts during Deathly Hallows, more of Harry/Ginny's relationship, post-battle) or redo a period of canon in a more fulfilling way.
