  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

*** I absolutely adore this story and am eagerly awaiting updates, so please don't take the following as a deterrent: The beginning of this story is possibly one of the most grim and dark depictions (at least of the after effects) of torture I've ever read.

To put into perspective, a large portion of the story is Harry desperately trying to fix his body (and soul). He's MoD so he can't die, but his body is pretty much trashed.

Uhh..No. Maybe a maximum of 6-7 chapters focus on that. After that, the story is focussed on his travels.

***** I mentioned it was in the beginning. 6-7 out of 25 is around a fourth and a third of the story respectively. I'd call that a large portion.

** Two that I enjoy enough to reread are

linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhal by Disobedience Writer)

linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon)

The first is a crossover set in the Game of Thrones/Song of Ice and Fire universe. The second is set in the Firefly/Serenity universe after the events of the Serenity movie.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.

  COMPLETE. Firefly: :Harry Potter crossover Post Serenity. Two years have passed since the secret of the planet Miranda got broadcast across the whole 'verse in 2518. The crew of Serenity finally hires a new pilot, but he's a bit peculiar.

** I have one that is not exactly in this category, but is kind of adjacent to it. If you want to check it out! :)

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13125917/1/Trading-Places]]

Trading Places:

When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, how high will the cost be to switch them back?

** I actually wrote one like this but it turned out to be terrible. I do plan to redo it one day where Harry is the main character rather than Eragon. But my current story ‘The Codex' is about the IC universe coming into Harry's cannon.
