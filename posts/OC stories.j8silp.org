Recommend me some good OC/SI stories. And only MALE STORIES I don't want to read a female main character story. If you have one go somewhere else because I don't want it. Thank you everyone.

  When Lukas Black was seven, or maybe eight, he opened his eyes to a back alley and found he couldn't remember anything beside his own name. Not even how to speak. Stranger yet is the boy with a lightning scar calling for him while chasing Lukas down a street.Jack used to be a Malfoy, but now he's a fugitive with a skull and a serpent branded across his arm. The discovery of his old friend's son on the streets gives him the purpose he needs to pull himself off rock bottom. It's just a shame that the Dark Lord and his lieutenant don't have the good grace to stay dead.With fractured memories and a hunger for power sleeping beneath his skin, Lukas steps into the wizarding world with his teeth bared. Strange dreams haunt his night and a boy called Tom who lives in Ravenclaw's diadem calls him by another's name, and Lukas has to uncover the secret behind these hidden memories before they drive him insane.Tom is a blessing, a sanctuary against the nightmare that claws out Lukas's mind, but the further he falls into Tom's gravity, the more Lukas questions what's really going on behind Tom's acid-brown eyes....Does Tom want Lukas to lose his mind?
