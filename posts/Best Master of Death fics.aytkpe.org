MOD!Harry fics. Time travel or alternate dimension or whatever. No Harrymort slash and definitely no Snape romance with anyone. Well written


** Now, I'm gonna put up a disclaimer now that I did not finish/haven't yet finished all of these, and it's been a long while for some of the others, so please, bear with me here.

​

Also, I don't know about "best", as that's really subjective, so these are mostly the ones that I deemed worthy enough for me to document/save on one of my lists.

​

Alright, so there's the obvious one, linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus), though it's definitely not to everyone's tastes. The Carnviorous Muffin has one of those writing styles that happen to be either a hit or miss, and while there a lot of fans, I'm not a particularly large one. Be warned that it's a rather extensive universe with /quite a few/ side-fics and crossovers. And by quite a few, I mean more fics than I could ever dream of writing.

linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) js a wonderful LoTR crossover wherein Harry finds himself summoned to Middle Earth; I haven't read/watched any LoTR-related things for a few years, now, but I understood most of what I've read so far just fine. I liked how he used the plants---but that's probably just me.

linkffn(Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is by Tsume Yuki) is a rebirth fic where he finds himself as as Sirius and Regulus's older brother. Don't remember much about it, but I saved it, so. There is that.

​

A few more of the fics I have aren't "All-powerful, immortal, Master of Death!Harry" so much as they are "Harry gets all the Hallows" or something similar, as in my mind MoD means that just as much as the first definition, so I hope you don't mind that I'm adding these as well. They're all rather short, though.

​

linkffn(The Last Enemy by Luolang) is a oneshot that happens to feature a Harry who becomes obsessed with the Hallows and death. Features a rather sinister/dark Harry, if that's your thing.

linkao3(tell me whether he is dead by LullabyKnell) is much fluffier than some of the other things on this list, though there is definitely some sadness about it. More slice of life than anything else, I think, so probably not what you're looking for, but it's worth a few minutes in my mind

linkao3(Sisyphus by esama) is a peggy sue-type fic where Harry is reborn to live out his life again and again whenever he dies. I'm chalking the constant rebirths up to MoD shenanigans for the sake of this thread, but it's never specifically addressed in the fic; it's supposed to be rather depressing, from what I've gathered, and it lives up to its name.

​

And...that's it. I could've sworn I had more MoD fics saved, but I guess not. Even if I were to include the couple more that happened to have a HP/TR or HP/LV pairing, I still seem to have a lot fewer than it feels like I should. Huh. Well, if I come across any others in the next day or so, I'll link them as well.

​

Hope this helps you find something you won't mind spending your time on---have a good day

  He really hated hospitals. The novelty of being in one again disappeared as quickly as it came when Tsunade forced a cup full of pills down his throat. Being stranded in another world really wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Especially when people start dying and Naruto is at a complete loss of what to do.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
