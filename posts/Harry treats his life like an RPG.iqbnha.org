:END:
I've read Harry Potter and The Natural 20 linkffn(8096183) and of course was supremely disappointed that it was abandoned.

Are there any good finished or in progress fics that are similar or have Harry treat his life like a game of D&D or an RPG.

Thanks in advance.


** Not sure how "good" they are but "Gamer" fics are a dime a dozen. Though they're not quite like /Harry Potter and The Natural 20/. They tend to reinvent the world of Harry Potter as a video game, with Harry Potter basically being a self-aware PC.
