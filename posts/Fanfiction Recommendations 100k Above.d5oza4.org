******* i'll probably give the last two a shot at some point, but i loathe SGU, so the first one is out. i think my first introduction was a HP/SG-1 crossover where Harry winds up being possessed by Klorel before eventually gaining his freedom. it was written by Shezza. managed to hunt down a copy of it a couple of years ago (found it on a yahoo group since he deleted it from his profile). it...didn't live up to my memories of it, or my expectations of his work.

speaking of which, i highly recommend Shezza's Denarian series. it's a HP/Dresden Files crossover.

****** as for stargate, one series i'm rather fond of is the XSG-Com series by Hotpoint. the best version (meaning, edited) is on Twisting the Hellmouth. it's a Stargate/X-Com crossover. where the Asgard Loki is one behind the Sectoids and other aliens attacking earth. there's three stories in the series, iirc, with the latest one being set in the Pegasus Galaxy and they just woke up an ancient enemy of the Alterans, the Aquatoids. damn good read, though he hasn't updated much in years now.

personally, my favorites from him are New California Dreaming (a Fallout story set in the capital wasteland with an OC NCR Ranger related to the Chosen One being sent to do recon on what the hell the Brotherhood is doing out east, set a few months before the Lone Wanderer leaves the vault) and the Compelled series, a Buffy the Vampire Slayer/Angel The Series story that heavily focuses on Illyria.

I was under the impression that this was meant to be a post of recommendations of good stories for the users of this sub. I don't think it's meant to include trash just because it's over 100k words.

******** Yea, the dating did bug me, a bit, but not enough not to read it. It's not my all time favorite fic on anything, but it's well written and unique. You think ‘goblin raised Harry' and only really that one comes to mind, for me.

But I can see why people wouldn't like it. That's also why I didn't directly link it, but just mentioned it. The same, I feel, is true for the Firebird series. It's a much more alien magical world. And I considered not linking The Queen Who Fell To Earth because of its slash, polygamy vibes, but idk, I did anyways, I guess.

Again and Again was linked by OP, so clearly slash doesn't matter for this list.

********* RobSt, especially in his earlier works, has a number of problematic tendencies that rub a vocal portion of this subreddit wrong. He's a very /clumsy/ writer, with a tendency to tell rather than show; many of his characters are sock puppets spouting exposition rather than actual people. He has a number of personal axes to grind, especially against Dumbledore and the Weasleys, that also grate (although to be fair, there are also readers who love Weasley and Dumbledore bashing and can't get enough of it).

Personally, I find most of his stories readable and enjoyable, in a 'potato chip fic' fashion; quickly consumed, quickly disregarded. Some of them are borderline untouchable - Harry Crow fits that category for me. Knowledge is Power was also horribly clumsy, but he's currently reworking it as Proud Parents and I thought it was decent.

As with any fic, everyone's mileage varies. Read what you like, and to hell with the haters.

For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

  Albus Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice sacrificing an innocent child. Too late he understood how terrible that mistake had been... Harry Potter was not what he wanted him to be, he was not what the magical world expected him to be. He was not a replica of James, instead he had inherited more of Lily, far too much, in many people's opinion. Powerful&Intelligent!Harry

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner.
