Time-turners are the biggest example of this. They are /incredibly/ overpowered and pose /enormous/ questions (HPMoR takes on a few of them). JKR had to destroy the Ministry's stock of them in OotP just to shut us up about "oh they could've been used for [blah]". While the use of Hermione's time-turner is extremely clever and results in one of the coolest scenes in canon (I still get a rush every time Harry realizes who needs to cast the Patronus), time travel opens a lot of nasty plot holes. How would canon change /and still keep it's fantastical, magical tone/ if time-turners were removed?

What effect would the removal of other overpowered magical concepts have on canon and fanfiction? Like memory charms and the /Imperius/, or the Marauder's Map, or the ease of destroying a Horcrux.

******** True, but that's not what HP magic is about. They don't directly learn how to bend or break the laws of thermodynamics, or classical vs. quantum mechanics, etc. JKR has alluded to this on multiple occasions and has even outright said it: HP magic is fundamentally unscientific.

No energy or matter is transformed in Conjuration. To take Dumbledore at his word, the soul and mind appear to exist independently from the brain. Refilling Charms. /Just/ Refilling Charms. As fascinated as Muggle scientists might be were they allowed a peep into the DoM, or even just Diagon Alley, wizards don't care about these laws. There's no point: it's not even guaranteed that all magic produces a repetitive effect every time.

  “I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students,” said Karkaroff. He had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now. His face wore a very ugly look indeed. “You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more, and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions. It's only fair, Dumbledore.”

  “But Karkaroff, it doesn't work like that,” said Bagman. “The Goblet of Fire's just gone out - it won't reignite until the start of the next tournament -”
#+end_quote

Also, if the goblet only ignites for tournaments, I don't think it will ever accept Riddle's name. Only students may participate. Harry was allowed because the underage rule wasn't a traditional TWT rule but a restriction agreed upon by the schools.

** Wards/protective spells. I know they're not mentioned in canon but the idea is present. But they always seem to be incredibly strong in fanon, and I think it's a bit of a cop out. Especially when they're supposed to be the strongest in the country but the protagonist manages to break through them with brute force or some esoteric spell.

JKR has said that pensieve memories are objective not subjective, which in my opinion makes them an obvious source of information. We've been told that Veritiserum isn't used because some wizards can resist and it leads to self-incrimination, but if pensieve memories are unedited they're a pretty obvious source of information. Memory is itself very subjective so why shouldn't a pensieve memory be the same?

Slughorn managed to modify his own memory and store it for safekeeping. He might not have used a pensieve but it seems harder to modify his own memory without one and he certainly seemed familiar with the process of memory removal.

** Dementors are immensely overpowered. Indestructible beings whose very presence robes you of strength and will suck your fucking soul (which in the HPverse is a fate worse than death, because /your soul can't move on/) unless someone who controls them tells them not to, and the only way to resist them is one incredibly difficult charm (which, in their presence, becomes even more difficult). Oh, and muggles can't see them. How Dementors aren't the dominant species on earth I have no idea.

The Trace is one bullshit concept. The Ministry can apparently monitor and track magic when it happens, but they didn't seem to appear on the scene on all those times Unforgivable Curses were used outside of Hogwarts, like in the graveyard scene. But use two simple spells when you're underage, and you're expelled from school, your wand is snapped and you become a pariah. Right.

House-Elves and their amazing apparition skills bother me too. Why didn't Harry just use Kreacher to get into Hogwarts in DH? he already knows about their power to get beyond protective spells.

Same goes to Phoenixes. Well, I wouldn't say they are exactly overpowered, but they have powers that just weren't used properly in canon, like apparition beyond protective spells, and their tears, who can heal you from Basilisk venom (one of the most destructive substances in existence), but apparently couldn't heal Dumbledore's hand from a curse.

Speaking of Basilisks, they are completely overpowered, but I'm willing to pass that because they also have a laughably common fatal weakness.

Think about this for a moment. The Trace is two separate things 1) detection 2) enforcement. It's clear from canon that the Ministry doesn't enforce much of what they detect because it's not illegal. For example, they detect a lot of magic happening at Pureblood houses but because they know there's an adult wizard there, they don't enforce it because they can't know that it's the kid doing the magic. Similarly, we never see the Trace being enforced during the school year because while surely the Trace detects all the magic being cast, the Ministry assumes that the kid is at Hogwarts and therefore the magic is legal.

The Graveyard scene took place during the school year. All you need to have it make sense is for the Ministry ignoring the Trace during the school year to be a blanket affair rather than someone checking each individual output.

Because JKR never explicitly and strictly defines the limitations of magic (despite well theorized interpretations), canon magic has a tendency to break fan fiction stories.

Most fanon writers try to overcome these by describing spells as "difficult" or implying not everyone can perform a curse or obtain a certain item. It takes an especially skilled writer to create rules around the aforementioned overpowered magic and to follow the rules in a way that doesn't cheapen the story or artificially makes things difficult for our heroes.

There's no explanation of how your matter gets from one place to another, let alone your soul and belongings. And teleportation is immensely useful on the battlefield, so much that it ruins the need for /any other/ magical transportation. So instead fanfiction has to "nerf" apparition and utterly abuse Anti-Disapparition +Wards+Jinxes. Almost every battle in fanfiction has to have an obligatory sentence about "[character] felt fear when he found he couldn't disapparate".

It would be fascinating, and /magical/, to see a world where apparition doesn't exist. Would everyone ride brooms? Or flying carriages? Magical transportation would be varied and exciting instead of boring teleportation.

A country's ministry can increase and decrease the protections of the border, and since the was against Voldemort other countries surrounding Britain have been wary and are threatening to close off the borders.

Also, there's a range-limit, and if you transport someone that range decreases a lot. So you can't just apparate to your house like that when you're in another country.

Then there's also the fact that apparition by underage people is traceable, and floo traveling, broom riding and portkey travelling isn't.

...and then they (not sure if it's movies only) went and made it so the Killing Curse can be blocked by a chunk of stone.

Anyway, it's not a problem for the story if the antagonists have access to something that's overpowered, as long as it's still reasonable that the protagonists would still be in business. The Killing Curse? That's just another way of murdering people, hardly innovative. The Torture Curse? There are a thousand and one ways to cause pain.

The Mind-Control Curse is the most dangerous. Its limitations are hinted at in canon, and they seem pretty strong: it's easy to tell when someone's under the curse, and you don't get as much control as you'd like. That's why Krum was glassy-eyed in the maze, why Crouch Jr sequestered his father and had him communicate via letters, and why Crouch Sr couldn't (successfully) order his kid never to try to escape or resist the curse.

** Lots have been mentioned, but I'd like to take up the Imperius Curse in detail.

For starters, the Imperius as it stands in canon is /ridiculously/ overpowered. It took me /less than five minutes/ of considering the spell to come up with a plan for one single witch or wizard with decent combat competency, /who doesn't even have to be evil/, to use the Imperius to take over the entire world including all the Muggles. Part of the issue is that mind control and manipulation /in general/ tends to be a very powerful thing if used creatively, simply because control of a mind also allows control of all its resources. The other canon mind magics are largely also overpowered for this reason; note that HPMOR nerfs and/or removes pretty much every form of mind magic to keep the world from falling apart.

I personally prefer nerfing the Imperius rather than removing it, for reasons that also illuminate what the results of removing it would be. So I'll discuss those reasons first.

One reason is that it lends a certain sort of symmetry and balance to the Unforgivables. Each Unforgivable Curse is an easily used and extreme form of a different class of threat: the Killing Curse exemplifies the threat of death (obviously), the Cruciatus Curse exemplifies the threat of horrible experiences (including but not limited to torture), and the Imperius Curse exemplifies the threat of mind control. (There's actually more to the symmetry than this, but this is enough to make my point here.) There are good arguments to expand the set (adding Obliviation, for example), but it seems very odd to remove all representation of threats directly to minds.

Another reason is that mind control is /just so useful/ that unscrupulous people, magical or otherwise, have very strong incentives to learn, invent, and/or refine various forms of it - especially taking forms that are already easy to use and/or powerful and making them more so. In all that time spent on the subject, it would be weird for no one to come up with the simple and effective attack on humanlike minds that is the Imperius.

But if it were somehow removed without drastically changing the mental characteristics of humanity as a species, then all that effort that would otherwise have been spent on it as a form of mind control wouldn't go away. I'd expect most of that effort to go into working on the other forms of mind manipulation still available, likely elevating one or more (by the snowball effect of easier and better-known magics being more appealing) to replace it in the Unforgivables.

We can even look at the known forms of mind magic remaining and pick out which ones might replace the Imperius. In HPMOR's magic system, the heavily refined replacement would probably be Legilimency for long-term control and the Confundus Charm for short-term use. In canon and most fanfiction, the heavily refined replacement would probably be the Confundus Charm, hands down, but even supposedly minor things like Calming Draughts and Cheering Charms would work if refined properly.

Whatever happens the first time you experience it, is what happens. You can't change the past.

So if you were to see someone take a killing curse to the chest, you can't go back in time to save them, because it already happened.

In the case of Buckbeck and Sirius etc, Buckbeck was never executed and Sirius was never kissed because those events never happened. Hermione and Harry stopped them from occurring the first time all together. They can't make it unhappen, but they can prevent it from happening.

What happens during the time-travel reality /is/ what happens in the 'original' reality. Everything Harry and Hermione did in the time-travel reality had already occurred in the original reality. Really, it's like they exist in a parallel reality, not a reality a few hours previous. *It's essentially like they rewound the clock of their original reality, and then viewed it from a different perspective.* They didn't actually change anything, not really, because what they did already occurred.

Now at that point you probably ask yourself, "well what was the first instance of the time-travel? Wouldn't there have to be a 'first' reality?"

And the answer to that is don't think about it.

It is a major plot point in POA that what Harry and Hermione "see" wasn't what really happened, and it appears from their POV that they have changed the past. Thus by that logic you can save him as long as you also create the scenario where it appears like the original event took place.

F.E. you subdue the real murderer and then take his place. Only instead of killing him you sent a "green stunner" at him that looks like the killing curse.

The original you still sees the green curse hit a guy who then fell down, thus from his POV the timeline was preserved.

There is only one timeline, and if time travel would occur 4 hours in the future, then the universe already made it so that time travel is part of present causality. If you decided to go back in time to fix a problem, you wouldn't be able to make a different outcome from what you saw because your actions have already become part of the timeline.

I don't think they need a time-turner for that.

****** Magic is all about intent. Therefore if you intend to do something that would require a time turner, the event will probably occur. If you say to yourself "I intend to come back in time and /stupefy/ this guy in front of me", then your future self will probably appear (out of sight hopefully) and stun the guy. And hour later you will go back and cast the spell.

This means you can do nearly anything. Even if you see someone take a Killing Curse. Just say to yourself "I intend to come back in time and stun that person with a green stunning spell" and voila the person isn't actually dead; that wasn't a Killing Curse, it was just a green stunning spell. You can literally play God - just as long as you have intent and access to the time turner.

(MoR has some fun with the concept when Harry duels Moody.)

******* Or what a competent author would do is have the author 'intend' to come back to save them, only to cause the death in the first place. In canon once someone is dead, you can't undo it, period.

In fact the permanence of death is central to the harry potter narrative, death is permanent and everything you can try to bring people back from the dead either fail outright or result in a hollow imitation of the living person. Further any methods used to extend life destroy a person or turn them into a dependent on something were any shortage of the substance will kill them.

******** Interesting. That makes perfect sense in canon narrative.

However, assuming fate or the plot or time itself isn't conspiring against you, it /should/ be possible to avert death. The problems should only arise when death is part of a narrative like canon, and thus, outside of canon (and in some poorly written fics), time travel can still be god-like. So it really comes down to the skill of the author to explain why the turner couldn't be abused in certain situations and, readers will complain or notice when time travel isn't even considered outside of corner cases.

Everything comes down to the skill of the author I guess.

***** u/TyrialFrost:

  So if you were to see someone take a killing curse to the chest, you can't go back in time to save them, because it already happened.
#+end_quote

not at all. All you saw was someone get hit and crash to the ground remaining unresponsive.

Why not go back in time, give that person a metal plate to put in that location and enchant it with a stunning charm to activate once it is destroyed. then tell the person not to mention it.

Paradox resolved. person 'saved' from AK.

***** u/toni_toni:
#+begin_quote
  Now at that point you probably ask yourself, "well what was the first instance of the time-travel? Wouldn't there have to be a 'first' reality?"
#+end_quote

The only answer to that is that there never was a 'first' reality because no one in the HP universe ever really has a choice. Harry is bound by the prophecy that started the chain of events that killed his parents in exactly the same way there is an infinitely repeating loop of Harry and Hermione arriving in the hospital wing just as they leave. JKRowlings universe takes a very dim view of concepts like free will, in that no one ever has any free will in the universe because of fate, predestination and authorial intent.

***** This as the case back in PoA, yeah. However, JKR kinda ruined that interpretation on Pottermore, where she talks about people who used timeturners and did change the past... with bad consequences. Not just for people, but for time itself. I believe the reference was that Tuesday happened twice.

** Time Turners.

My personal take on it is you never actually travel back in time.

Instead magic opens a conduit to the multiverse, discards all dimensions that would contradict your perceived reality then shifts you to that reality after the return to 'real time' gaining the perception of having undertaken the actions in question.

This way there is never a paradox created and no real free will to create one.

** The Magical Tents, I mean why would anyone buy a house at all if you can use a magical tent? or Hermione's bag, that trunk of Moody's. And even Arthur did that car. I know she has said there are strict laws and limitations, but so far it looks like there are ways around that.
