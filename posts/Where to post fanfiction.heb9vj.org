I am writing a Neville Longbottom fanfiction and was thinking of sharing it, what platform is best to share it. I have a bunch of social medias but am just not sure where is the best place to post it.


** Probably [[https://www.fanfiction.net/]] or [[https://archiveofourown.org/]]

** It depends on if you are looking for constructive feedback or just sharing your writing. If it's the latter FanFiction.Net and ao3 are your best bet. If your are looking criticism then SpaceBattles or sufficient velocity forums would be best you won't get as many comments there but most of them will have good feedback

** As many as you like. I prefer Archive of Our Own to fanfiction dot net, as it has a better interface and no ads, and I get spammy comments from ffn.

*** i tend to prefer ao3 to ffn as well, i just wasn't sure where people would actually read it. i mean when i was younger i used to post to wattpad but i look back at those days somewhat regretfully (they were some awful stories that don't deserve the amount of reads as they have) thank you for the advice :)
