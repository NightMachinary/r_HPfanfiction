I am stuck on a current chapter. I am happy to read/edit for someone in exchange for some feedback on plotting and flow. I am writing a cannon compliant Chamber of Secrets version told from Ginny's perspective. I am on my 13th chapter and at the time between Valentine's day and the diary stolen. The time jump is so large I am struggling to keep the plot moving in a natural way while covering two to three months.

So if anyone would like a beta I would be happy to read someone else's work in exchange for some feedback. The first twelve chapters are posted here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12312469/1/Ginny-Chronicles-Part-1-Little-Girl-Lost]]


** I'm a few chapters behind but am currently reading this one. Would be glad to throw my two cents in once I get caught up.
