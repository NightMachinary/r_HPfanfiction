Fic is quite long. I believe it is slash.

I don't know whether Harry is called "Harry" in the fic, I believe he might /not/ be.

Dumbledore's relative (I think it's a nephew or son) is also involved and may be paired with Harry. This relative is EXTREMELY OP - literally a demi-god. I understand later in the book Harry has an epiphany or something. He is a demi-god in human form, then he remembers his past and unlocks his powers.

Been trying to remember this fic for a few weeks and can't even guess at what it might be called.

Please help.


** Sounds like Phirephoenix8's fic, Vindico Atrum. Its a sequel to Black Heir and LVHP

*** Hi,

Yes that's the one.

Bit disappointed reading it now. It has so much potential but it's so, so bloated.
