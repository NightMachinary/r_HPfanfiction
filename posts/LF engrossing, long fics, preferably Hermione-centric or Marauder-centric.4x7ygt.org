I'm going through a really awful breakup and I need something long and totally engaging to keep my mind off things. I know this is a really broad request, but I will take any recommendations you have. Fics you could not put down, that you consider all time favorites. Some of my favorite characters include Hermione, Remus, Percy, Neville, McGonagall, Charlie, and Bill. I like Marauder-centric fics, time travel fics, and fics that delve into different branches of magic. I'm fine with romance as well, despite the nature of my request, and I have read a lot (but not all) of the most frequently recced fics.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** Whew boy, sit tight. You've requested my favourite HP fanfics, and I'm sending a list from my Fav's:

- "The Werewolf Tamer" or anything else by Atruwriter (although most of Amanda's stuff isn't complete except for her earlier work)
- "Carpe Diem" by Berti Blott (if you want Hermione/Tom but written differently, more humourous)
- "Fair Fortune" by sweetasylums; HG/SB (this is the "Thief of Time" redo by TinkeWolf after she left FFnet)
- "Just a Harmless Joke" by CrazyGirl47 - although this is Fred/Hermione
- "Misplaced Moony" by ShaylaLonnie (RL/HG; erm, time travel but not?); actually, *anything* by her is pretty amazing
- "Hungry like the Wolf" by TaraSoleil (RL/HG time travel)

I have more, but I've spent about half an hour browsing my lists, so if you have any more specifics, PM me! I'll happily link you to them all.

**** Np! I'd recommend /Thief of Time/ even though it was never finished - what a shame, so well written and done; the new version is very different and highly stylized, but she said it will follow a similar Sirius/Hermione flow later on.

I've been reading through [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5]]'s stuff recently - /Patron/, /Divided and Entwined/ - but those are mostly post-Deathly Hallows fics about stupid purebloods. But their favourites is a goldmine for other great fanfic, which is how I usually find great gems through ShaylaLonnie and Atruwriter (although I might be tooting my own horn because I know Amanda had some of my own fanfic on her list ha!).

MaryRoyale (on Shayla's favs) is a great writer, too.

** If you are okay with slash, I cannot recommend [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3378356/1/Casting-Moonshadows][Casting Moonshadows]] more highly (and if you aren't into slash normally, this is a story to give it a try with I think). The slash is not graphic (from what I remember) but the love story between Remus and Sirius is a big focus. This is not only one of my favorite marauder fics, but just one of my favorite fics in general. This spans from first year until the end of 6th year (I would say it is basically complete, although it is still being updated occasionally) and is one of the most detailed and beautifully written MWPP fics in fandom.

The downsides are that it is really dark (especially Remus' and Sirius' back stories) and assuming it sticks with canon going forward, knowing what happens to the Marauders (especially Remus and Sirius), makes parts especially heartbreaking.

The pranks in this fic are amazing. The friendships are heartwarming. It will make you laugh and cry. There's a reason why this fic has 7k comments and is such a favorite almost 10 years after it was started. The author is also a published author in her own right, so you know the writing is great. linkffn(3378356)

**** Oh man if you are a Remus/Sirius shipper I have SO MANY more amazing recs for you! I will limit it to my absolute favorites or to long engrossing fics as per your original request.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/54783][Survivor's Guilt]] - this is a series of three (almost) canon-compliant remus/sirius fics with PoA and the years before that told from both of their POVs. Then after Remus realizes Sirius is innocent, the final fic in the series is of the summer they spend hiding together in the Caribbean. I really like fics that re-write events from canon in another character's POV and bring to it a whole other layer of complexity and depth - which this series does expertly. The only negatives for these is that they are pretty depressing - given the subject matter it isn't surprising but still - and that there is NEVER a mention of lube. Seems a little suspect to me, but I am not a gay guy so I will let it slide. This series is a definite favorite!

[[http://remusxsirius.livejournal.com/3156196.html][It Was Only a Kiss]]- This 7th year "get-together" story for Remus and Sirius is one of the best - it is pretty much perfect with the dynamic of the Marauders, the angst of exploring their feelings for one another and the dialogue is amazing. The fic starts off with Sirius and Remus getting drunk and talking about what it would be like to kiss another guy and then just spirals from there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4181253/1/Very-Bad-Things][Very Bad Things]] - This fic is so so good if you love fluff. Of gosh this is so good. It isn't plotty or action packed, but it is a really sweet and fluffy glimpse into how Sirius and Remus got together during 7th year. This author writes the Marauders SO well - I really recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1461919/freudian-fuckup][all of her(?) stuff]]. There are a few one-shots with James/Sirius in particular that are unusual and cool. I also liked "I Know" because it is a rarely seen relationship between Sirius and Remus, where Sirius is kinda just using him.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1145357/chapters/2318859][Teenaged Kicks]] - A really sweet and well-written sirius/remus where sirius finally tells remus how he feels on the train on the way home from 7th year. They start a romance right as Remus is going to join a werewolf pack for the Order. Their relationship is so cute and well-balanced, I LOVE how sirius was such a man-whore at hogwarts and remus was such a prude, but now that they are together, it is sirius who is the shy one. The biggest downside to this story is that it is not complete, even though it is listed as complete! It ends at a place that could be the ending, but really there is a lot more story to tell and the author says he still plans to update. I really hope he does because I really loved this fic - same author as One Hundred Sixty Nine.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1651109/chapters/3501239][Text Talk]] - Maaaaybe my favorite Remus/Sirius of all, but I usually don't list it because it is a non-magical, modern AU and that is so far from HP it is barely fanfic imo. But this fic is SO SO GOOD. You will be grinning the whole time while you read it I promise because it is that great. It is super dialogue heavy (through the plot device of the texts) which is what made this fic so addicting. This is the perfect fic IMO to read after a breakup because it is so sweet and heartwarming and you will be so happy for the characters that it is hard to be sad yourself.

I hadn't read "Stealing Harry" because I am usually not a fan of "everyone is in different houses" AUs - but is it pretty focused on RL/SB rather than Harry's story? Also Stealing Harry is unfinished (although there are notes at the end?) and I will rarely start an unfinished fic unless someone tells me it is worth it and that I will not be too frustrated at the end lol.

For "As Red as Hearts in Autumn," is it important to read the rest of the series? There are a lot of one shots in the series and I want to read it in order if that is how it is meant to be read. What do you think?

********* "Stealing Harry" is finished, and it's more focused on Remus and Sirius stealing Harry from the Dursleys' and raising him, and on their relationship, than anything. The story doesn't even get to Hogwarts, so I wouldn't call it a different houses AU. The series includes additional stories that following "Stealing Harry" and yes, Harry is a Slytherin in some of those, but once you finish "Stealing Harry" you'll be hooked. Also, I'm pretty sure the series is finished as well. It's totally worth it, regardless. A really well done story with some great R/S moments. :)

And no, you don't need to read the other fics in the "As Red as Hearts and Autumn" series. They'll provide additional scenes and backstory, but they're not necessary to read first.
