** I am in complete agreement, tbh. I trust that ObsidianPen has an idea of what she wants to do and I support that decision, but I still sorta prefer the original uncensored version. There was this contrast between that first dream and the waking world that was so...it sorta gave me second-hand anxiety, I think, but in the best ways (not that that makes any sense lol). But it made it so I understood Harry's decision to run - it made sense despite me knowing he shouldn't do that. There was that sense of self-disgust and terror that made Harry's actions rational, and that really set the tone for the rest of that book and the next. And yes on the piano? Like that was one of my favourite things in the whole series and that last bit with him in Grimmauld Place still gives me shivers just thinking about it. It was great.

However, with the rewrite for Hauntingly I do have higher hopes for the ending. Imo there was something that shifted after that battle at Hogwarts that felt...well, I don't know what changed, but it felt more disjointed than the rest of the story. Maybe disjointed is the wrong word, but the flow of the story shifted. Eh, to find the proper description I'm going to need to re-read it all, so... I'll go do that now instead of studying for finals mdr

*** I totally agree in your last point, I'm rereading Hauntingly atm, I dislike the change in writing after the battle of Hogwarts. The scenes after the battle in the room of requirement have a troopy feel to them. The way that Harry comes in alive and everyone is just happy to see him, the way that Ginny does the typical slap-then-kiss thing, how his map was recovered putting them out of danger.....it all feels like your typical fanfiction, where's before it was dark and sinister and meaningful.

Yes on one hand you can see that in reality they are all still children, they banter and dress up and have fun. But in actuality they are still under a lot of stress, in great danger and nowhere near safe. After a while the feeling evens out and the story returns to the style that we know and love. I have an intense dislike for those scenes.

Yes it's twisted, but the whole time I was reading the negotiation scenes, I was really rooting for then to go through successfully, for Harry to really go to Voldemort, for him to really be in close proximity to him, for Harry to as he puts it “ sleep in Voldemort's spare bedroom”. Because I would find that fascinating, although one could argue that Obsidianpen does that in her work “No Glory”.

I really hope for a better ending. The original while in no way bad and absolutely heart wrenching, but I found that it was a bit too open. Maybe that's only my opinion because I actually want an ending where Harry has to really deal with the death of Voldemort and loosing him. Or one where they actually come together, although I find that very very unlikely.

Either way I can't wait for her to complete the rewrite, even though I get the impression that her passion for writing, or maybe just her passion for fanfiction, has greatly diminished. Her newest chapter in ‘No Glory' has a very ‘done-with' feeling to it, like she doesn't even like the story anymore. If that's really the case, then I feel that it's a shame to take down the Haunted and Hunted series, because she may never actually finish the rewrite or ruin the story due to missing interest.

**** Oh hey you can actually articulate what I'm trying to communicate! That's refreshing. You've hit most of the points I was thinking of, so I'm not sure what else to say besides 'I agree'.

And is New Glory really getting like that? I haven't been able to keep up with updates lately and the idea of that happening is rather depressing. But I suppose story burnout happens to a lot of different authors. Still such a shame, though.

Fingers crossed that she finishes it all, yeah?

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  Nearly two and a half years had passed since Kreacher had woken up to find Harry Potter asleep on his kitchen floor, and Grimmauld Place had changed dramatically since then. Sequel to "Innocent".
