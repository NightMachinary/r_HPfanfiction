I highly doubt this would be a major plot point in any stories but if you can think of any where this happens, I'd appreciate it.

There is one I vaguely recall, where Hagrid is made Lord and one day Narcissa comes to Hogwarts to pick up Draco for a Wizengamot meeting but Harry, Sirius, and Hagrid did not get any notification of a meeting so they know something is afoot.


** It is mentioned in linkao3(14078862) (everything is mentioned there).
