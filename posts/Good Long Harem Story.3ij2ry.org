** If you are looking for a serious one that does not really suck, I don't know if there are any. The only one that I have read and liked is this:

linkffn(Too Many Dates by fantasy1290)

It is light-hearted and humorous, and that is exactly why it works. The way the harem is formed is kind of novel as well. Minus: the ending is very abrupt. Nonetheless, there are some good laughs to be had.

  What if Harry's friends tried to help him out in getting a date to the Yule Ball and he suddenly found himself with too many dates? Hilarity and romance ensues of course. Harry/Multi and eventual harem.

** The only harem story I would recommend would be Effects and Side Effects. It's readable, pretty fun, and pretty long (although probably abandoned at this point)... That's about it.

Fair warning, Harry gets turned into a girl. It's done fairly well for the genre: Harry doesn't start insisting on being referred to as her/she/Harriet and he struggles with the change.

Harry's incredibly OP, it has some bashing (Ron/Molly/Dumbledore), but otherwise it's pretty fun.

It's pretty good... for a harem story.

*** I can't even begin to express how pleasing it is to find a fic where Harry's pronouns aren't universally changed and accepted by everyone the moment it's realized he has breasts.

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.

  His life was never normal, then it becomes truly abnormal. He must save a world he never cared for, but with others ... he can care. H/Hr and maybe others. Rated M to be safe.

****** Wouldn't say this is without smut, personally. The girls wander around naked with the expectation they'll be objectified and sexualised. Got to chapter 19 and couldn't take it when Harry ordered Ginny to take off her clothes because the others were naked. Seemed more like a male wank fest. Witches "had to" masturbate from a young age and there was compulsory sexual mentoring which screamed exploitation and male fantasising.

** I vaguely recall the "Witches' Secret" Trilogy being OK but it gets worse as it goes on. It fits the bill for you though.
