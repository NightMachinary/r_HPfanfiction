*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13160344/1/][*/Harry Potter and The Power He Knows Not Book 1 The Reluctant Champion/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/11142828/ACI100][/ACI100/]]

#+begin_quote
  Book 1 of a Trilogy. Harry Potter thought his life could not get any worse. No parents, the worst childhood one could ever imagine, and now no godfather. Harry Potter was wrong. When his name comes out of The Goblet of Fire, Harry is abandoned by those closest to him, and is sure that he is truly and completely alone. Once again, Harry Potter was wrong.

** linkao3(Flutterby, Butterfly by LadyMimiAliceDeYorke)

This is short and I'm not really a fan of it, but it's cute and fits your request.

  Since he pulled her out of the Black Lake when she was a small girl, Gabrielle wished she could repay Harry. And now the war is approaching, maybe she can? Harry/Gabrielle. (Gabrielle is older than the books.)

** Vitam Paramus by TE7 is probably the closest your going to get. Harry is a pro quidditch player and develops a relationship with Gabrielle. TE7's work is really solid, and his OC's are interesting. If your looking for quality writing, with this pairing, and a complete story I would recommend it. I certainly enjoyed the story.

**** Yes I did, there are very few if any fics that are decent fitting his exact specifications. Yes Gabrielle and Harry have an age gap in Vitam Paramus but at least they are both consenting adults, and the writing is solid. There are barely any Gabrielle/Harry stories out there worth reading, I'm trying to at least, somewhat, give him a story that he might be interested in. No need to take an attitude.

***** 17 and 23 is a lot different than 8 and 14 that's for sure.

Or, as in the epilogue, 22 and 28.
