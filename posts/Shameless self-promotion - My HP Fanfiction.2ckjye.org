I've been looking for somewhere to spread the word on my stories, and I was really hoping not to be too out of line or sound too needy by posting my works here. Obviously, I'm not expecting everyone to flock at once, I just got me fingers crossed that maybe someone on here could maybe read and maybe comment or criticize on one or two of them? Any input would be welcomed. :)

** I've had a bit of a look through and submitted a couple of short observations. Mainly I think a beta would be good for you---your ideas are good, but could do with love and a little polish to make them shine properly. (Not that I can talk, if you look at my challenge fics (which are /not/ good).)

*** Thanks for looking through. What do you mean by a beta? Like a rough draft for ppl to comment on and then fix afterwards??

**** Yes, basically. The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/44309/22480415/1/Looking-for-a-beta][Looking for a Beta]] thread on the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/forum/Harry-Potter-Fanfiction-Challenges/44309/][HPFC]] forum is usually full of people willing to look over your stuff. Some beta's are just for typos and grammar mistakes, and some are willing to expand on your work and help you make it the absolute best it can be.

Were you trying to write a story without ever using the word "said"? Because that just makes the story weird. And your word choices are quite unusual.

/Much/ better, but the consistent use of single quotes for dialogue is distracting.

*** Firstly thanks for reading them!

For Quidditch lover - no it never crossed my mind that I wasn't using "said" regularly, just the way it turned out I guess. But I do try to experiment sometimes with finding words to use other than "said".

And I have used single quotes for dialogue in every story I've ever written, its a matter of habit and personal choice I guess, and besides I got into writing because of the HP series which has single quote dialogue throughout the entire series.

Thanks again though :)
