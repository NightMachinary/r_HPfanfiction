So after reading tv tropes fanon page that brought it up, are there any fics where Harry comes across the snake he freed in the 1st book, usually by it recognizing him? Doesn't have to be crucial to the plot or can be a one shot.


** Something similar, harry take the snake to brazil couple of minutes later the snake comes back and goes Nope nope nope im outta here

** The questionably-written, albeit amusing, linkffn(Letter from Boa) is the only one I can think of offhand. Though it's something I've long wanted to incorporate in a story someday.

  When Harry wonders what happened to the first sort-of friend he had, even if it was just a snake, he's surprised to get a mysterious letter from said snake, telling him about his life... honestly, he got to Brazil? Harry wondered if that was true...

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts by Clell65619) brings that snake back but only right at the end. Quite an important role though.
