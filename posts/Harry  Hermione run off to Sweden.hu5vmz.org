Hey,

Does anyone know a fic---it was from a while ago---where Harry & Hermione take off, with the help of Aberforth, and go live in Sweden? It was pretty dark--Hermione's parents were murdered & I think the implication was that she was assaulted by Death Eaters & i think Sirius was also dead so they would have been in 6th year.

Thanks
