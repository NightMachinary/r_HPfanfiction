:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for fanfiction but I don't remember the title. I only remember that Dumbledore, as Harry's magical guardian, made a magical contract for him to marry Ginny. Harry somehow managed to get out of it, and in return Albus himself had to marry Ginny.\\
PS. English is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes.
