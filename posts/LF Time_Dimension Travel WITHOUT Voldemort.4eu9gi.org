Time travel fics are a persistent guilty pleasure for me, but I'm absolutely fed up with the "let's defeat Voldemort slightly differently" plot. My preference has always been character drama and seeing Harry create new relationship dynamics.

Essentially, give me your best time/dimension travel fics where the Death Eater conflict is nonexistent or pushed to the background.


** *The Evil Overlord List*, linkffn(10972919): Jerry (Harry?), a voice in young Tom's head, supposedly came from future and was helping out Tom on his way to world domination.

*Returning to the Start*, linkffn(10687059): dealing with Voldemort and Death Eaters was easy, regaining Hermione's trust and love was far more difficult.

*Ginny Returns*, linkffn(4740107): like in the previous story, the time traveller had it easy with the bad guys, but ran into trouble with her own love life.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

** Fics where the main character travels further back than Voldemort's time: linkffn(A Long Journey Home; Wizard From Earth)

linkffn(A Little More Time) has Remus and Tonks travelling forwards to post-epilogue time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6957439/1/Why-Can-t-It-Be-a-Joke][Why can't it be a joke? by bbgirl32]] has Grindelwald and Dumbledore as the main antagonists instead of Voldemort.

linkffn(the albatross did follow by Chromeknickers) has an infinite time loop wherein Ginny and Draco repeat the same day over and over again.

For dimension travel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6435092/1/Turn][Turn]] is the best damn dimension travel story there is, and it is all post-canon.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.
