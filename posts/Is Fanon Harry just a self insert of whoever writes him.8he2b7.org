** No because most people give him values and qualities and a personality and flaws that they do not have themselves. He is his own character like any other. And he can be changed like any other.

** Not really. I think everyone who writes HP fanfic has qualities about Harry that they like and dislike. Some people really like his sarcasm and wit. Others enjoy his heroics. Others still enjoy exploring more realistic personalities brought about by varying degrees of abuse at the hands of the Dursleys. All of those things are made more in fics, just as his flaws or things people /dislike/ appear less.
