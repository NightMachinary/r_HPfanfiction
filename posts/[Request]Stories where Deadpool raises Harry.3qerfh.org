  "Harry's mutant power. It's hair regeneration."

  "What?"

  "Harry will never go bald."

  "Are you serious?"

  "And his hair will never go gray," Beast said quickly. The professor gave him a long silent look before just floating back to his office.

** I only know who Deadpool is bc Husband...I'm checking it out. Hopefully you don't need to have read the comics to understand (though I'm pretty sure Deadpool was introduced already in movies, right? sort of?)
