:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi all

I'm looking for a fic, I think it was fairly long and on fanfiction.net, where Harry works in an apothecary under an alias during summer and learns 'dark' (in the traditions sense rather than violent) magic.

There's some rituals and something that stuck in my mind was that he learns to breathe on candles to light them.

Thanks!


** Was it [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12723942/1/Out-of-the-Night][Out of the Night]], by Raining Ink (RememberFics)? Dark wizards had marks on their faces, there was a big library, a grumpy old mentor named Zate, etc.? linkffn(12723942)

  After 5th year, Harry takes charge of his own life. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war, and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Long, slower-paced fic. Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, NOT Evil!Harry, No Romance. -ABANDONED-

  Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.
