Like I really enjoy these types of fics, seeing Harry take charge of his own destiny and taking on the world on his own terms is freaking awesome, but I can't stand the Ron and Hermione bashing. Like did y'all forget Ron sacrificed his life for Harry in Wizard's Chess? Or how he helped break Harry out of his room at the Dursley's? Hermione bashing makes no sense either, she served as a motivator and confidant to Harry in the books when he and Ron weren't on good terms and I honestly see a sibling like bond between all three of them.

That being said, any fics where Harry and the gang ( not just Hermione) actually care about their learning and put in more effort to take down Voldemort and Dumbledore and all the other BS at Hogwarts. A BAMF trio if you will.

Hope I'm not asking for too much ._.

  Post OotP. AU. Harry is fed up with Dumbledore's interference and sets out to do things his way, with help from some unexpected sources. When he learns the second half of the Prophecy, and finds his power, he won't allow anything to stand in his way.

  Harry is left with the Dursleys just after his godfather had died. One thing leads to the other and Harry is fed up with being a puppet. He breaks free and finds help. And boy, does he start rocking the boat.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

  The night in the graveyard, produces a very different result as Harry discovers things he didn't know about his heritage. Before he only had a castle, now he has a whole wide world to get himself in trouble. At least he has his responsible godfather along for the ride. That should help... right? Or not.
