:END:
Each champion got to choose a coach to help them during the tournament and Cedric picks Harry. I remember that they made the tasks less dangerous but still had to use the dragons. I think Flickwit made a obstacle course underneath the dragon that the champions had to go through. One of the dragons takes offence and kills a bunch of people, mostly aurors and Fudge who tried to stop it.

*** I love the bait-and-switch of this fic. The title primes you to anticipate an obtuse lordship Hadrian Jameson Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryffindor-Gaunt-Stark-Ravenclaw. The first chapter features Harry using his brilliant analytical mind to realize that Ron, despite being poor, has an enormous collection of chocolate frog cards. Where did the money come from? The chemtrails? Area 51? Manipulative!Dumbledore?

Then it turns out Ron's uncles and older brothers gave him their collections. Harry spends the rest of the fic literally building a house. The fic, instead of being a shitty "politics" fic, is about magical construction.

**** It sounds interesting, and I would read it, though is it bashing Ron?

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.
