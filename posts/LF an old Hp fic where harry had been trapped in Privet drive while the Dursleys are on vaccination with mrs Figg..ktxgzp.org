Harry escapes after a few days by accidental magical and goes to Gringotts for the Cliche exposing of Thievery, inheritance and so on. Harry moves into a house of vampires and werewolves in knockturn alley. He experiments with potions and creates some to hide himself better. He is accepted as a student of St. MUNGOS and experiment with potions and is a natural healer.\\
Remus and moody hunts dumbledore with a bunch of angry werewolves and vampires, they catch up on him, bites and feeds on his blood, bit he doesn't turn but dies.

(I am seriously posting this for my mother. You have no idea the drag it was to listen to her give a full, long, boringly slow account of this story because she loved it that. Omg kill me now...)
