*** Me too, and answer is still Petunia. As of pettiest, being a bloke, I suspect an abusive husband.

** On another post here, people were talking about how it was Petunia's disdain towards magic that caused Vernon to hate them too. Like he was only hateful of magical people because of his wife's words (mentioned it here cuz in fanfiction its always Vernon being the hateful guy while Petunia just agrees with him or is neutral towards Harry and Co.) . I don't remember Canon about this exactly but I'll say yep, Petunia pettier (she was blood relative of magical people and Harry, Vernon was by law). Both petty though.
