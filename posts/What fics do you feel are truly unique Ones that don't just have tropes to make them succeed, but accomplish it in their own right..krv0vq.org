I do want to say, I don't mean fics with no tropes. In the words of the Great Brandon Sanderson, "Tropes are tools to be used. You can do them well, or you can do them poorly. Nevertheless, you should have them in your writers toolbox."

In this light, I'd like to recommend my favorite HP fic of all time, linkffn(A Different Kind of War)

I also want to say this is a discussion more than a request. What do you feel is okay to do with tropes? What do you feel must be done with the writers imagination? Are there lines you cannot cross?

Edit: here's my obligated edit to say I'm so surprised this got so many responses, and that I'll try to respond to as many as possible.

Edit: It seems the bot didn't kick in, so here's a link to A Different Kind of War --- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13634783/1/A-Different-Kind-of-War]]


** Linkffn(The Second String by Eider Down)

After Harry is attacked by dementors in Little Whinging, he finds himself on Hogwarts grounds at the same time as the teenaged Marauders.

The only things I can say about this fic without revealing spoilers all sound /very/ tropey. But if you actually read it, the author took a very different approach to almost everything and I haven't read anything comparable or even similar. I love the way the travel is handled, how Voldemort is handled, how prophecy is handled, how well the OCs are handled and how background Canon characters are re-imagined.

The story is still in progress, but the last update was less than a month ago and I think there are less than 5 chapters remaining.

*** Seconding this. I especially like how the author explores how Harry's perceptions of people change as he grows up, from easy and often unfair judgments in the first part to much more complicated ones once he has to start making his own compromises. All the characters, including Harry, are really flawed and really human. Plus I agree, it's a really creative and thoughtful plot.

Additionally, I wouldn't describe anything on thr FFN version as smut. Im pretty sure most of it is either fade to black or only briefly described on FFN. I skimmed most of those parts.

** This brings to mind both the things I love and the things I hate about the Haphne ship. Introducing Daphne (who is by all means an OC) into Harry's life nearly always drastically alters the events of the franchise in a big way. To someone just being introduced to the ship it can seem like an extremely fresh take: seeing a friendly Gryffindor/Slytherin dynamic, learning about the other side of the war, Harry getting independent from Dumbledore earlier on, etc.

But then its nearly always squandered by the reuse of tropes associated with Daphne. You have a complete blank slate to begin with and craft ANY kind of story and character, but 9/10 times authors will fall back on the well used fan-established tropes. It is a fun trope to read don't get me wrong, I've contributed to it myself, but one can't help but feel its a waste of opportunity not doing some different with it, more often than not.

Dramione for this reason has probably actually been used better, because authors have to work harder to make their dynamic happen in new and different ways so it isn't just the same story again and again. Because Draco has a lot of canon to keep in line with, stories either have to get creative or risk being too AU. Whereas with Daphne, you have a world of potnetional, but the same stories keep being told.

Bit of a tangent there and I most definitely didn't answer the question, but there's my two cents on it. And this is all coming from a huge shipper (and critic) of Haphne!

**** Thats made my day, thank you!

What I wanted to do with my series specifically was take the done-to-death fandom interpretation of Daphne and write something realistic and grounded for her. I've always seen the stories that take the 'sexy' aspects of a purebood Slytherin and ignore the toxic mindset and ignorant world-view they'd probably have as a waste of plot potential, frankly. Lots of fics don't utilise their chances for genuine characterization, they just use the house divide for a bit of scandal in early chapters then its forgotten about.

So I wanted Living Dangerous and Living in Secret to be a bit different from that and really focus on being character pieces, so thats really made me happy you would say that! :)

** It's hard to measure success of a fanfiction, but if the amount of fan participation is a factor, then there's an active Discord server and over 150 spinoff stories for linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) (edit: bot seems to be down, link is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/]] ).

Interestingly enough, the gender flip ends up being a relatively /minor/ factor despite being highlighted in the summary. Harry is primarily worried about people finding out her real name and blood status. Impersonating a boy isn't a crime, but impersonating a Pureblood gets you a life sentence in Azkaban.

It does a good job of depicting a Harry who is quite a bit more powerful and skilled than canon, but who a) has good reasons for that (eg being raised by both parents and knowing about magic from the crib) and b) has challenges to match it (eg being exceptional is a big problem when you're in disguise).

It also stands out to me because it doesn't feel like someone has taken canon and altered it. Rather, it feels like an entirely new storyline, which has on occasion taken some inspiration from canon, but implemented it quite differently. Some of that comes from the Song of the Lioness crossover, but I've read that before (albeit a long time ago) and I'm pretty sure that a lot of the story is still original.

** My absolute favorite fic of all time turned this hardcore non-drarry shipper into a full on stan. Running on Air by Eleventy7 on AO3. It's SO beautifully written, the drama and tension is haunting, the suspense kept me reading ALLLL day and night. Their relationship feels natural and very well earned. There's this beautiful mix of magic and normalcy. I can't even put it into words but it is 100% the best thing I have ever read. I think the biggest thing they hit the nail on the head with was the way characters act/talk. It all felt so akin to the books. A proper mix of how their characters were and how they probably have grown in their adult years.

Voldemort goes back in time and raises Tom Riddle.

Time travel is a trope, but I have never seen it used this way.

The writing is solid, everyone in that story is very in character and I've just been crazy about it.

** I'd say tropes can be tools, but they aren't tools. They're labels, that we use to describe common story plots, elements, or characters. They aren't bad, but they can be if they're all your story is. Lack of depth is bad, not being unoriginal. You can't make trope-free writing, since everything has been done at least once, and if you break it down enough you can find a trope.

To avoid bad writing, however, just think beyond the tropes if you use them, or if you find them in your writing. For example, if you're writing a boy-meets-girl story, having a solid and well-developed reason /why/ boy meets girl may not avoid the trope, but it will make your story more solid from a plotting and characterization perspective.

If you'd like to use a trope as a tool, I'd recommend writing your story first, and playing on tropes to take advantage of our preconceptions of them. I believe Sanderson uses the example of meeting a thief character by having the main character being robbed. The important thing is what you use it for, by showing the thief's skill, the main character's skill, and/or both of their characters in the situation. The trope allows them to meet, but you're writing /your/ characters in that situation. If this wasn't Sanderson, whoops.

Stay off TV Tropes, because you'll never stop seeing tropes everywhere, because, as above, /everything/ is a trope.

But number one, write /your/ story, tropes or no. That's the best you'll get, always. If it has a bunch of tropes that's fine.

But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** I've been told that my series The Deep Dream, is unique. Series link is here [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1995562]]

Book 1: Harry Potter and the Deep Dream

On the morning of his 11th birthday, Harry finds a letter from his mother that leads him to discover that there is more to the world than most can see or touch, and that his heritage is out of this world. Join him as he discovers new facets of himself, new friends, and a heritage that could bring the world to its knees.

Book 2: Harry Potter Secrets of the Dream

A new year and new challenges. Harry and Hermione return to Hogwarts with their friends and family, however, the recent passage through The Dream has not gone unnoticed. Read as they have to deal with a monster in the school and an increasing threat from The Dream.

Book 3: Harry Potter Escape from the Dream

Petunia has been introduced to Lyasa's family but is still a slave to the Winter court. It's becoming increasingly likely that rescue will not be able to come from earth, so she decides to learn everything she can about the Sidhe way of magic and fighting.\\
Karen needs to settle into the role of Headmaster while also fending off clumsy power grabs from the Ministry, as well as negotiate Hogwarts part in the upcoming Tri-wizard Torneyment, and finding time to train to become strong enough to rescue her wife.\\
Harry, Hermione and Daphne need to stand together as they learn what it means to be a Magi and try to retrieve the recently unearthed tablets of life before they can be used by servents of the sleepers.

** Outcast Alley is one of my all time favourite fics. It has a sequel, but the author abandoned it as fanfiction because (s)he decided to make the story original fiction.

As far as crossing lines, I personally have not found a fic that crossed the proverbial line for me. I partially use fan fiction as a coping mechanism, both reading and writing. When the memories/night terrors get to be too much, I'll search for non-con tags or request fics with the most horrific war/battle imagery possible. Those fics generally help in one of two ways: when the story goes into how the author thinks the survivors would(n't) have coped with their situation or sometimes merely to feel understood by someone, even if it's a fictional character. Much of my own writing could double as a dream journal and would likely cross many lines for other people.

** - There are more fics out there that I enjoyed, but these are the ones that I would describe as truly unique and singular
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is an extremely imaginative AU that is updated pretty frequently. I enjoyed this so much I read the author's crossover with Naruto. I don't even watch anime. This was also one of my gateways into the Harry has a Horcrux in his head that talks.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17040896][Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails]] is perhaps the most unique fic I've read in the fandom. The writing style and concept are just totally different than anything else I've read. You'll note that I'm not giving up any information; it's best to go into this one blind.
- The actual events in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11547009/chapters/25929084][Modern Romance]] are not particularly unique, but its framing device is. It is presented as a series in Witch Weekly, so every chapter is written from a different person's point of view and seem like disjointed oneshots, but there are stories that continue between chapters. It is a lovely, touching, original work. It is complete.\\
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is my number one fanfic of all time. I've been in the fandom for more than fifteen years and this is it for me. I'd like to be buried with it in my coffin. It is complete. I'm including it in the truly unique list because there is a method of magic that I have not seen anywhere else. And I read a lot. (I counted up the amount of fanfic I read last year. It was the equivalent of reading War and Peace 12 times.)
- Also by the author of TSLoP (see #1) comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]]. In this, Harry runs away before he gets his Hogwarts letter. He excels at instinctive magic and manages to block tracking magic. I love the feeling I have when I read this. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of an aching nostalgia. It is complete. This is another unique magic method.
