Having a really hard time summarising in the title, sorry. Basically I'm looking for fics where the main character has to hide a lot about themselves, especially in the sense of experience and competency. For example, fics where Hermione uses a time turning to go through extra training to help Harry, or WBWL where Harry has to stay in the shadows, but really has lots of training, or Snape dies and gets a do-over, and starts Hogwarts with all the knowledge of his adult self. Or even hidden relationship aspects, where some character knows that Draco/Snape/etc isn't really a death eater, but has to play along to maintain their cover. A few requirements:

- Must be complete.
- Must be over 50k words (over 100k is preferred)
- No evil Snape that gets killed in a horrible way (Snape is my favourite character...)
- Must be realistic. I know there are a lot of them that do randomly OP Harry, and they turn into total Gary Stu Crack Fics. I'm looking for more of a well thought out power growth, or a good reason for their knowledge.

Some examples of what I'm looking for would be Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance (Hermione is Salazar Slytherin reborn), Family Bonds (WBWL, Harry grows up being trained by Snape), Again and Again (Every time Harry dies, he ends up back at the start of his life, with all his memories in tact), Sin & Vice (Hermione spends years training to help Harry, with the help of a Time Turner), etc.

I prefer Harry, Hermione, and Severus centric fics, but I'm not picky. I don't have a problem with Slash or any of the usual trigger tropes. I just really want something that is long, well written, engaging, and /not abandoned/...

Thanks in advance.


** You'd probably enjoy the Sacrifices Arc, if you haven't already read it linkffn(2580283)

It is relatively "OP Harry" but there's reasons for it in-universe, and he still struggles to defeat enemies and overcome obstacles and such. It fits pretty well under your example of "WBWL where Harry has to stay in the shadows, but really has lots of training". Also has Snape as one of the main characters.

It's complete, and with 7 stories in the series, 4 of which are over 500,000 words, it's definitely long, and I would say it's well written. The first time I read it I only got a few chapters in and then dropped it, but picked it up again recently and I'm really enjoying it (currently on book 6), so give it a shot.

** MC hides who she is and what she's capable of from everyone except her cousin in linkffn(the pureblood pretense). She hides her school from her parents, she hides her identity from her classmates and mentor Snape, she lets the thieves she hangs out with think she's a boy even though she tells them her real first name, she hides her dueling training from everyone except her uncle Remus who accidentally finds out, she has a side business that relies on the proprietor she sells to maintaining her anonymity, and overall she's juggling three identities and even more cover stories the further the series progresses. Not written as a power fantasy though some elements are implausible upon further reflection.

It's on break in fourth year.

** So in linkffn(reboot by kallanit) Snape, Harry, and Hermione all get a redo in which they regain memories of their previous lives at age 11. Snape hides his memories alone until the kids hit 11 and then he trains them in secret. Warning about this story though, the Dumbledore bashing is hilariously bad. Otherwise it was pretty good.

Another one I haven't seen rec'd much is the Wise Ones trilogy, in which Harry and Sirius hide their identities and train in secret while moving around all over the world. It's a pretty great, completed story. I only made it to the end of Book 2 so far so I can't vouch for the third installment but 1&2 were really good. linkffn(The Wise One: Book One: Becoming by FarenMaddox)

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. Rating & Genres may change later.
