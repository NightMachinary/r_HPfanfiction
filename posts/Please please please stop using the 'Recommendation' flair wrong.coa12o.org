Sorry but this is irritating me and I have seen a lot of it recently. If you are asking for recommendations you use the 'Request' flair and if you are looking for a specific fic you use the 'Looking for a fic' flair. The 'Recommendation' flair is for when you are recommending a fic' to the other members of this subreddit.


** Oops, didn't know that.

** Maybe we should re-word the flairs to make them clearer? It could be kinda vague, especially the difference between looking for recommendations and looking for a specific fic we forgot the name of, for example.

** Feel like when it happens this often the flairs should be changed. I made this mistake in a post whilst actively trying to figure out what all of the flairs meant and being confused by the descriptions.
