Why on earth do some 11-year-olds in these fics speak like 20-year-olds honestly. Once saw Hermoine make comment about systematic racism and It really broke any of the small immersion i had left from Harry chatting shit. 11 year old would call your mother a stinka or a tramp someone cries and a teacher tells you off honestly these writers man smh

** In general it is a problem. But it's important to understand that the problem isn't /what/ they talk about, but /how/. Kids learn all sorts of things, both independently and from the milieu they grew up in. For instance, we think it's completely normal for a 6 year old to know tons about dinosaurs. 100 years ago, that notion would have been absurd - why would a small kid be obsessed with the dry science of fossils? So an 11 year old may well be aware of systemic racism and be able to use the term correctly in a general way. But she's not going to be able to talk about it with the same sophistication as a teenager or adult, nor is she going to know how to deal with it in novel situations.

Honestly, though I can accept the time line being brought forward. More annoying is when the time line stays explicitly what it would be in canon, but people still throw in anachronisms. Anachronisms which are quite easy to avoid, too, as most of the story plays in a society which is a bit removed from ours.

If they were raised by adults acting like adults and had little interaction with other kids, they are gonna act much more like adults, even if they won't understand all the intricacies and details.

That's not right for all children, it heavily depends on how they were raised and how their environment was.

Honestly, people are not consistent because of their age, have you seen Japanese children? Are they similar to European or American ones?

Have you watched period dramas or other kinds of media that show aristocratic children, raised by nobles with tutors and etiquette? They behave very differently from what you are describing, and it's still realistic because any child psychologist will tell you how children are malleable and a product of their environment, it's during teenage years they tend to vary wildly.

Even the source material had them acting different than what you are describing, Hermione and even Draco spoke with much more eloquence.

And who wants to read about kids acting like average kids? It tends to be boring.

*** You don't have to be an eleven-year-old to write one, lol. The truth is, real children are inconsistent to all hell. They alternate between infuriatingly dumb and stunningly brilliant, thoughtlessly cruel and incomprehensibly kind, mind-numbingly dull and oddly fascinating.

But that's not satisfying to read. People want their characters to be consistent, to make sense. They want them to constantly move forward, not stumble and change their mind and fall into obvious pitfalls. As an example, just look at how pilloried Ron is for occasionally letting his jealousy override his common sense.

I'm an only child, too, and even as a young kid, I used a wider vocabulary and spoke differently from kids in my school or church. I grew up primarily around my parents, who treated me as a small adult once I got to a certain age, so when we talked, I used language that was generally above the reading level of kids my age.

** 11 year olds know about politics and systemic racism. They may not all grasp all of the technicalities and complexities, but they still understand discrimination. I had a full conversation about redlining and how it can contribute to a cycle of poverty in minority communities with an 11 year old at my school last week.

I agree that sometimes the Slytherin!Harry fanfictions can be a little ridiculous and over the top, but if a child was raised in an extremely political environment, it's not exactly impossible. I was able to have lengthy discussions about authoritarianism vs totalitarianism and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict by the time I was 10, because it's something I grew up hearing about all the time.

And especially with something as prevalent as systemic racism, it's natural for kids to know a lot about it. 11 year olds don't live in a bubble, they hear people talk about these things on the news and they're taught about it and they talk about it in primary school during Black History Month. So it's perfectly plausible for an 11 year old, especially someone as intelligent as Hermione, to have an intelligent, complex opinion on systemic racism.

*** Exactly. My experience is similar. Have met smart, well articulated kids with varied knowledge as an adult and have also talked about problems in society at that age. Then again I remember often Bering exasperated with kids my age because their world view was vastly different then mine - self centred and mostly concerned with present happenings starring themselves. It has to do a lot with upbringing, reading level (also which books, and whether it's only children's books or not) etc. Obviously I didn't get many of the intricacies of the topics I knew about but still enough to have an opinion.

*** This, especially if said child is a marginalized group. Like, black kids generally learn about systemic racism LONG before white kids because they're smacked in the face with it from a very young age. Same with LGBTQ kids (and kids raised by LGBTQ parents) and homophobia, and disabled kids and ableism, and Jewish kids and anti-semitism, and so on.

Not every kid has the luxury of saying “politics is grown up stuff, I don't care about it.” In fact, most don't. And even if they do, if a kid can't at least grasp “discrimination exists and is bad” by age 11, even if they don't understand the nuances or have the maturity to come to terms with and unpack their own ingrained prejudices, the parents have failed spectacularly. Kids don't go from stupid little babies to intelligent adults the second they turn 18, it's a gradual process.

My younger sister and I have understood what implicit bias looks like since we were little, even if we didn't know what it was called until middle school. My LGBTQ+ friends and I have subconciously understood the dangers that comes with being anything but cishet before anyone told us. I've understood racial fetishization (sexual and otherwise) long before I've had unmonitored internet access.

** I'll agree that an 11 year old actually understanding what systematic racism is and the nuance of such debates (for example, it's not the laws, it's a relatively small group of people in the enforcement agencies who actively refuse to enforce properly and a larger number who are apathetic which is almost as bad) would be a bit of a stretch for anyone who wasn't some sort of genius (doesn't have to be Artemis Fowl level but still definitely above average; Hermione /might/ qualify but that's a bit of a stretch).

That said, I could easily see kids hearing those terms and trying to use them whether they're accurately applying them or not, and would probably argue that such coming from a muggleborn would be realistic in a next gen fic when the muggles are talking about that far more than in the 90's.

** I think until you sit down (as a 20 or 30 year old adult) and try to write an 11 year old, you can't really judge people for not being able to do it. It's hard AF because nobody really remembers what it's like to be 11 years old. The authors who do it best have children that age.

** I mean it does totally depend.

Think of the smartest kid in your class at 11 and how did they talk? That's what you should be comparing Hermione against, and possibly Draco too. Harry, Ron and the others are more typical kids, but in canon we have several high achievers including, for the Pureblood kids, probably a lot of homeschooled kids as we never have any indication of any kind of elementary school.

So homeschooled kids with private tutors might end up talking and acting a lot more like mini adults. If you've ever seen a period drama or e.g. The Crown on Netflix, the kids in those never talk like how we'd expect typical kids to talk either.

  Why on earth do some 11-year-olds in these fics speak like 20-year-olds honestly. Once saw Hermoine make comment about systematic racism and It really broke any of the small immersion i had left from Harry chatting shit.
#+end_quote

Even in canon Hermione was quick to spot bullying, discrimination and slavery. It was only logical that she ended up with protecting elf rights. IIRC she found, at 12 years old, horrible how Dobby was forced to punish himself.

  11 year old would call your mother a stinka or a tramp someone cries and a teacher tells you off honestly these writers man smh

11 year old white privileged kids, yes. 11 year old kids of color? Not at all. Hell I'm white but I at least listen to people on Reddit and elsewhere when they say that their parents gave them the "cop talk" at age SIX. Those less privileged in society are forced to grow up fast and early, and I would bet quite a sum of money that many fanfiction writers actually come from such backgrounds.

** I mean I headcanon that her mum is black, and thus went through uni to become a dentist as a black woman, and a lot of people do end up being quite political at uni. Maybe that's how her white sting bean of a dorky dad met her mum.

And you know Hermione quotes people and books a lot; especially when she's eleven. so depending on what she said, I'd just assume she was parroting her mother, or her aunt or grandma, who are adults who have had to deal with that kind of thing every minute of their lives.

And you know if she lives in an upper middle class area generally those are pretty white, and so her school would have been filled with snotty white kids who gave her shite about her hair, and the sugarless snacks her parents filled her lunch box with. Black kids in western/colonised countries are faced with a hostile world from the moment they enter it. They may not all be able to pronounce ‘systemic' (though we know a Hermione sure as hell can) but they understand probably better than I do about the pervasive, all encompassing, subtleties and nuance of ‘you're not welcome here, and I'll do everything within my power to ensure you won't thrive, no matter how smart you are or how hard you try'.

And I mean in a general sense, kids can be really good at picking up stuff that's going on around them or over their head, and coming out with some really profound (from a point of view you've never seen the thing Bec fore) and then go on to do something absolutely ridiculous and badly thought out. so who knows

But I do know what you mean. I know writing kids is super difficult to do well, but I do find it strange that people set out to write a story about eleven year olds and then say ‘kids are boring so I'll actually write them as tiny adults, up to and including perch comments about the developing bodies of prepubescent girls‘
