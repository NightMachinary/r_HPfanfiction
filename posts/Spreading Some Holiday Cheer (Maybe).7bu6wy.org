So I've completed four Harry Potter fanfics: linkffn (6535391; 6862426; 6943436; 9444529)

Last year I spent much of December writing an epilogue to Vitam Paramus centered around the Christmas holiday. It was more fun than it should have been and I decided this year I'd do something similar with one of my completed stories.

Interestingly enough, I had what I consider to be decent ideas for all four of them. So rather than picking one at random and rolling with it, I figured I'd throw ti up here and see what generated the most interest. I was just going to post a poll but the thought of that sorta bothered me so I figured I'd just see what happened throwing this up randomly.

I have already planned all four. I've debated posting what they would be about, but I think that sort of kills the surprise. They all do focus on the theme of the story that they are paired with, though. They will all take place after the main text of the story, but they might, depending on the story, take place before the written epilogues. I will publish whichever one I feel wins on either December 24th or 25th.

And please don't just say 'write more LdS!' the next chapter will be up within a week and I won't be able to write it's Christmas scene until next year after it's been completed!

** Pureblood Princess all the way. Although i have to say i never really understood the name of that fic.

I actually didn't read it for the longest time because i thought it was another one of those Ice Queen Daphne fics.

She just doesn't seem like either a typical pureblood or a "princess" to me in that fic. Just a typical teenage girl, which was one of the reasons i liked it so much. It'd be very interested in hearing your reasoning for the name.

--------------

Also: Vitam Paramus will probably forever be my all-time favorite Harry/Gabby fic without any actually Harry/Gabby romance.

*** I didn't change the title after drastically altering the plot. I wrote three chapters, hated it, took six months and replanned the entire story and then went from there. So the summary and the title reflect the first story and not the second.

Originally it was planned as a two parter following sixth and seventh year where the second part shifted the focus to Astoria. Astoria was the Princess and not Daphne. It was misdirection that became pretty much pointless after I changed the plan.

** From what I remember reading you're really not a fan of your own Letters story and how that started to unravel a bit, that being said its your most popular by favourites which I could imagine being slightly annoying. I personally think you should do another eqilogue to Vitam Paramus that picks up on the semi-established HP/DG in the story just to pay homage to the slightly jarring nature of Letters alternate epilogue.

** Very difficult to choose between four of my favourite stories (and indeed I changed my mind while writing this), but I'll go with Pureblood Princess by a hair.

The other choice was VP, but I think the present single epilogue left things at a good point, while PP still has several unresolved questions (how did Daphne react to rediscovering magic? Did Harry ever rekindle his friendship with Hermione and the Weasleys? Etc).

Whichever you end up doing, I'm sure I'll enjoy it.
