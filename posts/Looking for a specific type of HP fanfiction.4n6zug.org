Looking for a fanfic in which Harry does something unique and changes the world. Like Guy Fawkes Day, by MisterQ, or Bound in Survitude, by Little.Miss.Zanda. Any suggestions simalar are welcome.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig]] - The only non-crossover fanfic I know of containing wizards in space and beyond.

The ending gets a bit crazier than the rest of the book- the author obviously wanting to stop writing the fic and doing it in a speedy way but the rest is good.
