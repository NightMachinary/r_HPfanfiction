** So [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When In Doubt, Obliviate]], but with Slughorn and business after-hours networking events?

There's one fic out there that I remember Harry going to one of Slughorn's parties to schmooze with people who might be important to his future business endeavors (runes related maybe?) and Ron is kind of disapproving.

#+begin_quote
  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!
