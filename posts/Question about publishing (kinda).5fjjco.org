Hi all, first time here if I'm breaking rules I'm sorry I'm not trying to. Long story short, I have sister who I found out write HP fan fiction and has been doing so for a couple years. I thought it would be a nice Christmas gift to print out one of her "books" and give it to her. I'm not trying to proxy publish or anything of that sort. I just want it to be. A nice gesture. Does anyone have any ideas or experience is printing a real book? Places to use costs etc? One of her books is Try and Tri Again it's about Teddy Lupin and Victiore Weasley, if any of you are interested. Any help or advice would be appreciated.


** lulu.com is one well known company that allows you to essentially self-publish books.

*** Yes, lulu is pretty good. I'm having the Alexandra Quick novels printed for my husband's Christmas present, and they look great and cost about the same as buying a new book.

** You can 'vanity press' publish through various services. Amazon has one for instance: [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/seller-account/mm-summary-page.html?topic=200260520]]

The big issue, of course, is the use of Rowling's IP. Might be safer to try something like this: [[https://www.bookbaby.com/single-book-printing]]
