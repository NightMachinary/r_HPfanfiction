:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I'm trying to find a fic I read like 3 years ago that was on fanfiction.net and over 60k+ words and it had Harry strike a deal with Rita skeeter through blackmail that she was from scandavia and was previously an ahem adult film star. Harry was the typical cliche lord manip dumble I just want to reread it it to see how it holds up to my new standards.

Lastly there's a fic on AO3 that was at least 40k words where Harry's was Voldemort's son but both were some sort of magical creature that had some type of soul mate system and Harry's was Lucius. The magical creatures kryptonite was ice/cold magic. Any one know it? If anyone recognizes them can y'all please ping me and link them
