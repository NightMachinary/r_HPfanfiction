Has anyone read/written/found a fic where the Purebloods are /technically/ correct about something like:

- Muggleborns come from muggles stealing their magic? When a wizarding line dies out, new wizarding line(s) is created by /jargon/ to replace them... so Muggleborns /are/ the result of magic passing on from a pureblood line, but not anything nefarious.

- Purebloods are just better at magic? ...But only because the strongest/best wizards are insane and inbreeding increases your ...odds of being 'odd'... see: Lovegoods, Blacks, and Al vs Abe Dumbledore

--------------

Alternatively, whats your [[/s][best]] interpretation of pureblood dogma that makes it /technically/ correct?

Edit: also... what did I do wrong with my spoiler tag? It isn't mouse-overable.


** Magical power grows through adversity. To an infant, being near magic is painful. At first they didn't realize it, but pureblood families are essentially torturing their children from birth. It's worse when they live in heavily warded houses, like the Malfoys. Once you can use a wand, you've got enough internal strength that ambient magic doesn't hurt.

Harry Potter had blood wards and a magical scar to provide magical adversity, even stronger than most purebloods experience, guaranteeing him strength no matter what. Being locked in a cupboard and beaten repeatedly strengthened him further. Neville had some similar experiences in his childhood, and Ron had his brothers to provide trouble. Hermione had a somewhat lonely but non-abusive childhood far from magic, so she is unfortunately weak.

The reason Voldemort uses the Cruciatus Curse on his own followers is to make them more powerful. It's not a fast process, but it does work.

The "baby being born" with vague powers part of the prophecy wasn't what scared him. There's a good reason why Voldemort is afraid of anyone who's survived fighting him as many as three times, and that just reminded him how dangerous that could be in the long run.

Gotta wonder: when Voldemort bumps into Harry while trying to steal the Stone (after the third time the kid survives an attack from him, remember? [baby AK, broom attack, unicorn luncheon]), and given how he grew up being punched all the time (at least) by his cousin...what's the scouter say about the kid's power level?

Still, Voldemort is a combat machine. Looks like it's time for Harry to go to +space+ Atlantis to train under 100 times Earth's normal magical field.

Wait, why does Hermione (the unusually powerful "muggle-born") have a tail again? Is it really from that magical cat potion thing earlier in the year?

... actually, I think the main reason he acts like he cares is because he knows that deep down he doesn't and that is not a good thing. Grindelwald and their dreams of ruling over muggles, resenting his family for needing to take care of his sister, knowing Harry was treated badly by the Dursleys and sending him there despite it, Snape (too many to examples to enumerate here), Sirius (see Snape), and so on. He understands that he needs to be better and really tries. It's an artificial conscience, but it is a lot better than none.

** The closest I can think of for number 2 is that some pureblood families have "family magic", as in: they create (and hoard) a lot of strong spells and rituals that you can't just pick up from a book in Hogwarts. This doesn't make them "stronger", they just have access to better stuff.

Other than that, maybe some talents like being a metamorph or a seer makes pureblood lines stronger?

They have a point that muggleborns don't understand, and sometimes even refuse to understand, their culture. I mean, someone like Hermione doesn't pull her punches when she insults anyone who owns a house elf and calls them slavers. And how many others (even us) have joked that quidditch doesn't make sense and is a poorly thought out sport? A pureblood looks at that and sees an outsider insulting his tradition and national sport.

*** Oh... I knew I was forgetting something(s). Though the only metamorphmagus we can confirm in canon is a halfblood. I have read a few fics where this is a Black family trait that crops up occasionally. Secret family recipe spells is an obvious one that I should have remembered, and indisputably valid.

The slavery point is odd... I can't for the life of me recall if its canon or fanon that the elves need to leech magic out of the wizard they're bonded to in order to live. If they do, then calling it a symbiotic relationship between lazy wizard and starving elf is fair. If it isn't... then elves are technically slaves. I just can't recall which of the many interactions between Dobby and THE GREAT HARRY POTTER SIRS GRANGEY is canon at the moment.

The culture one is a fair point, in that it explains why the purebloods are against muggleborns without ceding that the muggleborns aren't perfectly justified in their scoffing at pureblood 'culture' since lets face it, Quidditch is a very nonsensical sport, written to be a narrative device / foreshadowing rather than a well designed game. Not that any real life sport sounds any better if you word the description with the intent of being off putting. See Robin Williams describe golf for instance. "18 <BLEEPING> times"

There is, as far as I know, no canon evidence that House-Elves /need/ wizards for anything at all. We know of two freed elves: Dobby, who does OK, considering the culture he came from; and Winky, who descends into depression and alcoholism, but, her elf-nature aside, she got unjustly fired from a job that she's had all her life, /betrayed/ by a family she loved, and almost all her peers have nothing but contempt for her --- and they aren't hiding it. How well would a typical human do under those circumstances? However, neither of them appear to be magically diminished in any way.

We do know that elf ownership is magically enforced: when Harry orders Kreacher to shut up in the beginning of HBP (or was it end of OotP?), Kreacher begins to /suffocate/. From Dobby and Kreacher, we also know that House-Elves can /want/ to change their ownership state or owner and can take steps and opportunities to advance that goal.

So, they are beings with sapience, self-awareness, consciousness, as well as free will and wants, who have, at least as far as canon evidence is concerned, bondage imposed on them magically, and reinforced through culture developed over centuries of said bondage. So, yes, they are enslaved people or, at the very least, any elf that serves an owner that he or she does not want to serve is certainly an enslaved person. Canon examples include Dobby (who wants to be free) and Kreacher (who wants to serve Narcissa or Bellatrix, rather than Sirius or Harry).

That said, there are some fanfics, or at least fan-speculation, that postulate that they are some kind of bound demon/imp/gremlin race that tried to conquer wizardkind and paid the price, and, if freed, they would eventually devolve back to teleporting, telekinetic terrors that they are. That might be something the purebloods are right about. However, there is no canon evidence of it, that I know of.

(Also, possible headcanon: the reason Hermione suspended her campaign to free House-Elves is that she found out about their true nature, but she didn't have the heart to tell Harry what Dobby was really about (or to admit that she was wrong), and their true nature probably wouldn't resurface until several generations without the cultural conditioning anyway, so no harm done...)

Whoever says they need to be freed for this to happen has never read book 2. That was Dobby when he was being /helpful/. Canon house elves are, or ought to be, terrifying to wizardkind. It only takes one witch or wizard looking over at their enthusiastic minion and lamenting that no one will rid them of this one turbulent priest... I'm surprised house elves are banned by the Wizarding Geneva conventions.

******* Now imagine a House Elf actively ordered to do it's level best bar none to "solve" a problem, a problem that might happen to be /you/. When you're done gibbering and regain your composure, ask yourself what the odds are that no one, in the history of ever, thought of that?

Even if 'common sense' says not to so so among purebloods who grew up knowing what house elves were before they were defeated (which we can't say for sure happened) history is rife with people making poor decisions in the face of a bad situation. Letting your bound house elf regain some experience with mischief is a tomorrow problem, your rival doing X Y and Z are today problems, the bloody bugger.

Edit: or maybe they did... hmmm... Harry never does ask /why/ life was so bad for elves under Voldemort's first reign of terror... maybe someone did send their elf to solve the problem, and Voldemort survived... which isn't hard to imagine given the steps he took even early on.

That could be an interesting fic... Hermione starts freeing elves... and wizards start vanishing without a trace.

******* That works. An elf's owner deliberately freeing an elf is not just giving him or her clothes, he or she is also ordering him or her to take them. Similarly, when clothes are given for a specific purpose, an elf may have other orders regarding them.

That would actually make Hermione's strategy make sense. Every piece of clothing left by her (a student of Hogwarts, the elves' "owner"), especially with intent to free elves, that a house-elf finds is an /opportunity/ for the house-elf to choose to be free, even if she can't order them to accept it. So, maybe she got the mechanics of freeing the the house-elves. Her problem was their culture: they not only did not choose to take this opportunity, they considered it an insult.

******** To be honest though her intentions were good, you could accuse Hermione of being a bit of a 'white feminist' - automatically assuming her culture and her position on another culture's 'suffering' is right without (ironically enough for Hermione) properly doing her research.

I like Hermione, but I do thing her problem-solving skills are off in this one. She wants to free the house-elves on principle without taking into account that they appear to actually desire to work and that not working sends them into depression. Although to be fair it's probably exacerbated by the fact that Ron and others around her continually say things like 'they like being enslaved' - word choice is key when what he really means is they like keeping busy.

Do we know this? It runs completely against all descriptions of Hermoine's character that she doesn't attempt to research elves - Hermoine researches everything, and canon doesn't ever have a pureblood wizard knowledgeably contradicting her positions.

Further, Hermoine founds SPEW in 4th year - the year right after she's spent lots of time researching (the apparent lack of) creature rights for Buckbeak's trial and then dealt with the prejudice the magical world has against werewolves.

Actually, looking it up, the first thing Hermoine says when she introduces SPEW is:

#+begin_quote
  “I've been researching it thoroughly in the library. Elf enslavement goes back centuries. I can't believe no one's done anything about it before now.”
#+end_quote

Which is exactly what you'd expect of Hermoine.

********* I am not necessarily defending Hermione here: it was most certainly not one of her finer moments [1]. A possible extension to the above headcanon is that Hermione read all about the mechanisms for freeing house-elves and the magic involved, but she hasn't though to talk to some to understand the culture that resulted. That seems like a very Hermione error to make.

At the same time, I don't think that we should fall into cultural relativism, either: that it's another culture is a weak argument, especially when membership in said culture is almost always coerced, and even when it's not, trying to leave it leads to ostracism at best; and when this culture is a product of millennia of magical slavery, a particularly insidious form given the self-punishment compulsion that seems to accompany it. Could offering the house-elves an opportunity, that they don't have to take, to free themselves have been the least bad option?

Ultimately, we do not know what an elf born and raised free would actually desire. (It may well be something horrible, which is why they are all enslaved.)

--------------

[1] On the other hand, it puts a lie to the fanon notion that Hermione is particularly obedient to authority: she went against /every/ authority in the society, universal ridicule, and with her few friends being indifferent at best, in order to follow the dictates of her conscience.

********** Oh absolutely, thought experiment and consider the options, I didn't mean to appear as if I was arguing with what you said, just expanding.

EDIT: I have just thought as well; the characters we see in Harry Potter are in a postwar context where there appears to be peace but truly there's a lot of polarisation. The house-elves at Hogwarts seem to be largely happy; whereas elves like Dobby who served a Death Eater family seem to be more under duress and torn between morals and duties. Perhaps Hermione is just not taking Dobby's context into consideration when applying her logic - Dobby is x, therefore all house-elves are x. Put that way, it almost seems as if Hermione is being a bit racist by taking Dobby as a spokesperson for his 'race', when he is one elf who was basically magical Britain's version of the butler for the Mafia and the nanny for their kids; other elves seem in general blindly loyal to their masters, and I'm not sure I remember any house-elf but Dobby doing the self-punishing.

*** For family magic, I like to think magic is somewhat sentient. So families that use the same magic over multiple generations would be "blessed" by magic to be better in that field of magic. Then that magic would then mutate into a family magic/trait.

So, if the metamorph talent was a Black trait, then maybe the Blacks were very good at transfiguration for so long that it mutated into the metamorph trait.

I also like to think that by inbreeding, the talent will disappear because the magic that could be used for the talent is instead being used to fix deformities/diseases caused by inbreeding. So Tonks, being the daughter of a muggleborn and a pureblood, would have the Black metmorph trait. Harry probably had a minor metamorph trait in him because he was able to grow his hair back using accidental magic. He was also the grandson of a Black so it would make sense.
