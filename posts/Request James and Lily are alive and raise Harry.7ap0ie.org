Looking for stories where James and Lily are alive and raise Harry. Harry can have a brother or sister, or more then one but absolutely NO! wrong boy/girl who lived in that regard please!

I want James and Lily to be written as actual loving parents, not parents who neglect Harry.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash. Would rather it be completed but if not it's fine.

Am fine with just one of the parents being alive. Harry doesn't have to be the main character or even the protagonist as long as James and Lily, or just James or just Lily are alive.

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game.

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.
