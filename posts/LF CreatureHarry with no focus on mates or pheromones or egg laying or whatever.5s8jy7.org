No mating season, no bonding to Draco because he is his one true alpha, no carrying Voldemort's children, no going into heat, none of that. Romance can play a part in the fic, but certainly not the majority and certainly not the driving force behind the plot. I'd prefer NOTHING involving soul mates or whatever, but if it's minimalistically done, I suppose I'll accept that.

Slash, bashing, crossovers and dark!harry are fine. No romance/smut-driven plot, mpreg, harems, genderbending or pottercest. Thank you.


** linkffn(8197451) Um, It technically doesnèt count as creature!Harry lol...

I really enjoyed it and the whimsical nature of the sequel, so here's Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** linkffn(Outcast's Alley) is pretty good as far as I can recall, though it's been a bit since I've read it. There's definitely some neat world-building concerning creatures in general in it. The lack of romance-driven plot drew me to it initially. Best of luck searching!

*** This fic irritates me a lot. It's pretty well written, but Harry's characterization is awful; he's even worse than canon - almost completely passive, reactive, bland and dense. And Hermione's portrayal is equally awful.

*Edit*: Having finished this (Merlin knows why), I have to say that 80% of the story is drivel. The beginning is interesting, but what follows is 180k words of "witty" useless banter - and the characters slowly become even more unlikeable.

  It was completely the wrong shape for a human and Harry was not an Animagus, so was very used the shape of a human, and therefore clearly aware of his very much not human body.

Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi
