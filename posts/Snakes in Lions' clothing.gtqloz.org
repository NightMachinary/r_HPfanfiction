Everyone seems to believe that Harry is a stubborn, run-into-danger-without-thinking, absolute Gryffindor. Everyone seems to believe that he is some pure, do-gooder who would never think about doing anything even remotely dark. Nobody would suspect that within his smiles and seemingly care-free grin, hides a bitter and hateful soul. Nobody would believe that secretly, he despises with all his heart all those who had wronged him in the past and would constantly imagine of different ways he could exact his vengeance, of course, without anyone ever suspecting him. Harry Potter has a lot of plans for this Wizarding World and nobody will ever see it coming until its too late. Of course, nobody would realise Harry's true nature except his two true friends, and they will be by his side no matter what will stand in their way.

*** Yeah. I was inspired by renegade and that oneshot fic about how Ron knows how different Harry is in comparison to Dumbledore but nobody in the wizarding world will see it.
