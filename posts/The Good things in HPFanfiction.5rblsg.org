There has been many posts of "What is the worst things within HPfanfiction" and they always end with the Lord, money, super powered crap with a rarety of someone saying something different.

Instead what have you read (Can be within many stories or just one in particular), that has stood out as something that is effective or you just really like?


** Of course, there's loads of lovely gems to find in fanfiction - it's why I read it after all. I won't list specific stories now but I love the explorations of magic in many stories, developing from the existing ideas in canon yet often displaying unique flavours.

I love some of the deeper looks into wizarding society, sometimes it's annoying like the aforementioned ancient lords but sometimes it's simply really interesting.

I love how some stories focus on minor characters, giving them deeper personalities. It's great that fanfiction allows for strange ideas to exist that mainstream wouldn't risk producing, being driven by economics, money.

I love the various alternate universes which are simply tons of fun when done well.

I love stories featuring time travel, a device that really lends itself well to fanfiction, due to being a derivative of other works.

I love the sheer range of genres Harry Potter fanfiction displays, both humorous and serious, romantic and family, tragedy and mystery. They all exist and some are so long which and must have taken a great deal of time to write.

Most of all I love the huge audience, still present even ten years after deathly hallows was published, always talking and reviewing and reflecting. Thank you for that, perhaps it's not said enough but I love fanfiction, I'm happy to take the good with the bad.

** Anything that can [[https://np.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2dq7gb/tearjerkers_of_any_length/][make me cry]] or [[https://np.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5dhu9g/what_is_the_best_most_impactful_line_from_your/][make me feel]] something.

The best fanfics are the ones where the most evil is done by those who do nothing, though getting it right is difficult with all the cliches built around that idea. I think Browncoat, Green Eyes does it pretty well, but then, I'm super biased.

Knowing where to describe visually in detail and where to assume readers will already know what something looks like is very difficult for most authors, especially those that stick closely to canon. If you describe nothing, it's dry and boring. If you describe everything, it's tedious. The best thing about fanfiction as a whole, and especially HPFF, is that there's no obligation to write a certain amount. If your story gets done in under 2000 words, it doesn't have to keep going. If you need millions of words and never stop, that's fine too.

** I personally like it when an author takes a part of the universe and makes it their own. You can always tell when an author feels the need to stay on the canon rails.
