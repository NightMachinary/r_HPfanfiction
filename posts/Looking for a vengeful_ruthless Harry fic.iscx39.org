I've had this itch lately that I've been unable to scratch. I don't really like fics that just mindlessly bash, so this aggression is mostly pointed at Voldemort and is Death Eaters. A few good examples of what I'm looking for are Sum of their Parts and For Lack of a Bezoar. I'm at my wits end here, so please help a poor man out.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start]]) there isn't much bashing in this at all that I remember (outside of Dumbledore), though Hermione is a bit pretentious during one part. It does end Harmony. I'd also say that most of the vengeance is set off camera, so that might not be the best for you.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.
