I've come across this a few times, and it seriously pisses me off, but I don't know if I'm just being touchy. I know that most authors write from experience, and write about things that they feel passionately about. But if I'm reading a fluff piece, I don't want to deal with an entire chapter about your pro-life/pro-choice opinions... It completely puts me off a story. I've also seen fics that make a lot of allusions to gun rights, legalised drug use, the death penalty, etc etc, though those weren't quite as "in your face" about it... But in most cases, it still throws me out of the story and makes me roll my eyes at the very least. But I just finished yet another fic that went on a tirade about abortions. This one was pro-life and spent literally an entire chapter ranting about how Hermione thought it was absolutely disgusting that the mediwitch would even suggest that she get rid of her baby. The last one was actually pro-choice and involved a multi-chapter argument between Hermione and Ron about a woman's rights... I'm not going to get into my own opinions on these issues because frankly, they don't matter, but I will say that both of these fics lost serious points with me for how they addressed it.

So basically I'm wondering if other people get just as annoyed about this, or if it's just me...


** You're in this community for a while now, you should have learned by now: A lot of fanfiction is crappy, ignore it. Close the tab, and move on.

I usually just skim over rants, if the story is good, otherwise I just stop the story.The problem with a thing like that it usually means that the author has no idea of how to write a good, flowing story with realistic human interaction.

People don't often /rant/ in real life, especially in a group of 4-5 people. Hermione never /ranted/ about House-Elves rights, because that's not her style. She uses short, convincing (in her eyes) arguments, and discusses. Short. Communication is two-way.

In real life it's usually like this: You can either convince the other person, or the two people will clash. People /interrupt/ each other. That is why every half-way premeditated discussion has a moderator. Be it in TV, in radio, or anywhere.

[[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36304313][Austria]] tried a debate once without moderator between professional politicians, and it turned into a shitfest. And these are people which have arguing as a job.

So neither a long discussion is realistic (unless between very good friends, and a topic they can kinda agree on - to refine the other's opinion, not to change it), nor is a rant in any two-way medium, except in very special cases.

*** Lol, you have a point. I will admit that I've been a bit surprised a few times though, because the fic was actually really good overall, and the rant blindsided me and was completely OOC... But yeah, I just skimmed it and moved on. It just frustrates me I guess. :-)

** Some of the greatest literary works have been very political. I think the issue here is that you're just reading bad fanfiction.

** It depends on how unskillfully they do it.

I enjoy a lot of fics that include real life issues into them. And when they're done well, it can often elevate a fic. When they're done clumsily, however... well, let's just say I can't click the back button fast enough.

I think the issue here isn't that the author is pushing an agenda (since, after all, isn't all writing pushing /some/ sort of an agenda, at their basest level?), it's that they're using their characters as author mouthpieces without any real thought to how these characters would actually act as /human beings/. And sometimes it's like reading out of a textbook or a pamphlet. This aren't how people engage in these discussions! This just isn't how people /talk/!

So, yeah, I like when authors engage with actual issues, but they still have to treat their characters as people first. Otherwise, it just reads like a really badly written propaganda piece. Or a self-insert.

*** Yes! Exactly! I don't have a problem with fics that touch on societal issues, so long as it's done in character makes sense with the context of the fic. But when you have a fic that doesn't have anything to do with /insert issue here/, and the author decides to basically take a break from the plot and use their character as a mouthpiece, as you said, that's when I have a problem...

** It depends. If it makes sense for a character to defend a view, or if it supports/moves along the plot, I'm indifferent about it. Any view I hold that can be changed by fanfiction is worthy of review anyway.

However, if it pauses the plot and becomes "ideology exposition" I close the tab.

You brought up Hermione and Ron arguing about women rights. Character wise it makes a lot of sense. Hermione is brought up in a highly educated household with both parents working (statistically speaking for a progressive family culture), while on the other side Ron grows up in an environment of a very traditional household. Its a culture clash. But then there are fics (,maybe I've read the same as you,) where the inevitable clash ends up being a presentation about the core points of feminism instead of a clever dialogue between two characters of opposite opinions.

In the end I couldn't care less as long as I'm entertained by it.

** Frankly, for me it's probably going to be if I agree with it I smile inside and move on and if I disagree with it, I ignore it. If I really dislike it, I'll probably just stop reading the fanfic.

** Political agendas are fine as long as the execution is perfect. Two characters ranting for a few pages doesn't cut it. It has to be subtle in order to come off well in most cases.

** Well... since JKR did it very blatantly, I guess it won't bother many here on principle. Although many I think will be bothered when the pushed agenda clashes with their own views.
