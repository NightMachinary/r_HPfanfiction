Perhaps this is just my impression, but I feel like most of the time, the writing, on a technical level, is better. At the very least you don't get the "english is not my native language" fics, which might be what gives that impression.

I've only read a couple fics in other languages, but I find it really funny that the fanfiction only tropes carry over to different languages. You still get evil manipulative dumbledore, Amelia Bones is still Susan Bones' guardian (as she obviously should be) and Snape is still Draco's godfather.


** Norwegian is not the most expressive language, and the official HP translations are so cringeworthy and bad (quidditch=rumpeldunk, which is an unappealing word even without the added connotation of it sounding like slang for anal sex), so I would not want to read fan fiction in Norwegian (and I don't think I've ever seen one). The "problem" with non-native speakers writing in English is easily solved by getting a beta who fully masters the language, and problems I see in fics by writers who say "not my native language" are also present in fics written by English native speakers who don't use betas. I tried reading French fan fiction, to see if I could keep up. However, having only read the first book in French I quickly realized that "no, my French us not good enough", and also that some of the HP-specific words and names were so different in French that I lost track completely.

**** They also dubbed the golden snitch "gullsnoppen". Gull means gold, so that makes sense, but snoppen is a euphemism for penis (most commonly used by or around children). So there are balls flying everywhere, and the goal is to catch the willie in your hand.

** I have read many German fanfics (also from other fandoms) and they are weird. There is a certain style that all German fanfiction writers use (or used; I haven't read a German fanfic since 2004 or so). It's just cringe worthy in my opinion. You also get that in English but I haven't found one good German fanfic.

**** You know those beginner fanfics in the early 2000s? They are kind of like that. More casual and colloquial than is common. Most languages use a different style for their written part of the language and if someone writes how they speak it is odd. German is a rather complex language to write in (four cases, gendered nouns, longer sentences) and in the oral part it is more simplified and that's the way I remember most German fanfics to be.

** Native spanish speaker here. I've read a few in Spanish. /El ocaso de los Altos Elfos/ is probably one of the most well known. It was sort of big news for a while.

They aren't /bad/, but it's not the same as reading it in english, you know? It kinda loses a little "charm".

*** For me it's that most of them aren't neither good nor original, like, I just saw the 25 fics in ff.net with more favourites in Spanish and I saw a Harry centric story, one Hermione/Sirius, one Hermione/Ron, there was a Scorpius/Rose Weasley (that's basically Dramione) and 21 Draco/Hermione

****** As I said, /El ocaso de los Altos Elfos/ was pretty decent, though it's almost 10 (?) years old, so it's kinda dated.

For the rest, I guess that since there's just so many more in english, it's easier to find better quality ones.

** I'm French, but most of the fanfictions I read are in English. I do enjoy reading them in my native language, however there aren't that many french fics in the first place. If I want to read something specific, or about a particular romance, I'm very limited.

Many authors who aren't native English speakers will still write in English so their story can reach as many readers as possible. Because of that, you can find a lot of fics with interesting and unusual plot. I think it's really cool :)

**** Indeed, hell most of my reading these days is done in English (most books are writen in English - makes sense as most decently educated people have learned that language at school, not to mention that there are a ton of native speakers (the British, the Australians, the Americans, the Canadians...etc. etc.))...I only read a few German things (my native language) like my local newspaper! Books only if I can't get an English version :) (I don't want to end up like many other people who've learned a language in school and later lost their proficiency! Nope, nope, nope not going to happen to me!)

** I read also in Hungarian fics, you can also found some really good original stories and lots of good translations (and of course bad ones also). The reason to begin the English ones was some good Hungarian translation but I got impatient and went to the source. The Hungarian translator of the books was a genius, lot of names and terms are different so I needed to learn the English terms.

** I read a few in german... or rather, I began to read a few. They tend to be really awful overall.

I think the main problem with German is that most authors writing in German have to get over their "OMFG lets get /fancy-fucking-fabulous/ with the writing" phase, which may or may not end with maturity. German is incredibly versatile - any language with rules for compound words tends to be. But German even opens up sentence structures and whatnot at your leisure. Its insane, and I understand anyone who gives up on learning the language because there is literally an exception to /every single grammatical rule/, and Mr. or Ms. Fancyauthor loves to write exclusively in exceptions.

** For what I remember from french fanfictions there were a bunch of somewhat good dramione, a whole lot of mary-sues going to hogwarts with the protagonists and falling in love with harry (or draco) and seldom hidden gems focusing on left out characters. I guess the problem is the way they are written, it always sound forced and remind me of the essays you're forced to write for your french teacher in high school, way too academic.

** I read a few french stories. Most of them aren't very good, but I came across a few readable ones like linkffn(le sang des anciens) off the top of my head.

Still not comparable to english stories, since most speakers of other languages write in english, since it is a more prevalent language.

** I've read some German ones and while it is weird (Note: I am German and it is my native language, but I've read the HP-Books in English from the get go because I read them first when I was already 19 (they just flew under the radar before my then GF gave them to me!)...and reading them in German (and HP fanfiction in German) is weird, especially since the translations are off! They also translated names, which to me is a capital crime (note: I went to a foreign language school so I am capable of translating English into German and vice versa very well!), like Hermione becomes Hermine (sorry, but: Does not compute!) or the Knightbus becomes Der Fahrende Ritter (I think...I don't like remembering what I consider butchery and mutilation!)):

There were still some decent ones!

I'd love to try Spanish ones, but I've got a lot of work ahead to get my Spanish to that level (don't want to try that before I am speaking the language decently...did that with English! I read the Lord of the Rings (complete edition!) in English when my English was still pretty shoddy...It took me 6 months to read that bloody book! It was worth it, sure but it was still annoying to have to look up every 3rd-5th word at first!)
