Hi! So with the announcement of [[http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them/38251/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-five-films-planned][five]] new HP movies I thought we all should find our crystal balls and drain our tea cups and divine the future for HP-fanfiction!

How do you think the movies will effect fanfiction? What do you hope the movies will bring? What do you fear the movies will do to fanfiction?

I'll start: So my one and only wish is for the movies to broaden the horizon of fanfiction. There are more animals out there than dragons, basilisks and unicorns. I hope to see new animals and places that feels, well, magical. And as such I hope that the movies brings some new flavours into fanfiction that pushes authors into new directions.

I also think the movies might revitalize some old hands and bring new authors into fanfiction, sure we are going to get 100k+ stories that are a waste of words, but I do hope for some new gems. So what do you think about the future of HP-fanfiction?

Edit: I also have no idea how to format it to make it more readable, tips?


** My predictions:

Grindelwald will be the main villain of FB.

Dumbledore will play an important role.

We may see glimpses of Tom Riddle.

** If Dumbledore plays a role, I hope it gives a new direction to his character. How he influenced magical society after his sister's death. How big of a role he played in WWII.

I'm too tired of reading manipulative Dumbledore.

** I am hopeful that the series will stand alone in terms of characters such that the magical world can be explored as snapshots of time and geography. A story in Africa about the Nundu and other stories in other places. Distinct locales and distinct people such that each might spawn its own universe, but not as cheesy because the films no longer have to be directed at children as a primary audience.

Thus an exploration of magic at many times that would really expand what information ff authors have to draw from in a character and narrative sense. I expect none of this, I merely hope for it.

Btw it's affect in this case not effect.

** For one I just look forward to a bit more worldbuilding. I already dread whats to come and how much I'll have to ignore, but at least we get some new stuff to discuss.

New places, new people, new creatures,... I can't wait. Finally we get a new protagonist on which we can base stories.

What I hope for fanfiction is that people divide their focus from Hogwarts and the British Isles to a broader playing field.

From the movies I hope they don't just play in the United States. The following Ameriwank would be unbearable. I hope, since she hinted on Grindelwald, that we also see continental Europe and maybe we even glimpse towards Asia and Africa.

In any case I'm looking forward to some new stories. Fresh stuff is always good for a fandom.

** My hope is that it will expand canon materiel. There are severe limitations of how Harry interacts with the wizarding world considering he's in school, but I am hoping these movies will explore other issues like alternate career options, and the market out of (diagon and knockturn) or even just about creatures would be interesting.

** We are /finally/ going to get a better idea of just how wizarding societies are structured around the world. I cannot say just how much that excites me, since blindly groping in the dark is really hard when it comes to trying to write societies that may or may not predate their muggle counterparts by decades if not centuries. For one thing, their version of the UN is centuries old. How the hell do you write/account for that? We may soon know the answer.

** I'm excited to read the vampire!beast!dark!unicorn! renditions. The protagonist will take time off from following the exact plot line of the movie to angstily jerk off in a corner before going back to fucking his massive harem. He'll then finish everything off by giving a speech to the antagonist on exactly why he's a dumb piece of shit.

** *My hopes:*

- As others have said, new perspectives on magical creatures.

- Interesting characters with complicated flaws and motivations.

- A continued emphasis on choices between doing what is easy and doing what is right.

*My fears:*

- A plethora of new American OC-Sues who help Newt save the day.

- Factions drawn up to debate the legitimacy of new canon content with each side drawing from the new films to support its claim in biased fanfics.

- A rash of stories deriding the original series in favour of the new one.

** Since /Fantastic Beasts/ takes place (at least partially) in Harlem, NY, I expect there will be an increase in fics set in the US.

Harlem in that period was primarily black, and the US as a whole is only two thirds white. /Fantastic Beasts/ doesn't reflect that. So I expect almost all OCs to be white.

/Fantastic Beasts/ has references to First Nations magic, if I recall correctly. However, it doesn't do anything to make those references reflect any beliefs or myths or lore or history of any people group. So I expect a mild surge in talk of native North American peoples and magic, but I expect that it will be equally unresearched and uncaring toward the people depicted.

I would /like/ more fics that contain fresh looks on what magic in the Americas could look like, especially with a non-Euro-centric view. I would like fics that deal with international politics. I don't expect many of them.
