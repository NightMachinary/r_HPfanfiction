There're quite few stories with teen!Tom Riddle (in school) or very adult. Do you have any whe he's in his 20th or 30th? And in close relations with Harry (love/friendship/other). Time travel, AU, parallel Universe - any will do.


** I just finished this story yesterday and am in love with it. "So theres a train" by leif

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11674462/1/So-there-s-a-train]])

I cannot recommend this one enough. I know some people will be put of by the fact that it's a non-magic AU. However, I would ask you to give it a go anyways. It's a post-apocalypse AU where Harry is an inventor. But what's really amazing is how complicated and realistic the author has made the politics. Rebuilt by Terrific_Lunacy

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2702009/chapters/6046874?view_adult=true]])

This one is about manipulation and politics. It's a very interesting read. Their interactions are more like a game with each other. Dreams and Darkness Collide by Epic Solemnity

  Death and Fate give Voldemort a re-roll before the final battle, allowing him to escape unscathed. With the Wizarding world believing him dead, a sane Tom Riddle returns to (frustrate Harry) thwart the prophecy with the well-scorned 'power of love'. A short told in progressively quicker skips and snippets. Slash. HP/TR

  AUSLASH! Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned

** linkffn(Horror of our Love)

linkao3(When lies turn into truth)

edit: I definitely only read the title before posting. Horror of our Love has Tom in his early-ish 20s, I think, but When Lies Turn into Truth is teen Tom. Whoops!
