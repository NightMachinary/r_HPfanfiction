A little over three years ago, my writer's block finally ended. I was so happy at that, that I wrote a silly action novella that was basically a GTA 5 mission in the Harry Potter world. After publishing it, I asked the readers whether they were interested in a sequel. They were, and that spiralled into The Elder Tales. This was its final part. The trilogy, for those interested in reading it, is about 30 year old Harry and Ginny's relationship as Harry is forced to take the Elder Wand in possession again to save Ginny's life. It's around 240k words long in total, and I've had nothing but positive reviews!

I'd like to thank all the people who helped me with the writing and the editing process: Inareskai, Jenorama, Lawyer, and Vlaai. I would have gone mad somewhere in the planning stage or during editing without their help. I'd also like to thank the most active reviewers: Godricshelm, Bluest Witch, Bolshevikmuppet, and Yuan. Their words of encouragement have made my day brighter countless times.

**** Thank you for the reminder, first of all! I appreciate it, and I appreciate the feedback. [[/u/Lineofeld19]] words it well: Dumbledore didn't have all the Hallows, and I should add that he was far more adept at Occlumency than Harry.

Harry's weakness is his depression. It's a shame you don't like it, but it was a conscious writing choice.
