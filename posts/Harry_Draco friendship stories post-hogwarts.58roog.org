** Other than the already mentioned Big Brother is Listening to You is the linkffn(A Fine Spot of Trouble by Chilord), where Draco is getting married and wants to invite Harry, and ends up [[/spoiler][pulling Harry out of alcoholism]].

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

*** I forgot about this one but you are absolutely right. I read this after it was recommended here and I was surprised I had never seen it before. I really enjoyed this one. The author of big brother has another story called "the 8th year" about returning to hogwarts after the war. Eventually Harry and Draco become friends but it is a long, kind of fluffy fic.

** There was a fic I read called linkffn(big brother is listening to you) that has this as a big part. Basically it's a way to make Harry/Daphne work by making the wizard ing world have a version of the show big brother. But Harry and Draco becoming friends is a big part. I can't remember who Draco is paired with but I don't think it's hermione. It's a neat little fic with lots of Harry/Draco bromance fluff.

Edit:turns out its Gabrielle. If I remember correctly it actually works pretty well.

  A new show on the Wizarding Wireless Network launches 5 years after the final battle. It will place 10 'celebrities' in a house together for 2 months. Friendships and romances will blossom, but rivalries threaten to rip them apart. Who will win 'Listen-In' and the prize of a thousand galleons that comes with it? AU post-DH, Rated M for language, sexual and sensitive themes.
