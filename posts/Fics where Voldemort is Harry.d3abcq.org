So either Riddle takes over Harry's soul or Harry is some combination of Harry and Riddle. Not as in he is two people in one body but just he as a person is a combination of Harry and Riddle.

He can have memories or being Voldemort or he can have no memories of his past either works. There can be two voldemorts like Riddle Harry vs actual voldy thats fine but doesnt have to be the case.

Ive seen two with this concept. One was HPMOR and one was some Riddle/Tonks story. I had mixed feelings on HPMOR and i really didnt like the Riddle/Tonks one mainly cuz I don't like the ship but I did like the Harry is Riddle concept.

I prefer no ships for Riddle Harry especially if he has more memories of being Voldemort.

But if there are ships no ships with Anyone in Harrys year(including Harry) x Tonks or anyone older than Tonks

And more plot or character based than ship based. And no gender bending

Apart from that m/m m/f f/f its all good.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
