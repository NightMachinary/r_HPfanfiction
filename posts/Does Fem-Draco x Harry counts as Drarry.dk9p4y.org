** Tbh i would say that any gender pairing of Draco and Harry is Drarry - in my opinion the pairing is about how they act and not the gender.

** It's about the name as Drarry made up fan name. If Fem-Draco's name starts with ''Dr'' then it's Drarry, if not then it isn't.

** Is she called Draco? If yes than weird, and secondly Drarry.

If not then no, it is Female Malfoy/Harry Potter.
