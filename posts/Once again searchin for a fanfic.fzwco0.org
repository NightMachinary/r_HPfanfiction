So i read a fanfic on ffn where Harry travels back in time with a special magical knife (or something). Later he finds out he destroyed his world by traveling with that knife. Basically he travels back into the dieing body of his former self (quiddich injury) during second year i believe? (It's been a year or so since i read it) He creates a harem with Hermione, Luna, Padma and others (don't remember them) and i thought it was a good Fanfiction. I don't remember if there were smutty parts or not (don't think so, but not sure). I hope that's enough for somebody to find the story.
