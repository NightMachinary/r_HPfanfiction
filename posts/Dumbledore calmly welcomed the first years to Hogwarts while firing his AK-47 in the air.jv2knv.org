Basically a world where Dumbledore does things "calmly" like the meme and people just roll with it. Otherwise he's just the same Dumbledore just hammy.

Of course the he gets "angry" he starts doing really violent stuff like kicking people off buildings, beating them with giant tables or getting them eaten by Fluffy for his entertainment.


** "GO TO YOUR COMMON ROOMS, SHITSTAINS!" Dumbledore said calmly. "FOLLOW YOUR PREFECTS! OUT OF MY SIGHT BEFORE I START SHOOTING!"

OoOoO

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled as he looked at Harry and Hermione. "Time is on your side."

Hermione's eyes widened. "You want us to use the Time Turner?"

"WHAT DID YOU THINK I WAS TALKING ABOUT! TIME MAGAZINE?!" Dumbledore questioned calmly. "SHUT UP AND SAVE SIRIUS BEFORE I SLAP SOME SENSE INTO YOUR DUMBASS!"

Hermione paled before grabbing Harry and turning her Time Turner as quickly as she could.

OoOoO

“IT WAS SO FUCKING FOOLISH FOR YOUR DUMBASS TO COME HERE TONIGHT, TOMMY BOY!” said Dumbledore calmly. “THE AURORS ARE ON THEIR FUCKING WAY-”

“By which time I shall be gone, and you dead!” spat Voldemort. He sent another Killing Curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security guards desk, which burst into flame.

"YOU CAN'T EVEN AIM RIGHT, YOU NOSELESS BITCH!" Dumbledore said calmly. "SHOULD I SHOW YOU HOW A REAL WIZARD DOES IT?!"

OoOoO

“They met some of your guards. They're having a fight down below. They won't be long. ... I came on ahead. I --- I've got a job to do.”

"GET ON WITH IT THEN, YOU GUTLESS LITTLE BITCH!" Dumbledore said softly. "I'LL SPARE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY IF YOU GIVE ME BACK MY WAND! YOU HAVE OPTIONS!"

“I haven't got any options!” said Malfoy, and he was suddenly white as Dumbledore. “I've got to do it! He'll kill me! He'll kill my whole family!”

"DO I LOOK LIKE I CARE! I'M YOUR HEADMASTER NOT YOUR THERAPIST!" Dumbledore said kindly. "IF YOU WANT SOMEONE TO VENT YOUR PROBLEMS TO, GO VISIT THAT NOSELESS FREAK, NOT ME!"
