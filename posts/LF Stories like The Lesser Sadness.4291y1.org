*** The thing that gets me about this request is that you sort of wrote your story in order to parody this very trope. And now your story is held up as one of the best examples of it.

*** The idea is certainly there in a lot of shitty super!Harry fics.

Harry inherits Merlins memory on his 14th birthday, and shit.

**** I thought the idea is Harry Potter/Order of the Stick (the three voices idea came from there)? The time-travelling and super!Harry was just the logical aftermath.

**** I remember one were he was like the 9th, last, and most powerful to get Merlin's power/memories? Voldermort was 8th but didn't full inherit his piece of it or some shit? Really bad but ok to waste time on

***** I like that you didn't use any conventional famous mages like Merlin or something, and I like Penelope as an idea. May the creative juices flow and your enemies grovel

** It's not quite /The Lesser Sadness/ in tone, but a couple of old stories (dating back to 2002) linkffn(The Order of the Phoenix by Ruskbyte; The Well of Shadows by Ruskbyte) have elements of what you seek.

#+begin_quote
  Completed Sequel to The Order of the Phoenix. Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts has begun and with it a mix of friends and enemies, old and new, an ominous prophecy, great battles, and a pair of truly crazy DADA teachers. All hell is about to break loose.

  *Completed* Harry's fifth year and he's just been chosen by the Order. Kinda strange, especially since the only living member in the Order is Harry! New powers, new friendships, new relationships and old enemies. H/G and R/Hr.

**** Not really. They were a guilty pleasure back in the day^{†} , but not really readable anymore. Russ has far better stories.

^{†} Unless you're into smutty PWP, that is, in which case his outtake /Alternative Sleeping Arrangements/ found on fanficauthors.net is some of the best writing of that form in fanfiction.
