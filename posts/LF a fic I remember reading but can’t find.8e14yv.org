There was a part where [[/spoiler][Lily comes back to life when Harry holds a locket and touches her or something of the sort]], that's the main thing I remember from it though.

Anyone know it?


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path) has Lily come back to life when he touches her exhumed body due to magic stored in a runic necklace she made? Happens later in the fic.

#+begin_quote
  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
