Last year I wrote a story and posted it to ff and a03. Looking back, it's not great and basically your typical smutty fanfiction. I've rewritten most of it and want to post the new one. Being a new author, how should I do this? Delete the old story and reupload? Upload this as a less sexy companion?

Thanks!


** Personally, I'd upload the second as a 'version 2' or 'rewrite' or some variant thereof. Sexy Fic V2: Electric Boogaloo, basically. Mark in the original fic somehow (either in the summary or the first chapter) that the fic has been rewritten and link/provide a place to find it.

** I am all for replacing the old text.
