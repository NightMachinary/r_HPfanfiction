I guess it doesn't make much sense, but despite how many times I've read the series, the main thing I didn't like about it was the main character (then again, I also watch The Vampire Diaries). Any good story that features him as little as possible interests me.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594634/1/FINDING-HIMSELF][Finding Himself]] - Harry is a character, but mostly background to Cedric and Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4238384/1/Aucune-Defense-Pour-Toi][Aucune Defense Pour Toi]] - Harry is barely in this. Hermione/Fleur.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick series]] - Completely AU, takes place in wizarding America. Absolutely brilliant.

**** That's a great point! I think I meant to say something like, "completely non-canon plotline focused" or something to that effect.

#+begin_quote
  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.

Harry is in it but the focus is on Snape and the kids in Slytherin - including a non-romantic OC

** Arsinoe de Blassenville's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1875189/1/The-Prefect-s-Portrait][The Prefect's Portrait]] fits the bill; it focuses on Lily Evans and Hermione Granger. Novel-length, complete.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7781192/1/][Harry Potter without Harry Potter]]:

*FFnet Summary:* Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

*My comments:* The summary doesn't mention that Voldemort was discorporated as well, so the situation in September 1991 is not dissimilar from canon, though it diverges quickly. It has a rather unique element of Hermione tricking her way into becoming a Durmstrang student.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9950232/1/][Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation]]:

*FFnet Summary:* In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;)

*My comments:* A fic loosely inspired by /HPMOR/ (but one less willing to sacrifice characterization for the didactic component, and the protagonist is far less obnoxious) and /Worm/ (though not a crossover). Harry is present, but they don't interact much, since Hermione is in Ravenclaw.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/][Amends, or Truth and Reconcilliation]]:

*FFnet Summary:* Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

*My comments:* Harry doesn't play a significant role.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9045882/1/][A Pound of Flesh]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9672145/1/][Ill Met by Moonlight]]:

*FFnet Summary:* AU: In her sixth year, Hermione engineers a way to reawaken Tom Riddle's diary. But forbidden magic has its risks, and she finds herself locked in a deadly battle of wits with the most dangerous teenaged Dark Wizard of all time. A game where the only way to win may be to prove the Sorting Hat's decision to put her in Gryffindor wrong. TW: Torture (some sexualized)

*My comments:* /Not/ Tomione or romance of any sort. Harry doesn't show up at all.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]] - I'm right in the middle of it, and it is FANTASTIC. Legitimate Bellamione due to time/dimension travel.
