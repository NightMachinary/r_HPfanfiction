Especially side characters!

Bonus points if you're talking about a character other than Dumbledore, Snape or any of the Golden Trio (you have to admit, we complain about those an awful lot already.)


** McGonagall really. She's fallen into this sort of duality, where she either comes to Harry's side irrevocably and fully, or she is shown to be a worthless mentor/ally to Harry.

Admittedly, canon has clear examples of both tendencies. Unfortunately it has very little screentime of normal student/head of house supportive interaction.

I haven't read a nuanced McGonagall in so long, I'm starting to doubt I ever read one.

** Sirius Black! I don't know how many times I'm going to stress this out: he was not a whiny, stupid and flirtatious womanizer (this one maybe, but when it's his /only/ defining trait, like what even?)

His Hogwarts years: Sirius was arrogant, reckless and the top of his class (along with James). He was also borderline sociopathic! Leading Snape to the whomping willow is /not/ excusable and getting revenge by killing a guy in public is completely twisted. Period. He'd have been sullen and angsty. Because what kid that has run away from a abusive home and family with twisted idelaogies isn't going to be? No, he was NOT stupid and nor was he a whiny kid that only did pranks, stared at Remus's intelligence with awe, got drunk between classes and skipped them, kissed every single girl he laid eyes on and jumped from the astronomy tower because /James dared me to Moony!/

After Azkaban: Please /please/ tell me why Sirius always cracks a joke every single moment and seemingly isn't worried about anything. He actually /encourages/ Harry to drink alcohol /outside/ in lots of stories and cowers with fear whenever Molly confronts him. Like /no/. Sirius wouldn't let Harry out of his sight in canon and would not let him get drunk outside when Death Eaters could easily get him. Sirius did not confuse Harry with James and could tell that he was not him.

He /whines/ to Remus and is always around people. No, he was more sullen and moody and angsty than ever before. He wouldn't just be 'himself' after Azkaban and I'm not sure whether he'll be so enthusiastic and bombastic all the time. It's canon that he preferred Buckbeak's company to even that if Harry's. Making Sirius out like that after Azkaban as though unaffected from it is being unfair to his character. Azkaban was not a picnic to be enjoyed and it left him messed up and mentally unstable to an extent.

And he gets disarmed in most fanfiction quickly when he first enters battle. No. Sirius wouldn't just stare blankly at a wall and suddenly start pondering the meaning of life as /Ginny/ disarms him. He was an outstanding wizard and that much was true. It's stressed out in canon a lot, actually but people seem to forget about it.

I'm not saying that all fanfiction portrays him that way but most of them do and it's unfair to his character. Sirius is such a popular character but he gets so misrepresented in fanfiction that it drives me mad. Especially because he's my fav

I think a lot of you might disagree with me but this is how I see it. When it really comes down to it, he's just like any other Black except more open-minded about blood, werewolves and muggles.

*** I mostly agree with your characterization, and am also super frustrated by how he's portrayed in the fandom, though I think you might be being a little hard on him about Hogwarts days. From what I remember, Sirus didn't "lead" Snape, he said "go check under the whomping willow". I'm sure we all have or at least know someone who said things like "go jump off a bridge" when mad at kids. If someone I hated had actually gone and jumped off a bridge I'd have felt bad, probably a bit guilty, but it wouldn't have been even attempted murder on my part. And if it was actually attempted murder, a) he probably wouldn't have told James about it until after, and b) I'm sure the Black family knows of way better ways to kill someone. Hell, first years learn potentially deadly charms in class, if they're creative enough.

**** I adore Sirius and I /was/ a bit too harsh on him but really, he was cruel and would've probably killed Death Eaters rather than disarm them, etc. he loathed Snape. Maybe he was in a bad mood? There are lots of possibilities but you're right, James and Remus would've never forgiven him if it really was attempted murder.

Sirius actually told Snape to get under the Whomping Willow and see Remus there although Snape is supposedly smarter than that. So the blame lies with both of them. If it truly was attempted murder he'd have been expelled. It's sort of like Fred and George pushing Montague into the Vanishing Cabinet?

I still don't get what his aim was though? /Fun?/ What exactly? What do your think was going on in his head? I like the common perception about a letter from his parents or Regulus or family matters, etc.

It wasn't for fun- it was exasperation and exhaustion and just fuck off and let me breathe for just one minute.

*** For reference, Sirius duelled on par with Bellatrix who was dueling three people at once in hermione ginny and i think luna. Three very talented witches. Bellatrix only killed him because Sirius lost focus.

Sirius was said by McGonagall to be "one of the brightest students to walk through the halls" and by slughorn to be the "star" of the black family. Sirius pulled off being an animagus at 15, passed his owls and supposedly newts without much studying and helped create the single greatest piece of enchanting outside the deathly hallows in the maruaders map. That map alone, would have given all four maruaders mastery in charms and enchanting. It doesnt lie is shown to function outside hogwarts and is in some way tied to the boundries of the castle (since wards arent canon).

That doesnt even take into account that Sirius was the first choice to be secret keeper. And arguably a part of that is the fact that he was better dueling than remus.

**** To add to that, Sirius was a master of both Charms and Transfiguration. These two fields have been mastered by the most powerful of witches and wizards so had he lived, he'd have given Snape a run for his money. Flitwick was a Charms master and dueling champion, Merlin was the Prince of Enchanters (I'm NOT saying Sirius was the second coming of Merlin), McGonagall and Dumbledore were also extremely powerful and intimidating so he's like in the elite.

We also know he and James were the /best at everything/. That would also mean Potions? Maybe they came on top of Snape so that's one of the reasons he loathed them? Dunno. But it's said by Lupin two times and he made a point to make Harry understand that.

Also, that knife he gave Harry. That's arguably one of the most powerful bits of magic in the entire series that gets very overlooked. I wonder if he enchanted that himself. Plus, he didn't even have his own wand at the time. Or a wand for that matter.

Hedwig was the only owl that could find him. As said before, he didn't have his wand so I don't know how exactly he made himself unlocatable. It must have been very hard though. Without a wand. If the simplest of spells required hard concentration that that definitely did.

It says in his Pottermore page that he's also skilled at nonverbal magic among charms and Transfiguration. That's also very advanced from what we know.

As you already said, we also have to remember that when he entered Hogwarts for the first time, Bellatrix had already graduated. So she had around eleven years of a head start. He only had four years of extra training for the Order whereas she had like eighteen. He then dueled on par with her but lost because of his arrogance. If that's not an indication that he'd easily make it into the top ten most powerful witches and wizards I don't know what is.

He was also an animgus at the /age of fifteen/. Possibly the youngest ever (along with James and Peter, of course). The Marauders' Map is also, as you have already mentioned, a great indication that he had mastered charms along with his friends at an early age. And, as you have already said, he was top choice for secret keeper. But Lupin is also highly advanced, too.

He had strong mental health despite inbreeding and spending twelve years in Azkaban being mentally and emotionally tortured. He was still the most sane of the inmates and his wiki page (although I don't think is strong evidence) suggests that he might've had a hand in occlumency. Bellatrix did (maybe it's a family thing?).

Sirius is one of the most underrated characters when it comes to abilities and skills.

***** I don't really care for Sirius as a character but personally I find him to be one of the most overrated ability-wise. I haven't read the books in forever so correct me if I'm wrong and I'll gladly change my opinion. From what I recall James was the skilled one when it came to transfiguration and Sirius was only implied to be skilled at charms. While I'm sure they were competent in all fields of magic more than the average person they really only specialized in one field each.

When characters say they were the 'best at everything' I don't think it's meant to be taken literally. It was always said by characters close to them when they're trying to comfort the orphan kid who never knew them. That's pretty much as biased as it gets so it's probably exaggerated a little bit.

None of the marauders were mentioned to be a prodigy at potions. Slughorn was the one who taught them all and the only people from that era who he praises are Snape and Lily. Lupin's statement needs to be taken with a grain of salt because once again he's comforting Harry when he's literally having an identity crisis after he sees James wasn't perfect.

I don't know enough about the knife to make an argument about it. Sirius could have done it himself or it could be a family heirloom. Nobody knows so it's all speculation.

I also think it's said somewhere that Dumbledore had a hand in hiding Sirius. So it was most likely Dumbledore who made Sirius untraceable except for Hedwig. It would make sense since he knew Sirius and Harry were on good terms and wanted to help.

Nonverbal magic isn't really special. I think Snape says pretty much that it's expected of adults and only advanced for students.

The only thing I can say about the Sirius v Bellatrix duel is that they only use spells and curses. We've seen two examples of top ten witches/wizards duel and in both cases they only used transfiguration. (Dumbledore v Voldemort, Snape v McGonagall)

Apparently the African school teaches their students to be animagi by age fourteen. Marauders map is cool as is enchanting the motorcycle. We know the motorcycle is special because it's just like the Ford Anglia and Dumbledore says the Anglia is a good piece of magic. Secret keeper isn't special since it's literally keeping a secret.

He does get props for surviving Azkaban. Only thing worth mentioning is that being an animagus helped. He said when he was a dog the effects were less severe and he kept that form unless people were around since apparently dementors can't see.

Anyways those are my arguments for why I think you're hyping Sirius a little too much.

#+end_quote

No way! I know it's your opinion, but Sirius is extremely underrated ability-wise. You just have to open up a random fan fiction containing him to see that. For example, any marauder era fan fiction will have lily beat him when, canonically, he would've given her the hardest time and won at the end.

#+begin_quote
  From what I recall James was the skilled one when it came to transfiguration and Sirius was only implied to be skilled at charms.
#+end_quote

I think this is a quite common misconception. It's become so ingrained in the fandom that people take it for canon. Sirius, just like James, was said to be outstanding at transfiguration. They both became animagi at just /fifteen years old/. Thats very impressive, and the fact that only some students from Uagadou are animagi at age fourteen doesn't change the fact that JK Rowling considers the process to be extremely difficult. It's a very impressive form of transfiguration and achieving that at fifteen is pretty strong evidence that Sirius and James were of exceptional talent at transfiguration, both.

#+begin_quote
  The process is extremely difficult and can result in disaster (such as permanent half-human, half-animal mutations) if done incorrectly.

  It takes skill, practise, and patience for wizards and witches to become Animagi. The process of becoming an Animagus is long and arduous, and has the potential to backfire and cause the transformation to go horribly wrong.
#+end_quote

The fact that Sirius and James both did that at their age without assistance (unlike the students of Uagadou) is evidence enough that both of them were very skilled at transfiguration.

If you're not convinced then take this, Sirius - who had escaped Azkaban - uses a wand other than his own to conjure heavy manacles from thin air.

#+begin_quote
  Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air.
#+end_quote

This is taken directly from PoA and Sirius wasn't using his own wand to do such complex magic. Besides, he has been out of practice for nearly thirteen years. That's well over a decade. So, yes, Sirius was great at transfiguration and it wasn't just James. And he also performed human transfiguration on Pettigrew when he forced him into human form. We also know that Rowling considers transfiguration as a very difficult field.

#+begin_quote
  When characters say they were the 'best at everything' I don't think it's meant to be taken literally.
#+end_quote

Well, let's not take Lupin's words for it and see McGonagall's. It's your interpretation after all and it's fair enough. But before that, Sirius and James were both abducted into the Order of the Phoenix - which is the elite - straight after graduation. They must've been exceptional for Dumbledore to recruit them that quickly.

#+begin_quote
  'Black and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course - *exceptionally bright, in fact.* -McGongall, their transfiguration teacher.
#+end_quote

So, Lupin's talk about both Sirius and James seems honest and I don't think her over exaggerated or was just trying to comfort Harry since he says this in PoA:

#+begin_quote
  Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school.
#+end_quote

That's Lupin here without trying to comfort Harry. It seems that Sirius and James were truly the best at everything they did. If I recall correctly, I think that part of the animagus process is to hold a mandrake leaf in your mouth for an entire month. Sirius and James (with Peter) started becoming animati at the age of twelve - second year. So they'd have most likely taken how to repot mandrakes like Harry and co.

I don't think it's that far to suggest that Sirius and James were skilled at herbology - which is closely related to potions - and acquired the mandrake leaves through the lesson. But anything's possible.

#+begin_quote
  The only people whom he praises from that era are Snape and Lily.
#+end_quote

I think since Sirius and James were said to be the top of their classes it's fair to suggest that he wanted to recruit them but they declined and he since turned a cold shoulder on them. We know that whenever a person doesn't meet Slughorn's expectations in any from they are ignored. As is the case with Marcus Belby. Besides, Sirius and James aren't the type to attend the Slug Club since they spent more time making pranks and living life than thinking about the future. They aren't the Slug Club type. Lupin is, but the staff must've been informed of his condition so Slughorn never really paid much attention to him. We know that he did have a mild prejudice against muggleborns so I don't think it's too far off to suggest that the guy also held prejudice against werewolves, vampires, etc.

#+begin_quote
  It could be a family heirloom.
#+end_quote

As you said, it's all speculation but if that was the case, then I don't know how he would have acquired it since he seemed to be living in Africa at the time, IIRC. Don't see how he could've gotten it and where from, anyway. Unless he broke into Gringotts and got it without setting off anything. That's ridiculous :P

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore had a hand in hiding Sirius.
#+end_quote

Partially true. He told Sirius to hide in that cave in GoF. I don't think he did cast it on Sirius since the owls from the owlery found Sirius. This just contradicts my point, doesn't it? Maybe the only explanation is that the ministry was extra stupid and arrogant. He might've cast something so that only owls that Harry has touched might reach him? Dunno. Again, the likeliest explanation is that the ministry was too stupid. Or Dumbledore might've visited him and cast it. It's all up to speculation, as you said.

#+begin_quote
  Nonverbal magic isn't really special.
#+end_quote

Hmmm, the trio never used nonverbal magic after they learned the technique - Harry and Ron, at least, You've got to keep in mind that Sirius had like four years of freedom before being tossed into Azkaban where he couldn't develop his skills. Besides, this is what I found on the wiki:

#+begin_quote
  Performing spells non-verbally is very difficult.
#+end_quote

His Pottermore page wouldn't have said that had he not been extremely exceptional at it. Otherwise, Snape's page would've said that he was also extremely skilled at nonverbal magic. Same applies for Lupin, too.

I think that you don't really get that Sirius and Bellatrix were out of practice for almost /two decades/ both. Sirius for fifteen years and Bellatrix fourteen (?). Bellatrix had like, eleven years more practice than Sirius? That's a lot. And she's considered to be /the/ most powerful witch in the series by a lot of people. If Bellatrix is, then why /not/ Sirius? He managed to almost beat her had he not been so arrogant. She was much more experienced than he was for certain, too. If /Hermione, Ginny/ and Luna (?) couldn't take her on and Sirius duelled her by himself then he's extremely capable. I think it goes without argument that Sirius was more talented than Molly (who killed Bellatrix the same way she killed Sirius, by luck), Hermione and Ginny were exceptional at duelling and Bellatrix was /ruthless/.

Besides, duelling isn't just the use of transfiguration. Dumbledore and Voldemort did use stuff other than transfiguration. As for Snape and McGonagall, I recall summoning knives and using shield charms. These aren't fields of transfiguration ,as far as I recall.

As you said, the motorcycle is also very special and advanced as Dumbledore said.

#+begin_quote
  Secret keeper isn't special since it's literally keeping a secret.
#+end_quote

I'm afraid you're wrong here. The Fidelius Charm is said to be very complex by Flitwick - a charms master - and difficult. He says in PoA:

#+begin_quote
  'An immensely complex spell.'
#+end_quote

Also from the wiki:

#+begin_quote
  The Fidelius Charm (incantation unknown) is an extremely difficult, multifaceted and potent charm that can be used to conceal a secret inside an individual's soul; the witch or wizard who houses the secret is known as the Secret Keeper. A dwelling whose location has been protected by this spell is then invisible, intangible, unplottable and soundproof. This is an extremely old spell, one of the most ancient of all.
#+end_quote

As Sirius's Pottermore page says he was skilled at charms, it's safe to assume that Sirius cast it. His skill at charms is supported by the Marauders' Map, his motorcycle, and summoning six butter beers all at once in Grimmauld Place. He also most likely cast a permanent sticking charm on the pictures in his from at Grimmauld Place since they were never taken down. I think it's well known that Orion and Walburga would've taken them down had they seen them - which they most definitely did.

I think we also tend to forget that he was skilled at Care of Magical Creatures since he and Buckbeak had a very close relationship and he treated him with respect and knew how to handle him. He also managed to gain the trust of Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon.

I hope I helped and didn't come off as rude or anything! =)

  I think this is a quite common misconception. It's become so ingrained in the fandom that people take it for canon. Sirius, just like James, was said to be outstanding at transfiguration. They both became animagi at just fifteen years old. Thats very impressive, and the fact that only some students from Uagadou are animagi at age fourteen doesn't change the fact that JK Rowling considers the process to be extremely difficult. It's a very impressive form of transfiguration and achieving that at fifteen is pretty strong evidence that Sirius and James were of exceptional talent at transfiguration, both.
#+end_quote

Like I said before I don't think it's specifically stated that he is a master of transfiguration. McGonagall calls him exceptionally bright but not that. Your main evidence of him being this is the fact that he is an animagus but that alone doesn't make someone a master. We know actual masters who were never animagi (Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald) and animagi who were never said to be good at transfiguration (Peter and Rita Skeeter). I don't think this should be used as evidence nor a single spell of conjuration before the wand allegiance quirk was thought up of Sirius being a master. Skilled yes but master no.

#+begin_quote
  I don't think it's that far to suggest that Sirius and James were skilled at herbology - which is closely related to potions - and acquired the mandrake leaves through the lesson. But anything's possible.
#+end_quote

I still think most compliments are biased. Lupin was their best friend and didn't hang out with anyone else so he wouldn't actually know who the cleverest students were. I'd even consider Snape more clever and he was in the same year. 1 person practically rewriting a NEWT level textbook and making his own spells > 4 smart people making a map and becoming animagi in my opinion.

As for what I quoted being good at herbology doesn't make someone good at potions. Neville was by far the best at it but the worst at potions.

#+begin_quote
  I think since Sirius and James were said to be the top of their classes it's fair to suggest that he wanted to recruit them but they declined and he since turned a cold shoulder on them. We know that whenever a person doesn't meet Slughorn's expectations in any from they are ignored. As is the case with Marcus Belby. Besides, Sirius and James aren't the type to attend the Slug Club since they spent more time making pranks and living life than thinking about the future. They aren't the Slug Club type. Lupin is, but the staff must've been informed of his condition so Slughorn never really paid much attention to him. We know that he did have a mild prejudice against muggleborns so I don't think it's too far off to suggest that the guy also held prejudice against werewolves, vampires, etc.
#+end_quote

Slughorn can still be nice to people not in his club. He seemed pretty fond of Sirius when he spoke of him to Harry saying he wanted to 'collect the set' of Blacks and said he was talented.

#+begin_quote
  As you said, it's all speculation but if that was the case, then I don't know how he would have acquired it since he seemed to be living in Africa at the time, IIRC. Don't see how he could've gotten it and where from, anyway. Unless he broke into Gringotts and got it without setting off anything. That's ridiculous :P
#+end_quote

You're right. I remembered the knife being used in Order of the Phoenix and assumed that's the book it was given. As you said it was given in Goblet of Fire when Sirius was in Africa. You're right about the owls as well I think.

#+begin_quote
  His Pottermore page wouldn't have said that had he not been extremely exceptional at it. Otherwise, Snape's page would've said that he was also extremely skilled at nonverbal magic. Same applies for Lupin, too.
#+end_quote

I think Snape was skilled at nonverbal magic as well as most other adults. Snape used it when he dueled McGonagall and when he countered every spell of Harry's at the end of Half-Blood Prince. I could be wrong again here but I remember a lot of the Weasleys doing it in later books. I agree with you about the duel with Bellatrix. I disagree about the secret keeper. I know the spell is complex as well as casting it but the actual role of being a secret keeper isn't which is what you said in your first post. I also disagree about the Order of the Phoenix being elite. I think that is fanon since in canon the only requirements for joining are being trustworthy, of age, and against Voldemort. Some members can be elite but joining doesn't mean you are.

That's it pretty much and you didn't come across as rude or anything. I hope I don't seem rude either by arguing.

Overrated by his fans. The only thing we know he did himself is charm his motorcycle. The Marauders Map and becoming an animagus were all group efforts. Sirius didn't go evenly with Bellatrix he *LOST* to Bellatrix. I assume you'll argue he wasn't taking the duel seriously or something so to that I'll say none of the people I'd rank above him would make such an idiotic mistake. The wizarding community also thought Harry was the heir of Slytherin in CoS. They also thought he was going mad in OotP so I'll take what they think with a grain of salt.

My opinion is irrelevant to whether their statements are biased or not. We have Remus Lupin who was one of their best friends who was extremely loyal due to them accepting him being a werewolf. We have Sirius Black who thought of James as a brother. We have Mcgonagall who openly state that James and Sirius were two of her favorite students ever. We have Snape who hated anything to do with either of them. Anyone who speaks of James is either already in favor of him or against him.

The only way to get an unbiased opinion is to have some random person who went to school with them voice what they think but we don't get any in the books.

He did.

What did McGonagall did by herself if we have to go that way ? She became an animagus while older than Sirius with the help of Dumbledore and no, becoming and animagus was an sole feat from James and Sirius, Peter needed their help not the other way around. All DA members learned to cast a patronus together, it doesn't make it a group efforts (except if you consider being taught by Harry make it one), they just happened to do it together.

It didn't prevent him fro stating the truth about them, there is no need for him to overexxagerate the truth. And Sirius has never been anything but honest to Harry admitting they were idiots back them. Remus portraying them as far better than they were would earned a reaction from Sirius. Anyway it doesn't matter that all you got and obviously the teachers statements.

******** Sirius was an animagus at the age of FIFTEEN without an adult's help. That's enough evidence to support the fact that Sirius was a master of it. Master means:

#+begin_quote
  acquire complete knowledge or skill in (a subject, technique, or art).
#+end_quote

Sirius and James both seemed perfectly capable of being masters of transfiguration, both. Besides, there's a possibility that Dumbledore was an animagus but just wasn't relevant in canon. After all, he /was/ considered to be the most powerful wizard of his time.

Slughorn never seemed to like the person as /themselves/ (save for Lily). He wanted to collect their talents. So it's the most likely explanation he was fond of Sirius's talents, not Sirius himself. Besides, he never did see fond of Sirius when he just threw his name in the wind at the beginning of HBP. 'Yeah Harry, my former student is dead, heard of him?' He never got emotional, even Harry seemed frustrated at his behaviour towards him. Sorry of this doesn't make sense.

#+begin_quote
  I also disagree with the Order of the Phoenix being elite.
#+end_quote

Hmmm, well, yes, you have to be trustworthy, of age and against Voldemort but to do real work for the Order you must be elite in /something/. Lily for example was elite at potions so she recruited for her ability there most likely. Tonks: metamorph, Remus: DADA, Sirius and James: transfiguration, McGonagall: transfiguration, Moody: well, he's /Moody/ and so on.

I'm sorry for the late reply, I was just busy with exams and too lazy to get up and reply. Were all have our own opinions at the end of the day and that's OK.

** I've been waiting for this kind of thread for a while!

My opinion: Percy Weasley

Percy is this weird character for a lot of people because he wants to do the right thing, to such an extent that he becomes somewhat of a rule-nazi in doing so. The dude clearly had problems growing up with being so different from his family that he's almost withdrawn from them, like when people are coexisting in the same space but not really being involved in each other's lives. He has ambition and a drive for success, is clearly intelligent, and clearly has a good heart.

I think he's a great character that really should have had more focus in canon. I can identify with him a lot in some ways, and to see him bashed so often just shows how shallow a lot of the community is.

A lot of times, authors take the worst parts of Hermione and crank it up to 11 in how he's completely full of himself, and God forbid seeing him on the street because he would talk to you for hours about his legislation on cauldron bottom thickness.

Is he too proud? Most definitely. But he's not the swot that edgy writers make him out to be.

** I think a distinction needs to be made between genuine mischaracterization of a character based on a wrong interpretation of the canon character traits, and deliberately changing the character despite clear characterization from the canon text.

I think Ron is most mischaracterized since I genuinely think a lot of authors who bash him actually think they are holding true to his more negative traits. The believe Ron is disloyal, stupid, lazy and that his jealousy takes him to evil places. And there is /just/ enough in canon to draw these conclusions.

Draco is often mischaracterized as way more conflicted about his beliefs than in canon and more sympathetic overall. In canon, he truly believes these awful things and has no qualms about awful things happening to non-purebloods, he is just incredibly cowardly and doesn't want to get his hands dirty to further the aims of the Death Eaters.

Plenty of authors make him the bad boy with a heart of gold, which is really just deliberately changing the character instead of unintentional mischaractization.

Ginny is a character where canon is quite clear on who she is and how she behaves, yet too many authors simply change her into a weepy damsel.

** I´d say Ron and Malfoy, there´s a reason why tropes are named after them. Ron is discussed all the time, so I won´t go into detail, because if he get´s the shaft then always in the Ron-the-Deatheater way or by making him into an arrogant git with no loyalty, with a superiority complex always despite the fact that he ´s useless as wizard. Draco´s portrayal is a bit more nuanced, he often get´s the leatherpants treatment, but he´s also mischaracterized by making him worse than he is or at least more prone to act on his worst instincts. He is a poser and coward in canon, when he talks about blood purity, he´s just regurgitating, what he learned from his parents without really thinking about it, because when all his hopes came true and Voldemort was resurrected, his joy lasted only until his father was sent to Azkaban, when he was expected to act like a Deatheater, he was terrified and desperate and everything he did through book 6 to 7 was out of desperation, not because he enjoyed it, or because he was a true believer, this doesn´t make him a good person mind you, he is still a despicable little ferret and probably deserving of a sentence in Azkaban, but he isn´t a fanatic like most of the DE, that´s why he was eventually capable of ridding himself of the ideology. In short if he doesn´t get the leatherpants treatment he is portrayed as mindless fanatic.

If he were a complete fanatic he would be far more eager to actually go out there to kill and torture people, but he´s too much of an coward to do this. Lucius on the other hand has always been a true believer and for the most part he was quite competent, he didn´t disavow Voldemort because he stopped believing in blood purity, but because his own safety and that of his family was in jeopardy and that was the only thing he values more than his bigotry.

** *Tonks*

Shes's always written as a super rebellious, very sexual character, but I think what we know of her in canon goes against that. For one, she became an auror and held her own in the order with much older people, which suggests she was more mature than she's typically made out to be. She also fell for Lupin and wanted to start a family with him. To me she seems far more, for lack of a better word, traditional than she's made out to be in canon.

I think people write her a certain way because it makes her more interesting (or the author thinks it does) but she's /always/ written that way and as someone who likes Tonks, I'd like to see a story explore her in a way that's closer to canon and less one-dimensional.
