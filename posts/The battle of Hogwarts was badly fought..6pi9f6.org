** The house elves, centaurs, Slughorn's reinforcements, Hogsmeade resident and other back-up all arrived in the second half of the battle when they had already taken serious losses... why did none of them manage to arrive or decide to take part in the hour Voldemort gave the defenders to prepare?

That always seemed to me like coming in too late to get a share of the spoils.

That whole sequence though had way too many tropes and felt like a paint-by-numbers/formulaic battle for me to be enjoyable.

****** *Battle of the Hornburg*

The Battle of the Hornburg is a fictional battle in J. R. R. Tolkien's epic The Lord of the Rings. The battle pitted the forces of the Wizard Saruman against the Rohirrim under King Th√©oden, who had taken refuge in the mountain fortress of the Hornburg at Helm's Deep. The engagement is also informally known as Battle of Helm's Deep or simply Helm's Deep after that location. An account of the battle is recorded in the climactic chapter "Helm's Deep" of the volume The Two Towers.

That's not even orc level military organization. Basically they just used some small unit tactics but had no tactical coordination on the large scale and their strategic goals were short sighted and narrow in the extreme.

** u/Madeline_Basset:
#+begin_quote
  Hogwarts is a Castle, a defensive structure,
#+end_quote

You can't quite assume it's a defensive structure from its name.

It may have been built as a castle. But if it's anything like 1000-year-old Muggle buildngs, it's been constantly changed, added-to, modified. New doorways cut into walls (because a castle's single way in or out is very inconvenient), new windows put into the curtain wall to let in more light, they'd also let in rocks and arrows, but in an era of peace, who cares. Extra bits built when needed, demolished a few hundred years later when no-longer needed. In the end it becomes a very complicated brick and stone patchwork.

The point is that any defensive qualities of the structure are going to be long lost when they're just not needed because ultimately, its a school, not a fortress. The UK is stuffed with old stately homes called Castle This or Castle That, and the only castle-like things about them are the name. The remains of the original fortress are burred somewhere in the centre of the structure, like the original bit of grit in the centre of a pearl.

Fortresses are still used and besides voldi no one had the power of a siege engine sufficent to destroy a magical castle, that was probably built to withstand magical sieges.

Edit concerning the video: wouldn't people just build underground fortresses to withstand dragons, like the swiss fortresses in the alps.
