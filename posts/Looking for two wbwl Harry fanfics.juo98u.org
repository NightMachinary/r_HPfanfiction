:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So the first fic was one where Harry was raised by the Dursley's (who told him his parents are dead) and became very apathetic and emotionless due to being brought up by them. He goes to Hogwarts and discovers that he has an older brother and living parents (who had to leave him with the Dursley's for medical reasons? I think). After arriving at Hogwarts his parents try to arrange meetings with him but he doesn't want to meet them. They eventually come to see him at the Dursley's the following summer, realise that the Dursley's are abusive and get custody of Harry and Dudley. I think Hogwarts also closes at some point, and there's a scene where Fawkes cries.

The second fic is one where Lily and James are aware of Harry being a horcrux, but they think that that means that Harry is just a fragment of Voldemort's soul (instead of being a host for it). So they treat him as something dangerous, lily telling Harry that he needs to be controlled and guarded (and his sister (I think) does part of that guarding) whilst James insists that Harry is not his son because his son was killed by Voldemort and replaced by a piece of Voldemort (in James' opinion at least).

I've been trying to find these two fics but I haven't been able to, so if anyone knows the fics I'm describing that would be amazing!
