*** Bad news. The guy's been reported /hundreds/ of times, and has been reported to the thread over a dozen times. Somehow, nothing has happened despite all of that, and according to a spokesperson from the Forum, there's nothing that they can do.

** You get lots of this sort of shit. Just report him, everyone else who sees his stuff and has any knowledge of the fandom will do the same. We can't launch an [[/r/hpfanfiction]] crusade for every plaguerer or we'd be doing nothing else.

*** I've been on this subreddit for practically a year now, and I've never seen a post like this until now. It's not a problem until we see a lot of these. Until then I see nothing wrong with letting these posts be. Only if we start to get spammed by them is it really a problem.

*** I've never really seen one of these, and nor do I intend to spam the sub with this. Over 500 people, including Jbern /and/ the guys over at TAPIR have all reported the guy, all to no avail.

The fact that this guy has copied /14/ fanfics word for word without /any/ repurcussions, is scary to me. That is why I came to this subreddit with the problem.
