The HP fanfic fandom is vast and diverse, from near-duplicates of canon, to straight-up original stories. Particularly for the latter kind, changes to a character is often met with... mixed reception, so I must ask:

What defines a character, such as Harry Potter himself?

Let's say, you are writing an AU fanfic centering around Harry. When do they stop being Harry?

- Example 1: Harry Potter, same physical appearance, same/similar personality, DIFFERENT parents, and same upbringing
- Example 2: Harry Potter, different physical appearance (gender, race etc.), same/similar personality, same parents, same upbringing
- Example 3: John Walker (or some other name), everything else is the same
- Example 4: Different personality, or different sexuality; everything else is the same
- Example 5: Different upbringing; everything else is (more or less) the same

Now, of course changing one aspect can have a knock-on effect on others. But ultimately, it is the author's choice as to what remains the same/similar. Based on the aforementioned examples, when does a character cease to be its original self, even with only one change (significant it may be)? When does it become a deal-breaker, if at all?


** Outside of reckless courage, most of his personality didn't transfer to fan fiction. We generally have to take what we can get, so, for me, he stops being Harry when he's no longer black-haired, green-eyed, and James and Lily's son. If it's not fem Harry, I also typically avoid stories where he's not 'Harry Potter.'

** People tend to forget he was rather sarcastic, (as were many characters) many of the major characters had at least one good sarcastic moment.

Sarcasm is hard to write.

People also tend to ignore the interactions, or make the characters act way too old, if they're kids or teenagers.

He goes through a lot in such a short time. He's moody, he's angry/upset in his teenage years, he's quiet, not talkative, he does think rude (ish) things about characters like Hermione occasionally, but doesn't say them. I had actually forgotten about that.

It's hard to write him well. Just like the other characters, they tend to fall flat.

More importantly than this, is that sarcasm is next to impossible to sound authentic. If you attempt a good sarcastic response, you have to figure out how to make it work in the story. For example, him going to Slytherin.

He's not gonna be friends with Malfoy, but he may use him in a sarcastic response which would work. But that's about it. Not even saying he'll turn dark works for sarcasm cause it's going to get back to a teacher

**** I would go further, and just combine those two points, sarcasm is hard to write because it's hard to make sarcasm clear and authentic. Tonality is so important when it comes to sarcasm, and in general how it's spoken is usually the cornerstone of sarcasm. With writing, you completely lose that

** Because this fandom is so vast and diverse, I do not think it is possible to answer your question because each person will have his own opinion about what define a character like Harry. Something I'll accept may be a dealbreaker for others, just like some of the trope I hate (let's say Nobility! AU) are loved by a part of the fandom. And it is perfectly normal.

Personally, I think it doesn't matter what truly "make" Harry in Canon, because it is precisely the goal of Fanfic to change things from Canon. It is obvious that "Harry" would never follow Voldemort or hate Muggle, but it's a change we can accept in Fanfictions, as long as it makes an interesting story.

My own deal breaker concern more the "unrelated changes" than anything. I can accept Harry being a girl, or going to Slytherin, or calling himself "Leo Black" after being raised by Sirius. But as a reader, I'll often assume that, unless it's a full AU, the change announced at the start of the fic is the only difference from canon, and that all the following differences are only a consequence of this one change.\\
If we take the characters of Ron and Hermione as an example. How the hell does Harry going into Slytherin lead Ron into being a lazy bastard barely better than Crabbe and Goyle? Or Hermione being so much more talented than Canon and also now being incredibly attractive? I could accept these changes if they were at least justified (like Harry's absence means that Ron lost his sister in the Chamber, which lead him to be ressentfull toward Muggleborns or something like that), but it's usually just dropped like that in a fic as if it was Canon.

Concerning this point, I am clearly not the best person to say this since I have never published anything, but I think author should just ignore it.

The fandom is very large, and everyone has his own preference but some people are clearly going too far when commenting on a story (especially on ff. net since it's so easy to comment anonymously).

Looking at some of the most commented story. No matter the pairing of the story, you will have someone to say that Hermione would be better, and someone else asking for Harem. You can't mention Daphne Greengrass before someone asking to pair her with Harry. No matter how Harry's act, you'll have some people asking why he keep acting "/like a little bitch/".

The reception will always be mixed no matter what someone write, so I think it's better to ignore this kind of comment of just focus on the constructive one, that could give usefull advice or observation about the suite of the story.

** If you ask me it's the personality that changes the character into someone not its original person, but it is only a deal-breaker when the change is an unexplainable one, if it is instant but has a good reason, it is fine, and if the personality change is over time, even better cause we get to see how it develops, but no matter how slow/fast the personality changes if it has no reason/explanation then it just reduces the fic's quality by a lot.

** Personally, apart from Example 3, I have enjoyed all other types of AUs. The name change sets me back, for a few reasons. Last name changing, ehh still kinda negotiable. First name wise, though, you can do anything to the character, but if he's not Harry anymore, my brain can't compute it as a Harry Potter fanfic. I love fics with Slytherin Harry, super Harry, Fem Harry, Non hetero Harry, different parent Harry(with a few rules), adopted Harry, mix it all up, I'll read it through! But if I find something where his whole name changes, I can't anymore. While I love some character changes in some of the other characters( non vilified Slytherins, for example) I hate it when the trope becomes evil Gryffs- good Snakes just to validate the plot. Add that kinda trope to a nonHarry Harry, that's my line drawn. (No offense to those who like this plot, please don't kill me)

** For me, if Harry does not have black hair and 'his mother's eyes', I drop the fic. To me, these things are an integral part of who he is. Similarly, he must be the son of Lily and James.

I've never gotten into the whole WBWL thing. Harry not being The Boy Who Lived, is a deal breaker for me.

Also, Harry having a completely different personality, without any reason given, is a huge no.

A dark/evil Harry, or a Harry who's basically a younger version of Snape is something I simply can't do.

I agree that writing Harry completely in-character is very hard, and beyond most fan fic authors. I certainly don't have the skills or talent, so I didn't try. While my Harry retains many of his original characteristics, I sought inspiration into comics. Peter Parker and Clark Kent, in particular. Though, he's evolved in a way that has added Bruce Wayne and Oliver Queen into the mix. At least that's what I was going for.

** I think the question is a bit overly specific. You seem to be focusing on which /specific/ aspects of Harry are core to his identity as Harry, when instead I think the answer to that lies more in how /many/ aspects can be changed before he becomes an OC in the HP universe.

Harry with different parents is still Harry.\\
Harry with a different appearance is still Harry.\\
Harry with a different name is still Harry.\\
Harry with a different personality/sexuality is still Harry.\\
Harry with a different upbringing is still Harry.

But if you show me a fic starring Gloria Winthrop, daughter of Julia and Harold Winthrop, the lesbian witch who's top of her class in potions but struggles to scrape a passing grade in defense at the Salem Witches' Institute in America, there is no force in the universe that would make me believe she's really a genderbent, renamed, re-parented Harry with a different sort of childhood. You wrote an OC.

That said, and at the risk of contradicting myself, I'd say Harry's name and (perceived) parentage are the most important to keeping him recognizably Harry because /that's how we identify him./ Everything else can be handwaved away with "what if...?" scenarios, but the moment you slap a name on him that isn't obviously tied back to his old identity of Harry Potter (e.g. Hadrian Peverell) and/or do away with Lily and James entirely, you start to lose that connection.

** Technically, in any AU Harry Potter isn't Harry anymore. Only in canon compliant or canon rehash you can get Canon Harry. And that's pretty coherent storywise.

AU implies that a different set of circumstances will lead to a different set of outcomes. When it comes to a character that means their choices and perception of the world would be altered. You can't have the same outcomes or nearly the same journey with a whole different set of circumstances. Canon rehash in AU is bad writing, IMO.

That's one of my Pet-Peeves with some AU. I would take as an example the fanfic "On the way to greatness". It's hailed as the best Slytherin!Harry on this sub while in fact, this fanfic is basically Canon!Harry with a green tie, and it's mostly a Canon rehash. "Everything change, nothing change". People love it.

So, for me, Harry should technically stop being Harry in any AU that actually tries to be an AU storywise. That doesn't mean you can't make him courageous or a goody-good guy, it's simply that you have to do it in a non Cano!Harry way, if that makes sense.

The deal-breaker would be Slytherin!Harry being the same as Canon!Harry.

** It really depends on how well done the story is. However:

I would say that the first three examples I would likely still consider Harry. The name change almost makes me hesitate, but since he has the same upbringing and personality, I would say generally I could regard him as the same character. (Though I would wonder why change the name and literally nothing else about him.)

I don't like the way you've expressed example four, since I would consider major personality differences (e.g. qualities of a typical Indy!Harry) not the same character (or badly moving towards OOC), but different sexuality as not necessitating a new character. I've read lots of slash Harrys who felt pretty close to the canon Harry, and lots of het Harrys who were supposed to be canon but whose personalities, because of the writing, really missed the mark.

I would consider example five an AU Harry and not really the same character. I'm thinking of the AU Harry in, say, /C'est la vie/ or /Too Far From Home./

** I think the core of what makes Harry "Harry" is the strong tendency to improvisation over planning.

This can be a character strength in any setting that requires thinking on his feet.

This shows courage when he acts on what's right rather than what's prudent for him.

This can be a character flaw when it he acts recklessly or his plans blow up in his face.

This can can funny when he says something that pops in his head without thinking it through ("there's no need to call me 'Sir', Professor").

But it all comes back to the same core personality trait. That's what baffles me about the Sorting Hat saying he could have been in Slytherin. Not only does he detest most of them on a moral level, not only in his only major ambition to lead a normal life and not be famous, but he singularly bad at planning and cunning.

*** I agree with you so much. Harry puts it all together at the last possible moment (facing Quirrell, facing Tom, facing Pettigrew, facing Crouch Jr, after picking up the prophecy, chasing Snape).

And I think the sorting hat was just teasing him. It was probably surprised that he had such a strong bias so quickly. It offered the usual Slytherin selling point “you could be great”, and it identified what Harry was focused on (Harry didn't want to be friends with people like Malfoy). The books play up Slytherin as the evil house, I think Rowling wanted to suggest Harry was choosing to not be evil.

Good examples. I think this personality trait may be more a result of convince, i.e. it's more exciting to have a protagonist pull out a solution to an impossible situation than to carefully plan. In fact, when people change that aspect of Harry, they end up with pretty boring action scenes without tension. All the same, it's not like there's a ton to his character besides that, so that's the part the sticks out to me.

I'd buy that if the only other time the Hat offers a choice it's to Hermione, who fits roughly equally well into two houses; the Hat asking makes sense there, but not with Harry. Though you're right that the point of that sequence was to show Harry making a choice to be good.

** I honestly have never been so put off by fanfiction as a big chunk of the fandom is. I understand that people have preferences and I also respect that. Who cares what other people prefer to read? It's their choice. With that said, the only time harry stops feeling like Harry to me is when it's fem!Harry. Everything else I can take and I love actually. Different house Harry, Evil Harry, smarter than Hermione, different sexuality, different name, different parents or upbringing, no dursleys, different friends, not the boy who lived... you name it and I will probably like it, because I don't care. Of course that includes fics that are also close to canon and harry is basically the same character or super close to being the same character with minor changes.

The only thing I care about in a story/fic is that it's good. Interesting plot, good writing, character depth, multiple arcs.

So far the only thing my brain does not accept is fem!Harry. I just cannot comprehend it.

** Characters are depictions of people, and a person is a combination of nature and nurture. Harry Potter, like every other character, is the sum of what the plot makes him. He has certain personality traits and tendencies, certain actions and behaviors he leans on. These are the things that define him. If you change enough of the story, you could turn him into almost anything, but that's the difference between good stories and bad ones. Good ones show their work.

Due to his fictional nature, Harry is an idea. As long as enough traits of his are respected, and his curve of growth and change is sensible, he remains Harry. The same is true of all fictional characters.

If you're asking at what point he stops being Harry Potter and becomes something that is not Harry, if you're asking where precisely that line is drawn, then you're asking about the Ship of Theseus Problem. Better men than anyone posting on this website have failed to adequately answer that thought experiment. The simplest answer is that you know it when you see it.

** Everyone would have their own views for this, so I doubt you'd get any kind of consensus. For example, my views are very broad on this topic, and forgiving of any kind of 'breach of canon'. The only case from your examples where I would feel iffy would be example 3, and that's only if it's not even close to his original name AND not explained. I'm fine with Harold Potter. I'm fine with Hadrian Black. I'm fine with Harrison Evans. Hell, I can even stomach Harridan despite the absolute utter ridiculousness of the name, because even without explaining it by the author I can see what it was - an attempt to find a fancy name that Harry could be a nickname of, while not wanting to use the same ones everyone uses. But I wouldn't be fine with, say, Oleander Potter, or Charlus Potter, unless the story does try to explain why Harry's name is different here - even though these two examples are on the nose obvious. John Walker would need a really damn good explanation to convince me.

** This is actually a very interesting question regarding fanfiction. What can you change without fundamentally changing the character. This is part of why I don't read race/gender/sexuality bending stories. I believe that the baseline for a character has to be the same and if it's not there needs to be a reason why. For example lets take Grant Ward from Agents of Shield. Things that make him who he is at his core are his abusive family and being a Hydra traitor. His abusive family is something that you can't change otherwise it makes him an entirely different character. However you can change him being Hydra if you change who his mentor is. He was picked up by John Garrett in the show but if you change that to Nick Fury, Victoria Hand, or somebody else, he can be not Hydra. It's all about the circumstances in which that character is developed. But there are some things that if you change, the character becomes entirely different in ways that take them too far from who their character is

** For me, examples 1-3 are not Harry Potter & i generally don't read them. James & Lily are too key to the story, losing them removes too much. Changing Harry's race/gender makes him not Harry Potter. Changing his name is also a big no no, although I can potentially accept him being adopted by someone, but not him becoming Hadrian or any other pretentious BS.

Example 4 varies a bit for me. Changing Harry's sexuality is a no-- I hate slash. Changing a bit of his personality can be okay but I draw the line at him not wanting a family-- that was such a key motivation for canon Harry, when I've read a story where the author doesn't like kids & therefore Harry doesn't want kids, I roll my eyes and drop the fic.

Example 5-- a different upbringing should make other changes such as affecting his personality in one way or another, but I prefer for him to still have enough traits for him to be identifiable as Harry.
