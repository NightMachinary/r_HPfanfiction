I'm looking for a story where after the events of the first year at hogwarts Harry gets taken on as Nicholas' apprentice and he is raised by Nicholas and Perenelle from that point forward, including being taught to make his own philosopher's stone. It was on ff.net for a while,then got removed and was on another one of the hp fanfic websites.


** I remember something like this, but not the name :(

Was it one where he has to learn to cast a lightning spell with such delicacy that he can use it to dry a wet feather?

*** I'm not sure, I'm pretty sure they sent him to an Irish school but it's not Harry Potter and the Irish Choice. I'm also pretty sure there was something to do with the wolfsbane potion. Thanks anyway.
