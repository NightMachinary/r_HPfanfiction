Following Canon Couple Harry/Ginny, but at some point Harry gets turned into a Female. While he is shocked and Ginny suprised, she finds herself attracted to this feminim side of her Husband (possible Bi/Lesbian attraction) and have her way with him.

As an addiction: if its Post Epilogue, i think it woud be hot, if their or other Kids find "Harriete" hot. But no requirement.

It is somewhat heavy on the smut IIRC but still the best from a similar thread a while back. Set during a late Hogwarts AU.

  When Harry wakes up one morning to find himself suddenly transformed into a beautiful girl, all hell breaks loose in Hogwarts. At least Ginny doesn't seem to mind. Harry x Ginny, fem!Harry x Ginny, femslash, gender bender, and much lesbian fun! Hermione x Luna (Moon Sage) established!

**** I think my biggest issue with Ginny is that if she ends up with Harry you either have a background Ron/Hermione or Ron/Luna relationship, more often than not done just as poorly as in canon. The story will ignore Ron's (and Mrs Wesley's) faults and highlight how much they love each other despite only showing evidence of the contrary and that makes the narrator sound unbelievable. And once the narrator becomes a unreliable/contradictory voice, the story is doomed for failure.
