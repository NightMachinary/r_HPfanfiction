It can be Defence, or it can be as another type of teacher, I'm not picky.

No OP Harry. No Harem Harry. No Lord Potter-Black-Malfoy, et cetra.

No Character Bashing: Characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but an author going out of their way to bash characters is usually a no go for me.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.

Can be on ANY Site.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

NO: Harry/Hermione, Draco/Hermione.


** 0800 Rent a Hero has Canon(ish)!Harry pulled into an AU by an AU!Order. Instead of helping them fight Voldemort, he becomes a Divination instructor. It's fun and funny but incomplete.

  At twenty-five, Harry Potter is at a crossroads in his life. He's achieved his dream of being an Auror, but it's not all it's cracked up to be, and with one child and another on the way, he's missing out on precious time with his family. But being an Auror is all he knows how to do - right? So he's in for a surprise when Professor McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts, offers him a job as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher ...

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** There's a bunch of time travel fics that have him teach, though I'm drawing a bit of a blank atm. The best one being probably Gelosaþ in Écnesse. It's slash that's more sweet than explicit and the pairing isn't nearly as eeek as you might think at first glance. linkao3(2352896)

Putting the M in Mystery is on my to-read list. Also a time travel - it is finished, it just isn't tagged as such since its older than dirt. linkffn(2386991)

The only other one I can think of off the top of my head is a pretty ridiculous harem fic (Narcissa's Chance? Choice? Something like that.) And then... here's an OP Harry for completion's sake: if you ever want some guilty pleasure fix-it stories, this series is for you. Lone Traveler: Professor of Defense. linkffn(12184104)
