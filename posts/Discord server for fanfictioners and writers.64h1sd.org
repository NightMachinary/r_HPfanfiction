I created a discord for writers to come and mingle and share their work. We have writers of all levels, from fresh newbies to experienced novelists. Don't be shy; there's almost 500 members and we're all one big family! [[https://discord.gg/vNKRWDg]]


** There is already an existing IRC and Discord server. There are bots in each that will send the messages from one server to the other so everyone can chat. The link to the discord server is [[https://discord.gg/CfmJvqt]] and the link to the IRC chatroom (##HPFanFiction on Freenode) is on the sideboard or here: [[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23hpfanfiction&uio=d4]]
