If there are no male veela, and fleur is only quarter veela, does that mean that all veela are hermaphrodites? (They have both sets of genitalia) if not, then where does fullblooded veela come from?

In a lot of fics muggleborns flinches when Voldemorts name is said, does fanfic authors forget they are not raised to be afraid of the name? (Secondary, why are wiz-raised children afraid of the name? I can understand the adults, but the children never experienced the horrors of the war, so would have no reason to fear the name. -and if noone speaks his name, how does everyone know voldemort is his real name if he is only ever mentioned as you-know-who?)

** I read a story once (Lie I've Lived maybe?) Where pureblood Veela + muggle = pureblood veela, while pureblooded + wizard = halfblooded, so that could be a source.

** I can't say what is fanon (one “n” before “o”, by the way) nor attempt to answer for it, but I can tell you this much:

- Veela are magical creatures, supposedly all-female based on the fact that the mythical creatures they are based on are all-female but with no solid proof of that, with unknown means of procreating. It may very well be that they simply /happen/, since they are supposed to be based on the Slavic vila and those were spirits borne of ... souls, I guess, of dead young girls. I can't imagine Madam Rowling going for the full version of the thing with all the gruesome implications, so it is a likely assumption that in HP universe they just happen.
- We only know that Fleur's grandmother is a Veela, as it is mentioned during the wand weighting thing, but we do not know how, if at all, it affects Fleur herself.

And then there is the thing with Tom:

- Madam Rowling herself has never shown anyone but a few chosen individuals use Tom's actual alias.
- There is, and in the past at some point likely was as well, a taboo placed on his alias, so I do not see why parents teaching their children to speak only the censored version and placing enough emphasis on it to cause them not to use the alias when they don't even know it would be wrong. Sure, some kids may get rebellious, but we don't really see Harry interact with a lot of people so we have a limited sample base there, so to say.
- As for everyone knowing Tom's alias regardless, that's probably the individual authors' mistakes. It may be written somewhere, though, we just do not know.

*** On the subject of Veela, we are never told they're an all-female species. It so happens we only ever see female Veela, but it's not like we see a lot of Veela either way. The first /Fantastic Beasts/ film aside, we never see female Goblins in canon either, nor are they mentioned, but that doesn't meant they're an all-male species, either.

Yes, but they are seemingly based on a mythical creature that is all-female. I guess I should have worded it differently, which I will do shortly, but info about their alleged origin is written about in the same point.

***** That's true, but how many goblin girls do you know in mythology, either? Unless Rowling goes on record to say otherwise, I'm going to keep assuming Veela are a normal, two-gendered species.

  Following the fall of Voldemort, it is up to the Gringotts goblins to carry out the terms of the Potters' will. What will happen when young Harry Potter - halfblood, Parselmouth, curse-scarred, outsider - is raised in the stalagmite city of Underfoot?

** I like the idea that Veela do not need to have intercourse to have a child. A Veela is born to another Veela by some means - maybe just chance - that doesn't involve sex. I like the contrast of it, to be honest. This epitome of beauty and sex-appeal breeds true by means completely disconnected from these physical traits. Half-Veela are in truth no Veela at all. They're "just" abnormally, hypnotizingly beautiful people - wizards and (more often) witches.

The second is simply how taboos are created in society. A muggleborn sees her peers react badly to the name. They start reacting badly to fit in. Through repetition it eventually becomes habit and is then propagated through more and more social circles. It probably had an actual use at some point (Voldemort creating the Taboo we know from the books, for example) but it doesn't matter at that point of propagation because the paradigm has been formed and is enforced by the group.

*** Maybe the Veela are similar to the Asari from Mass Effect. They only have one gender and reproduce through mind melts (pretty much what the name says). That does not mean that Asari cannot have sex, they just do not conceive kids through sperm.

** I just assumed that it was caused by how they were conceived: Fleur's mother being conceived by a loving couple whereas full-blooded Veela are conceived by veelas ensnaring hapless wizards...

Sounds kinda sappy, come to think of it.
