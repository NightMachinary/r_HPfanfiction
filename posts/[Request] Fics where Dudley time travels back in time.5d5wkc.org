#+begin_quote
  Dudley Dursley, 37, has only just put his daughter on the Hogwarts Express and said goodbye when Platform 9 3/4 is attacked. In the ensuing explosion, he blacks out - and wakes up as an eleven year old back in Privet Drive. Confused and wary, he finds himself blundering through his life all over again, and unfortunately, being eleven isn't the only surprise in store.
