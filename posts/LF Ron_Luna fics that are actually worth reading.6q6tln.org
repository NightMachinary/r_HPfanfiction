Only fics about this pairing seem to have them as a side pairing to really forced and OOC Harry/Hermione romance.

  Non-epilogue compliant. Four years after the war ends, Ron quits the aurors and moves back in with his parents. Luna has returned from her world travels, older, wiser and now her owl has low self-esteem. Oh, and Harry finds the whole thing hilarious. A Ron/Luna fic because it's weirdly perfect.

** The only one I've read. Quite good. More friendship than romance, though. The other fics of this author are good too, but they're not Ron/Luna. Keep in mind it's the last of a series of one-shots.
