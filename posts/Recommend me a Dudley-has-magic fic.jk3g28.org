I don't really have a preference for pairings beyond no H/Hr or H/G (I never understood how/why canon ended up that way, and I've yet to read a fanfic that convinced me that it works), slash/het I don't mind/care. Genfic is great too.

Anyway, I want to read a fic where Dudley goes to Hogwarts with Harry and they both have to come to terms with the fact that Harry is a worldwide celebrity.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

** Well there's this one linkffn(2818538) which puts quite an interesting twist to it.

However it's a pre-DH fic and it puts quite a lot of emphasis on the Harry/Ginny relationship as started in HBP.

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

  Suppose the Marauders torture hadn't driven Snape to Voldemort and he had been the better man. What would the future have looked like? Warning: may now contain DH spoilers.
