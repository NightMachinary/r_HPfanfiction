Hey guys

I am searching for a fic where Harry travels into a different universe and has to deal with things being different.

Thank you

Edit: I would still like him to go to Hogwarts. Parents being alive is optional.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** AU dimension travelling is one of my favourite types of stories, I'll see what I have to suggest though I read some of these a while ago. Not all will be set at Hogwarts or feature just Harry neccesarily.

  Harry won the war. It's a couple months afterwards, and unexpectedly, he's quite literally picked up off the face of the world and shoved into another. One where Harry Potter died a long time ago and the Potter family's still fighting a war with a Dark Lord whose ruling over the world one muggle murder at a time. They say he's their only hope. Harry just really doesn't want in.

** Dimensional travels are plenty, time travels are plenty, but dimensional time travel is extremely rare. The only one I can think of is "Para Bellum", linkffn(9754483), the incomplete sequel to "Delenda Est". In that story, canon Harry and Ginny were attacked on Hogwarts Express by 2 Voldemorts, fortunately, they were saved by the daughters of Harry and Bellatrix from the other dimension.

** While it's Ron-centric as opposed to Harry (which is pretty much the opposite of what you asked for), there's an excellent one that I've been reading lately that fulfills the rest of what you want--it's dimensional hopping AND time traveling. I typically don't really enjoy anything outside of Harry-centric fics, but I've really been enjoying this one.

** Well you can see a bunch of different variations in [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter/dimensional-shift-hp-private-sneak-peek/][Dimensional Shift]].

He spends only an hour in each dimension before skipping to the next. He's searching for one with specific criteria - a spell automatically moves him on. It's listed as slash, but is currently unfinished and has not reached a point where anything has happened yet, if you don't want to read that.

But, for variations, hard to beat: worlds where Harry died at one, where he died at 12, where Voldemort has taken the Ministry, where he's part of the resistance, where the Dark Lord is Grindlewald, where Harry has younger siblings, where only his mother is dead... lots of variations.
