Ok, so, I was reading the actual books again and realized how much I like Harry in Gryffindor, despite the fact I love Slytherin Harry. It just drives me nuts though because he's kind of useless in the books unless it comes to a Patronus.

Long story short, does anyone know of any either series or LONG STORIES that start with Harry either in first year or Pre Hogwarts that have him in Gryffindor but actually being really good at magic? Like, competing or surpassing Hermione kind of good at magic. Also, bonus points if Harry's best friend is Neville. I'm fine with Ron as his best friend, or as enemy or whatever. Also, a Harry who becomes politically aware with the help of Neville or on his own would be very welcome, but not required.

I try to avoid Harry/Hermione pairings like the plague, but if one is really good with that pairing I will read it. Aside from that, any pairing or no pairing is fine as long as it's not slash. If that's your thing, more power to you, but it's just not for me.

Also, preferably not a WBWL story. Again, if that's it, I'll take it, but preferably not.

So, I doubt there's anything like this as I've made this quite specific, but hit me with your best shot!

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...
