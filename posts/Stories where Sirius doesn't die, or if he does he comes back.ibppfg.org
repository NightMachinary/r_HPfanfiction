So many stories have Sirius still die through the Veil or other reasons, and I'm just like why? There's so much potential there, for Sirius to be proven innocent and freed.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash, threesomes and the like.

Can be on any site, anyone can be the main character, can be any length, can be old or new, can be completed or not.

Would rather not have character bashing (if at all possible). Especially NOT Weasley Bashing.

  What if Sirius Black didn't die? It's been done many times. Here's my take on it.

  For Sirius, going through the Veil opens up doors. Pretty much literally.

** In [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130353][Path Diverged]] and its [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130365][sequel]], Sirius lives, but only because Harry never makes it to the Department of Mysteries, because Hermione doesn't get the idea to lead Umbridge to the forbidden forest.

Umbridge tortures Harry for what I think is an hour before Snape comes back to intervene, and then Harry gets fully possessed by Voldemort and even more $#!+ hits the fan.

What I think makes this fic great as a reader is the dilemma of whether or not the suffering Harry went through was worth the alternative of what happened in canon.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
