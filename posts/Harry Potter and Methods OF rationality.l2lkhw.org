I was suggested to read this Fan-fic .I started to read it . I came upon the part where Draco is talking with Harry on platform . Draco talks something there very bad about Luna and all other nonsensical things. I never continued the book beyond that part . I think who have read may know what it is . I didnt like this fan-fic .

I didnt understood why many say it as a good fan-fic . What is your opinion on the Fan-fic ?


** Harry in that fic is the most unlikeable character I ever had the misfortune of reading about. And that list includes Ramsey Bolton.

*** Exactly this. I heard the summary of the fic, and I was like "heck yea!" Thought it sounded super fun and a completely logical AU of the HP universe. Then I actually started reading it. UGH!

I can't finish any story if I am rooting against the protagonist. The only way I could have finished MoR is if someone told me that it ends with Harry being drawn and quartered by a mob of pissed off wizards tired of his smug condescension haha :D

*** Ramsey Bolton is fun to hate because he's a psychotic antagonist, and we live in hope that one day he'll get his comeuppance. MOR!Harry is hateable in an un-fun way because he's absolutely unbearable to listen to, whilst also being the protagonist with the story validating all of his views and actions.

** The Diagon Alley bit and his first day with the Time Turner were fun, but it went downhill /fast/ from there.

** I read the whole thing. It has some scenes I liked. One particular quote beginning with "When this flawed world seems unusually hateful..." Resonated with me quite a bit. And I'm in support of transhumanism in general.

On the other hand, no female character has agency, and yudkowski either can't or won't understand what people mean when they explain this is a problem with his story. Hermione gets fridged late in the game so harry can be sad about her death, and he missed the point when people complained about that, too.

Really, no character other than harry and quirellmort have any real agency. Quirellmort at one point holds an entire defense class just to teach harry how to lose. The other students do not complain about this or act like it's odd in any way. It's almost like the entire world revolves around harry in this fic, almost like he's a Mary Sue or something. Oh wait, that's exactly what he is, and the author even more or less admitted it, so that's something I guess... Except he even misses the point of why a Mary Sue is problematic.

Oh, and apparently a lot of his science is wrong anyway, so you don't even learn correct rationality from his author tract.

Worth skimming through if you like transhumanist stuff. Worth reading if you like nerdy rants. Otherwise, don't bother with it.

** I don't understand how that fic has so many reviews, favourites and follows if it's so universally hated by the Fanfic community?

** It reminds me of IAmVerySmart and I only got through the first few pages. Maybe I'm too dumb for it or something but I really didn't enjoy it.

** Definitely agreed on the un-likeability of the main character. I can't even call him Harry, because he is a complete self-insert who is Harry in name only.

Giving their character a triple-barrel surname is a HUGE red flag for a writer being a pretentious idiot. As far as I can tell, it seems to be aimed at teenagers who haven't yet realised that being book-smart is not the same as being intelligent.

Somebody on a previous thread put it better than I can: the character (and by extension, the writer) is the guy nobody wants to be stuck talking to at a party.

*** Ouch.

As someone who hasn't read MoR, what exactly do you mean by a triple barrel surname?

** Instead of reading HPMOR, just go on a site like Omegle and find a nerd who will let you watch him masturbate while telling you how much smarter than you he is. That will give you the same experience as reading HPMOR, but it won't take nearly as long.
