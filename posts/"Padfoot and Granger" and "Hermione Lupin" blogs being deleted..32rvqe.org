Two fanwork blogs on Tumblr are being deleted by the creator for personal reasons. Each blog has a bunch of material for each ship, including fanfic recs that are on sites like FFN/AO3, as well as work that as far as I know is only published on Tumblr. They're being deleted sometime Friday, so you've only got a little bit to save any material you're interested in.

Here's the two blogs:

[[http://padfootandgranger.tumblr.com/][Padfoot and Granger (Sirius & Hermione)]]

[[http://hermionelupin.tumblr.com/][Hermione Lupin (Remus & Hermione)]]

EDIT: I got a response from the creator, they have people taking over the blogs now. If it's one of you guys, you're awesome. I'm glad they won't be gone.


** I don't get why they are deleting it - they could just let it up as an archive of sorts and never touch it again. Seems like a bit of a temper tantrum to me, to delete something just because you don't want it anymore, especially if it's a contribution to the fandom

*** I agree, I sent an ask wondering why they don't just scramble the password and abandon it, but it hasn't been answered yet and I won't be surprised if they don't answer it.

I'm not comfortable taking over someones blog (let alone two of them) but if I have time tonight I plan to reblog all the Tumblr-published fiction at least onto a shell so it's preserved. But I'm in class all day so we'll see.

Since I can't promise to be able to do that, figured a heads up for the people here is at least something.
