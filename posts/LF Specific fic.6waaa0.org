I don't really remember much about the fic, but I remember Hogwarts becoming poor because less and less students were attending. I think Harry set up a rival school elsewhere, which all the pro-Hogwarts people scoffed at until it was too late. I think there was some bashing involved, might have been a Hermione-bashing. If anyone could point me at the right fic, that'd be really great!

  Harry Potter had enough of the stupidity of the Wizarding World. If they all believed that he was a dark wizard, just because he could talk to snakes, screw them! He didn't need them. And who ever said that all prophecies did come true? (No horcruxes).

**** I remembered reading a few variations and that in one his school was Queens Academy or something like that, which let me find this. I'm glad it's the one you were looking for!
