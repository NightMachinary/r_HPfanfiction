I recently scoured ffn for fics dealing with the prophecy, when you take the canon wording and some plots & viable options(out of the original hp universe) without going too strongly out of the way to invent something new.

Sure, there are many fics that do that but i havnt seen it quite like this yet. Its rather more... believeable than other stuff i've come across. Tell me your ideas or fic's to deal with the prophecy or defeat its purpose in ingenious/obvious but mostly overlooked ways! ;) linkffn(12952055)


** Considering this is fanfiction, what happens if you go back in time to kill either Tom or Harry (or their parents Terminator-style) before the prophecy was even made? Time-travel is pretty common trope here.

Here is a thought: if either must die at the hand of the other, does that mean they can't commit suicide? And did Voldemort really die at Harry's hand, since technically he cast the killing curse /both/ times that killed him?

linkffn(Realignment): I have six words for you: Tom Riddle, the Boy Who Lived.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** In linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor), I do believe I dug up the most off-the-wall idea yet for loopholing away the Prophecy. It comes in quite late, though, so tell me if you want to know, but otherwise I'll avoid the spoiler...

  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, secrets are uncovered, and loopholes are delightfully abused.

  Lily Potter took certain steps to ensure that is exactly what she gets. (Oneshot?)
