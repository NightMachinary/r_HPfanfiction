great writing, constant updates, or a plot you're actually interested in.

Pick two.

Or, of course, you can find a story that's all three-- but the author has only the one story, usually posted years ago.

#+begin_quote
  It wasn't one of the 'inner circle', if that's what you're wondering. Harry made a number of enemies along the way. The wizard that betrayed him was supposedly a would-be follower. He had access to some nasty artefacts, including one that replicated the Imperius-effects. He planned to use it on someone in Harry's 'inner circle' and use them to kill Harry. Harry did not take kindly to that.

Stuff I'd include in the Dark Arts If I were an author:

- Addictive vampiric spells

- Transmissible curses beyond lycanthropy/werewolf-ism.

- Paranoia inducing hexes.

- Josef Mengele-type experimentation.

- Some sort of cannibalism shit?

- Monster creation beyond Inferi and Basilisks.

********* Indeed. I tend to write Voldemort as a man - like Dumbledore - who prefers plans that advance his goals even if they fail and that don't depend on luck and coincidences.

As an example, in "Patron", Harry was forced into the Tournament, but that was just a diversion, to keep Dumbledore busy so Barty could prepare Voldemort's resurrection without interference. Dumbledore suspected that, but still was forced to up the security to counter the sabotage attempts. At the same time, his reputation suffered some with each incident during the Tournament that couldn't be dealt with quietly, even if neither Harry nor the other champions were hurt, forcing Dumbledore to spend more time on maintaining his influence. And Voldemort set up a strawman to take the fall, so the Ministry would think they caught the culprit behind the sabotage and would not suspect his return. Dumbledore though knew of the Dark Lord's actions thanks to Harry's visions, but played along, so Voldemort would keep thinking that he had succeeded, while preparing his own moves.

** That linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn518) was alot more fast paced and cut all the unnecessary parts that doesn't advance the characters or the plot. My biggest issue is that it's highly meticulous and explains all the parts step by step. A good thing if the readers are novices to fanfiction, I remember being confused when reading a fic where someone named Daphne was introduced with little to no fanfare or explanation. The thing is I'm nolonger a novice at fanfiction, and just because they dedicate an entire chapter to the fem!Harry character doesn't mean it's going to drastically alter my perception of that fan!character. If she had a more drastic past or some other quirk that puts her appart from all the other fem!Harrys then it would be warrented. Only difference in this story is that she's Ravenclaw with Hermione and a few details that ultimately doesn't change anything.

I don't mind if it never got finished, I got imagination and enough travel times to think up great ending myself. It's just it never actually advanced past the first week. Partially because it also introduced everything in the beginning before even attempting to advance the plot, as if they can't introduce new things at the lull of the story. Now they used all their plot-twists and OC introductions in the first week and can't proceed without jumping the shark because the pacing got screwed in the beginning.

Only story that perfected this pacing issue is canon and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by the Santi)

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

*** No-one's saying they should change anything, it's their story after all. But you must have read some fics you really enjoyed but just had bits that didn't seem right to you. We're just chatting to see if anyone else felt the same.
