** The best fic of them I've read doesn't have them as prime characters. It's the Good Morrow by anyaviolletta. But if you read it, prepare for the very brutal and depressing ending... it's a great read but wow is it tough emotionally.

Basically James and Lily come back (after being time-displaced by Voldemort) on Halloween of Harry's Fourth Year. Unfinished but really fun.

** There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649528/nonjon][NonJon's]], "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2630300/1/You-Did-What][You Did What!]]" which is the third part of a trilogy. I highly recommend all three and quite a bit more of what NonJon has done.

It starts with "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the World is Harry Potter?]]"
