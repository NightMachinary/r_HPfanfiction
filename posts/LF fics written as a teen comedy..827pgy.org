Looking for any fics that are written as a teen comedy. Doesn't matter who the characters are. My request is based off a video I recently viewed...[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_ubmjE21SY&feature=youtu.be]]


** I don't know what sorcery you did but it has put a permanent grin on my face. Haven't read through it all but my bets on this page having some fics like this. Hope it helps! [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterHumorCrack]]

  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD.
