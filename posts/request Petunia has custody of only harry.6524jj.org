I have had a plot bunny running round my head for the past year or so where Petunia ends up a single parent with custody of both boys or just Harry. Started various times but I have a history of starting fics then loosing my plotlines mid way through.

Does anyone know of anything else like this? Dark or light, I have several ideas running around.

  Prompt from an anonymous tumblr user: For the prompt thing I really have been wanting a fic where petunia never married and got over her jealously about not having magic. Harry was raised lovingly and well by Petunia. Pretty please write something for this even if it's short.(Hahahahaha it's not short.)Asexual Petunia Evans must raise the newly-orphaned Harry Potter on her own- or so she thinks. When Remus Lupin shows up, seeking contact with the last connections he has to two of his best friends, the two quickly form a bond as they share their grief over the events of and following Halloween. Heavily implied Wolfstar.

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

  AU: JKR portrays Harry as completely unaffected by the Killing Curse cast at him. But how would things have gone if it had been different?

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.
