*** That story is not set in our Muggle world either, but in a sci-fi universe with superpowers. Riddle, therefore, is only a low level threat, and truly terrifying super villains will show up in its sequel.

***** This fic is actually the prequel to [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28614/DianeCastle+The+Secret+Return+of+Alex+Mack.htm#pt][The Secret Return of Alex Mack]], which features a different main character. HP Trio makes frequent appearances and are important to the plot.

A direct sequel, “Hermione Granger and the Swiss Tournament”, will be written after the author is done with her current work.
