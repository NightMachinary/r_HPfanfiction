Something I've realised from reading a lot of Fanfiction's throughout the years is that people very rarely hit the middle of a Slytherin Harry. He's usually they typical 'I'm mean and cold harry' or the calculated Harry that is there because his brother is the BWL (I don't mind reading these fics) however I feel like people forget who Harry is.

Now I agree that Harry as a character isn't super driven or super funny. However I do find he has a very dry sense of humour that isn't ever seen in these fics, and I can see an argument saying that Slytherin's can't be funny. My argument would be that to be a good Slytherin I'd imagine you to have a good sense of humour. The main attributes for Slytherin are ambitious and cunning, you're telling me the best comedians in the world aren't those.

My main point is that you could write a Slytherin Harry so much better. I've seen very few fics with a Slytherin Harry that isn't super cunning or cold, and those who don't start with 11yr old Harry.

Anyone else feel this?


** I think its largely because of the way people like to portray Slytherin house as a whole. You know, full of smirking politician children who "don't have friends, I have allies, MOM."

If the kids in Slytherin were allowed to be more like actual kids, just ambitious, driven, and maybe a bit ruthless ones, Slytherin!Harry wouldn't have to be such an edgelord. If you combined Harry's canon traits, along with his dark humor, with Slytherin values, I think it could make a really interesting character.

Edit: what i personally miss most in Slytherin!Harry fics is genuine friendships. I just can't relate to a character that doesn't want friends, and I think Slytherin has a real potential for “I'll kill for you”-relationships lol

*** A sidenote "I don't have friends, I have allies MOM!" Would actually be funny to read in a Slytherin focused fic if the mom responded with something like "of course, sweetie, I'm so sorry. You're a very cunning little politician." Complete with a patronizing head pat.

*** Harry (actually Harriet, going by Rigel) has genuine friendships in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense). She doesn't necessarily have all that much resemblance to canon Harry, though. But it's a great series! Starts off looking pretty straightforward, but as you keep reading, it keeps unfolding more layers.

** What's interesting about this is that the Sorting Hat would have put him in Slytherin as-is. He asked to go to Gryffindor and got what he wanted, but the Sorting Hat must have seen enough Slytherin traits for him to reasonably fit in as-is. Would he learn more and perhaps hide his true self a bit more once he finds out some "Slytherin secrets" or whatever people like to put in their fics? Probably. But he would still be put through the situations that required him to save the school again and again. And he would still do it. He might not end up on the school's Quidditch team but he would definitely still stand up to Malfoy about Neville, in public or in private. Changing his House doesn't change his attitude. It's literally just changing his environment. A reptile that adapts to fit its environment is still the same reptile it was before. It just moved and adapted to a new environment.

*** To be fair, though, I'd argue that the Hat's suggestion never made any sense, at least not if you retroactively assign the traits and behaviour Harry showed afterwards in Gryffindor to his character before then. Harry, after the sorting, is the epitome of Gryffindor. Which is the reason I don't think simply putting Canon!Harry into Slytherin works (nor do I think it's interesting, because you are asking "how would a Gryffindor act in Slytherin", to which the obvious answer is "like a Gryffindor").

So if you don't assume the Hat's words are simply author fiat that's not supposed to make much sense, the only way to reconcile this is to assume Harry's behaviour in Gryffindor is shaped by /being/ in Gryffindor, but if you go /there/, then of course the entire discussion becomes obsolete, and you're basically starting his character from scratch.

You might want to take a closer look at what the Hat actually said. It's a pretty experienced piece of headwear.

It didn't say he belonged in Slytherin. It didn't actually say it wanted to send him to Slytherin. Harry started the conversation by thinking "Not Slytherin," and the Hat said that that was interesting because "Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness." Which is spot on. Learning a bit more self control and cunning could have made Harry far more effective and dangerous than he was in canon. He likely could have had a much less adversarial relationship with Severus Snape, who has no time for brash heroics and impulsive violence. He might have had some real success with Occlumency. And perhaps, with him being one of them, some of the members of Slytherin House would have fought to protect Hogwarts in the end instead of evacuating.

But the Hat didn't actually say he belonged there, only that his antipathy to it was interesting. Even in second year, when he consults it again, what does it say? "You would have done well in Slytherin." Not that his Sorting was wrong.

***** For someone like Harry, I see Slytherin as a high-risk, high-reward house: it'll either push them towards greatness or chew them up and spit them out---or both, as it did with Snape. The Sorting Hat is a Thinking Cap, not a Seeing Cap, and it can only talk about possibilities, with an imperative to play up the virtues of all houses.

***** Fair, though I'd argue that given the context, the intention would have to be understood as such.

If you interpret it the way you do, it's true for everyone, and therefore kinda meaningless -- the same truth value would be in the statements "Ravenclaw will help you get good marks", or "Hufflepuff will teach you loyalty". Yet the Hat did not talk about Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw, only about Slytherin and Gryffindor. My conclusion is those were Houses the Hat (resp. the author) considered for Harry, that it was relevant to the decision being made, not that it was merely uttering truisms.

Anyway, that aside, "you would have done well in Slytherin" I'd dispute in any case. I just don't see how, if we accept the Houses as places of people sharing similar traits, and "doing well" necessarily implying succeeding by /that standard/ -- if Harry perfomed the same actions as in Canon, it surely must be considered an utter failure. (And if he didn't act that way, we're back at my last paragraph from above.)

I don't really think that that's the case, though.

Exhibit A, Crabbe and Goyle. They have less cunning and ambition than Trevor the toad. They went to Slytherin because...well, I guess they needed to. Their only apparent aim in life was to do as the Malfoys instructed them, and they couldn't achieve that purpose anywhere else.

Exhibit B, Luna Lovegood. Ravenclaw may have suited her inquisitive mind, but similar traits to her housemates? Not hardly.

Exhibit C, Percy Weasley. He had some courage buried deep down when it really mattered, as everyone should, but he was nothing like the other Gryffindors. IMO he should have been a shoo-in for Slytherin.

******* Well, there are two arguments here.

We are certainly told people are sorted according to certain qualities. But we are also shown they are. The respective qualities between show and tell might not match, but people are still grouped by similar traits, especially in the case of Slytherin. So I think the argument works either way.

Anyway, if you want to argue by what we are shown, you have to replace "cunning" and "ambition" with "bigots", "assholes", "cowards", "selfish people": they go to Slytherin, and that covers everyone from Crabbe to Snape and Slughorn. (And to quickly jump out-of-book, to make sure that point wasn't missed, if you look up stuff from Rowling on Pottermore, the fact that Pettigrew betrayed the Potters is proof he should have been in Slytherin, too.)

So by what we are shown, Harry, acting the same way as in Canon, really must be a terrible Slytherin, he's their virtual opposite. It's somewhat easier to argue by what we are told, but as you note, that results in contradictions, and anyway, Harry's exploits during the books don't score brilliantly on the "cunning", "use any means to achieve ends" and "ambition" score either.

I disagree with the time before Hogwarts, though. He had very clearly worked out a way to optimise his stay with the Dursleys. What comes to mind is "don't ask questions" and sneaking off into the kitchen to eat at night even if he was supposed to be grounded, for instance.

With that out of the way, I think there's no way for Harry to end up in and survive Slytherin without becoming far more cunning, more skilled, and at least more standoffish, if not outright meaner, than he was in the books.

Why? No Ron, probably no Quidditch, and more Snape.

** It's a matter of taste, of course. As both a writer and a reader, I would invert your question: What is the point in writing Harry in Slytherin, if not to radically alter his character? You /must/ change him a lot. Harry who is his Canon-Gryffindor-self, except in Slytherin, does nothing to me (leaving aside that it makes no sense, if Houses have any meaning at all). It feels a bit pointless to me -- why change anything, then, if it's the same character still?

But at any rate, the main change I want to see when reading about Harry in Slytherin isn't less humour or more ambition, but selfishness. This has the greatest impact on the story, because it's a negation of Canon; any of the seminal events in the books happen because Harry feels responsible, and I love to explore what happens when he just doesn't. Everything else follows or it doesn't; but admittedly, the kind of story that follows naturally from this kind of setup is serious and perhaps a tragedy, so I get (and am fine with) a lack of humour.

**** Harry's defining trait is to stand up for what is right, regardless of the personal costs. So there is no way around the fact that it just /is/ hard to put him into Slytherin. Harry -- the way he is portrayed after his sorting -- is the quintessential Gryffindor. So you're always creating bad compromises between removing his signature behaviour and creating a useful Slytherin, if you're going that route.

To not just offer the cop-out of "it's impossible" to your question, however: I guess the easiest would be to take what we see from Harry during the early Dursley chapters in PS, before he gets sorted. This includes, amongst others:

- Being quick-witted (helpful for the whole "Slytherin fence with words" trope)
- Being reasonably sneaky and able to plan ahead
- A talent to read people, and manipulate them such that they are willing to part with information (or do something or another)
- Being conscious of his image, a desire to fit in, and having friends
- A dislike of bullies, stupid people, and compassion for those suffer under them

So I don't know that you get much of a (or, /the/) Gryffindor!Harry out of this. But you do get something that is approximating something Harry used to be before he came to Hogwarts and that works in Slytherin.

** I see OP's point in that Harry's character oftentimes lacks canon traits that are great in both Slytherin and Gryffindor. Harry's kind of a jock with a dry sense of humor, and I think the house would appreciate when his flying won them the quidditch cup.

Plus, remember when he said “you don't have to call me sir” to Snape?! You can't tell me that not a single slytherin thought damn, that was good. Even if saying it to Snape is suicidal, getting off a perfectly-timed burn like that is the dream of every teenager ever.

That said, one of the main points of fanfiction is that you get to change things (as seen in hermione and Snape pairings). Sticking closer to canon Harry doesn't mean the fic is automatically “better” than others. But... I'd also really like to read a fic like the one OP's describing, because I've never understood why Harry could've been slytherin in the first place. If anyone finds one let me know :)
