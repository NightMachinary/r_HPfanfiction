Hey there, what I am looking for is a bit hard to describe. I read the story Still Standing on HPFF and although it is unfinished it is my favorite story so far. I am looking for a mysterious Harry who comes back into the lives of his old friends and there is that element of mystery like where has he been, what has he learned, why is he stronger etc I dont want super OP Harry but a solid power increase is fine. I don't know if I am describing this well but any help would be great. Thanks!

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

**** Not anything that is either too similar to Too Young To Die or would match all of OP's request criteria.

Still, you can also check the stories from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5oatjs/looking_for_more_gems_like_mother_of_learning_can/dcihhve/?context=3][this recommendation list,]] (most of them are not HP fanfics, and are TT/DT though).
