This may fit more than one fic, but I'll take any. Anyway I remember he was confronting someone(death eater?) and is outnumbered, so he calls out "say hello to my little friend" and dobby pops in and blasts them all back (think Lucius in CoS) and pops harry away to safety. It was early on, harry got stronger later and fought his own battles, but that stuck with me. Ring any bells?
