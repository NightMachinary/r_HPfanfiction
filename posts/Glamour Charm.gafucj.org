I keep coming across a charm in HP fanfics where a person can basically alter the way they appear to themselves and others. Like, say Harry's seriously abused and he doesn't want anyone to know, so he uses the charm to make it appear that he's hale and healthy and isn't skinny as a rail or is covered in old scars. I tried looking it up, but I can't find anything like the charm except for the disillusionment charm or being a metamorphamagus.


** They're not canon at all.

Glamours, like wards, are very much a staple of magic from any number of other series and people have simply transferred them over to the Harry Potter verse as fanon.

*** Ah, okay. That makes sense.

** It's not canon, and IMO the existence and use of polyjuice potion implies that no such thing exists.

*** Except there are spells that allow a person to alter their physical appearance. Self-Transfiguration for one, would allow you to rearrange your facial features into whatever you wanted (and in fact I feel like one could argue that that's essentially what a Metamorphmagus does, just on an instinctual level); and you could use the Colour Changing Charm to dye your hair, and possibly even alter your eye colour.

*** I would say that they cover different niches, though. Polyjuice physically turns you into a different person/form - a glamour, in the fanon sense, is just a magical illusion.

Techniques and spells that could detect or ignore magical illusions would not work against Polyjuice, for instance. Glamours would also not change your voice, or other attributes (eg - weight/actual size). There's a lot of other ways in which polyjuice would have an edge over glamours, should they exist.
