The mod team has created *Rule 9*. Please see below.

#+begin_quote
  9: Request threads are for fic requests, not opinions on the requested item. /Do not bash the requests people make. Instead, make a discussion post if you wish to discuss the style of fic requested./
#+end_quote

Long explanation:

Request threads are for requests /only/. Not discussion of the request, or about the merits of the type of story requested. Just a request. So even if you hate Harry/Ginny with a passion, *do not spew your dislike all over a thread where someone is asking for fics of that nature*.

This even includes some of the lesser-liked requests that people might make. Like Tom Riddle/Harry. Like mpreg. Like slash. Like Death Eater Redemption. Like Harry-turns-bad. If you wish to discuss the type of request made, *make a discussion thread for it*. Do not bash a request made inside a request thread. Do not downvote a request made. Simply ignore it if you don't like it, and move on.

We all are readers here who love Harry Potter. We just happen to like different parts of Harry Potter. Remember rules 2 & 3 and remember the human behind the screen.


** This makes sense, except for the part about downvoting

​

> Do not downvote a request made.

​

The problem here is by default what people usually do is "If I want to see more of this post, Upvote, otherwise Downvote". Since votes are not really moderated it really isn't an easy thing to police either. Nor does it really make sense to expect people to change that without strong guidance otherwise.

​

Unless we explicitly change the standards for voting on requests (for example, Upvote if it is a clear and well thought out request, Downvote if it is something that could be found by searching or isn't well written), I don't think you can reasonably expect things not to engage. If someone gets onto the hot page via upvotes, people who don't like it are gonna downvote.

(Changing the standard for voting would work, but takes work. Like a bot that posts on every request reminding people how they should be voting. Either that our a sub-wide standard for voting, not just requests).

​

Alternatively, disabling downvotes for requests would also do that.

*** Disabling the downvote button does not work in my experience and only makes the people who want to downvote angrier & more likely to brigade.

This is because when you disable the downvote button it is done purley through CSS. CSS does not exist on individual user pages, nor does it exist if you turn CSS off for any particular sub (or reddit entirely). I'm also not fully sure how this would translate to new reddit.

While a decent idea, it ends up being more harm than its worth.

For reference, Reddit's site wide rule is that downvoting should only be used when something does not belong on reddit. Such as harassment, comments/posts that go against the sub's rules or include personal information. Otherwise, the downvote button is not a disagree button and should not be used as such.

That's already the proper [[https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette][Reddiquette]] and always has been afaik. Downvoting is never supposed to mean "I don't enjoy this," it's supposed to mean "This doesn't belong on Reddit /for anyone/." That's already the standard. If you personally dislike something but others may like it, the proper response is to hide it.

There is nothing wrong with a community that downvotes requests it doesn't like and upvotes requests it does. In a community of like minded individuals,bit can be valuable. It may not be what we want here, but it doesn't mean it isn't good elsewhere.

***** The Reddiquette standard says "contributes /to dialogue or discussion/," though (emphasis added). It also suggests that before downvoting, you consider providing constructive criticism about why. So, as an alternative to simply hiding a post or comment, you could reply and point out your reasons for disliking it. But there's really quite a low bar for being good enough to belong.

I only half agree. The upvoting is sufficient to distinguish popular from unpopular, unless posts are actually off-topic or against subreddit rules. Remember, once downvoting reaches a threshold, content is hidden from /everyone/. So under a "downvote whatever you dislike" policy, some posts with only niche appeal, but not violating any rules, could well be hidden from their target audience. The appropriate response is instead to just ignore or hide them, upvote your preferred posts to the top of the subreddit, and let niche readers find what they're after unhindered if they take the time to wade through.

Not exactly that. Lets say someone asked for a femHarry timetravel story. My rec is like... Mistakes and Second Choices (a necromancer femHarry genderbend time travel fic). I say somethings that are immediatly discernible from the first few chapters, like there will be some Dumbledore Bash, no Weasley bash, though no love either, and she uses a couple of elemental spells for being a necro.

Someone then responds to me that they either dislike the fic in general or point out its flaws. That should be allowed in a Request fic, because its expands upon the request itself, not if its a bad Request or if the suggested fic isn't what was requested.

But yes, what you said should also be allowed.

All of this is my opinion, ofc.

** This rule is perfectly fine, so long as it is consistently enforced (which it hasn't been up til now). Namely, it needs to be enforced just as much against the OP as the people in the comments.

The problem is that people who make request threads rarely limit themselves to a request. It's never "Looking for stories where Dumbledore is evil." It's always "Looking for stories where Dumbledore is evil because no one in their right mind could justify his actions in canon."

If OP creates a combination request-discussion thread, I don't think they can complain when people respond to them in the same terms. Labelling a thread a "request" should not be some kind of shield that people can use to give themselves a soap box from which they can profess controversial opinions without any risk of being called out.

That said "make a discussion thread if you want to discuss a request" idea is the kind of silly rule that can only exist because the rule-makers don't expect people to actually follow it. Imagine if for every request made in the sub, there was a corresponding discussion thread. The sub would be overrun with spam.

It's certainly possible to write an AU where Dramione is believable (eg Draco starts to question pureblood supremacy after Hermione outperformed everyone during PS, he befriends Hermione to find her secret only to realize that she isn't cheating), or to write a good Lord Harry fic, but doing so usually means to disregard the common interpretation and tropes surrounding that type of story. But as far as I know, there are no stories which do so, which makes arguing in that direction difficult and in return means that the existing fics are subjectively awful.

Which means that I'd trash the recommended fic and the common stories and motives, but not deny that the premise can be done well. It gets really difficult when OP asks for the elements which make something awful (eg Snarry while Harry is fed a love potion and still 13).

Article 24 allows ruses, but not for carrying out assassinations since they are forbidden by 23.

Actually, as I said, the rule has been in the sidebar for over a year, just phrased differently.

As others have mentioned elsewhere in this thread, before this change it used to be part of the wording of rule 7. Apparently some commenters just overlooked it or chose to ignore it. Thus, the mods have now clarified the matter by making it a separate rule.

#+begin_quote
  So for most people, and what can be assumed in general, is that this is a new rule, no matter if it had been there in the past and then removed.
#+end_quote

In the past year there was never a time period when the rule was not in the sidebar. Mods have been enforcing the rule consistently whenever they get reports.

Which rule? 7? Because that just says which flair to use. Rule 2? Well, discussing the failings of underage m/m mpreg isn't hate speech.

The Request threads are full of people only talking about the request and not linking. Even now, one of the threads is literally just people talking, and not linking. If they've been enforcing this rule, they're doing it only to certain people. Otherwise, they're not enforcing it, because people here obviously think it's nonsense and not needed.

As I mentioned, the answer to that question was already covered [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c4fz8u/new_rule_announcement_see_inside/erwu0bb/][earlier in this thread]].

Yeah, people can report them, but if they're not, it just answers my second point of that discussion. People aren't reporting those posts because they think it's a nonsense rule, or they don't care enough, which makes the rule unneeded.

Or, like yourself, they never noticed that the rule existed.

If you followed [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/a7eh26/downvoting_should_be_reserved_for_shitposting_and/ec4erjx/][the link]] in the second comment chain I mentioned, you would see an example of someone who agreed with the rule but didn't realize it existed until it was pointed out to them.

Judging by your previous comment, you seem to think that upvotes/downvotes are an indicator of like/dislike. You could look at how many people upvoted this announcement thread as an indication of how many more people view the rule favorably vs. unfavorably

*** Your case is rather extreme, but I believe the reasonable thing here is to /always/ allow discussing recommended fics as reply to the one recommending -- be it because they don't like the fic (assuming their post is more elaborate than "this fic sucks"), it doesn't align with what OP requested, the fic is disturbing because reasons (such as the one you mentioned), etc.

*** Rules are located on the sidebar, but I'll repost them for you here:

1. No personal information.

2. No hateful speech or witch hunting. Homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism or any other derogatory language will not be tolerated.

3. No personal attacks or insults. Purposefully inciting arguments, personal attacks and threats will not be tolerated.

4. No impersonating authors. Pretending to be an author and making comments on an authors' behalf will not be tolerated.

5. All spoilers must use the spoiler tags: >!it was his sled!<

6. Do not use this subreddit to try to circumvent the rules of other fanfiction communities or the will of authors.

7. Request threads are for recommendations of a certain critera. "What's that fic?" is for finding a specific fic. Flair accordingly. See here for an explanation.

8. No direct links to sexual or suggestive content involving minors. Please note reddit's policy regarding this issue. All direct links to such content will be removed.

9. Request threads are for fic requests, not opinions on the requested item. Do not bash the requests people make. Instead, make a discussion post if you wish to discuss the style of fic requested.

OP asks for "good Harry/Ginny stories".

Someone provides a link to "bad story here" which /is/ a Hinny story but is not a good fic for x, y, or z reason.

You would like to comment on why "bad story here" is not a good example of a Hinny.

***** Yes! What is /not/ okay are these things:

OP asks for "good Harry/Ginny stories".

You explain why Harry/Ginny is a horrible ship and why the author shouldn't be reading it.

OR

OP asks for "good Harry/Ginny stories".

Someone provides a link to "bad story here" which is a Hinny story but is not a good fic for x, y, or z reason.

You comment that Hinny is a bad ship and do not address the technical reasons why the story is bad or address the request at all.

Essentially, you may discuss linked fics that match the OP's request. What isn't okay is a discussion on the merits of OP's request. In this example, discussing Hinny stories is okay. Discussing whether Hinny is a good ship is not okay.
