** HpMoR is, even if many people dislike it, trying to teach something - it has morals, a somewhat sensible plot, it has a point.

Partially Kissed Hero.. its a Lionheart fic. As Taure said, it belongs with My Immortal. Its just a whole lot of random crap written down without a semblance of order and called a story.

I object to these 2 fics being compared - its not in any way right!

** My personal reason for not liking HpMor is that it just reads like an elaborate criticism of canon; that is using a super-smart Harry as a tool to point out logical flaws and things you dislike about the books, rather than a genuine attempt at fanfiction.

** I object to many worldbuilding, plot and characterisation issues in MoR, as well as the pacing, dialogue, narrative voice and themes. However, it does at least meet certain basic standards of coherence and technical writing.

Partially Kissed Hero is just a shitfic. It's in the same category as My Immortal.

** My biggest problem with MoR (aside from the author's self-insertion) is the pacing. It just seems to drag on and on.
