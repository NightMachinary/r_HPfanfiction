I feel like reading fanfiction has done a lot to teach me about what not to do! so when I sit down to try and write myself I am very aware of just how bad what I have written actually is.

but I also known that the best way to get better at writing is practice

so any advice on How to not worry so much about what I am going to edit and rewrite later and just write /type?


** The fact that you're going to edit it and rewrite it later should be enough to get you not to think twice about your writing in the moment. There's not really much else to it except sitting down and letting it all out. Get in the right atmosphere: coffee shop, desk at home, with a cup of tea, wherever you write best and just write. There are also apps that basically you can't stop writing because then all your work gets deleted. Too scared to try it myself, but it mght interest you. Just remember that no one's first draft is anywhere near good, much less ready to publish.

I wish I could somehow inform everyone everywhere that wants to write that editing is where good writing is made. First editing passes aren't about polish, they're about making sense of things. It doesn't take magical divining or inborn talent to do either. All it takes is the time to sit down, read the story, and decide what is working and what isn't. Literally anyone can do it with enough time.

Honestly, in my experience the two most difficult things about writing are getting started on a blank page and cutting scenes that are awesome but don't fit the story.

@OP: Remember, no one is judging your writing until you show it to them. When you read anything, you don't see the struggle they went through to get there. Trust me, the struggle is real.

For anyone interested, Brandon Sanderson has a download of 1.0 vs 6.1 version of Warbreaker available for [[https://brandonsanderson.com/books/warbreaker/warbreaker/warbreaker-rights-and-downloads/#comparisons][download on his site]]. The entire thing is red with deletions and insertions.

** No first draft is perfect! Give yourself permission to write 'crap'. Just write. Your only enemy is a blank piece of paper (virtual or otherwise)! - Worry about the quality only after you're finished with the chapter/story. Polishing it and making it readable, that's was the editing process is for. A beta might help as well. Don't give up! You already know that the key to improving your writing is to keep on writing! - Good luck! :)

** Happens all the time. The vast majority of fics I write are in response to reading someone elses story that has a semi-interesting idea, but awful execution, so then I take it upon myself to write the idea the way I think it should be done. Except, my own version is often times worse than the version I was trying to do better than.

** Writing is an art; proofreading is a skill. Both require practice and the former, a good bit of courage to fail and fail often before you get any good.

Editing is unavoidable. The only person in modern history who could bang out magnificent prose on the first go was Dwight Eisenhower. Unless you're like Ike, you'll have to labor like the rest of us and work your craft through multiple drafts.

** I realize that all the time, especially when I'm reading one of my favorite fics and I'm like how do they write like that? I wish I could. So I take note of what they're doing, not the plot but how they draw you in etc.

** When I started writing (it was a Starcraft fic, iirc. There were clones, and spaceships, and dragons, and also Captain Picard) I wrote longhand, in pencil (even though I never erased anything).

Switching to typing on a PC has made definite changes to my writing style - I write much faster, but my beta has commented on my 'spare' style, when I used to have a Tolkienesque love of description.

So I took up handwriting again, and then typing it over, and I do believe that my writing is much, much better now. I've found a balance between the description-heavy purple prose I wrote between eleven and seventeen, and the minimalist style I adopted once I started writing on a computer.

The thing about writing by hand is that it can be done anywhere, and you have time to think while you're doing it. Unlike typing, which i find often goes too fast for me to properly register what I'm doing. Which leads to ungood writing.

The other thing is that when you're writing by hand with the intent to publish online, you're basically forcing yourself to reread. There's no way to get the work online without reading through it and typing it up, which gives you a fantastic opportunity to edit as you go - the first draft on your computer will actually be your second draft.

You've mentioned that you read fanfic, so I know you can recognize shit writing when you come across it. When you come across a bit of your own work that is perhaps not as good as you'd like, doing the work by hand means that instead of having to /delete entire paragraphs/ (which is disheartening and depressing and other things ending in D) you can just change it as you type.

** I can tell you right now that the first stuff I wrote was really, really bad. Like, awful. It was a Haruhi Suzumiya fanfiction and it suuuuuucckkkkkeeeeddddd. Whenever I go back and read it, my eyes bleed a little.

The next story I wrote was a Mass Effect story that was pretty awful. It was hella long and but the first part was a canon retred and the last part was a confusing jumbled mess.

Then, I wrote a story that was OK. I go back and I see problems with it, but it's alright.

I took a break, then wrote some HP stuff. Some of it is good, some of it is bad, but it's improved. My lastest stuff is easily better by miles than what I wrote last year though.

My point is, keep writing. The first 100k words you write will be terrible. The next 100k will be bad, but improving. By the time you've written 500k or more words, you'll be light years better than where you started.

just imagine you're writing the title for a new thread on reddit, that should allow you to just let things flow and ignore typos etc.

sorry, this probably isn't constructive, but I couldn't help myself.

** Yes, a billion, million times yes. I read or re-read my favorite authors to purge myself from having read bad fics and if I spend too long there I can't even write my own stuff easily. If I read a good fic, I almost have to read a not so good fic to feel better about writing again. :(
