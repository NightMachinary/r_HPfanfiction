For example, linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5) is centred around a revolutionary group similar to groups like the Black Panthers, the Cuban Communist Party (under Che's military guidance) and so forth, and makes explicit reference to notable MLs like Mao. It seems like any political fics are generally from a centrist neoliberal view, which, as you can guess, is a bit gross for me. Anyone got some other good ones? Anarchist fics would be my main preference, but ML stuff is cool too. I'm fine with ships as long as they're not unrealistic.


** I wouldn't call most political fics as neoliberalism at all. The vast majority of them are straight up unironic endorsements of aristocracy.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

**** Right, but leftist != socialism. I simply cannot see how you can be an anarchist and a socialist at the same time: some authority needs to do the redistributing in socialism. In anarchism if I have the bigger gun or more friends I'm just going to take all your stuff, that's the opposite of socialism (the rich get richer)

I also reject the notion that I have to be some kind of radical as a lefty, I think socialism and anarchism are both really stupid, but I'm most certainly not a centrist.

***** The argument in anarchist theory is that even if the state starts as a power intended to redistribute wealth to others, it inevitably is co-opted by the elites in order to be used, in the most general sense, to protect private property. The second follow on on that is that most people operate in a manner that seeks mutual aid, as Kropotkin called it, and that they will seek to help one another in the absence of a state, as while you might have more friends or the bigger gun, it might be even better for you to make the man you're thinking about robbing into one of those friends, or less hypothetically, you might not even need the threat of incarceration to behave morally.

And yeah, I wasn't trying to cast you out of like, the super secret lefty club or anything, sorry if it seemed that way. Socialism and anarchy are the radical side of it, to be sure, I was just more trying to point out that they share a common set of goals, in many cases.

I'm wondering what you could call such an organization that acts by the people for the people, with their common interest at heart, I'm sure there's some kind of word for it...democra... Something.

Why do I have the feeling that people who argue for anarchism always try to sneak in some kind of governance (be it through consensus, tribalism or democracy) through the backdoor? Even the most idealistic of hippy communes had some (unwritten) laws and you'd have been thrown out if you were an asshole.

******* I mean, you're not wrong at all, the basis of anarcho-syndicalism, one of the communist anarchies I mentioned earlier, is direct democracy and direct action by the workers to stop those doing harm. The issue I find most anarchists have with much of modern democracy is that it is increasingly hijacked and perverted by elites to go against the interests of people it's suppose to empower and serve. Democracy is all good, the problem is the apparatus attached to it, the state.

Full disclosure, I'm not an actual anarchist, so while I'm confident in a lot of my sourcing, some of my rationale and personal commentary may be inaccurate.

That's all fine and I think we are probably in agreement for the most part. It just seems very irrational to me to propose the removal of all *accountability* as a *remedy* for elites abusing their power.

The ideals of socialism are literally the opposite: Holding rich land-owners accountable and redistributing their assets to the workers by rule of law and if necessary by force.

********** Yeah, sure I understand the concept, let's think it through though: let's imagine you own a bunch of cows and sell the milk. One day, Anarchy is declared! Suddenly every night a cow disappears. Since there's no police you ask your friends to help you catch the thief, but they are all way too busy protecting their own shit all day and night. After a bunch of sleepless nights and lots of stolen goods someone has a genius idea:

"Hey everyone, let's all pool our resources, build a big fence around our stuff and on a rotation-basis each night one or two of us patrol the perimeter and attack trespassers on sight"
