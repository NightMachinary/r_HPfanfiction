** It might help to clarify a little. Do you want a self-absorbed Harry who doesn't care about anyone but himself, do you want an apathetic Harry with no drive to do anything, do you want an indy!Harry rebelling against the plan who doesn't give a shit about Dumbledore or Magical British society, a Harry who is a Sherlockian-sociopath that doesn't care for societal mores, etc?

A character who doesn't care about anything at all isn't really all that interesting from a literature standpoint - characters don't do what they aren't motivated somehow to do - so I don't think you'll find any fics starring a Harry of such... broad apathy. Specifying might be the only way you'll get anything, if that's what you're looking for. Apologies.

*** Indy!harry tends to have a lot of bashing in it. I just want a apathetic and sherlockian-sociopath. Thanks.

** So he's severely depressed. He doesn't bathe, doesn't go to class, doesn't get out of bed.

The year Dumbledore had to drag Harry out of the cubbard to go to Hogwarts.

The year Harry stopped the attacks by talking to an enchanted diary and causing it severe depression.

The year Harry got rid of the dementors by talking to them.

The year Harry was entered into the Triwizard tournament and failed all the tasks due to not doing anything.

The year Voldemort captured Harry because he didn't win the Triwizard tournament and used his blood in his rebirth ritual.

The year Voldemort offed himself because Harry's blood passed on his extreme state of depression.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. After ten years in Azkaban Harry emerges a changed man. Enlightened and respectful, he is creature of magic full of disappointment and shame in his own race. And yet wielding power that none can match.
