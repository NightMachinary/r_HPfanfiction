I was reading The Son's Silence and the Serpent's Secret and the author just ruined it for me!!! I dislike stories that screw Severus' love for Lily (it's romantic damnit, stop demeaning by saying it's platonic) but to have him and James be involved is a just a gigantic HELL NO!!! Having Severus involved with any of the marauders is just weird and wrong on so many levels, they tormented him, why are people putting them in a romantic setting?!?!?

Don't get me wrong, I don't mind male/male pairings, but some just truly rub me the wrong way.

So what stories have done this to you?

** I don't remember the name of the fic and I don't want to. The idea was basically a Dramione set during HBP and DH, it was the usual Draco and Hermione learn to understand each other and fall in love. It was one of the best of this style, with realistic pacing going from "I hate you" to "I like you" with all the stages clearly explained. I really, really liked the story as for once it wasn't the "Draco was always in love" or "Hermione knew he was a victim all along" but rather started pretty much with hatred and contempt.

Then the story went into DH territory and one thing pointed its ugly head: Hermione was pregnant (she and Draco only made love once but of course it was enough). If the story had treated this subject realistically (as the difficult situation that it is) I would not have liked it but I would have kept reading... but no. I was the usual being pregnant at 16 is sooooo romantic... that was my cue, I lost two days of my life reading this.

For the last time, no it's not. Unless you're already settled a surprise pregancy is NEVER a good news. It may bring joy later, but it's not the "ray of light that you needed in a difficult life". Also Hermione discovered that in Grimmauld Pplace just before the start of the "camping trip" phase... and beside how "cuuuute" her situation was it had no consequences.

other things I hate: marriage law, I'll just left the word "implications" here.

Though there's the question of whether a “soul bond” has to mean love of whatever sort or any facsimile of it, or if it can actually be something else. Because I do remember having once read a story in which two characters did become soul-bound, which didn't really make them a couple but was instead a “both will die if one will” kind of thing and it was built around that thing.

#+begin_quote
  “but with the weird fixation some people have with pairings and romance as something ... sacred”
#+end_quote

The above quote clearly says that the fixation is about “pairings and romance”. Not about OTPs or any such things, but rather about romance, and pairings as something that is present because there is romance. Once again, it's not about OTPs; it's about people writing stories in which whatever character is infinitely unhappy because he or she has no boyfriend/girlfriend/harem/whatever, rinse and repeat for so many authors; it's about people putting romance as a part of life so far above everything else that it becomes hilarious in how pitiful it is and after some time ends up being just sad.

That's what I said (well, wrote actually). Nothing, and I repeat, *nothing*, about OTPs. Because I honestly couldn't care about OTPs and I don't even really have those; that people think that this-or-that pairing is better is their business, and it is no fixation in the context of my message; what is fixation is when people decide that pairings must exist no matter what, not that OTPs have to exist but rather that people have to form couples, whatever those couples happen to be.

********** I am not getting worked up. I apologise if I came across this way, my style of writing can be a bit weird that way but I was in no way getting emotional when writing the previous reply. Also, rather than being shouted, the bold parts are supposed to be read more slowly for emphasis; you know, the way it was before it became synonymous with shouting (why, I cannot fathom, but I'm not the expert on evolution of speech so I can just shrug there).

And from the very beginning I did not mean anything about OTPs or anything like that. That I became a bit more ... insistent in my reply, was because after explaining once and making it clear that I did not mean what you took it for, your reply was one in which you ... well, pretty much discarded what I wrote and decided that whatever I say I clearly meant what you think I meant, as far as my perspective of it goes, which can make one more insistent (or even more violent and vulgar, though now I am speaking in general as some people do tend to become crass if you do that).

As for the “pairings and romance” bit, it might imply it to you, but not to everyone. And I did already explain that no, this is not what I meant, after which you proceeded to say that yes, this is what I meant. To be honest, I'd say that it's a bit insulting but I really don't care because I'm used to people misunderstanding what I write due to the behind-the-time writing; it still makes it look like you don't really care what I write for as long as you have anything to say, which ... well, I'd say that it doesn't make you look good, but it's not my business to judge people whom I really don't know because a few messages convey pretty much nothing about a person without spending time on it.

Also, I will note that I am not getting worked up now either. Nor have I in any of the other messages. And I do note that ... well, pretty much because it appears that my style of writing makes me look that way to you when it is not the case and I really don't wish to waste time on being told to calm down when there's so much to write (mind you, I am not trying to be insulting here, it's just that my other attempts to write this particular sentence ended up being even more of a mess, so I went with the least stupid version; point is, I prefer not to have to repeat the same thing a few times when I can instead write it once and spend time reading something else or replying to something else). And yes, I do like writing long messages; this is not to torment you.

And I'll have Harry defend Ron against her on some occasions to make up for it.

The main character also dislikes Unicorns (vicious beasts), doesn't mean unicorns are evil in the story. This seemed like the best way to work around my own dislike for him.

I don't get why people get so upset by bashing though, Hermione is generally my favourite character yet I've read and enjoyed stories where she was bashed a lot. It's like inserting too many puns into your writing for me, it's not good writing but it can be amusing at times.

He was a /kid/ that had been taught his whole life that he was better than everyone else, that muggles and muggleborns were subhuman and that the return of Voldemort would bring back the glory days for people like him.

If you consider Pottermore canon:

#+begin_quote
  Draco's existence had been cloistered and protected until this point; he had been a privileged boy with little to trouble him, assured of his status in the world and with his head full of petty concerns. Now, with his father gone and his mother distraught and afraid, he had to assume a man's responsibilities.

  Worse was to come. Voldemort, seeking to punish Lucius Malfoy still further for the botched capture of Harry, demanded that Draco perform a task so difficult that he would almost certainly fail - and pay with his life.

  ...

  At this early stage, full of the desire for revenge and to return his father to Voldemort's favour, Draco barely comprehended what he was being asked to do. All he knew was that Dumbledore represented everything his imprisoned father disliked; Draco managed, quite easily, to convince himself that he, too, thought the world would be a better place without the Hogwarts Headmaster, around whom opposition to Voldemort had always rallied.

  In thrall to the idea of himself as a real Death Eater, Draco set off for Hogwarts with a burning sense of purpose. Gradually, however, as he found that his task was much more difficult than he had anticipated, and after he had come close to accidentally killing two other people instead of Dumbledore, Draco's nerve began to fail. With the threat of harm to his family and himself hanging over him, he began to crumble under the pressure. The ideas that Draco had about himself, and his place in the world, were disintegrating. All his life, he had idolised a father who advocated violence and was not afraid to use it himself, and now that his son discovered in himself a distaste for murder, he felt it to be a shameful failing. Even so, he could not free himself from his conditioning: he repeatedly refused the assistance of Severus Snape, because he was afraid that Snape would attempt to steal his ‘glory'.

  ...

  Even when faced with a weak and wandless Dumbledore, Draco found himself unable to deliver the coup de grâce because, in spite of himself, he was touched by Dumbledore's kindness and pity for his would-be killer.

  ...

  Draco's changed, yet still conflicted, personality revealed itself in his actions during the remainder of the war between Voldemort and those who were trying to stop him. Although Draco had still not rid himself of the hope of returning the family to their former high position, his inconveniently awakened conscience led him to try - half-heartedly, perhaps, but arguably as best he could in the circumstances - to save Harry from Voldemort when the former was captured and dragged to Malfoy Manor.

  ...

  The events of Draco's late teens forever changed his life. He had had the beliefs with which he had grown up challenged in the most frightening way: he had experienced terror and despair, seen his parents suffer for their allegiance, and had witnessed the crumbling of all that his family had believed in. People whom Draco had been raised, or else had learned, to hate, such as Dumbledore, had offered him help and kindness, and Harry Potter had given him his life. After the events of the second wizarding war, Lucius found his son as affectionate as ever, but refusing to follow the same old pure-blood line.

  Draco married the younger sister of a fellow Slytherin. Astoria Greengrass, who had gone through a similar (though less violent and frightening) conversion from pure-blood ideals to a more tolerant life view, was felt by Narcissa and Lucius to be something of a disappointment as a daughter-in-law. They had had high hopes of a girl whose family featured on the ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight', but as Astoria refused to raise their grandson Scorpius in the belief that Muggles were scum, family gatherings were often fraught with tension.

  *J.K. Rowling:*

  I pity Draco, just as I feel sorry for Dudley. Being raised by either the Malfoys or the Dursleys would be a very damaging experience, and Draco undergoes dreadful trials as a direct result of his family's misguided principles. However, the Malfoys do have a saving grace: they love each other. Draco is motivated quite as much by fear of something happening to his parents as to himself, while Narcissa risks everything when she lies to Voldemort at the end of Deathly Hallows and tells him that Harry is dead, merely so that she can get to her son.

  ...

  I have high hopes that he will raise Scorpius to be a much kinder and more tolerant Malfoy than he was in his own youth.

  Draco had many surnames before I settled on ‘Malfoy'. At various times in the earliest drafts he is Smart, Spinks or Spungen. His Christian name comes from a constellation - the dragon - and yet his wand core is of unicorn.

  This was symbolic. There is, after all - and at the risk of re-kindling unhealthy fantasies - some unextinguished good at the heart of Draco.

It is the definition of assisted murder. He is responsible for everything but the final blow. Without him that event would never have taken place.

As for the Pottermore stuff it essentially boils down to 'cool motive, still murder'.

Draco is racist and at best his redeemable qualities are that he feels guilty about not doing the bare minimum required to be a decent human being. Heck, his last words in canon are begging Death Eaters not to harm him because he's on there side, his last non-epilogue actions are trying to capture Harry for the Dark Lord.

I also think it's pretty telling that it's Astoria, not Draco, teaching their kids that muggleborns aren't scum.

No, but coming up with the plan and assisting in its execution was. Any (Muggle) court of law would find Draco guilty in an instant if they had all the facts we do: he attempted to kill Dumbledore several times, leading to the severe injury and almost-death of two people in the attempt, before finally succeeding. The fact that he wasn't the one to pull the trigger means he gets assisted murder and not murder, but it doesn't absolve him of all guilt.

Being brought up in a certain way doesn't excuse him. The law assumes the existence of free will, as do most moral systems. Further, duress cannot excuse murder, neither legally or morally. Being under duress might make his actions understandable, but they do not excuse them. Both the law and morality expects a person in that situation to die rather than kill another.

So, list of crimes:

Two counts of attempted murder on Albus Dumbledore (necklace, poison)

Attempted murder on Katie Bell (necklace, by transferred malice)

Attempted murder on Ron Weasley (posion, by transferred malice)

Conspiracy to commit murder on Albus Dumbledore (helping Snape kill him)

Grievous bodily harm on Katie Bell (necklace)

Assisted grievous bodily harm on Bill Weasley (Fenrir Greyback attack)

Treason

Terrorism

Crimes Against Humanity/War crimes

A good majority of these were committed after reaching adulthood. Further, the earlier ones he was still old enough to be tried as an adult under English law anyway.

This isn't even really a narrow thing. If Draco Malfoy stood trial in an English criminal court, he would receive multiple life sentences. He's not a misled boy, he's cruel and evil.

You say that he's capable of change, but you should remember that Draco's a coward, and will ultimately do what's best for him, even if he hates himself for it. Even at the end of DH, he was willing to capture Harry to redeem himself and his family in the eyes of Voldemort, and he was supporting the Death Eaters even after Harry saved his life.

Do I think that Draco would remain the same petty bully and rascist shit he was before the war for the rest of his life, even after all that he's witnessed and experienced? I don't think so, so in that way he's capable of change. On the other hand I do think he would once again commit those sort of crimes if his life was at stake again, because he's a coward at heart, and he would once again take the cowardly way out, even if he hates himself for it.

He reminds me a lot of Peter Pettigrew, really. More loyal to his friends/family perhaps, but no loyalty to principles.

However, in the later books we get such real-world political allegory (the arrest of Stan Shunpike, for example) that Voldemort seems too repugnant to gain traction.

When I think about what allowed him to come to power and have so many sympathizers, I assume his movement must have had better veneer at least initially. He clearly shares traits with some famous fascists, who appealed to a nationalist sense of culture.

To me, at a certain point: the blood purity agenda isn't explained well enough. Why do Snape and Voldemort commit to it? Did Voldemort have anything else on his political agenda.

I really like a fic that goes into what else might be motivating people (normal people) and Snape to sympathize with the Death Eaters--without excusing their actions or beliefs. One like it is Spellcaster by SGCbearcub.

I get what you're saying though. Even if we fans fill in the gaps Rowling left by making part of the D.E. agenda preserving wizarding culture from muggle influences, the Malfoy's are racist bigots in cannon, and that addition to Voldemort's agenda shouldn't be used to redeem them because they're "cunts".

**** Depends what you mean by "superior".

Wizards are superior in abilities, sure, but in human worth? Whatever it is that makes human life and liberty valuable, Muggles surely have it in equal amounts, which means racism against them is /not/ justified. You can exclude them from your private club on the basis that they lack the qualification to enter it, but you can't justify treating them as of lower moral worth.

To hold otherwise is to say that a person's worth depends on their abilities. That's a difficult moral position to maintain, and dangerous besides. For a start, it applies between individuals, not just between groups. Further, it also applies to the group attempting to look down on another group - if wizards can treat Muggles as having less worth than wizards, then any species superior to wizards in abilities can justifiably treat wizards as inferior in worth to them.

Not really. The only way to determine the order of abilities is with human subjective biases. Why does ability with magic mean a person has greater moral worth than someone with musical ability? The idea that magic > music can only be arrived at through (bad) human ethical reasoning.

If you're referring to evolution and Darwinism, then the position works even less, because evolution is at work in the world and Muggles are the result. Evolution doesn't select for the strongest organism, it selects for the most adapted one. By definition, if you attribute moral value to the results of evolution, then Muggles have moral worth. (As do all other species, also the result of evolution).

While there won't be any muggle guns brought into the war, or muggle soldiers and such, culturally there will be some influence. Humans tend to assimilate stuff from other cultures all the time. Often as a passing fad, sometimes, like manga/anime and many formerly exotic dishes, as a permanent addition.

Of course it'll be limited though. Muggle clothes are at best inspirations for magical versions since they simply can't compare to enchanted garments. Pens and other tools face a similar hurdle - in this world, unlike in canon, most important tools are enchanted. If you're writing with quills, fountain pens will quickly replace them beacuse they are far, far superiour. If you're writing with an enchanted, everfull, eversharp auto-correcting quill that can also write down what you say, a pen is an amusing toy, nothing more. There's not much in Patron's muggle world that is superiour to their magic counterpart.

Given that the only thing stopping characters from having sex in, say, 5th year in /Patron/ is social convention, it just comes across as odd that they keep specifically thinking/talking about, once per chapter, "Year of Discovery" in specific as a shorthand for sex. Hermione's worried about girls coming on to Harry for casual encounters in the "Year of Discovery"? Good thing she doesn't need to worry about that in "The Year Before the Year of Discovery", then, since of course no teenager would ever violate an unofficial social convention.

And as a muggle raised/born trying to fit in, the pressure's stronger.

And while I am not about to write a graphic sex scene, sex is a thing teenagers worry about a lot - should I sleep with my boyfriend? What if he leaves me if I don't do it? Should I wait until marriage? Does he cheat on me? What if he asks me to do something weird? Will I be able to satisfy her? What if I can't? What if I make a mistake? What if I am too little? Does she cheat on me? What if she finds someone else, who pleases her more? And so on.

In a story where the relationship between a teenage couple is a major plot point, sex, or at least thinking and talking about sex, will be common. Especially if they talk about their relationship, or think about it. It's like complaining about Harry thinking and talking about his broom "way too much" in a story where Quidditch plays a major role - some stuff simply goes together.

Sorry if I don't write entire scenes how they do homework, and write essays, or listen to a lesson in school - but those moments do not matter much for the story.

Same goes for the narrative viewpoints - if someone really misses that Draco sees mudbloods and Hermione sees muggleborn, then that's really not fault. Some people want to take offense at anything, and will see stuff that isn't there.

Okay, that I agree with. That's obvious.

It's more like that Harry and Hermione's, due to having been raised in muggle Britain, and having Sirius as their closest adult wizard and guardian, have slightly off ideas about year 6. Sirius hasn't been magically cured of the effects of 12 years in Azkaban, and he was one of the more extreme 6th years.

** I can't remember who mentioned it (I /think/ it was [[/u/NedryOS]]), but someone once said that just seeing the word "wards" in a fic throws a small handful of people into hysterics.

I'm one of those people.

Just as a previous traumatic experience might develop into a phobia, everything that often comes with the word "ward(s)" is the reason why I catch feelings when I see it. That usually includes:

- Arithmancy and the runic alphabet (almost always Norse/Egyptian) being used primarily (sometimes even solely) for enchanting objects/making these "wards", with either no explanation as to how it works or nine-thousand-and-one paragraphs of oddly placed exposition

- vice versa, Arithmancy and Ancient Runes classes at Hogwarts essentially becoming Enchanting 101

- Magical cores, and how having one that's large/full enough can overload the "wards"

- said "wards" are usually just a huge Shield Charm which are occasionally powered by "blood" and stuff, and therefore not very interesting.

EDIT: It's easy enough to go through fics that have this, but it's definitely an amber flag.

****** Oddly enough, I just remembered another reason - one that's really niggling but I always forget to mention.

Quite often, if wards are just the term for protective enchantments in-universe and encompass a wide array of techniques and methods, then I'm cool with that (even more than cool). It's when wards become Wards, i.e. "Warding" is a distinct branch of magic from Charms, Transfiguration etc. but still uses "Runes and Arithmancy" (which then become bread-and-butter disciplines even if it isn't an AU) to function.

This might be someone else's cup of tea, but it isn't everyone's. Maybe it's me being pedantic (it almost certainly is) but it just doesn't rub me the right way at all.

******** I'm with you, but I also see the parallel of Hermione taking courses that most students consider 'harder than would be useful in my life after school'. Such was advanced mathematics and computer programming back in the day. Of course, plenty of students felt the same way about the 'shop' classes like woodworking, auto repair and Home Economics (a.k.a. how to cook, sew and keep a budget).

For my headcanon, Runes are used to sustain charms which would otherwise fade. This aspect is taught in NEWT level Charms class. /Ancient/ Runes is the study of the evolution of rune-use in enchantment. Kinda like learning FORTRAN and Pascal to understand how these things were used to build up to Python, Ruby or whatever. Not necessary but instructive, and in the case of tomb-raiding a key skill- you can't ask a modern programmer to do anything in an AS400 system or with the truly ancient punch-card systems, but if the systems were still out there and protecting valuable data, people would still study them.

Arithmancy is a little more obscure- it relates to Qabbalist numerology which has much less to do with mathematics than with Astrology- much of it is about predicting the character and destiny of a person based upon the significant numbers in their life and how they add and subtract. For headcanon purposes, I see it as a way to understand complex spell interactions- like when a bunch of the DA folk shot spells at Draco and his goons, the effects were not simply cumulative but interactive. Somehow, this could be understood with Arithmancy. It still depends more on the symbolic meaning of the numbers rather than their mathematical meaning.

Pretty much all of what you wrote, but especially this.

In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome), I've written enchanting items through sigils as a widespread practice due to the difficulty and expense of learning wand magic. Runes themselves aren't crucial, but supplementary to the universally understood symbols which recur in wand magic, potions, astronomy etc. depending on one's general school of thought.

Arithmancy can and would be often employed in conjunction with bog-standard magical theory, but it would be used to conclude that adding a second porcupine quill to the brew would ensure flexibility of property x when adding element B (because pragmatism is a magical property of the number 2), rather than just making it twice as strong. But it's an AU, so it's headfanon if anything.

It is reasonable given his own past for this to be a catalyst for him to see past the appearance to the person. And since Snape is, when not busy being an embittered childish asshole, a very interesting character with a lot of depth.

Given the way the story was going: not too hard on the tropes, a reasonably intriguing premise, characters that are at least moderately as they are in canon...it broke my heart that they pulled that bullshit.

*** I like it when they make it reasonable. Though I like adoption too. What Makes A Family by Stump Pan had Harry as James and Lily' child, but only James died. Snape and Lily mend their relationship and Remus, Sirius, and Severus grow up in a reasonable fashion. I like it. Sure it might be ooc but I like the mature versions.

I liked this one until Snape wasn't in love with Lily romantically (if I remember correctly) and he's gay, having a thing for Remus.......ugh, the concept was great till that tripe came barfing up.

** Hmm ... I don't remember the story right now, but it was one of the many “whatever character from other series adopts Harry for this-or-that reason, and then things change in whatever way because of it” stories, and what it did to me was having Hedwig named ... Hedwig.

Thing is, Hedwig was named the way she was because Harry had no idea how to name her and then decided to use a name he'd found in one of the books. For another character entirely, one who grew up in another culture (not on Earth, even) and had no reason to give this particular name to anything, let alone get this one specific owl and name this bird that, that's just terrible rail-roading. And yes, it's not even really a bad example of it, but after seeing so many stories where terrible stupidity and stupid terribleness were paired with rail-roading, it just left a distaste that wouldn't disappear and /that/ was /it/.

*** I think for things like that you just need to separate the fic from canon mentally. Think of it like this, Hedwig is a character in Harry Potter. So logically she will appear in a Harry Potter fanfiction and how that happens is just up to the author.

In the same way linkffn(reign of the serpent) has a complete AU where Slytherin is still alive and rules Britain the headmaster is Tom Riddle, leader of the feared Death Eater Squad who helped fight in the ongoing war against the terrorist Order of the Phoenix and great European threat Grindlewald. There's absolutely no reason for any of those characters to appear, but they do because it's fanfiction.

**** Separating canon from a derivative story is one thing; I've read and enjoyed many a story where canon was treated as nothing more than a loose guideline and the whole thing quickly went massively AU.

What irks me is not a story being AU, but blatant and unnecessary rail-roading that stinks of laziness and makes me expect the quality of anything from that point onwards to crash through the floor and continue falling.

And names ... honestly, I might be weird as far as that is concerned, but for me names are ... not really that important. Maybe it would have been different had people used just one name to call me, but since they don't (and I'm not talking just about variants) and I got used to names not being “sacred” or “unchanging”, they're just not an exception from the whole “when things are changed, there are changes” thing and leaving them the same without any explanation for it when there clearly is a reason to change them is still something I perceive as rail-roading.

A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight.

#+begin_quote
  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  #+begin_example
      When starting this, please keep in mind that A Year Like None Other was started long before HBP came out\. It was always my intention to write an alternate 6th year and when the canon Year 6 was published, it meant that my own little saga seriously diverged from canon\. So reading this, imagine that Years 1\-5 did occur, but nothing we discover from HBP and DH is necessarily true this time around\.The most important divergences are these: In this universe, Snape \*is\* a pureblood and his father's name was Hostilian \(which tells you a lot all by itself\)\. Dumbledore never died \-\- and certainly not at Snape's hand\!   This story is completely finished and is about 760,000 words long\. It took me a while to get it all posted here at AO3, but I am very happy to report that the whole thing is now online for your \(hopefully\) intense enjoyment\!And now, on with the show, which begins with A Year Like None Other \(completed\), continues on into A Summer Like None Other \(also completed\) and wraps up with A Family Like None Other, a Year 7 novel that I am still writing\.

**** Actually, portraying the conflict between the muggle/magical worlds was one of the story's strong points. It's actually snowballing into what looks to be a cold war between the two worlds as of the latest chapter.

Yes, Harry has an incredibly biased viewpoint at first, but remember that he is being spoonfed information by one side only, and the Order's actions don't exactly help things in that regard. What else is he supposed to believe? His viewpoint becomes much more nuanced once he has access to the wizarding side of things.

The story gets much, much better around the part where you ditched it, so I'd recommend picking it up again if you're interested.

** Yeah, I've had this happen...there's several peeves (some only concern Harry Potter - others though concern other fanfiction and works of original fiction, too) I have and a lot of authors don't warn you - probably because they don't think that writing about certain things is just a no-go for certain people (that's why I love sites that use tags for that sort of thing, so that you can avoid your peeves, though such a system is not a guarantee, as writers can change their stories or continue them differently (sometimes they haven't even completed the plot when they start writing))

For me, some of those peeves involve (not a complete list, I'd be here for a rather long time if I wanted to list all my peeves about Harry Potter alone!):

- Slash (with characters that have a stated sexual preference or just - IMHO - don't fit together, like Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy or Severus Snape, Lucius Malfoy or - even worse IMHO - Tom Riddle aka Voldemort...come on the guy killed his parents, Harry wouldn't touch him with a ten foot pole!)

- pregnancy (particularly in school - damned, teenage-pregnancy should be avoided at all costs, not encouraged with stupid stories -.- not to mention that as someone who identifies as "childfree" (meaning I just don't want to have children, at all!) normally doesn't like reading about babies (I know, I am strange, I read fiction intended for teenagers but I don't like children...), not to mention that a pregnancy changes everything...hell, it can totally ruin a character (like Katniss from "The Hunger Games" who never wanted children and even hooked up with the "wrong guy" (my opinion!) in the end or Sonea from "The black magicians guild" -.-)

- male-pregnancy (ties in with Slash)...not only is that IMPOSSIBLE (unless the "male" in question has had an incomplete sex-change or something like that, as normal males (at least of the human species) don't get preggers!)

- mary-sues (Oh, I like reading about god-like characters, but even those should make at least some mistakes (someone who doesn't is no joy to read about!))

- total change of universe (I like alternate universes, changes to characters (as long as it's not the sexual orientation) etc. but I don't like it if people change the premises, like putting the Harry Potter characters in our world and magic not existing or say writing a Twilight fanfiction without any vampires in it -.- ("all human")...)

- using an interesting ability/plot-device and then later totally forgetting about it (writers of original fiction do this, too...plotholes anyone? -.-), even if it would be a damned good solution for a problem (yes, it can happen...but explaining why it does or why it wouldn't work is always better (like say: Harry remembers the mirror to speak with Sirius in HP, but the mirror is broken...the other thing, that he doesn't seem to remember, is just plain bad writing!)

- total stupidity of a character (or several), just because it serves the plot -.-

**** I don't agree - Peeta was just the safe choice (come on, the guy is plain boring and unremarkable, while she is damned exciting and capable and - IMHO - special (as in: I'd love to go on a date with her!)), it could/should have been anyone else if she couldn't stand Gale anymore :( (Peeta is like a fallback point, a safe position...sure he loves her, but IMHO he doesn't deserve her (because compared to her he's just an average jock IMHO)...and it's bad enough she's using him (at least that's what I think) like that, just because she knows he will make for an obedient hubby -.- (come on, she needs someone who can stand up to her - which IMHO he can't, no I am not saying he is totally whipped, but he isn't a very dominant person either))

Yeah, Prim...I never understood why she thinks her sister is that special (but maybe I am just a coldhearted asshole, as I don't know any people I would be willing to put my life on the line for - not even my last GF who I was (IMHO) very much in love with (I'd have done a lot for her, but not sacrifice myself!))

Oh and independent women (she's a great example IMHO) with children are just another peeve of mine (I don't think she only didn't want kids because of the circumstances - to me it sounded like she didn't like kids, so it's kind of a 180 for me that she has kids now!)
