Lately I've been rewatching the Avengers movies and I realised that I haven't read an Hp/Avenger fic in a while. Any recommendations?

  Hat Kid was a simple girl, finding her way back home with all Time Pieces in hand. But a nearby planet had other plans for her. Join Hat Kid as she journeys through a new world. Making new friends and enemies, exploring new places, and trying on new hats. Rated T just in case. Basically a narration of the game, but with some extra details to add a bit more to the story.

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.
