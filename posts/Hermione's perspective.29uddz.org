Just like the title says... any good fanfics from Hermione's point of view? I want ones where they are still at hogwarts or during the search for Horcruxes.

Thanks!

Voldemort has launched an all out war on the Wizarding World, and has taken the Boy Who Lived. But he has not reckoned on the resourcefulness of Hermione Granger. HHr developing in a sort of postapocalyptic environment.

Rated: Fiction T - English - Angst - Hermione G., Harry P. - Chapters: 28 - Words: 269,062 - Reviews: 359 - Favs: 371 - Follows: 161 - Updated: Feb 8, 2009 - Published: Jan 10, 2006 - Status: Complete - id: 2746577

It earns its 'Angst' category but this is a high-tension action-suspense story to the bittersweet end. Some interesting uses of magic and no real bashing, though it starts with canon relationships and veers off for very practical and human reasons.

** Off the top of my head, here are some fics that are mostly in Hermione's perspective, Hogwarts years category, that I've enjoyed or am enjoying:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]] by AlphaEph19 (Point of view shared with Harry, but mostly Hermione for now.)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]] by jacobk (Mostly Hermione, with an occasional scene from others' points perspective.)

- [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]] by Couldson Eagle

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] by White Squirrel (It sticks to canon rails a bit too much, early on, but it's diverged quite a bit in recent chapters.)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9323348/1/For-The-Only-Hope][For The Only Hope]] by ausland (Same problem with canon rails until the most recent chapters, and it's SS/HG albeit after years of accelerated aging from using a Time-Turner, but Hermione still has a personality, so it works.)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9767794/1/Hermione-Granger-The-Witching-Hour][Hermione Granger: The Witching Hour]] by Temairine, for the obligatory Video Game fic.

Other than that,

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036056/1/Granger-Verse][Granger Verse]] series of one-shots by jeanne.summers, which may well be too much of a good thing.

*** For some reason, I had completely blanked on two more fics, these involving sending information back through time:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127137/1/Palimpsest][Palimpsest]] by Larry Huss: Future!Hermione sends a telegram back through time. Recommended without reservation. Just updated, as it happens.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5724097/1/Kick-in-the-arse-of-the-Wizarding-World][Kick in the Arse of the Wizarding World]] by Alrissa: Also Hermione sending a stuff to her past self, maybe a little too much of a good thing, but a very fun read, branching out in interesting ways.

** There's a few! [[http://web.student.tuwien.ac.at/%7Ee0226430/hermione/hgps0.html][Hermione Granger and The Philosopher's Stone]] [[http://web.student.tuwien.ac.at/%7Ee0226430/hermione/hgcos0.html][Hermione Granger and the Chamber of Secrets]], I think it's unfinished.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=661&chapno=1][This one]] would probably count too!

I dunno anything that's 100% canon and from her POV in the later years. There're a few SSHG fics that are "DH-compliant" and have her point of view during the horcrux hunt, but you probably aren't looking for her to get with Snape at the end, so. Yeah.
