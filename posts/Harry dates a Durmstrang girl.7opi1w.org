Because the "Harry dates a Slytherin girl" scenario was fun for a while, but it's also starting to feel a bit old and repetitive by now. Let's see something new. Let's see Harry falling head over heels for a Durmstrang girl who's visiting during the Triwizard Tournament. Let's see him immersing himself in Russian or Scandinavian culture as he travels to visit her at her home. Hell, even if it's just a random hookup with no relationship, it would be a nice change of pace. Just show me what's out there!

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

**** It is considered one of the better fics by many in the community. It's sadly abandoned, though there are 4(?) additional chapters on the DLP works by author section.

** That reminds me, a story with a character (perhaps an original 40 that JKR did not use?) from another country could provide a different POV. Commentary on different magical culture, different government, etc.

I think Hiver's SI was from Sweden, but it wasn't much of a plot point.

*** I've done some digging, and while Harry / Durmstrang girl remains rare, there /are/ a few Draco / Durmstrang girl fics out there, all with fairly similar titles: "Durmstrang Girl", "The Girl From Durmstrang", "The Only Girl in Durmstrang".

  This story takes place in Harry's fourth year. In the shoes of a Durmstrang student who was dropped off at Igor Karkaroff's office door step. The student's past is unknown. Why was it left there? Who left it there? Oh, did I mention she's a girl? DM&OC

  V Krum has an overly dramatic shadow, chronic elbower of the people. /They were fooling themselves,they could never be. Same on the inside;full of secrets,deceitful,people-pleasers. Polar opposites on the outside. Parallel story to The Goblet of Fire. Look on what the rest of the students did during tournament, scoop on Durm. Draco & OC (First few chapters is Quidditch World Cup)
