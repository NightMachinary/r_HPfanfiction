*/[A concept I'm currently writing, made vague enough that you can go wherever you like with it.]/*

/The International Confederation of Wizards: Abstruse Magics Division is for magical artifacts, beings and phenomena that defy explanation or magical logic. E.g. spells that defy the established laws of magic./

/Many an item, spell or being is locked away for study or containment within facilities around the globe. Ranging from mundane and fascinating to world ending terror./

/Facility 22 is an unmarked location only the higher echelons of the Division is aware of. The facility itself was built around a site where the ICW were previously containing a [REDACTED] long before the establishment of the Division./

/Though the facility itself has been updated to take into account modern methods of sealing, warding and protection, it houses one of the oldest threats the ICW has ever faced, ancient magicks already in place long before further protections were implemented./

/In an attempted update to the security (in which a new warding scheme was to introduced to strengthen the pre-exisiting protections) a "Cascade Sequence Failure" occured within the present wards that unleashes its contents on the unsuspecting staff./

/Though the ICW's backup protocols kick in (sealing the entity within the facility) and they go so far as to outsource immediate security solutions to top level Gringotts warders, not even they can stop it's inevitable escape.../

I think my inspirations are pretty clear...
