** Don't let a silly name put you off reading the fic! I mean, it's just a name...the fic might be good?

I'm currently reading a fic where Hermione has severe nerve damage and the only cure is to rub Snape's semen all over herself. Seriously. If there's a good time to stop reading a fic, it's now...

What's in a name? ¯_(ツ)_/¯

*** Desert Sea? I almost didn't read that story cause it sounded ridiculous but read it in the end cause I love the author. Ended up really enjoying that story! :)

**** Yep! I was sooo disappointed when the story took that ludicrous turn, I had to put my phone down for a whole ten minutes. But, like you, I love this author, so I'm persevering with this complete nonsense...

#+begin_quote
  Hermione is afflicted by a curse. Her hyper-attuned senses mean that the entire world overwhelms her. She returns to Hogwarts in the hope that it can be the haven she needs. But she finds that it provides far more than she ever expected.

*** I'm sure I'll go back to it. But not immediately. It just betrays such poor taste. At least in comedy. If it were a humor story I'd delete any trace of it from my history.

** I see where you're coming from, but like all tropes/cliches it can be done well. For example at the end of the Changeling (or maybe it's the beginning of the sequel, idk) the author uses it in one of the most emotional scenes I've read.

Tropes can be tiresome but I won't discourage writers from using them because when they are used correctly (usually this means using the reader's knowledge of the cliche to invoke extra meaning into the words which would otherwise not be there without the cliche) they can be powerful.
