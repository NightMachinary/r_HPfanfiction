#+TITLE: Salazar actually built the chamber of secrets because he was in love with Godric and they needed somewhere to meet in secret. The whole Slytherin vs. Gryffindor rivalry was a hoax to hide their relationship because people wouldn't accept it back then so it would be bad publicity for Hogwarts.

Tom Riddle was really confused when he was exploring the chamber. He was expecting to find Grimoires full of dark powerful spells. Instead he found diaries about their love story, and their pet Basilic.

Well at least he could put the Basilic to some use.


** Salazar's idea of getting a Basilisk actually came out of a time Godric told him that the couldn't wait to see that snake of his in the chamber, and Salazar misunderstood.

** "I still don't think you should've pretended to be racist to hide our relationship. People look up to you, Sal!" said Godric, for what must have been the fifth time. "They'll imitate you!"

"Do you question my cunning, Goddie?" Slalazar flounced in his black robes. "In but a few years of magical children of all backgrounds attending Hogwarts together, blood prejudice will be a thing of the past. And even if anyone remembers my purported views on the subject, it'll do them good to think that even their idol had flaws---it helps with critical thinking. I shall slay two doxies with one spell!"
