**** "As Dumbledore ended his sentence, Harry's knee was shooting up between the headmaster's legs. Dumbledore went down moaning in pain at the hit he had sustained.“How's that for the Greater Good?” Harry asked.Dumbledore narrowed his eyes through the pain and was about to draw his wand when Harry drew his own wand at lightning speed. A stunner hit Dumbledore before he could even blink and Harry's wand was back in its holster." This is first year Harry btw, lol.

** In Not the Only Redhead Harry basically screams like a toddler throughout the entire story. There was a good 50 chapters where every time he'd see a few specific characters he'd tell them either fuck off or pick a fight. Then 75% of the way through fucking aliens showed up and I bailed.

*** I bailed from that one on the second chapter. It's even more annoying to read than a Dark!Harry story I read a while back which was 320k words long with 1-3k words a chapter. To this day I have a fear of long stories with short chapters.

** In Harry and Susan, Dumbledore is pissed off at Harry for wanting to stay with Amelia and Susan Bones, so Dumbles tries to stop Harry. Harry kicks Dumbledore in the nuts and Dumbasador squeals like a baby. And while squealing like a baby, he deflects a stunner from an Auror.

When I finished reading that chapter I was like "what the fuck is this"

Not to mention Harry and Susan snogged in the story and they were first years. I lol'd so hard at Amelia's reaction.

***** He uses Muggle in a derogatory way in that chapter, which is a little worse than his temper problems. Hagrid is loyal and brave, but also thoughtless, dismissive, a drunkard, dangerous for the students, aggressive with a hair trigger temper and a really bad teacher.

******* It has been a while, so i'm mostly remembering the impression he left and not specific scenes, but i'll try.

He was drunk when he exchanged information about Fluffy for a dragon's egg, his hut was smelling of firewhiskey when Hermione, Harry and Ron visited him at least once, he was absolutely wasted at Aragog's funeral - Who, btw, tried to murder Harry because Hagrid gives /bad/ advice - and i think Draco mentions he has a reputation based on his drinking habit.

Edit: Checked the wiki, there are also mentions of Hagrid spending the night Buckbeak escaped celebrating by getting drunk and him drunkenly kissing Minerva.

And he goes for a 'little pick-me-up' when Harry gets his robes.

******** Clarification accepted. Most of these I would say are very specific. Sounds like he just doesn't know how to control himself when he's celebrating or mourning. Which.. given his other flaws isn't surprising. But yeah.. the fluffy thing and the hut smelling like booze are harder to justify.

Yeah..."follow the spiders". I'm sure there were no psychological scars from that little endeavor.
