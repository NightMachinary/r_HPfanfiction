The world is breaking; war and technology are pushing on the edge of the unbelievable, and S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately attempts to keep the peace. The soldier and the scientist are not the only lights that push back against the darkness, however; magic will encompass the world again as the last wizard makes himself known.

*** No love for I See The Moon or Great Expectations?

Definitely seconding Strangers In Bars, Chance Encounters and Finding Home. Rest is at least decent too.

EDIT:

Second arc of this one is definitely inferior so far to the first one though. ):

**** I forgot about 'I See The Moon' because it hasn't been updated in a while. My bad. I haven't read 'Great Expectations', though. I shall correct that error at once. Thanks for the recommendation.

** Also worthy, but not an action story at all:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8410168/1/Steve-And-The-Barkeep][Steve and the Barkeep]] by RunawayDeviant

Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.
