I've now posted reviews for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ariaxa/fic_review_seventh_horcrux_by_emerald_ashes_the/][Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/alm4hi/fic_review_the_changeling_by_annnerb_aka_the/][The Changeling by annerb]], and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/amwz6w/fic_review_turn_by_saras_girl_an/][Turn by saras_girl]].

If there is a fic you would like to see a review done for, please leave a comment. I'll read and review whichever fic gets the highest recommendation. They can be any genre, any pairing, and any rating.

​

Please ensure they are:

- Completed

- Standalone, as in I don't have to have read long sequels or prequels for context

- Preferably not centred around Cursed Child. I more or less know the plot, but I have not read the screenplay or seen the play, nor do I intend to.

Everything else is fair game.

** Limpieza De Sangre or Vitam Paramus because I'm biased as hell, right [[/u/rpeh]]?

*** I think your magnum opus, Letters, is far more suited for an in-depth review.

*** Well by virtue of being the first responder, I'll read and review yours. I just got a look at the word count though, and it's huge, so this might be a little while.

** I loved this series. It has multiple books - that are short. I'd be interested in another perspective on it.

This is a six book series each about 60-80K words each. DO NOT READ THIS SERIES IF YOU ARE NOT TWISTED. This isn't dark. It isn't cringey, it isn't a damn Dark Lord Potter. Everytime you think the series has hit a low, you will find yourself giggling with joy at the new heights (depths?) It has reached. I have never given a warning for a story. I was introduced to this story by the recommender being incapable of finishing it.

Imagine a warning I could give. That's the warning for this. The only depth it didn't reach to was with single digits ages which was probably due to no chances arising. I give this story a standing ovation

*** So I only ended up getting two responses to this. I'll read the first request first (A Black Comedy), then I'll do yours. May take a while though - A Black Comedy is more than twice the length of Seventh Horcrux.

*** Well, I just finished this. Holy shit. I think I may need to cleanse myself with some Disney just to feel less depressed for a while before I write the review.

**** It's super dark, but it is still amazing. Even the annoying grammar issue of not adding periods at the end of a quotation mark sentence isn't enough to offset the story.

It isn't edgy. It isn't cringey. All of what would normally be edgy or cringey has consequences. When Harry kills Sirius, it isn't some edgelord shit. He is seriously fucked up. We see exactly how badly it destroys him. It feels real.

***** This is true. And I'll be writing a pretty long, rounded review. Since you seem to know it pretty well though, could you help me with a detail I think I may have missed? What happened to the diary horcrux? The staff and Harry destroyed the basilisk, but Ginny was never implicated because they never found out who had caused the attacks, which would imply that Ginny kept possession of the diary. However, she doesn't seem to have it anymore after that, and Neville, Ron and Hermione are killed trying to track it down. Did I miss a detail in there which put the diary back in Voldemort's possession?

****** I'm not sure. The last I remember it being mentioned is Voldemort speaking to Lucius about him losing it. I don't remember it being retrieved, so I would assume Dumbledore has destroyed it given Ginny is very much aware that it was Tom Riddle possessing her. I'll tell you if it is mentioned later in the final book.

****** I can't find anything mentioning it really. There is a mention of Voldemort taking a book down into Azkaban, but that was just a trap. I have no clue.
