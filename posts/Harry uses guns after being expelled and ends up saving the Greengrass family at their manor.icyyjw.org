I can't remember what this is called and I've spent a little while these last could of days looking around for it, I don't remember if it's a Harry/Daphne fic or not but I know she's in it (obviously as he saves her family) if anyone can help me out it'll be much appreciated.


** In this fic harry isn't expelled but he leaves Hogwarts [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6965311/1/]]

*** That's the one, thank you. A friend of mine has been asking for suggestions for stories to read and I just could not remember for the life of me the title of this one. Thanks again. :)
