I really want to read a fic where Luna ends up in the world of pokemon and just has a massive blast cuddleing/ahem/ collecting! All the wonderful pokemons she finds! Anything like that out there?

*** This sadly seems more to be a story where Pokemon already exist in the hp world, and then there is no reason for Luna to go crazy over them. :(
