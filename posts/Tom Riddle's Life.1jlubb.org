Are there any fics out there that chronicle Tom Riddle's teenage years in Hogwarts? I prefer novel length, but well written one-shots would be great as well.

Thanks in advance.


** It's not quite what you're after, perhaps, but [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/3/Fate-s-Favourite][Fate's Favourite]] by The Fictionist has a teenaged Tom Riddle in Hogwarts. Granted, he's time-traveled forward to Harry's time...

#+begin_quote
  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if thing's went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?
