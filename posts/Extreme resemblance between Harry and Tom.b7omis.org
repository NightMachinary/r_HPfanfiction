** Not exactly the prompt but linkffn(a cadmean victory) has Harry borrow the fake charming smile and its rather unnerving for some of the old teacher. It's not a big plot point or anything but it's there.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming) does that I think, but I couldn't finish it so I am not sure how much their resemblance is explored later on.

**** It gets really messed up man. Especially near the end of his 5th year. There are whole chapters dedicated to brutally torturing some characters in the most screwed up ways. I ended up having to skip some of the portions because it was actually sickening. Also the series as a whole is just depressing to read without any real uplifting/light hearted parts. Easily the most fucked up fic I've read by a huge margin.

There are some killer worldbuilding ideas in there though, especially starting around book 5, and the sequel is A1. So good. Especially if you've read his other fic.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7265374/1/Seeing-the-truth][Seeing the Truth]] Harry is unconvinced by people always claiming that he is like his father. Instead, he begins to panic over the realization that he resembles Tom Riddle more and more every year. linkffn(7265374)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]] has Harry's personality gradually change to be more like Tom Riddle due to the Horcrux connection giving him some of Tom's memories. linkffn(3688693)

In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13893606/chapters/31970736][souls touch, and the future changes]] Harry's personality is altered from childhood due to the unforseen consequences of Dumbledore ripping the Horcrux out of him. linkao3(13893606)

  Harry was always reminded of how similar he was with Voldemort's former self and when he didn't, others somehow made sure to remind him. What he can't understand though is why? At least he's about to find out.

  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller
