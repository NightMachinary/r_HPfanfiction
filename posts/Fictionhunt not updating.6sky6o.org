So I noticed that Fictionhunt.com is not updating. I hasn't updated since 8/6/17. Is there any news about this?

I emailed the webmaster, but I got no replied (automated or otherwise), and I don't know if their is a social media page that I can access for updates.


** I haven't noticed anything wrong. The front page has stories updated as recently as this morning on it.
