** linkffn(Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm). The story has a less than stable group consisting of Harry, Hermonie, Luna and Neville.

Edit: Yeah i somehow screwed it up, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope=][here you go.]]

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

*** I recently read Control, it is an incredibly good story, I wish there were more like it. Almost all other Dark!Harry or Evil!Harry fails to actually provide a good story and is instead about Harry doing amoral things.

Also one of my favorite things about the story was Tracey Davis, holy shit the characterization and interaction was wonderful. I'd read 500k words of just dialog between her, Daphne and Harry.

** linkffn(Seventh Horcrux)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106][A second link in case the command doesn't work]]

It might be a crackfic but it's definitely an insane Harry story. The idea behind it is that when Voldemort turned Harry into a horcrux the horcrux took over Harry's mind and assumed control.

Edit: Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] is a really good one. It fits what you're looking for perfectly. Idea behind it is that Harry gets voluntarily possessed by a fallen angel at age 8ish and escapes the Dursleys. It's a really great read. It's sequels aren't as good imo, but they're still worth reading. It's sequels are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3856581/1/The-Denarian-Knight][The Denarian Knight]] and the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4359957/1/The-Denarian-Lord][Denarian Lord]]. All of them are crossovers with the Dresden Files, but you don't need any knowledge about that to enjoy the stories and know what's going on.

**** Also there is a quote in this story I can't remember specifically, maybe someone can help. I think its when Ginny is filling in for Ron at some point and she says she isn't inferior to her brothers and Harry says 'See she already knows her lines' or something to that effect.

  Three years ago he was wrongfully sent to Azkaban. Now something has happened. Something that has placed the power of a god into the hands of a man that's half insane. A man who wants revenge. The question now is; who's Harry going to kill first?
