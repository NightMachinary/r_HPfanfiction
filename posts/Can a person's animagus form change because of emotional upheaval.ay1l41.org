We know that the form of the Patronus charm can change because of emotional upheaval, as seen with Tonks' case after Sirius' death and Remus' rejection of her advances. Can the same thing happen with the Animagus form as well - can it change because of a severe traumatic experience or world-shattering change in perspective?

Both the Animagus form and the Patronus form are sort of supposed to represent some aspect of a person's character, so a change could be reflected in the A-form since it happens in the P-form. (But obviously, the forms are not completely representative of the person, like Hermione and the otter, unless you count the otter as belonging to the same family as the weasel.) Peter's A-form is a rat, and he is as treacherous as a rat in life as well. Sirius is a dog, and he's fiercely loyal to James (and later Harry) till the end. Minerva's A-form and P-form is a cat, which is supposed to represent her intellect and wisdom I guess (which is ironically never shown in series). Remus' P-form is a werewolf, which is the defining aspect of his life.


** For what it's worth, the transformation is initially really painful, so that reads to me like it's a permanent and deep change. I think the theory behind the evolving patronus is that it's a reflection of the cause of your happy memories, whereas your animagus is more of an internal reflection. But with a big enough upheaval, maybe? I do like the idea; would make for an interesting story for sure.

*** Where does it say that the initial transformation is painful? Pottermore or the wiki?

**** Pottermore. But the Lexicon [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/animagus-3/][summarizes it well.]] "Fiery pain" and the first transformation is "painful and frightening," but gets easier with time.

I think also it's worth noting that Skeeter, Sirius and Pettigrew all would have huge incentives to change form if it were easily done, and in terms of emotional upheaval, I'd also think what Sirius went through would count. So the form seems fairly static to me.

But it's a fan fiction, so room for creativity!

Perhaps it's not simple upheaval so much as an altered self-image, as the form is a reflection of your nature. Say if, for example, Peter had taken the form of a lion but still betrayed his friends and felt any guilt, a rat might then be more appropriate and he'd shift.

** I could see a traumatic personality shift causing a person to disassociate from their existing animagus form, but I would think that they would have to start the process over in discovering a new totem animal to change into. It wouldn't be surprise-I'm-now-a-giraffe.

** Canon doesn't answer that question, but I really like that idea. If done correctly, it would be really gut-wrenching in a story to have a character find that their Animagus form had changed after a traumatic experience.

*** I don't know if Animagus forms being based on the personality is even canon. There aren't that many, only McGonagall, the Marauders and Skeeter, and it's implied that the Marauders had a certain choice to what animals they became.

I never got this impression, myself. And FWIW the Pottermore description of becoming an animagus says nothing about choosing your form either.

***** The only instance of someone's animagus form being a choice is in Hogwarts Mystery, but I'm pretty sure that it's only because it's a video game, and whichever form you pick is retroactively what you would've always been.

***** Didn't Lupin mention that Pettigrew became a rat so that he could deactivate the willow?

****** He just said that /as/ a rat, he could touch the knob. Nothing about how it was a deliberate choice of animal -- the way it's phrased, it could be simple luck.

******* Sirius could probably have done it if he was quick enough, but it was incredibly lucky that Peter was the perfect form for dodging the willow and hitting the knob.

Imagine if they'd all been huge animals like James, that would have been awkward.

**** That's not implied anywhere. JKR has said that wizards have no choice in what they transform into and that they'll only find out what it is when they do transform.

** I think it would be more likely that the person would stop being able to transform, much like Tonks had trouble metamorphusing.
