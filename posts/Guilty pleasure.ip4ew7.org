Anyone else have a guilty pleasure for Indy!Harry fics? Or simply fics that are so far off from canon they might as well be original works?


** My guilty pleasure is fix-fics, though it's always a balancing act for such fics to not stray into "too easy" territory where there's no tension at all.

*** Yes! Love it! I particularly enjoy fix it fics where characters go back in time to meddle with the past. So good!

*** I've honestly gotten to the point where I prefer fanfiction over the canon material. Especially with all the TERF nonsense going on with Rowling lately. I honestly can't believe that an author who portrays male characters wearing high heeled boots, long robes that resemble dresses, and have long hair is so transphobic and has such a binary view of gender It's truly disheartening.

**** Perhaps try to find out what [[https://www.jkrowling.com/answers/][she really thinks]], and perhaps there is still time to reconsider. But I don't think it will helps, because now it is more about what some crazy LGBTF+ activists think than what Mrs Rowling really said.

***** Kind of? I don't really idolize people or celebrities like some people, never have, I was just so disappointed that some who could create such a vivid world is so awful.

**** Don't know what cabin material is, but yes, I didn't like the Rowling novels very much. I liked HPMOR much better, and then started reading other HP fic because of that.

**** I was wrong, it's called Harry Potter and the Powerof Revenge. The country is called Insania.

*** I'll be sure to check that out! If you like this, you may enjoy [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7899682/1/][Schooled]]. It has its faults of course (mainly in moderate slut shaming) as well as rampant Weasley bashing (of Arthur, Ron, and Ginny) but it's pretty entertaining overall.
