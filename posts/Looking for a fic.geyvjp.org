Everyone always says that lily and james would have adopted and raised Dudley if things had been reversed. Does anyone have a fic where that's explored?

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

  Lily remembered her sister, how there had been a time she was curious and delighted about magic, before it slowly sank in that she could look and not touch.The last thing Petunia had said to Lily before she died was a chilly goodbye, ending a holiday dinner where they'd had a shrieking row in the entryway. Petunia had said 'freak' and Lily had hissed 'better than this, better than this being my whole fucking world, Tune, do you even see yourself, are you happy--'And now here was Dudley Vernon Dursley fussing himself to sleep as Lily walked the halls of the Godric's Hollow house. His tiny soft hands with their tiny soft fingernails curled under her chin, the same way Harry's always had.She passed James, who was gently bouncing his way up the hall the opposite way. "I think he's asleep," James mouthed over Harry's tousled head. His hair was the same mess, his head bent down as he peered at his sleeping son.Lily stopped where she stood, her nephew heavy on her chest, her husband smiling, her sister buried. "James," she said. "How are we going to do this?"

  Fourth year. Living with the Dursleys taught Harry three all important rules. These rules cause an emotionally repressed 11 year old to attend Hogwarts and discover his so called dead family aren't as dead as he believed.

  Dudley wishes he could go to Hogwarts. AU, and written before Deathly Hallows came out. This is a remix, with permission, of a drabble by Lilacsigil.
