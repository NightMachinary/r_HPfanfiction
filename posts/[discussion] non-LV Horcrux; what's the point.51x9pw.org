I need a refresher on Horcruxes. Let's say someone other than LV creates a Horcrux and then gets killed. The second part of their soul lives on in the Horcrux, but what's the point? Is it to avoid sending the soul to its eternal resting place? If that's all it functions as, why not just try to become a ghost instead? Seems like it's more achievable looking at the ghost to horcrux ratio, plus lower barrier of entry (no need to kill someone). Not to mention some kind of continued relative existence versus being chained up in an object.

Once someone destroys or unlocks a Horcrux, the soul goes flying out and into what? The great beyond?

I guess I don't understand how it's useful to have a Horcrux once the original wizard's body has been killed off. What am I missing?

OP, right off the bat you're starting with the wrong premise. Horcruxes don't allow you to come back from the dead, they prevent you from dying at all. Voldemort wasn't killed in 1981, he was disembodied. Nothing in the HP lore suggests that it's in fact possible to come back from the dead.

Also, I'm not sure if becoming a ghost is a conscious choice. I don't think it's like "I died, well let's become a ghost, shall we?". I think that ghosts just happen sometimes.

What you're missing is that the way Voldemort was disembodied isn't a common occurrence. I want say that having a horcrux makes you "immune" to the Killing Curse, but this seems to clash with canon. In OotP, Voldemort defended himself with his silver shield against what he assumed would have been a Killing Curse, though it can be interpreted as Voldemort simply playing along because he didn't want to show that he was KC-immune to Dumbledore, who Voldemort didn't know was researching horcruxes, or Voldemort simply didn't know if he could just shrug off a KC. In either of those cases, the theory of KC-immunity with horcruxes isn't impossible to fit with canon.

Do we have any actual basis for this? The assumption I always thought made the most sense was just that the horcruxes tether the soul to Earth, so even if your body is destroyed your soul remains and you have the chance to resurrect.

**** Until we know otherwise it seems safest canon-wise to assume the soul merely stays on Earth somewhere.

However that's incredibly inconvenient. If horcruxes can still allow the destruction of the user's body, why didn't Voldemort have a backup plan enacted sooner? Perhaps he was mistaken about the magic (assumed he couldn't lose his body), but pre-insanity Tom Riddle is shown to be an extremely gifted boy. It doesn't make sense that he would misunderstand a huge Dark Art.

A possibility is that horcruxes prevent the soul from being severed (killing curse or life-threatening injuries) except in the case of love, in line with JKR's theme of "love conquered all", or the Elder Wand, which trumps all other magic. So Tom really could never die/lose his body except to a force he didn't understand (love or ownership of the Elder Wand).

#+end_quote

He is by far the most arrogant person in the entirety of Harry Potter canon and we know that he's prone to making less that stellar decisions because of it. He never would have truly considered it likely that anyone would manage to kill him, so the only reason he probably thought he'd ever need a new body would be if his current one was getting too old, too damaged, etc. and needed to be replaced, in which case he could make a new one. The important thing to note about that, is that he would never expect to need a new body with no notice. Furthermore, we don't necessarily know how exactly the soul can be transferred to different bodies. It's possible that it's incredibly difficult or even impossible to do any meaningful work on creating a new body before the need for one arises. He also would have been severely hampered by his own secrecy. He didn't and wouldn't tell anyone about his horcruxes, and he would not have let anyone in on the secret to help or maintain some kind of body or resurrection system before he needed it. Unless it's a relatively easy, simple, and stable process, it's entirely possible that he would have been incapable of doing it on his own even if he wanted to.

I'm inclined to agree with you here, but I'm at least a little skeptical. The man was one of the greatest wizards to ever live, but that doesn't make him infallible. Horcruxes are one of the foulest, least known pieces of magic. There was probably only so much information available because 1) Not many people were going to be willing to carry and sell that information, 2) Many of the people that would know the real details of it wouldn't be the kind of people to go writing books on the subject, and 3) It would be a rare art and little experimentation is likely to have been done after the process was actually performed. Information would likely have been limited enough that it would be entirely possible that he would be mistaken about some of the aspects of the magic.

Your paragraph is very ambivalent about whether or not you actually feel that is the most likely scenario or if there is any information that actually supports it. You've just written that there is a single occurrence in which Voldemort defended himself against a killing curse and how that doesn't necessarily disprove the theory.

If Lord Voldemort is immune to the killing curse then I doubt he would ever find out. He didn't take anyone with him on his journey to immortality.

I think he isn't though, as it was the deflection of the killing curse that injured Voldemort.

  OP, right off the bat you're starting with the wrong premise. Horcruxes don't allow you to come back from the dead, they prevent you from dying at all.
#+end_quote

Which part of what I wrote included that assumption? I never stated that Horcruxes operate in that manner. You can't "come back" if you were never wholly gone in the first place, which appears to be how the Horcrux functions. Any kind of "resurrection" involving the Horcrux isn't a true "come back from the dead" experience, but rather a kind of fortification of whatever soul piece continues to exist on the mortal realm.

My point is it seems highly inefficient and nearly futile to have gone through the trouble of creating a Horcrux. Once your original sentient body has been killed off, your ambiguous soul remains tethered to the mortal realm by the remaining Horcrux. This is well and good, but unless you can get someone to go through the magic (presumably dark, difficult, and requiring high sacrifice by the avenue we witnessed in the graveyard) to get you a body, you're stuck in this pseudo-limbo.

LV managed to regain a body because he had goons waiting in the wings to do his bidding, but how does your average Evil Wizard manage that task without a #squad? The Horcrux is largely inanimate and unable to give directions. Sure, the diary was an ingenious bit of magic, but it's the only example we see of some kind of ability to give explicit directions and it appears to be an anomaly and possibly a piece of magic only someone like LV was capable of. We don't see that same level of possession and direction with any of the other objects.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I agree with your overall sentiment but to say "nothing...suggests" is a bit of a stretch considering that there exists a Resurrection Stone. But that is neither here nor there concerning my original question.

#+begin_quote
  Also, I'm not sure if becoming a ghost is a conscious choice. I don't think it's like "I died, well let's become a ghost, shall we?". I think that ghosts just happen sometimes.
#+end_quote

Not according to Sir Nicholas who states in OotP /"Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod ... I was afraid of death. I chose to remain behind. I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn't have ... Well, that is neither here nor there ... In fact, I am neither here nor there..."/ (from the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/creature/non-corporeal/ghost/][Lexicon]])

So yes, there is some way in which wizards can have a say in if they remain as a ghost.

#+begin_quote
  What you're missing is that the way Voldemort was disembodied isn't a common occurrence.
#+end_quote

Now this actually relates to my original question.

/Do/ we know that it isn't a common occurrence? It's possible Dumbledore mentioned this somewhere and I'm just forgetting when. If you could provide that reference, that would be helpful.

We know that LV didn't /expect/ any kind of repercussion when he AK-ed Harry, but that seems more to do with the fact that he underestimated the role that any kind of protective blood magic might play.

#+begin_quote
  I want say that having a horcrux makes you "immune" to the Killing Curse, but this seems to clash with canon.
#+end_quote

I agree completely. It does seem to clash with canon, which is exactly why it doesn't make sense for me to theorize about it.

Horcrux creation doesn't grant you "killing curse" or "Unforgivable" immunity as far as we can see in canon. It doesn't seem grant any immunity. Your physical body is still vulnerable to dying off.

So, once your original sentient body has died off, how does an average Joe Evil Wizard get someone to agree to go through a dark, difficult, dangerous ritual to restore his body? This is presuming the Horcrux doesn't get lost for a millenia in the first place, by which point in time whoever he wanted to dominate or be with is long gone anyway.

So if it's more of a matter of not wanting to pass into the Great Beyond, why not just come back as a ghost?

**** u/ScottPress:
#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The part I quoted at the top of my post.

On the inefficiency of horcruxes, I would argue that the point is not to "not pass into death", but to remain walking, talking, living with the actual living, not the in-between state of ghosthood.

Yes, destruction of the body presents a problem if you don't have a goonsquad, but I reiterate my point on wizarding medicine. It can do a lot. Destroying a wizard's body beyond the point of repairability is something we can't exactly quantify, but we know that it's possible to regrow bones and possibly grow organs or preserve them (brains in DoM). But even in the extreme, it's an extremely distant possibility of regaining the body vs the impossibility of it happening (death/ghosthood). Half an eye is more useful than no eye, or in the land of blind men, the one-eyed man is king, that kind of thing.

#+begin_quote
  bit of a stretch considering that there exists a Resurrection Stone
#+end_quote

Which we know summons ghostlike entities, it doesn't actually resurrect the dead. So I think I'm still solid on that point.

You win on the ghosts.

About the Killing Curse, it continues to have the reputation of being magically unblockable, even though we're explicitly told it was blocked by magic at least twice (both times when Voldemort tried to kill Harry). I see the love sacrifice magic as a rare occurrence, because I think if it was more or less regular instead of a freak incident /which blocked the Killing Curse/ then maybe there'd be caveat with the KC - love sacrifice phenomenon is an effective shield.

I like the interpretation that a horcrux wizard might be unaffected by the KC, because I don't think what destroyed Voldemort's body was just his own deflected spell. Two things: one, the KC is said to leave no mark on the body, second, there was sacrificial magic at work that night. That's why I believe it's possible to say that Voldemort might shrug off a KC if no other magic was involved. And finally, Harry's "death" in the Forest. The KC doesn't seem to be as perfect a murder tool as it's reputed to be. Sure, it's the best there is, but it is open to interpretation.

Lastly, to repeat myself, I don't think a horcrux is a matter of simply not passing on into the Great Beyond, because indeed, why not just become a ghost. I think a horcrux is a matter of remaining firmly embodied in the world of the living, which is well out of reach for a ghost.

** The second part doesn't just “live” in its phylactery, it anchors the piece that was in the original body to stay in our plane. I think JKR tried to implement the concept of “sacred” “soul” from classic abrahamic religions into HP-verse without actually mentioning anything about that concept's source. The result was yet another ill-defined mess: wizards who've lived in this world can leave behind portraits and ghosts of themselves, but neither is considered to be a “real” fragment of their original self for some reason (even though both seem to be passing the turing test, so to speak). Even though magic-able bodies can be created (VD's ritual) or copied (polyjuice) and memories can be transferred, to restore a fully-functional copy of themselves a wizard would have to go through this convoluted process of splitting their “soul”, then (if their original body gets destroyed) use the original fragment of their soul (which they turn into) to possess other animals (including magical humans) or be transported into a new body.

There was this great test that determined your stance on continuity of consciousness (can't find it ATM), and it had questions like “If your body gets destroyed and instantly and perfectly recreated by a teleporter, would you consider the newly created person to be ‘you', or it would still be lacking something that was lost in the process?” The questions there were put better than that, but the point was that people would have different opinions on the matter, and mainly because they had different opinions on the existence and function of souls, and different definitions of their selves.

So, what horcruxes are, in my opinion, is JKR's way of making VD survive as his original self [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling#Religion][while she had the idea of souls as a prime component of her worldview;]] the idea also kinda-leaking into the story as an unmentioned (?)

*** When I say "live" I'm thinking about how a soul-fragment of TR was imprisoned in the diary and had the apparent ability to "reconstitute" with the right ingredients (in that case by sucking the life force/magic out of another human). Rather like a seed that lays dormant until the right conditions happen.

Because it seemed as though Riddle was on the verge of becoming flesh and blood, I thought all Horcruxes must operate like that on some level. They're a kind of seed housing a piece of the original. Living in the way that a seed is living.

I agree with you about the messiness of portraits and ghosts. I have a horror fic brewing about exploring this concept, and this is partially how my original question relates, trying to best understand the mechanics and motivation.

The area-of-effect mind-corrupting properties of at least 2 of the horcruxes make one assume that they're not even dormant and possess some form of awareness about their surroundings. But if they were fully lucid and aware all the time like a regular human, that would not work either, because [[http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140514-how-extreme-isolation-warps-minds][the human mind quickly deteriorates in a full isolation.]] So one would either deduce that a horcruxe's consciousness doesn't operate the same way a regular human's does; or that Tom has built some countermeasures for his horcruxes to not become crazier (maybe a VR in the H. for the mind fragments to amuse themselves with, similar to how pensiveness work).

IIRC, There are several stories that deal with these questions in various manners (spoilers, obv):

- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][/Temporal Beacon,/]] the unspeakables place the Diadem on a magical body with no personality (IIRC, obliviated!Lockhart) and it eventually takes roots in it and becomes a copy of VD;
- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][/Black Comedy,/]] the Diary accidentally takes roots in Neville, grows into a copy of VD, realizes how unhinged his original soul-piece has become, and starts thwarting original's plans.
- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186430/1/Thunderstorm][/Thunderstorm,/]] Harry passes through Diary!TMR's shade when it's about to complete usurping Ginny's soul, and that makes the Diary-piece merge with Harry's scar-piece instead, materialising as a 16yo version of TMR. In this story too she's against what her original soul-piece has become, and eventually Harry and she agree to work together to kill the original. Because she's only a fragment of the originally whole soul, she starts withering if\when Harry blocks the connection between him and her via Occlumency.
- in ???, Hermione manages to make the Diary confess that it experiences time as a normal person would --- /while it is being kept open/, so she uses this to torture its sanity until it will agree to share information;
- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][/the Well Groomed Mind,/]] Harry helps VD merge back with the horxruces he'd created, gradually restoring his sanity;
- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][/Sacrifices arc,/]] they not only serve as a metaphysical anchor for VD's original soul-piece to stay here, but also act like a balm for his mind when his “magical network” gets damaged by a clever trap attack.
- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11280068/1/The-Brightest-Witch-and-the-Darkest-House][/The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House,/]]^{[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/black-knight-harry-potter-au.395017/][(2)]]} Hermione just keeps the Diary to milk it for information, though it seems to be able to still affect Ginny on a distance.

You may also be interested in [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/179564-doc-future][/the Doc Future trilogy/]] (not related to HP-verse in any way). In this story there's a character that is able to do precisely what you've described: place “seeds” of herself in minds of others so that they will grow into new copies of her in case her original self\mind gets killed\destroyed. Eventually several versions of her come to exist, and she has to deal with “synchronisation problems” between all these versions. One of the better [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_mind_%28science_fiction%29][collective mind]] stories I've seen so far.

OR

Mind and soul are separate and have different requirements.

OR

The Horcrux and however it binds already has a built-in protection mechanism, no innovation needed. It would seem it has to operate this way because who knows how many years it could take to find someone willing to create a body? It took LV almost a decade to run across Quirrell, and that was probably because he was famous enough that Quirrell even thought to go looking for him.

But I'm enjoying your notion that Tom might have given his fragments some kind of amusement to toy with.

  If you have a horcrux and your body gets destroyed, there are means to get your body back.
#+end_quote

Quite true. But how do you suppose a regular-Joe Dark Wizard goes about getting his body back? His original piece of soul is either floating around on earth (more disembodied than a ghost) or partially departed (depending on one's theory). How does he make sure someone is willing to go through the trouble of getting his body back? Is it likely to happen without a cultic following of LV proportions?

#+begin_quote
  You can also possess other people, among other things.
#+end_quote

The quality of full-on possession is only seen in one Horcrux; the Diary. The Diary appears to have been an anomaly. Which of the other Horcruxes operated at that level?

The Diary was probably the most powerful because LV had already a trial run with his first (the Gaunt ring) and still a significant amount of soul left to fragment compared to his subsequent attempts. He tried to get fancy with it in his hubris, I imagine, and had the ability to do so at the time. No other Horcruxes before or after are shown to have the level of personal ingratiation and possession that the diary demonstrated.

Is it likely that wizards prior to LV (or even after) created Horcruxes at that level of sophistication? I speculate not, since he had the great advantage of making one prior, and it seems that had almost never before happened.

#+begin_quote
  A ghost has no real power, nor will it ever have any power.
#+end_quote

I suppose this depends on how one defines power. How much power does a wizard have as a disembodied Horcrux owner? There is the /potential/ for power, certainly, but it relies on too many 'what ifs' to be useful I think.

"If someone finds my horcrux..." "If someone can recognize what it even does..." "If someone can figure out how to bring me a body..." "If someone is willing do go through a dark and dangerous ritual for me..." "If all this is done in enough time where I currently know people/have connections/can get revenge..."

Returning to the concept of Horcrux possession; the Trio had a significant amount of contact with the Locket. It was able to influence their mood, but we never see it take on the kind of possession the Diary had. Presumably this is is how a typical Horcrux operates.

Compare this to ghosts who are able to have a wider range of interaction with the living. They're able to /talk/ to the living; to me, this is hugely influential. To cajole, persuade, influence... we've seen nothing in canon to indicate that a ghost couldn't be quite the master puppeteer if they so chose.

What good did Voldemort's entire cult do him? It took the effort of all of one person, in this case Peter Pettigrew. Had Voldemort not been a perfectionist, he would have settled on any ordinary 'enemy' for his resurrection ritual, and would have had a body in a weeks' time.

And I wasn't talking about the possession powers of the Horcrux, I was talking about the possession powers of the main spirit. Voldemort retained the power to possess Quirrell and animals in his spirit form.

#+begin_quote
  Why on earth would a regular-Joe Dark Wizard make a horcrux in the first place?
#+end_quote

I was under the impression that LV was the biggest, baddest thing to happen to the British wizarding world in their recorded history. He's the pinnacle in both his capability for evil and his range of magical ability; this seems to be supported by the fact that he created so many Horcruxes when others only managed one. He sets the bar for a new grade of Dark Wizard.

Anything below that is what I mean by regular-Joe Dark Wizard. Someone still evil and with enormous magical power, but whose Horcrux making abilities are limited to one. Probably those previous Horcrux makers had dedicated personal loyalties ranging from loners to something along the followers of LV. But does that mean /all/ Horcrux makers commanded followers like LV? Probably not, is what I'd guess. That's what I mean by "regular-Joe Dark Wizard".

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I'd think having cult followers increases the odds that you will find one among the number willing to go through a dark, dangerous, difficult and rather thankless task of bodily restoration. In the case of LV, it seems like the concept of cult ultimately worked in his favor.

You made the excellent point reminding me about Pettigrew's motivation behind initiating the bodily re-creation. Not from true devotion did he return, but desperation.

You're right it only takes one to do the ritual. But I think part of LV's power stemmed from the fact that he had built-in followers. When Pettigrew "resurrected" LV, it wasn't just a lone, powerful wizard he was reactivating--it was him plus an entire network.

#+begin_quote
  And I wasn't talking about the possession powers of the Horcrux, I was talking about the possession powers of the main spirit. Voldemort retained the power to possess Quirrell and animals in his spirit form.
#+end_quote

This is a good point and a piece I was forgetting; the ability for the original soul piece to have limited possession powers increases the odds that it can find someone and communicate its need for them to create a body. Even still, it took nearly a decade for LV to get in touch with someone willing, and that was arguably because he was so famous and powerful he had someone (Quirrell) willing to seek him out. Surely not all Horcrux creators are as famous and powerful?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I agree with you on this point, but I was referring to people other than Voldemort when I made the statement about ghosts. What is the motivation for creating a Horcrux when there is little guarantee of being brought back bodily? Look how long it took LV. How much longer would it take someone without his fame?

There are probably all kinds of wraith souls kicking around for hundreds, if not thousands of years waiting for someone to discover them and have the desire and knowledge to make them a body.

It should probably be easier for someone other than Voldemort. Voldemort's problem was he didn't trust /anyone/ with his secret. No one knew about his horcruxes, not even Bellatrix. After he lost his body, he daren't approach any of his servants because he (correctly) suspected that most of his servants would want nothing to do with him since he was powerless. He didn't trust even Bellatrix in his vulnerable state, though he did trust Barty after he proved his loyalty by trying to find him.

His life would have been much easier had he just trusted one person to be perfectly loyal to him. Dear Bella would have had him up and running in weeks. I image most dark wizards wouldn't have the same level of paranoia as Voldemort, and would trust at least someone with their secret.

** The point of the Horcrux is that you anchor your soul to the living plane to stop an otherwise inevitable avalanche effect. Ghosts, as far as we know, aren't alive and, heres the kicker, don't have a way to get back to life. Horcrux bound souls have this option. By way of ritual or several other ways (like the diary or the philosophers stone) you can produce or acquire a body to live again.

While simply being a horcrux bound soul is probably even worse than being a ghost, it isn't a desirable state in the first place for the maker of the Horcrux. Nobody who makes a Horcrux wants to stay in that state. Its a failsafe and I'm guessing every sensible wizard or witch making such a thing would organize ways to come in possession of a body before even producing a Horcrux.

** I'm pretty sure the point of a Horcrux is that it tethers the other pieces of the sole to this realm. So, if you have a horcrux and you're killed, the soul in your body remains on Earth and you can come back. Presumably, you can also come back from any of the horcruxes, though that probably requires more aid as I don't think those soul pieces can move about or even have sentience in the same way.

An obvious distinction between a ghost and the soul remnant from a horcrux is that a ghost has no power and can never return to their body. A disembodied soul tethered to Earth by a horcrux still has some power to it.

** This is actually a pretty great question, my personal take it this;

Only the strongest and usually darkest of wizards could make a horcrux, thus splitting the soul in two, I don't personally think l this is an even split, let's take Voldemort for example, if the split was constantly 50/50 then by the 7th book would he would have what? 3% in his body, where as 50% in his first horcrux (math might be incorrect too lazy to work it out)

But rather I think creating a horcrux splits a small portion of the soul into the anchor, let's say 1 or 2% just long enough to keep the entire soul linked to the "mortal realm" now I'm using the assumption that "death" is when a soul no longer has a body, in which case the soul no longer sustains itself and completely dies.

Therefore, with at least a little part of the soul safe inside the anchor, no soul can truly die, and the 98% of the soul, will be able to rejoin the original host body, or should that body have been destroyed, or, as the wizard is dark and powerful, could seek out a new host, possession ect.

** I'm afraid you completely misunderstand what a Horcrux is supposed to do. The idea is that souls are inherently meant to be whole. Therefore, when you cleave it in half, the halves will pull at each other, craving to be whole again. Therefore, if the "master soul" is about to leave the mortal world and Move On, it will be unable to do so because the other part of the soul will literally anchor it to the mortal plane.

You seem to be under the impression, like many other people, that Hocruxes are "backups". I can't blame you --- this is certainly an obvious hypothesis after seeing Diary Riddle's actions in "Chamber of Secrets". But it it's actually wrong. The fact that the soulpieces inside the Horcruxes can become self-aware and escape their vessel originally was an unintended side-effect, though Voldemort, being the Slytherin he was, weaponized it with the diary.

A typical wizard would probably make only one. Is main the purpose to avoid death? If so, why not make more of an effort to come back as a ghost? Because, we know that the original body can be destroyed and the master soul is left nebulous on earth.
