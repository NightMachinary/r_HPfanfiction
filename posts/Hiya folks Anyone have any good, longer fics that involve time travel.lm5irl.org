The time travel trope is definitely one of a guilty pleasures. Marauders era, Founders era, Tom Riddles era, etc. I'm fine with most pairings too, just want some decent time travel fics. üòä


** linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) is without doubt the best one. Amazing adventure story where Harry is sent back to 1978. Just completely brilliant.

linkao3(Strange Visitors from Another Century by Izzyaro) is also very good. Trio are sent to the Founders era. Good there's a lot of back story with the Founders wars.

linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe) is good fun. Harry is sent to Marauders era but doesn't get on with the marauders. It's an interesting conflict and we learn a lot about Sirius.

Also linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4472270/chapters/10164680]]) is worth reading just for Teddy Lupin. Him and Harry end up in OoTP times. It's worth reading just for the chapter where they end up in Grimmauld Place. Teddy Lupin is a goddam treasure and I love him so so much it hurts. He has bit goggles and a sparkly bag and eugh he's completely amazing I adore him. This fic is... Rounded off but not conclusively completed. It was obviously a set up for a bigger story that never got written but what's there is really good and again, Teddy ‚ù§Ô∏è

Hope that helps üòä a bit of everything I think.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Canon-compliant up to most of DH, more than 10 years later in a hyper-magical, post-apocalyptic Britain, a spectator sneaks into the empty Once-Ministry to watch Harry Potter and Voldemort's final duel. Unfortunately, just as victory finally arrives, an unlikely escape triggers an unexpected beginning.

** linkffn(Unfogging the Future by Naidhe) Lavender/Tom Riddle. One of the most unique time travel fics I've ever read.

linkffn(Narcissa's Chance by ReluctantSidekick) Harry/Bella/Narcissa. Harry saves them from their future husbands.

linkffn(Delenda Est by Lord Silvere) linkffn(Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence) Both Harry/Bellatrix.

linkffa(1678) Harry/Amelia. This one is unfortunately unfinished but still worth a read.

Edit: So apparently linkffa doesn't work correctly rn, here's the link for the last story: [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1678]]

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** How much does grammar/bad editing bother you? If you can gloss over it, this has to be the best story so far for me out of 100+ fics. I really liked the story and tone. And there were at least three "wait WTF just happened?!" moments, which I hadn't seen before.
