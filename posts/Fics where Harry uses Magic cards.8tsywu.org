like throwing em do massive damage or heal someone or stun someone basically if you play league of legends its pretty much harry as twisted fate


** So magic cards in the way that Gambit uses magic cards? Or Magic cards as in laying down a Black Lotus and winning the game on the second turn?

*** What kind of weak ass vintage deck doesn't win turn one with a black lotus? You don't even have to do channel-fireball. Just do some combo like storming off with Tendrils at 12 or something or OOPS ALL SPELLS and kill them with your redic hasted monster.

And now I wish there was Harry the Planeswalker story...

**** I prefer the slow bleed and denial of blue. Oh, you thought you were going to cast something? Oh, no honey. You just put that right into your graveyard. Oh, and your 4/4 flyer is /my/ bitch now. And here's another point from my Prodigal Sorcerer.

I love blue control, red direct damage and white creatures. I used to play the old Microprose computer version endlessly. I still have my ancient Dell from 1999/2000 that has it and every now and then I crank it up.

***** That game is great, especially since you can basically build WinterOrb.dek and lock the computer out of doing anything, ever, as you cackle maniacally.

Or just do what I do and play white weenies with serra angle.

****** I liked the quest part the best. Roaming around, fighting guys, buying and winning cards. I loved it when the baddies started running away from you and would just throw cards at you to make you go away. And then taking on the Planeswalkers in their castles ... the iOS versions just aren't the same.

***** Oh crap you're right. I guess that means we're back to using black lotus to power out shivan dragon XD
