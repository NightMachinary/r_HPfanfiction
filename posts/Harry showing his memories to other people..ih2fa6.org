I feel that a lot of dangerous things that harry does, goes very much unnoticed and under-appreciated by a lot of people. Things like him killing the basillisk or fighting the dragon are very dangerous given his age. So I would like to know if there are fics where harry shows his memories to other people and they are shocked by his adventures.

These can be anything from AU, to Time travel.


** Reminds me of this...

  (Title-changed) AU. GoF. Harry was sent to Azkaban for mass-murder. Now, after defeating Voldemort he returns to Hogwarts and all those who abandoned him. Sorrow can be your downfall or your greatest strength. And banshees are just the beginning.
