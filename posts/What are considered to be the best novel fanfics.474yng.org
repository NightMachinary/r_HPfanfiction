More specifically, ones that start after book 5 or 6. Ive read a few and thats really what I like. This was like 5-6 years ago so Im re-reading the ones I read back then.

Prefer it to follow the canon in regards to shipping, but not against changesin that (as long as it isnt unbelievable)

The main thing is I like reading people finishing the story and having their own take on it. Especially after book 5 it gives them more options to use creativity because they arent stuck on the Horcruxs

The ones I have read (and liked)

Harry Potter and the Dangerous Choice

Harry Potter and the Elements of Valour

by MadEye1200

All of Melindaleo's novels (theres a post hogwarts one thats new to me so ill end up reading that one)

Harrys Last Task by razzberry2 (this one is buy far the best one Ive read but it was never finished as far as I can tell. Its basically impossible to find as well. Only way I found it was finding a forum discussing the new 7th book and someone had posted an excerpt of it as the real book. so googling that I found the full fanfic posted as the real book but its missing the last written chapter)

Also there were a 2 Post Hogwarts ones but they werent great.

The First Day

and one I cant remember the name, but it had harry working as an auror and ended with Voldemorts daughter trying to resurrect him


** The /Alexandra Quick/ series is easily among the best. The first one is here: linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle)

** The first thing that comes to mind when you mention 'a fic that feels like a real novel' is definitely linkffn(Renegade Cause by Silens Cursor) . It is probably one of the best mystery stories in my opinion. Definitely bit of a mindfuck at certain points if I remember correctly, but still amazing.

You've probably read this because it is quite well known, but if you haven't... you're in for a treat.

** *Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past*, linkffn(2636963), is the story with highest count of favorites (I don't care for number of reviews) on fanfiction.net. Unfortunately, it has been a WIP for more than 10 years and only reached middle of year 4. I doubt it would ever be completed.

*Strangers at Drakeshaugh*, linkffn(6331126), is in my opinion the best post war canon compliant story. In fact, most of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian's]] 83 stories makes up a huge postwar series.

*Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince*, linkffn(5677867), is a strict canon book 6 from Ginny's POV, very well written.

*In Case of Emergency*, linkffn(4625848), is slightly AU, but a nice smut fic with a decent plot.

*Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650), is a superb Harry/Ginny/Ron time travel story, very emotional, very well written.

*Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650), is a fairly new super Harry/Ginny story. The author is very audacious and has written something I've never read before. The story could still bomb, but I'm really curious in how it turns out.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.
