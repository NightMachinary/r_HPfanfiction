I recently read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3412346/chapters/7472102][D.S.S. Requirement]] which has Harry as the Captain of a space ship, and it's made me want to read more “In Charge” Harry fics. Basically anything where Harry is competently leading a group of people and receiving a certain amount of respect due to his position. This can be anything from the D.A being more structured, to him being a General in the war. Does anyone have any good recommendations?

I prefer longer fics, but will take anything good. Complete is preferred (though again, I'll take anything good), and I'm happy with any ships, slash, etc.

PS - thinking about the General idea, it doesn't even need to be actively during the war. I read a crossover fic once where Harry said something about the aurors not arresting him on trumped up charges unless they'd “lost all respect for their goddamn General”, and liked the idea. So even if it's post-war, if it gets mentioned or affects the dynamics I would be interested in reading it!
