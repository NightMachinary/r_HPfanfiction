:END:
Its a Drarry fic where harry is bonded to draco for some reason. But draco removes his pent up frustration on Harry by torturing him, mainly sexually. It goes on for many days. Narcissa sees Harry one day where he is lying on the bed almost about to die and later questions draco. Later Harry is found to be pregnant with draco's child so draco stops his torture and reality comes back to him what if harry leaves him and starts treating harry right. I have read the fic but I'm not getting the name... It was long too about 100k words
