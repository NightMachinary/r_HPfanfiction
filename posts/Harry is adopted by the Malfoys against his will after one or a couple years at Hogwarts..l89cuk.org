:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I made a post looking for this fic a while back but didn't find it, so here's take two.

I don't know how it happens, but it does. Harry's attitude towards it is about what you'd expect. He's surprised to find that while Draco is pretty much as bad as he thought, the Malfoy parents are a huge improvement on the Dursleys. They're perhaps a bit strict and they're definitely not affectionate or anything, but they're fair and reasonable guardians.

Draco has friends over throughout the summer, which isn't a pleasant time for Harry. He doesn't bring it up, but it does come up that Harry could have friends over as well if he'd like. He asks about Hermione, trying to prove a point or something, and is again surprised when they don't hesitate to allow it. The adult Malfoys don't like muggles or muggleborns at all and they don't pretend to, they just say that they are perfectly capable of civilly tolerating one in their home for some time for the sake of their ward.

Does anyone recognize this?


** Can you remember if it involves the Triwizard Tournament? And Harry pranking evetybody?

*** Tbh I think it was only a couple of chapters long. It died before he went back to Hogwarts. I think. Though maybe it continued updating.

If you know of one that maybe fits, I'd be interested in checking it out.

  Sequel to “How Like Hatred.” When Harry goes back to school after Christmas holidays as Henry Malfoy, he has to cope with friends, professors, and just about everyone else having an opinion on his new name and appearance. And that's not to mention his smotheringly overprotective family.
