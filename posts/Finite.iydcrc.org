So I have always read this as 'Fineet' but I recently watched /Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindewald/ and they pronounce it as 'Fineetay' in the final battle. Am I the only one who thought it was pronounced 'Fineet'? Because I am struggling to get through my denial right now...


** I've always pronounced it "ˈfənət," as in "infinite," even though "finite," the word meaning the opposite of "infinite," is pronounced "ˈfīnīt." I have just now realized that this makes no sense.

** Not all Harry Potter spells are based on Latin, but I read them as though they are. Basically, all letters are pronounced unless otherwise pronounced by Stephen Fry or in one of the movies

** And I have just realized Hermione says 'Fineetay' during the Chamber of Secrets movie. I hate being wrong.

**** Wait, it's not silent? So, is it supposed to be 'Kay-Nut' or 'Kuh-Nut' by Rowling's metric?

**** I suspect it's an oblique reference to King Cnut.

*** Yep, me too on both of those. Although to be honest, I read fanfiction more often than I watch the movies, so I tend to just ignore the cannon pronunciations.

**** I actually haven't watched the movies (I feel like the only Potterhead who hasn't) so I legit don't know how things are pronounced in them.
