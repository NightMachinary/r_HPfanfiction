I don't remember much but I think at one point Harry fights Dracula or his son? He also creates sometimes spells against them. I don't even think this was the major plot of the fic. But he must go meet some different races government to form alliances to fight the vampire. One of those may have intangibility power.

I'm looking for it because there is something similar in Harry Potter and the Hero's Curse linkffn(10913825) but it's not this fic. As I was reading it, this was reminding me of such events but it was clearly not in this fic.
