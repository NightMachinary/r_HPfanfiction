Yesterday I found out that there are fanfics which are written with the alteration that Harry gets into Slytherin instead of Griffyndor. I started reading one but it focused too much on the Harry/Snape relationship, but I'm really more interested in the Harry/Draco relationship. Could someone recommed me a good fanfic where Harry and Draco are friends? (and by that I mean friends, not lovers). I think it would be really interesting to read and maybe a couple of people here are aware of some really great stories?


** In my head, I sorta-by-default just change Draco from Malfoy to "MILF'sBoy", what with his mom being super hot. I've not ever seen it used, either in good-natured-ribbing between friends in Slytherin, or as an insult across the house tables when Harry's a Gryffindor. I think it should be.

I have no suggestions, sorry.

**** They're more or less friendly at various points, although I do agree it isn't quite what the person was looking for. It's still a very good treatment of the Slytherin Harry trope though and would definitely make a good introduction to the genre (especially since the other fanfic I would have suggested is the Sacrifices Arc, which is slash.).

** There are many of these stories out there. The ones others have listed are probably soem of the "best".

** Magical Relations has Harry as a Slytherin and best friends with Draco. The whole friendship group that develops in that one is really nice.

The Innocent series has Draco sorted into Gryffindor and becoming close friends with Harry (and Ron and Hermione), though Hogwarts doesn't happen until the second installment of the series.

And someone already recommended the They Shook Hands series which probably fits your request the best, if you can handle the OOC-ness of several of the characters.

  (1/7) At Madam Malkin's, Harry Potter introduces himself to Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to help Harry navigate the bizarre, new wizarding world, and Harry accepts. While Harry finds magic to be strange and amazing, there is no class to teach Harry about the complexities of friendship and social life in Slytherin... AU, Slytherin!Harry.
