Every time I check the Sacred 28 for names, I'm always struck at the Malfoys. To quote the wiki:

#+begin_quote
  Although the Malfoys are noted as respectable members as one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight (a title they are proud of), they do not take the pure-blood supremacy to the point of inbreeding, they are willing to marry half-bloods, many of whom are shown on their family tree. This makes them similar in case to the Ollivander family, as the author may have not noticed this or chose to neglect it due to the Malfoy's social standing.
#+end_quote

Yet in the book, Lucius is one of the biggest supporters of pureblood superiority. Interesting, considering this means he's descended, in a clear provable way, from at least one Muggle family.

Given that the Malfoys seem some of the more sensible pureblood families, why is Lucius so different? Voldemort's influence? Ashamed of his ancestors? You'd think that a family that relied on Muggles, via half bloods, wouldn't be so against the muggle protection act. I'd expect that of some of the fanatical families. Was it Narcissa Black's influence?

Anyway, this proves to me that Cantankerous Nott was full of shit. He didn't include the Potters, because Henry Potter was a loud supporter of Muggle rights. The fact he included the Weasleys must mean he had personal issues with Potters, and the Weasleys were too minor, or not vocal enough to annoy him. He likely included the Ollivanders because they're quite probably the oldest, from BC, and plus they make wands, can't leave them off and risk offending. Malfoys were definitely not someone to piss off, even ignoring the possible friendship he may have had with a Malfoy.

No wonder the Weasleys didn't take the sacred 28 thing very seriously. The book was clearly written by a biased author who wasn't a reliable genealogist, and only served to make a few families feel good about themselves. It's total bullshit

*** All of the extra pottermore stuff was written by Rowling if I'm not mistaken. The only thing so far that hasn't been is that travesty of a play and I don't think that really had anything to do with Pottermore beyond some cross promotional stuff.

There's some really fascinating background lore from Rowling in there. None of it (that I've read at least) retroactively harms or changes any of the main story either.

** This ties into the point that Voldemort's philosophy was seen as a new, radical approach which appealed to youngsters and firebrands, not a historical or traditional position. Salazar Slytherin was a historical anomaly, not representative of mainstream thought, and it wasn't until after the statute of secrecy was passed that serious anti-Muggle sentiment began to grow.

*** It´s kinda like what happened in Nazi Germany, while there definitely was animosity against Jews which made the holocaust possible, it was Hitlers ideas that pushed many to act on their worst instincts. Before Hitler came to power, the Jewish community in Germany was considered to be the best integrated in Europe. In that time barely anyone cared if one your parents or grandparents, were Jewish, or they just didn´t show it overtly. Historically speaking there have always been laws against Jews until the end of the 19th century and even with a change in laws the popular opinion didn´t change over night, it´s just that Hitler used them as scapegoats for the problems of his country and idiots really soak up every ideology that offers easy answers. Considering that Rowling modeled the Deatheater after the Nazi´s it is easy to assume, that both movements gained traction in a similar way.

**** Plus Grindelwald, /the/ Dark Lord of the 20th century, wasn't even particularly concerned about blood purity. His focus was that all Wizards should rule over Muggles as benevolent overlords rather than stay in hiding. He was far more anti-ICW, anti-Statute of Secrecy than anti-Muggleborn.

One of the big themes of the Dark movements of the 20th century seems to be that they were in some way revolutionary in nature. Both Voldemort and Grindelwald wanted to radically reshape Wizarding society to fit their vision of a better world. Perhaps this speaks to the notion that the magical world order that has existed since the late 1600s is untenable? Eventually someone strong enough is going to come along to knock it down.

***** Considering how Fudge could abuse his power in ootp even when every piece of information point to him being wrong and being so easily manipulated by aristocracy, that doesn´t even need to have a position in the government, just someone who feeds him ideas to manipulate him to move the law to their whims, it is quite obvious that the wizarding government needs a major reform to stay afloat, it is a system that only works if capable people or just downright geniuses are in leading positions, if an idiot comes in the consequences are fatal. This leads to one of the things that deeply annoy me about Dumbledore, he got the offer to become minister of magic and refused, even though for all his flaws he would easily be the most capable for the job, who could easily see which reforms are necessary to improve the government and his excuse that he doesn´t trust himself with too much power also seem like cowardice an unwillingness to face his demons.

****** I always felt like Dumbledore was simply overwhelmed by the number of tasks and responsibilities placed upon him. He's simultaneously the Secretary General of the magical Super-UN, leader of the judiciary, and headmaster of the largest school in Britain, plus God knows how many unofficial positions. I'd imagine that in that situation the temptation to cut all the red tape and run things your way as dictator /would/ be pretty strong.

******* That´s why he should´ve stuck to one job, all those positions are really important and shouldn´t be held by one single person, what he should´ve done is grooming capable people that could fullfill those jobs instead of him, so he doesn´t leave those positions to political enemies, death eater or just plain incompetent people when he dies or is in political hot waters. For all his flaws, I don´t think he would become dictator after accepting the position as minister of magic. I get his passion lays in the school, but he is involved in so many important positions and has so much influence and uses it, it just seems disingenuous to not become minister. I guess he has mental hang ups about this and he let himself drag down by the mistakes he made in the past, but I find it quite sad that he still thinks of himself as the man who was so easily manipulated by Grindelwald.

** Firstly, see Voldemort. If one accepts that believed in blood purity and wasn't just pretending to manipulate the Death Eaters, he seemed to believe that he had a half of filthy blood but that the supremely powerful Slytherin blood on the other side "made up for it". I could easily see the Malfoys having the same reasoning.

On the other hand, you can make the argument that /Lucius/ is the hypocritical one, who doesn't really believe in blood purity (though he may buy into the fanon "Muggleborns are destroying wizard culture" idea), but knows he'll make better business with the other old families if he pushes the blood purity thing as outrageously as possible and assassinates everyone who brings up his half-blood forebears.

** Also, note how many names on there wound up belonging to Death Eaters. If anything, it set the stage for Voldemort's recruitment. There is only one definite conclusion: Cantankerous Nott was a total POS/SOB. Really, who names their kid 'bad-tempered, argumentative, and uncooperative.'?

** Well, the Malfoys in a lot of ways act as foils and magical counterparts to the Dursleys' attitude of hiding the family shame in the cupboard, so to speak, so it's not surprising that they don't practice what they preach.

Also, I'm pretty sure the Sacred Twenty-Eight is a send-up of /Burke's Peerage/ or something similar.

Pick one.

Its a universally observable phenomenon that the more people want to believe in something, the less they want to know about it.
