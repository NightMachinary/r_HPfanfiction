I read several fics at one time on various sites. My favourites list on ffn us over 100.

How do you guys mange your stories?

Is there an app/software you use?


** Google chrome bookmarks

the folder structure makes orgnaizing easy and it being within the browser simplifies the access.

I know its nothing fancy, but it works best for me

** It's been a long time since I used Firefox, but you may be able to find an extension that let you nest x number of sub-folders in a main one.

For example: Fanfic > HP > HP/HG

Fanfic > HP > Gen

Fanfic > Crossovers > (insert fandoms here)

** Mine is admittedly high-maintenance but I use evernote. I hate not being able to sort the fics I like by ship/tropes/length/and how I rate them. I have a tag system and lots of subsets of tags and I copy/paste the description from the fic into the note so that it automatically hyperlinks the fic.
