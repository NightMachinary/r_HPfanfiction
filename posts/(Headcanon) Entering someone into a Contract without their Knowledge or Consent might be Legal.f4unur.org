I had recently made a post about about Umbridge and her use of blood quills. I had listed many examples to show how messed up the wizarding world was. While writing one of the points in which I was talking about GOF I messed up and it came out like this-

#+begin_quote
  It is perfectly legal to enter someone else into a contract without either their knowledge or consent
#+end_quote

I was told about this huge error and promptly edited it to what I actually meant to say. But now after reflecting on canon a bit I came to the startling conclusion that what I wrote originally might actually be correct.

In OOTP Hermione had asked all the members of DA to write their names on a parchment under the guise of it being a list of members. Instead she had entered everyone into a binding contract which prohibited everyone from disclosing information related to it. Someone who broke the contract would have acne on their face that would spell out Sneak.

She tricked everyone and entered them into a binding contract without their consent or knowledge and when this fact came to light; no action was taken against her. One of the people she had tricked was the niece of Amelia Bones the head of DMLE.

Given all this it might actually be legal to pull a stunt like Crouch Jr. did.

What do you think?


** I doubt it's legal. Only thing that's clear is that it's possible to bind someone to a contract without their knowledge.

#+begin_quote
  niece of Amelia Bones the head of DMLE.
#+end_quote

Most members probably reacted like Harry. Plus there was a war going on and Bones was definitely dead within the 1st two weeks of the holiday.

** I think /legal/ and /magically sound/ might be two different things.

Is it possible to curse a book, so the reader can't stop reading once they start?\\
Probably, yeah.

Is it legal?\\
Probably not.

Hermione's contract might not be legal, but as long as it's magically sound, the curse will take hold. I think it's rather important to view these things separately.

Why didn't anyone report Hermione?\\
Because snitches get stitches. Literally.

** I don't think Hermione's contract is the best evidence. Complaining about her contract would mean admitting signing it which made you a member of a banned club. Not only would the penalty clauses activate but you'd get in trouble with Umbridge. It might be legal, it might be illegal, but nobody would come forwards about it.

*** Hermione didn't enter anyone into a magical contract, she cursed the DA list. And even if you argued that she tricked anyone into a contract, they all still singed on their own and anyone arguing the opposite can be silenced with "but that's your signature there, right? Why didn't you read the fine print?"

***** L'Estrange v. Graucob, [1934] KB and I forget the volume and page number. Signing a contract represents that you have read and understood all terms contained in it.

Wherein I prove that my revision for Law of Contract finals is still holding up after nearly thirty years.

****** Hogwarts would be subject to Scots law, though, not English law. Which arguably plays a probably unintended role in the books, as the contract between Harry and the Goblet of Fire is gratuitous and thus not binding under English contract law. Scots law doesn't have the doctrine of consideration, so no problem there!

******* There's consideration - the right to compete and the chance to win the prize. The big problem is the privity issue: the contract is between Barty Crouch Junior and the goblet or whoever it's magical agent for. Contracting for the benefit of a third party is tricky enough - under Scots and English law alike, as I recall, although I've only ever passed exams south of the border - but contracting to impose a burden on a third party is where you've got to go for something /really/ exotic that Harry can't get out of with the utmost of ease.

(I mean, if I /had/ to construct an argument in favour of Harry being bound by the Goblet, it'd be around the idea of Crouch constituting himself as Harry's agent as a matter of fact, with Harry only unaware of his right to disavow the agency through fraud. He'd be entitled to disavow within any reasonable time of him becoming aware of his right to do so, leaving Barty Crouch Jr. liable for performance of the contract or in the alternative to pay whatever penalty the goblet imposes.

It's at moments like this that I'm glad this came out /after/ I passed exams in Contract Law because the people who set those exams at my alma mater were /exactly/ the kinds of bastards who'd use it in setting exam problems. And nerdy enough: there was a question with bloody /Red Dwarf/ references on one of my degree finals papers.

**** There was no fine print, since nothing was written at all. It was a verbal agreement: Hermione said, "/So if you sign, you're agreeing not to tell Umbridge or anybody else what we're up to,"/ so she did trick them.

So I would call it a magical contract, in the sense that it was an agreement enforced by magic. Any magical contract is, in the end, simply an enchantment that curses whoever breaks the contract. And it was unwillingly entered, since they knew only part of the terms - the obligations, but not the punishments.

  ONE-SHOT. After being entered into the Tri-Wizard Tournament against his will, Harry does some independent research on what precisely "magically binding" means...and comes up with a very different approach to the competition. As they say, the pen is mightier than the sword...but is the quill mightier than the wand?

** You can't bind someone to a contract without their knowledge and consent under modern common-law and civil law theories of contract. Which, bluntly, only go back a few hundred years. There are older theories of contract - even ones that deny an overarching theory of contract entirely like the pre-modern versions of the /ius civile/ - where /consensus ad idem/ is less fundamental to the thing.

** Probably not legal, but that doesn't matter. Because these contracts are magically binding rather than legally.

So while you won't face legal action for breaching them, you're still getting cursed.
