Arithmancy is a lot like maths, but numbers also have magical properties. Prime numbers have pure unique properties, 7 and 3 are the best known for power, other numbers have the properties of their prime factors.

So wizards have magical methods that are VERY good at factoring huge numbers into primes. Which makes it easy to reverse sha256 and get rich with Bitcoin.


** Hmm, well if sha256 is cracked, bitcoin actually becomes worthless.

*** It's only worthless if you spoil that you've cracked it. The key is to keep that shit secret.
