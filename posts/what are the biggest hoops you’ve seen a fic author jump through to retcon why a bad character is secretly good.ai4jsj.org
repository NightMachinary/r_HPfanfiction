I just read a fic where Dobby (the excitable abused house elf) it's explained, was actually a shit-stirring troublemaker who was disloyal and a danger to the Malfoys meaning they had to order him to burn his hands on the stove otherwise he may have attacked Draco and hurt him :( which was brought up as a way to explain away the Malfoys abusing him as self defence (bc they're secretly not that bad)

Death Eater characters hating muggles due to: Muggles/Muggleborns secretly draining the world of magic / being unbearably rude and disrespectful towards Wizard Customs (tm) / stealing the jobs of purebloods / other thinly-vieled justifications for irl racism & xenophobia are all too obvious, but what's the wildest retcon you've seen in fanfic to justify a character being a compete dick in canon?


** Draco gets this treatment a lot. For example, did you know that during the Death Eater attack at the Quiddich Cup in the summer before GoF, he wasn't maliciously taunting the trio as they fled? Rather, he was subtly warning them to get to safety. Sure, they were already fleeing, so as far as warnings go, it wasn't a very useful one, but you can't /prove/ that he wasn't secretly trying to help!

voldemort knows dumbledore thinks he's spying on voldemort for dumbledore.

the only other person i've seen who seems to understand this is Taure. snape's particular position means he can behave however he wants. snape is mean because he feels like it. dumbledore lets it happen because that's life

** Seventh Horcrux ([[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SeventhHorcrux][TV Tropes page]] links to FFN and SB) has probably the best Voldemort justification I've ever read. Tom Riddle only started making horcruxes to survive the deathtrap that is Hogwarts long enough to graduate, and only really wanted to become a professor. After Dumbledore rejected his DADA application, he went off to drown his sorrows and woke up the next day with a splitting hangover to find that he'd declared himself “Lord Voldemort” and started a pureblood-supremacist revolution during the ensuing bender. He doesn't even actually want to take over wizarding britain, but it's kind of hard to come back from that sort of thing.

I really like the thought of integrating the Sword into Harry's arsenal, without it become too cliche or some kind of muggle-wank "Harry's the first wizard who thought to dodge and use hand-to-hand combat" story.

I'm starting to view the sword as 1) a tool for specialized tasks, like killing things that are resistant to magic and 2) a symbol of Gryffindor's values.

It also should be noted that the Pottermore explanation for why a wizard carries a sword is that Godric still interacted with the muggles of his times, and if he ever got into a scrape with them he needed a weapon that wouldn't give away his magic. So take that for what you will.

#+begin_quote
  The question of why a wizard would need a sword, though often asked, is easily answered. In the days before the International Statute of Secrecy, when wizards mingled freely with Muggles, they would use swords to defend themselves just as often as wands. Indeed, it was considered unsporting to use a wand against a Muggle sword (which is not to say it was never done). Many gifted wizards were also accomplished duellists in the conventional sense, Gryffindor among them.
#+end_quote

That's the JKR justification. I think it makes it kind of lame, honestly. Like why go through the trials of getting this cool goblin sword if you're only really keeping it because "it was considered unsporting" to fight Muggles with a wand. They weren't trying to hide their magic or anything, they just didn't want to use a wand? I mean you could use a wand to non-lethally subdue Muggles but for whatever reason you just decide to maim them with a sword? Weird.

Interestingly, enembee had Harry use the sword as a tool in Forests of Valbone and it was pretty cool.

However that Muggles save the day trope persists. There was even a weird fic where Margaret Thatcher came in to save her homeboy Harry. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]]

** Dobby Malfoy:

1) in one fic, Dobby hates Lucious and is mean to him because he is a Black elf given to Lucius as part of Narcissa´s dowry; as such, one time he told Cissy about Lucius being unfaithful to him, and that made Lucius beat the crap out of Dobby because he could not break the bond without insulting Narcissa?

​

2)Another fic: Lucius actually loves Dobby, who had raised him since he was a baby. Once Severus heals Lucius Dark Mark, he regains his mind and remembers Dobby being nice to him, and weeps openly.

​

Voldemort is actually a good guy:

​

1) All Cleotheo´s fics: either the Death Eaters are misunderstood- they just want their traditions to have a space in the wizarding world, which is being taken over by muggles- or the author simply does not mention any racist shit and treats the DE as simply another political Party. She also tends to write Bella as just pretending to be crazy .

​

2)Tom Riddle was very afraid of dying at Hogwarts because Dumbledore hated him and so, one day he made a horcrux almost by accident to defend himself and ended up crazy and leading a racist political group.

​

Dumbledore is evil

​

well, actually, if you put the facts on paper without context, Dumbles is like NOT such a godo guy, so yeah, in my book I think coming up with extra reasons for Dumbledore to be such a manipulative old guy is game. ( I love when he basically is drugging everyone that comes into his office as the sweets he offers are laced with many illegal potions!)

**** You know what? This could potentially explain everything !

1) Dumbles is such a bad guy that he secretely bonds with all the elves and poisons Dippet!

2) Then he starts poisoning the snakes to be terrible and the lions to be stupid.

3) He also poisons Harry so that he get the hots for Ginny and Ron to overcome all his hidden prejudices and get on with Hermione!
