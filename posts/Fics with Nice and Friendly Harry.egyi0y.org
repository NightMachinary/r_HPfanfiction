#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  Goblet of Fire AU: "In fact, Harry decided that he was grateful for Cedric's closeness. If they stayed close together, it felt, if they grabbed each other tight and didn't let go, then maybe they could live through this." Cedric Diggory lives. Canon divergence at the graveyard.

  Prisoner of Azkaban AU: After the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff Quidditch match, Harry finds himself striking up two unlikely friendships. The first is with Hufflepuff's captain, Cedric Diggory. The second is with the Grim. You know, that canine specter of Death that's been trying to kill him. Between that and learning the Patronus Charm, surviving Sirius Black, passing his classes, training for the Quidditch House Cup, trying to figure out why Professor Lupin treats him so strangely, helping Hermione fight for werewolf rights, and more, Harry seems to be in for yet another busy year at Hogwarts. (Tl;dr: an alternate canon for POA, featuring crushes on handsome Hufflepuffs and canine Marauder dads.)

She's very sweet in this fic, to the point where she even becomes friends with Rita Skeeter and tries to include Percy. She's not afraid to apologise when she's wrong. She might be the nicest "Harry" I've ever seen.

*** I like this one but really didn't understand why the /transfiguration master/ couldn't just... human transfigure Harry. It's clearly possible to do so - if people can be transfigured into animals, then they can be transfigured into other humans, including the opposite sex.

I don't know the rules concerning fertility (though I doubt it's possible), but transfiguration of surface attributes and hormonal glands should have been possible.
