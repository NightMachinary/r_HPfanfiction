  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Update: May 2020 --- This story has been getting a lot of new readers lately, so I wanted to let you know that, yes, this story is currently on hiatus. As with many writers, I struggle with mental health issues, but I am working on them AND working on getting back to this story as soon as I possibly can. I sincerely thank you for your sweet comments and patience*

**** Thank you I will give it a read. I was thinking more Dumbledore leaving Harry with Lily's parents, not keeping track of them, and Harry ending up with the Dursleys. Maybe after Lily got married she helped her parents move out of Cokeworth and into the house at Number 4 Privet Drive. And shortly after the Potters either died or went into hiding the Dursley's moved in and took over.

  Thanks to the desperate actions of his wife, Fleamont Potter survived his dragonpox. Now he finds himself awake again in a world where all the members of his family are supposedly dead---except that the Potter family tree tells him that his grandson lives yet. Fleamont sets out on a search for his grandson, and then a quest to keep him safe once he's found him.

** This could make an interesting twist to a WBWL fic. Harry gets sent off to live with his grandparents for some reason while the twin gets brought up by the parents. There would still be some resentment for being abandoned, but since his grandparents are presumably nice and decent caretakers, it wouldn't be as extreme.
