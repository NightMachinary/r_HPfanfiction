I'm curious and looking for a fic where Harry is committed for murder and is actually guilty. I'm interested if any exist.


** Now that you mention it, for all the fics where Harry commits murder and all the fics where he's accused of murder and subsequently convicted, I don't think I've ever seen the two overlap.

"Prison" only has one "i", and commas are needed before "but" and "and" if the conjunctions separate an independent clause.

Three simple errors in three sentences gives me an idea of the quality of writing I'd be in for if I clicked that link!

******* That's fair. I'm an MC in the Navy, and I focused on journalism for my first four years (more or less). We needed to learn a lot about clarity in writing and proper use of punctuation as per AP style.

Commas need to be present if they are separating independent clauses.
