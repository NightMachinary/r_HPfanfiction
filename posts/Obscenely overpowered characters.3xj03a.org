I was wondering if there are any fics with obscenely overpowered characters. And by this I don't mean your usual Lord-of-everything Harry, but like an actual god. It should give the feel as if the main character plays around with mortals just for shits-and-giggles. I don't know if there are any good ones out there, if not, then you think there is a demand for this? (Disregarding mines of course :D )

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

*** I love this fic and the sequels. For some reason, I have always thought Bob would sound like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWn1sbAcs2I][Norm Macdonald]]. I don't know why, but it's always been that voice I imagine when reading this.

** Here's one with a God messing around to fix things, but not a main character by any means: (Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina) linkffn(8895954)

Here's one where the characters summon a demon and become super powerful: (Something Wicked this way Comes) linkffn(5501817)

And here's an incomplete story that is hilarious and totally worth reading that is exactly what you're looking for: (On a Pale Horse) linkffn(10685852)

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** *Elemental Harry*, linkffn(5648259), has the most overpowered protagonists in any HP fanfics I've read. Ginny unleashes fiendfyre and Harry throws lightening and tornados at will. They are also immune to each other's attacks.

*Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650), still in progress, but according to author's few comments, Voldemort seems to be just a pushover in this story.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse). Harry is the Rider of Death. Also Dumbledore's characterization is really good. Not bashing, but he's not perfect or omniscient either; he just wants what's best for the world without always knowing the exact right way to go about it.
