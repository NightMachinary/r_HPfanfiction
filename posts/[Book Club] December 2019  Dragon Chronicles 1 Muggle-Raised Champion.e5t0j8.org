#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

I let the magic of FFN filters lead me to this story. Let's see how it turns out.

** Stargon's writing is impressively bland, but his plots are pretty good. Worth the read.

** I managed to finish this but it was a struggle at times.

The initial setup is the usual over-the-top abused!Harry trope. It does give him a career, which is unusual, but apart from that it's pretty standard fare.

The big twist is obviously that he's not allowed to attend Hogwarts, and the story makes a big deal of how there's no way the magical world can override the will of the Dursleys because they're Harry's guardians. But of course that's exactly what happens with the standard emancipation gambit.

After that it's really just a slog through outrageous coincidences and luck until we get to the end. The friends he's made are pretty much tossed aside and he moves on. There's a sequel but after a couple of chapters I realised I didn't care what happened to this Harry at all.

Pros: It's written well enough that you're not stumbling over spelling and grammar errors ever sentence.

Cons: You've read it all before.

** Hey, I've read that one. It was fun. Is that the one where Harry talks with the dragon in the first task and paints her? And then gets job offers from dragon reserves around the world? I think there was a sequel. Ah, yes it's still ongoing. linkffn(13304763)

*** Okay, so help me out here. I'd actually recently begun rereading this series, and I swear the sequel used to have more chapters. I remember that the British Ministry went so far as to attack the dragon reserve to try to get Harry back, and all the reserves banded together to remind them that they were in fact independent of magical governments. Am I confusing this with another story with a similar premise, or is this a rewrite (because I don't remember any of this speaker FOR dragons plotline)?

  Being a parselmouth, Harry is hired by all of the Dragon Sanctuaries. His new job: to travel the world, check on all the dragons, talk to them and learn about them. The dragons have also heard of Harry's talent - as an artist and they can be pushy about having their portrait painted. With dragons, magizoologists and shades of Dark Lords after him, Harry's life is anything but dull.

** PONY!!! :) I love this story just for the premise! Yes I read it for the initial stuff about Harry not going to Hogwarts! I'd love to read like a FULL story of Harry just living a normal life like that maybe. Or maybe where he does get wrapped up in magic war stuff but as an adult! So it's like WAY later! :) Imagine trying to sell the whole prophecy chosen one stuff to middle management office worker Harry! :)

It'd be kind of like the Matrix. :o

*** i've read a story like that before, actually. where Harry lives as a muggle and wants nothing to do with the wizarding world, until forced to as an adult, and he brings in the muggle government on his side.

i want to say it was by Robst, but i honestly don't remember.

** Hmm...I've reached chapter 6 and I'm feeling like dropping it. Instead of exploring what it was like to be in the nonmagical world for years, it's veered more into OP!Indy!Harry territory - less egregiously than some, but still, he's shaping up to be better off than canon. After spending three years, not in Hogwarts, but in conditions that could well be described as actual slavery, where he is compelled to work long hours while his uncle gets all his salary, he is nonetheless better adjusted than canon and quickly gathers quite a lot more assets.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.
