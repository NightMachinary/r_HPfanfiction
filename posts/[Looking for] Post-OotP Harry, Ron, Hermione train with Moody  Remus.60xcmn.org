I specifically remember a scene where the three are in Grimmauld Place and summon (Pettigrew? or Voldemort? I feel like it's Pettigrew) and forget that between him at point A and them at point B, are numerous shrubs/people/windows/walls/etc and he comes to them in pieces.

Or, they kick the Order out of Grimmauld, Moody is amused, Remus is butt-hurt (but then joins them afterwards), and they yell out the windows at them on the street.

Thank you!

  Post OOTP, Harry is fed up and won't take it anymore. Dumbledore's worst nightmare!
