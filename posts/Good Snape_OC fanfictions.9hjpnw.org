I actually enjoy reading OCs when they are not too boring or text book Mary Sue. I know everyone hates them, but please don't kill me. Did you read any good story with a Snape/OC pairing? Do you have anything to suggest?

The first installment is on both ao3 and FFN: Linkao3(always in your shadow by Arinus) Linkffn(always in your shadow by Arinus)

#+begin_quote
  After the Dark Lord's fall in 1981, more than one child was lost in the spoils of war. Six-year-old Calista, the daughter of the Dark Lord's most infamous and fanatical follower, Bellatrix Lestrange, has been left in an orphanage by her mother's cousin Sirius Black, following her rescue from a mother that only wanted to twist her to the Dark Lord's purpose. The staff at the orphanage consider her both a lost cause and a Squib, but it may take a forgotten, rejected man to save a forgotten, rejected child. For his part, Severus Snape has enough to regret without dwelling on his brief, haunting affair with the Dark Lord's most quixotic servant; but he decides to see, in the aftermath of her arrest, if he can locate her missing daughter. Instead of answers, he finds a haunted, irrevocably damaged child with his eyes and his ghosts, and he knows at once that he cannot leave her where she is. Above all, a realistic Snape's daughter story, as well as an honest depiction of recovery and PTSD, and an in-depth exploration of the mental arts of Legilimency and Occlumency.

#+begin_quote
  Twelve years after the horrible experience in her father's bookshop, muggle Katherine Shepard is back home to start anew. However, a visit from a tall, miserable stranger sends her into a world she never knew existed, changing her future forever. As the dark potions master tries to grapple with the woman he's been forced to protect as well as living a life of a double-agent, his own worldview begins to change...against his better judgement. And as he continues with his plan to protect the world against the Dark Lord and begins to acknowledge the feelings that are starting to grow for a certain annoying muggle, Severus begins to wonder if he might deserve a happy ending after all. ***All 'Harry Potter'/etc related credit goes to Miss Rowling - whom I am very thankful created such a wonderful world full of amazing characters that we are able to play with!***[Note: This timeline is similar to Book 6- and it will continue slightly AU in the future for reasons that will eventually present themselves. ] I live for comments - they are my lifeblood.
