:END:
Looking for a fic where voldemort wins , Harry is in azkaban and he is sent back in time


** I mean, there are a few like that. Do you remember anything else? Pairings, sexuality of those pairings, plot points, etc?

Do you remember how he went back in time? My first guess would be that it's Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches by LeadVon, but that's just the most famous of the time-travelling Azkaban Harry fics for its... controversial elements and balance between them.
