Okay so i have to admit that i haven't gotten into the the show RWBY before, im not particularly into animes so i didn't pay it much attention, but after watching Hbomberguy's critique of the first 3 seasons i was reminded that I had read an (admittedly mediocre) abandoned crossover linkffn(The Wizard and the Grimm).

I decided to take a look again and while i found a few good ones, Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Phoenix of Beacon), I'm kinda surprised at how little there is on offer, considering the parallels in the settings and just how many anime crossovers there are in the fandom.

Maybe some of you guys could rectify that? I really dont have the talent to write a fic of my own unfortunately


** I dislike Phoenix beacon because Harry without magic is not harry +but Harry kinda breaks the rwby setting.+

These two are pretty good/decent, the Harry/winter one is probably the best one.

linkffn(12292532) linkffn(12946300)

â€‹

If you like Jojo or fate they have some good rwby crossovers.

#+begin_quote
  After the defeat of Voldemort, life for Harry Potter hadn't gone as expected. The Auror life wasn't for him, and his relationship with Ginny had failed. Now, as an unofficial Curse-Breaker, a more skilled Harry has found himself on Remnant saving the life of a certain Atlas Specialist. With magic returning to the land, will Harry succeed where others have failed in combating Salem?

  "To the well-organized mind, Death is but the next great adventure." When Harry wakes up in the world of Remnant, he quickly comes to the conclusion that he's either really bad at dying, or the best there ever was.

Well strictly speaking he does have magic in that story although its changed/reduced because yeah, normal HP magic would be totally unbalanced in RWBY as far as i understand it.

I disagree that magic is the be all end all of Harry's character though. It took a while for rowling to coax it out in canon (starting with book four) but he does have some personality, and enough commonly agreed on fanon has built up to give a relatively believable take on Harry as a person.

**** It is a matter of taste, putting Harry in a new setting without magic, the main thing that distinguishes him is not something that interests me, at this point, the crossover element is just a guy that has Harry name and kinda has his personality. A lot of times Harry name is also mostly done to grab readership attention, I would prefer to read about a OC or another protagonist than read about a depowered Harry and there are quite a few good RWBY OC protags fics or other crossovers.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12292532/1/][*/The Return of Magic/*]] has a good implementation of Harry's magic that maintains the conflict.

** I have/had high hopes for linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13512005/1/The-Life-and-Times-of-a-Dimensionally-Displaced-Wizard]]) which is the rewrite of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13428683/1/Remnants-of-Magic]]) which is pretty short itself but anyway. If you can tolerate updates coming at snails pace (or maybe never) you could check it out
