In almost all the fanfictions(and in the original too) that I read people ignore the very long life of wizards in regards to family life. I have read a few fanfics where old age is used to explain magical conservatorism, and yet in family life the grandparent is that very old guy/nice(or not nice) old lady.

If you look at our (muggle) society, people living longer don't just have a longer old age, the age slower, so a today's 40-45 old guy looks like a guy at 30 2-300 years ago.

Grandparents are old in fanfictions... while for wizards they should be somewhat middle aged. I mean, if you expect to live 150 years, having a grandson at 60 you are in the first half of your life.

So Neville's grandma should look AND ACT like a 40y old lady, and the Weaslies? late 20s!

Also, for all the vaunted long life of wizards in general, in most fanfics they actually die at 70-80 cause that's what feels normal to us (Black patriarchs, Potter grandfathers, etc). No, I want to see the old grand grand grand grandfather advising the kids, and the middle aged grand grandfather doing serious adult work cause he's still kinda young and able!


** My headcanon is that Dumbledore, despite being a powerful wizard, has had silver/white hair early because he used a Colour-Changing Charm on it to see what he would look like with white hair and, deciding he liked it, he kept it that way.

**** Nah, it was Merlin in a poster for Disney's "The Sword in the Stone" - to this day he's how I picture Dumbledore.

** I think the movies are to blame for a lot of that. A lot of the adult cast were way too old for the character they played (Snape, Sirius, Harry's parents, etc.), and even more so if they were supposed to age better than muggles. Or, for example, Slughorn is a lot closer in age to Dumbledore than, say, McGonagall (at least before the later retcon), but he looks younger than her.

And with the movies came of lot of new canon on the Black family, like the expanded Black family tree, that made little sense. Some of it is JKR being bad at math. And whoever made the props for the movie didn't question the very short lifespans and the inconsistency with the book!canon.

And you're right, with (at least some) wizards marrying young, we should still see a lot more great-great-grandparents around. That's also probably the kind of slow-moving old wise-/ish/ people that should be on the Wizengamot, not some 20-something "Lord"...

*** You could probably explain the short lifespans away as "accidents" befalling the Black family.

**** Yes, that's easy to explain away, really.

Maybe they were killed off until they supported Voldemort enough. Or later so that Malfoy could get his hands on the inheritance via his wife. Maybe they were cursed with short life or bad health in the past. Maybe they practiced too much Dark Magickâ„¢ or something...
