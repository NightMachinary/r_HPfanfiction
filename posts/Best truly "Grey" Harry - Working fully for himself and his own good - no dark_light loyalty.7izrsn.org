I feel like I have read a lot of "grey" harry fics where the grey is simply Harry being willing to kill or get his hands dirty, but he still seems to work alongside others in grand goals or follow Dumbledore or someone's plans or ideals. Its less, grey harry, and more a "less light" Harry, or a "more dark" Harry, if you catch my drift. Rarely is he separated from one faction or the other in the wizarding world. Rarely is he entirely focused on what benefits HIM. So I am looking for....

A truly GREY Harry.

That is to say, not interested in Dumbledores plans and schemes, manipulation and desires, greater good ideals, and whatnot.

Not interested in Voldemorts goals, plans, ideals, and desires.

Not interested in Pureblood ideology, or Muggleborn extremism.

A Harry who works FOR HIMSELF with no loyalty to either the dark or light (or even the grey tbh) but simply loyalty towards his own good. Towards his wants, needs, desires, and any benefits he can wrangle. If he needs to play one side or the other so be it. If he needs to kill or save so be it. If he needs to seduce or frighten so be it. Whatever is best for HIM and HIS future. Preferably for him, that future would be one where he is powerful (politically or magical or otherwise), respected (or feared), wanted and desired (romantically and in terms of partnerships), or other such things, as well as in a situation that benefits him.

He could be working from the shadows, out in the open, politically, or be superpowered. What matters is he is working for himself fully and completely.

I would prefer romance or pairings of some sort. It does not matter if Harry sleeps around, has women throwing themselves at him, or is a normal pairing but a romantic element does need to come into play at some point. Other styles of pairings such harems, groups, or polygamy are perfectly fine as well, however, no main character slash, please (side characters I don't care). I also prefer more mature rated fics. Smut is welcome provided it comes after the plot in importance.

Thanks!


** But, the issue is a grey(gray?) Harry would totally want to kill Voldemort. Voldemort murdered his parents. No dude gets over that, especially one that isn't averse to murder.

Canon Harry isn't manipulated into fighting Voldemort. Contrary to fanon, Harry desperately wants to fight. He wants to kill Voldemort.

*** Gray and Grey both mean the same thing in the English language. Gray is more utilized in the US, Grey in the UK. Hence, i tried to use Grey since its Harry Potter lol.

As for the "issue" as you call it, thats not necessarily correct. In the books yes Harry has a grudge against Voldemort, in large part because of his parent's deaths. However, a couple points here.

First off, just because he wants to kill Voldemort does NOT mean he's on any side (light/dark/whatever) Him killing Voldemort can easily be because its what HE wants, not because its what others want/expect. And Grey does NOT equal neutral. So effectively, him being grey has nothing to do with whether Voldemort dies or not.

Secondly, the implication that "no dude gets over that" is blindly false. This is fan fiction after all and Harry does not have to be portrayed as he was in the books. He could easily "get over it" as it were and move on with his life. After all, he never actually knew his parents, and until he heard the true story, thought they died in a car crash. Even after hearing the story he did not really start to "hate" Voldemort till much later. And if he was raised differently, perhaps more in control of himself and focused on his own goals or desires?....

Finally, Canon Harry is most definitely manipulated. Would he fight Voldemort without the manipulation? Sure he would. But again, that's book Harry. This is fan fiction. I also do not get how this is in any way an issue with regards to him being possibly grey. Again, grey does not mean neutral, and one can be grey, and still kill, torture, forgive, accept, or whatever it may be if it suits them.

**** Well, the only issue I was pointing out was "not caring about Voldemort's agenda".

He's going to want to kill Voldemort. Even in linkffn(On The Way to Greatness) which has the grayest of gray Harrys, he hesitates to remain neutral, mostly because he has to give up killing Voldemort.

Also worth reading linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom). Pretty gray there.

***** Fair enough, although once again, neutrally is NOT grey. Several people in this thread have made that mistake. Neutral means not willing to be involved in any way. If you are "grey" you may play both sides or even assist one or the other for a time, but only for YOUR gain, and usually with an eventual goal in mind that is for your benefit but not tied into any side. Let's be honest, Harry could want to kill Voldemort, but not because of any agenda of the light or dark sides, but rather for his personal benefit. Hell, he could kill Voldemort and Dumbledore in secret and fill the power vacuum that creates. That's still grey, but certainly not neutral.

I've read "On the Way to Greatness", but not the other one, although as it says "mentor Voldemort" in the description I question how it would be grey unless he's playing Voldemort or has his own outside agenda that goes against Voldemorts. But ill check it out.

****** So neutral doesn't necessarily imply staying outside conflict entirely. It really is not commiting to a side. An example is the US in early ww1. They sold weapons to both the british and the germans.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom is a great Gray Harry fic. The premise is, a sane and rational Voldemort already won. He controlls wizarding britain. Muggleborns are removed from the Muggle World through WYRA, the Wizard Youth Reclamation Act. Talented Muggleborns are adopted by purebloods.

In this fic, Voldemort did /not/ kill Harry's parents. When they found out about the prophecy, they fled the country. They're actually killed by muggles. Basically, Harry catches Voldemort's eye. He mentors him, looks after him, finances him. On the other side Albus Dumbledore and the rest of the Order are in Europe. They eventually make contact with Harry, and he essentially plays both sides.

I did notice you believe in "manipulative evil Dumbledore" (which I'll admit I'm not a fan of). This doesn't really have that, which makes Harry even more confused. Who to follow? The good? Or the man who essentially raised him? Regardless, it's a great read, and you really should read it.

Its been established through (by historical scholars, in textbooks, and the like) that the US was not truly neutral by the very fact that they participated via selling weapons. Maybe there was the perception of neutrality, but it was only that, a perception.

Not exactly. I believe Dumbledore did heavily manipulate Harry, and the circumstances surrounding Harry, however, I don't believe it was because he was evil, but rather he simply believes what he is doing is right. His heart was in the right place but he made poor choices with the belief that he was right, often ignoring hints or feedback otherwise.

I have long subscribed to the belief that Dumbledore fell into the same trap as Grindlewald, and their connection as youths only furthers this belief in my mind. Not evil, but misguided individuals the both of them. While Grindelwald took a much darker path, Dumbledore went the other way, but they both ended up extremists on opposite sides in a way, and both, while not necessarily inherently evil, had their issues. Voldemort on the other hand was truely evil.

Thanks for the info on the Prince fic. I'll definitely give it a read.

******** Yeah alright, I have to have a debate. Dumbledore is hands down, my favorite character in the entire series. I'll cop to some manipulation, but I don't think he "fell" to the idea of the greater good.

First, about ww1. The US wasn't neutral according to your definition of neutral (as well as others). We're not going to reach a consensus on this point simply because we have differing definitions. The US was /officially/ neutral until 1917, since they didn't commit to a side by having Congress declaring war on either side.

Next, Manipulative Dumbledore. Dumbledore isn't ever /truly/ manipulative. I'm going to go over some famous "manipulative Dumbledore" points. Let's talk about that in chronological order:

- Placing Harry with the Dursleys. It really was the best option. The blood wards that he's under are /strong/. Remember, they literally burned Quirrell's face off. Considering that just six months after Voldemort's disappearance, Bellatrix went after the Longbottoms, other wizards & witches probably chased after Harry. Especially following Voldemort's collapse. Harry was best protected at the Dursleys. Also, he /wasn't/ abused. Not truly. It seems to be isolation, and consistent bullying by Dudley that they turned a blind eye to. That's being neglectful and absent, /not/ abuse. To a much more eloquent and coherent argument, I'll refer you [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/fanonvscanon.htm#abusive_Dursleys][here]]
- He manipulated Harry into being friends with the Weasleys. The Weasley's were /not/ in the Order during the first blood war. In fact, they stayed out of it, most likely due to their young children. The closest relatives they had were the Prewetts, Molly's brothers. They didn't really have a relationship with Dumbledore until they started taking care of Harry in the summers. At most, it was just admiration from afar. He was a figure in the community that had similar morals to them. Their relationship with Dumbledore was the same as mine with Barack Obama (my political hero).
- Sirius's trial. "But, Dumbledore could have gotten him a trial! He didn't want Sirius to raise Harry" It's not clear exactly when Dumbledore was the chief warlock of the Wizengamot. But based on the pensieve memories from GoF, Dumbledore was only a member of the audience during the post-war trials. Assuming that Sirius's guilt was questioned around the same time, Dumbledore's only influence was confirming Sirius's place as the secret keeper.
- "He made Harry walk to his death, raised him from age 0 as a pig from slaughter" - Dumbledore didn't really find out about the horcruxes until 1996. He had his suspicions of course, but he tells Harry that he truly only confirmed it with the existence of the ring. That means he probably realizes the truth about Harry somewhere around that timeframe. He doesn't want to sacrifice Harry either. In the Snape Memory, he refers to all the time he spends trying to rid Harry of the Horcrux. He then realizes the best chance for Harry to live is for him to sacrifice himself, and use the blood tie he established with Voldemort.

My conclusion - Dumbledore never manipulated Harry, rather the events surrounding Harry. He set up the pieces for him, making it easy for Harry to take them down. He never once hurt people or society the way that Grindelwald did in his quest for the "Greater Good".

********* I will consent that the whole WW1 does depend on definition, although again I will refer to what historical textbooks say which states that "while the US and its leadership officially declared it was neutral, they did not maintain the necessary components to be accurately called neutral as it pertains to war." But lets ignore that whole debate...

Its a big leap to call it the "best option". There were other options certainly, although not with blood wards. But with the right type of secrecy, person, and a Fidelius charm? Perhaps at Hogwarts or across the pond? Without more info we certainly can not say it was the "best option", merely a good option. In addition, it was not the blood wards that burned Quirrells face off, but the blood protection. COMPLETELY different things, although they are connected in the sense that the blood wards are powered by that protection combined with remaining at blood relatives. In addition, I am not sure of your definition of abuse, but in the "real muggle" world, what they did WOULD, in fact, qualify as abuse. If the child protective services had shown up and found him locked in a cupboard and a failure to provide proper nutrition, throwing aside any possible physical aspects, they would still remove him from the situation and classify him as an abused child.

Honestly we dont know enough to say how connected they were with Dumbledore before the Harry connection. And while I agree "manipulation" in this case may be a strong word, it is a bit unusual how the two sides meet at the train station, and I have found it entirely likely Dumbledore simply asked Molly to keep an eye out for Harry by the entrance. The Barack Obama comment is silly since Molly and Arthur would have met and been nearby Dumbledore way more often if only because of Hogwarts.

As you said, we dont really know enough in this case to pass judgement, although once again the question is raised of, why wouldnt he do more?

I have never believed Dumbledore raised him to be a pig for the slaughter. But I DO believe that Dumbledore had an idea what Harry may have to do and hesitated to train or prepare him because of it, not knowing what it might do with regards to the prophecy. You yourself mention that he only confirmed it with the ring, but he had his suspicions long before that and we can see that from year 1 with Quirrel. In addition, instead of openly talking to Harry, he delays and delays, which seems really odd, even accounting for his whole idea of not putting burdens on Harry's shoulders.

At the end of the day, its obvious that Dumbledores plans are convoluted, excessively complicated, and a bit odd. The question has been, how much of that was intention, how much was simple mistake, and how much was innocent.

#+end_quote

Ehhh see, but even if you say he did not directly manipulate Harry, if hes manipluating events AROUND Harry, which by their very definition would affect Harry, thats manipulating Harry. The argument as to how many he "hurt" is a whole other one as there are a variety of deaths, including his own, that could be questioned with regards to how much he could have prevented if he had been open, and honest with Harry. For example the death of sirius alone would have been prevented if Dumbledore had been open with Harry. Yes its not exactly direct manipluation, but its certainly mistakes made that were due to Dumbledore trying to control events, and guide things in a way he thought was best.

This is why i dont use the term "evil" with Dumbledore. But simply say he was a manipulator and not always for the best.

Also, my favorite character is Luna ;)

First, the fidelius had /just/ failed. Dumbledore thought he had just been betrayed by his inner circle. And he was, just not the person he thought. He had very few people he could trust-the only two being McGonagall and Hagrid. You also have to take into account, he had to do this in 24 hours. When you take into account the betrayal, as well as the existing blood protection, the Dursleys really were the best option.

This is a cultural difference. The "closets" in Britain aren't quite closets. If you quote canon, there's room for a bed, and Vernon, a man of considerable girth, to move unimpeded. That suggests that the cupboard is actually the size of a small room. They had simply given him the smallest room. You're also making your abuse determination from a modern bias. In the 90's when JK wrote the book, the notion of abuse was far different. Spanking was still a reasonable punishment. Locking a kid in his room to ground him was acceptable. Also, in canon, Harry isn't locked without meals, or daylight. He still goes to school. He's just grounded. In the 90's that wasn't abuse. Of course, that's semantics. Abuse is abuse, regardless of the time period. But, what that explanation means is that JK didn't write Harry to be an abused character, just an emotionally isolated and neglected one. If you observe his actions from this point of view, you find a boy who desires friendship and companionship.

How well did you know the headmaster/principal of your school? Especially because Dumbledore is a very hands-off headmaster, Mcgonagall seems to run more of the day to day of the school. Maybe the relationship isn't as far as me and Barack (an exaggeration), it's not close enough for Dumbledore to ask Molly to keep an eye on Harry.

Because Dumbledore actively thought he was guilty. The premise of why didn't Dumbledore try harder is flawed. It assumes Dumbledore knew of Sirius's innocence. Considering the actions that Sirius took, confronting pettigrew, laughing in a deranged manner-screaming "It's all my fault! I did it" as he was apprehended, Dumbledore had no reason to believe in his innocence. Dumbledore is reasonable, and believes Sirius when he approaches him in 3rd year. If Sirius had acted rationally (Hard to do when your best friends are killed), it could have been avoided.

#+begin_quote
  But I DO believe that Dumbledore had an idea what Harry may have to do and hesitated to train or prepare him because of it, not knowing what it might do with regards to the prophecy.

#+end_quote

I detest the argument that Dumbledore should have "trained" Harry. Trained him for what? Voldemort is a wizard that will always be beyond Harry's reaches, even if he were a genius. Voldemort's natural talent combined with years of experience are an impossible hurdle. Harry does an /incredible/ amount of learning off screen. He's a legitimate prodigy at Defense. At 15, he's teaching seventh years. Keep in mind, the average wizard can't do a shield charm. He handles almost all Death Eaters, and reasonably can fight toe-to-toe with people like Bellatrix. While he's never going to be Voldemort or Dumbledore, I image post-canon Head of the DMLE Harry to be among the McGonagall's, Snapes, Shacklebolts, and Slughorns. Arguably even the best duellist they have during the Epilogue timeframe.

What Dumbledore did do is prepare him as best as he can. He helped Harry understand Tom, down to his very core, his motivations. This was crucial during DH, especially as Harry planned his next moves. It was especially crucial for Harry to find the Diadem. It was also how he knew that Voldemort would kill him, how he'd toss aside Snape, how he wouldn't understand Harry's protection on Hogwarts. Imo, Dumbledore prepared Harry almost as best as he could.

The prophecy and MoM incident is Dumbledore's fault, to be sure. Albus does tell Harry that he didn't want to tell him the prophecy, because he loves him, which is believable. Dumbledore and Harry are both close by the end of the series. Which, I think, indicates a deeper off-screen relationship, a more mundane one that Rowling didn't include in the books.

I just hesitate to use the word "manipulate" mostly because it has such a negative connotation. I think the far more appropriate word is, plan. He's a general. He made his mistakes, but most of the actions he took were beneficial, and he was very meticulous in his strategy.

#+end_quote

I am not sure I would call the "marauders" his inner circle. In fact, in canon it is implied that James and Lily are fairly young members and NOT that important outside of being skilled contributors if you will. And the other 3 mauraders are connected through them. Also you yourself said he trusted McGonagall or Hagrid, so why not have one of them be the keeper. Hell, McGonagall herself did not want Harry with the Dursleys. The only argument I would concede here is that because of the timeline the Dursleys may have been the best option briefly and temporarily, but not for his whole childhood. But then that asks the question, did Dumbledore NEED to do this in 24 hours? Surely he could have kept Harry hidden at Hogwarts for a time while figuring out what to do. He literally took him straight from place to place.

#+begin_quote
  This is a cultural difference.
#+end_quote

I will concede to some degree to your points in this paragraph. It was a different time for sure, as well as a different culture. However, I actually spent time in the UK as a kid with family friends in a house quite similar to the canon description and honestly not that far from the location either. I assure you, a cupboard under the stairs is hardly a room of any sort. Its a closet plain and simple but with a heavily slanted roof. I could continue the argument that being nutrition starved, and other elements constitute abuse, regardless of if hes going to school or not, but I feel we are at an impasse here in terms of what would or would not be considered abuse, even accounting for the cultural and time differences.

#+begin_quote
  Technical mishap on my part. I meant blood protection. Considering, as you said, the wards are powered from the protection, the intent is the same.
#+end_quote

We never really know what the blood wards would actually do apart from hide Harry, which seems to imply some sort of Fidelius like system. He could clearly go out without fear, the implication being that he could not be found by those wishing him harm. It is likely it's not just about preventing entrance. Point is, the intent is not exactly the same because of this factor. But this is also a debate that is not really resolvable without more information.

#+begin_quote
  How well did you know the headmaster/principal of your school?
#+end_quote

I am fairly sure going by Harry's and everyone around him years at Hogwarts that Dumbledore would have been seen repeatedly by Molly/Arthur and there would have been some communication as well. I never said they would "know him well", but certainly both would not have been an unknown to Dumbledore and he to them. I mean the school sees him at many meals and he seems to converse with students at times, and show up at sporting events and whatnot. Hes a fairly visable headmaster. And again, we dont know how close hew as to Molly/Arther coming out of school, but we DO know that Dumbledore knew the Prewitt twins well, and this suggests some level of contact between him and Molly's family may have been normal.

#+begin_quote
  Because Dumbledore actively thought he was guilty.
#+end_quote

That still does not explain Dumbledore ignoring the situation. Regardless of if Dumbledore thought he was guilty, the reasonable thing would be to put the accused to truth serum and find out information would it not? Why would you toss away what could be a valuable source of intel? No, its simply not reasonable to accept that Dumbledore believed he was guilty, and therefore simply let him be thrown in Azkaban without ANY interrogation, or trial.

#+begin_quote
  I detest the argument that Dumbledore should have "trained" Harry.
#+end_quote

I think this may be because of the loose nature of "trained". I understand that. However it would not have been hard to train him simply by being open and honest with him, rather than hiding things. By providing assistance as it pertains to mental preparation, historical context, and reasoning without delay and without misrepresentation. It does not have to mean physical or even magical training of any sort.

#+end_quote

This I fully support. You are right that manipulate often has negative connotations. I understand your hesitation and again I want to make it clear I dont think Dumbledore was evil in ANY sense of the word. I do however think his history caused him to become misguided at times, and his treatment of situations and those around him, stunk of a belief that he knew best. Someone's heart and mind can be in the right place, and they can still screw things up badly, and manipulate in an effort to help.

*********** A minor nitpick: Madam Rowling did not use the word “ward” to refer to magical effects of the kind that the fandom calls wards. Hogwarts has “protections”, and likewise, from the beginning to the very end, the protective effect on Harry that relies on the blood of Lily's relative is called “blood protection”, and there are no wards there anywhere.

But, as I wrote already, it's just a minor nitpick.

** Feels like you are describing For Love of Magic... linkffn(11669575) .

Though he doesn't ignore Voldemort, as he is still a target.

Harem fic, lots of smut, no slash. Long power build op that doesn't just stop because the author runs out of ideas once the "training" is done...

I think Harry is a bit "in your face" with his values and principles, but the writing is competent and the take on runes (powerful but dangerous, even the main hero has a price to pay) is one I like.

Dodging prison and stealing witches, linkffn(11574569) si often recommended but kinda has a whole "light/grey/dark Lord" system, so it's right up what you asked for.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** Yea I have read both. Granted I read them a bit back. I am currently waiting for them to complete or get close to completion before I go back to them. Thanks though.

** On the topic of TrueNeutral!Harry and other moralities, do we have Orange!Harry or Blue!Harry? A Harry whose morality is just strange or downright /alien/?

**** I was speaking in D&D alignments (True Neutral being not good, not evil, not lawful, and not chaotic) and referencing the trope [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality][Blue and Orange morality]].

** linkffn(Too Young To Die) seems to be pretty close to what you're looking for.

Harry doesn't give the slightest crap about the whole Voldemort issue, though he isn't the Boy Who Lived in this.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

**** It's kinda a love it or hate it fic. Don't go in expecting a literary masterpiece; just go along for the ride. The first year or so is kinda weird (apparently Hogwarts has more Professors than in canon for alternating periods, more hufflepuffs than the ones named in canon) but it's pretty cool watching how far Harry goes to master Necromancy.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw]])

THis one is good. Definitely Grey Harry and has Slytherin Hermione, Ginny and Luna. Definitely recommend checking it out but its incomplete, though still updated.
