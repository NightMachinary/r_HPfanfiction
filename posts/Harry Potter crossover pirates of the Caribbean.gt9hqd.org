Its been a long time but I just remembered it (and by long I mean like 2 or more years), a part the I remember is that (possibly) Harry and Jack are together (either fake relationship or real) and during a chapter Harry has to play a female to trick some people, and they got Will on the ship. Please help me find this its been so long and now I cant stop thinking about it.

Nevermind I found it! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3153014/1/A-Pirates-Life-For-Me]]
