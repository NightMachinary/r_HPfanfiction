Hi everyone, im looking for some stories were Harry uses/weilds a staff (like Merlin,Gandalf,even something like Lucius's wand/cane combo). I know its an incredibly difficult and unique prompt/request but i thought if anyone knows, it would be you guys and gals. Thanks.


** I know of a few, but the only one I can come up with the name of is linkffn(Betrayed by katydidnt).

** In linkffn(The cupboard series by Stargon1) Harry ends up using a staff, but it is not a big part of the story. And he doesn't get the staff until the end of his second year.
