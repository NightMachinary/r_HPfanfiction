What are the great lost fanfictions you've read? The ones you always wanted to find again and never could? I'm not talking about the unfinished stories, simply those which have vanished.


** I read this story back in the day where Harry somehow joined the Weasleys for a homeschooling session, and it had basically stuffed animals that taught lessons directly to the kids. Molly was supervising and he was really far behind Ron or something like that. That's the only scene I remember.

*** That sounds a really nice fluffy piece. How long ago was it? I struggle to remember the stories I read back in about 2008 (that year in particular for some reason), though I'm pretty sure there were some fun ones.

** I don't remember the name of it, but it was by Moya (i'm almost positive) Next gen, maybe called "the kids are alright" I actually don't remember anything about it except that it made me laugh so hard it hurt. She put out a PDF with all of her stories before taking them down and I lost the file when a harddrive crashed.

*** Goodness, that's a nightmare. Ever managed to find someone who could send you a copy?

**** I asked on 3 or 4 yahoo groups a few years ago, but haven't really looked since. It crosses my mind now and then, but don't have much hope of finding it if my memory keeps mashing up the details with other stories.

***** I might be able to help you here if who I'm thinking about is Maya. She did pull all her stories down and put up a PDF of her complete works. I just combed through it and it does have "The Kids Are Alright". It's not a terribly long story, though and focuses on Harry and Draco, I think? I haven't read it, just skimmed it.

Does this sound like it?

********* Just e-mailed you! I'd recommend reading Underwater Light as well if you haven't. It's novel length and one of the classics.

********** I will probably reread them all. My problem is that I have been reading fanfic for so many years that the plots get muddled when I try to remember a title or theme. Sometimes I will start a fic, then start to remember it when i'm a few chapters in and it feels like reuniting with an old friend. I cried when that harddrive when down. I am slowly creating a new backup with google drive, thanks again!

********** Hi, do you think you could share that PDF of yours if I gave you an email address? I must admit that I'm curious...
