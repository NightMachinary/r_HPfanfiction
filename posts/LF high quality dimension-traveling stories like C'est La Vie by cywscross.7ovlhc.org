** linkffn(Too far from home) linkffn(Delenda Est) are 2 great ones, and while it may seem like DE isn't dimension travel, it kinda is because shit happens and it creates another reality, kinda like how Trunks came back and killed Freeza, and modified the past in the war against the Androids by giving Goku his heart medicine. (if you don't get the reference, i'm sorry)

*** Too far from home surprised me so much!

The entire story (so far) takes place over the time of like 2 months, most of which is spent in the Potter's Cottage, but the story is so riveting. The writing is exquisite.
