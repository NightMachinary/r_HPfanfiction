** Many, practically every noncrossover fic with werewolf!Harry. In some he's bitten by Greyback though.

As for crossovers, I can only recommend *FILFY teacher* by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/4785338/][Vimesenthusiast]]. It has some adult content later on.

***** Honestly that is a major turn off for me. Over 850k words and not even half way done? I'll admit that I have not read it, but given that it's 850k words spread across 19 chapters, which averages out 44k words per chapter. Regardless of it's quality, that makes me want to stay away from it

****** High School DxD, the story it's more focused on, is around book 30 at this point. FILFy is actually really well done, and has a lot of detailed world building.

Although the book sized chapters do get a bit awkward admittedly.

** There are some weremione stories, but they are mostly unfinished and rather terrible (why in the world she needs to have a tail?).
