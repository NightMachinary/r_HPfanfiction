In this one when Hermione does something that changes the future she has fits of pain one of these times is when she was nice to Peter.

And I'm not sure if this was the same fic but can anyone tell me if they know what it is. So Peter calls Hermione a betrayer and death eater and she loses it and at least two other maruders were there too.
