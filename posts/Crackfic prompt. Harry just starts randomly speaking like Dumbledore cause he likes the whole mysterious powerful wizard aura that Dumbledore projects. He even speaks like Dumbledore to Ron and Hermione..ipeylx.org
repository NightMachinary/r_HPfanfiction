"Harry, mate, wanna play some chess?" Ron asked.

"Ah, young Ronald, perhaps I could indeed fulfill such a request. Lemon drop?"

--------------

"Harry, you have to study more, you'll fail all your classes," said Hermione exasperatedly.

"Ah, Miss Granger, you will find that knowledge may corrupt one's soul, especially combined with the foolishness of youth."


** "Did you finish that Divination assignment?" asked Ron.

Harry sighed. "Perhaps. But with Divination, one never knows if one is correct, as any slight shift in the ever-changing randomness of the universe could alter the future. Our time is better spent worrying about the present."

"Er, okay, but did you do it or not?"

"We shall see..."

Ron turned to Hermione. "Do something about him, please. He's useless like this."

Hermione rolled her eyes at Ron, then sat down next to Harry. "Harry," she said gently, "why are you talking like a pretentious philosophy professor?"

"Who knows?" said Harry. "Maybe I'm not, Hermione."

"But you are."

"Am I? Maybe it's an illusion. Maybe this is all an illusion, and we are in a collective coma, merely dreaming of being wizards. We can never really be sure, can we?" 

Hermione blinked stupidly. "What?"

Harry just gave a pleasant smile. "I feel like waffles," he said, and left.

***** "Tea, Luna?" Harry offered.

"Possibly, Harry. If the tea is in fact tea, and not something non-conducive to the having of tea, for example, water."

"It is in fact tea," Harry said, "though I'm only basing that assumption on the observation that it smells and looks like tea. I could be wrong, of course."

"Of course. But in not having the tea, we deprive ourselves of the true nature of the tea, and therefore remain ignorant for eternity. So I think I will have tea. Thank you."

Harry began to pour, but Luna stopped him. "Wait," she said, "there is a chance this tea is harboring a tea sprite."

"Tea sprite?"

"Yes."

"How do we tell?"

"It's difficult. Tea sprites are known to cause irritability, confusion, and incoherent philosophical rambling when in proximity."

They looked at each other. "Better not risk it then," Harry said. "Water?"

** Continuing on from the second prompt:

“You're just saying that to get out of doing your Transfiguration homework Harry” uttered a nonplussed Hermione.

“Quite the opposite, in fact” replied Harry. “You may find that too much studying can lead to atrophy of the brain”, he continued.

“That makes no sense” retorted Hermione, confused.

When you constrain it with your other senses, like sight, like what you read in a book..." - he slowly shook his head - "that's when you tether it with unnecessary...restraints. Hmmm....curious. I wonder if...", he gazed into the distance for a few moments before closing his books, getting up and walking to the common room's exit.

"Ha...Harry?" asked Hermione with a fair bit of surprise and confusion written on her face. "What....where are you going?"

"Hmmm..." responded Harry, deep in thought as he slowly made his way to the portrait hole. "I suddenly find myself quite interested in the ingredients of a treacle tart. Perhaps I can find a list of sorts in our castle's wonderful academic collection? An off-shoot shelf in the potions section, perhaps?"

Hermione just gaped at him, her mouth making movements but no words coming out.

"Off to the library..." said Harry as he stepped out and the portrait swung close behind him. "Of food!" he added and made his way to the kitchens.

Harry nods sagely, "I should enjoy the best of both worlds while I still can, then. My Headmaster, would you care for a lemon drop?"

I've re-read it multiple times too, and I'm gearing up for another reread soon, because I only recently came across those extra chapters on her live journal (and haven't read them yet). I'll read your compilation on my next run-through.

It's definitely still in my top 5. It was the one that made me really take a step back and re-evaluate my reading standards. Now whenever I read something I cant help but compare it to this series. The characterization and originality is just bursting.

****** Yeah, tell people that it's abandoned and they just won't touch it. But it's just /barely/ abandoned. It was nearly all resolved with just one minor conspiracy and villain to dispose of. My opinion is she had a bad idea about Harry being unable to love and maybe there was a bad reaction to it and it just left her unable to finish. It wouldn't be the first good story where the author wanted so much for a story to end well that it just never got done. No, I don't read any other fandoms. When I read fiction I usually go back to Harry Potter fanfiction -- though I did go through the Odd Thomas and Nero Wolfe books as audiobooks. I'm still finding some very good Harry Potter stories to read: Heir to the House of Black, Percy Take the Wheel, face death in the hope, Harry Potter and the Greatest Show, Dobby's Deceit, A Marauder's Plan, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin. Good fics are hard to find, but my experience so far is that they're out there if I keep looking, but failing that, I can always read the Resonance Trilogy again -- maybe for the tenth time?
