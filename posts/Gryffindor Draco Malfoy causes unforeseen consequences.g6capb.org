When Harry Potter met Draco Malfoy, he decided against being in Slytherin because it would mean being sorted into the same house as the blond prat. However, when Malfoy gets sorted into Gryffindor instead, Harry decides that he does not want to be housed with Malfoy no matter the house. This results in a Malfoy being sorted into Gryffindor and a Potter being sorted into Slytherin. Chaos ensues.


** I'd read it. Bonus points for Pansy Parkinson's brain shutting down in confusion, Crabbe and Goyle following Draco into Gryffindor, and Slytherin house actually living up to its reputation as a house for the ambitious and cunning instead of just ((the evil house))) for death eaters in training

**** Ron would be very conflicted.

I dont think he would hate Harry suddenly, and he 'd like to be with /his/ first friend (because it looks like Ron never had a friend outside of his family before Hogwarts either), but he also would want to be in Gryffindor and not disappoint his family.

I now imagine his conflict of loyalties leading to the hat to decide that somebody who wants to make everybody happy and stay with their friend deserves "Hufllepuff". - And poor Ron being not very happy about that decision.

***** What? You mean Ron can have a personality beyond "he's a slimy Slytherin snake" and good at chess? What is this actual character heresy?

****** Ron is one of my favourite characters. But I never liked characters that were not at least somewhat flawed, apart of in the rare instances where l feel like reading power fantasies.

I also think having the main characters of the story in several different houses would create interesting dynamics. And it would create opportunities for each of them to grow in new ways, too. (Which kind of fits OP's prompt of a different sorting leading to unforeseen consequences.)

**** Ron is as far away from Slytherin as is humanly possible. That doesn't mean he automatically hates them like most hacky fics, but the Sorting Hat would never place him there. The opposite goes for Pansy.

#+begin_quote
  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

******** Had to google that. That sounds incredibly painful, so sorry you are going through that.

Getting antsy, have been feeling like crap this week with an incessant dry cough the last couple of days. Everything triggers the cough. We just heard that we could return to work from May, so i reaaally dont want to get sick now. We are on a no work no pay thing, so lockdown isn't that fun here. Will see how it goes and get tested if this doesn't go away.

Hope you make a full and quick recovery from hereon out.
