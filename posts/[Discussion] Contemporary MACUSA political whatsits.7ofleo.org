I know J.K. Rowling is pretty outspoken on current issues and that she's tweeted about the current U.S. president and all that, but I'm wondering if she's reflected any of her views into the wizarding world?


** Haha! /Here's/ a discussion you're not allowed to have on [[/r/harrypotter]]!

...But to my knowledge, no, there hasn't been anything posted on Pottermore indicating how MACUSA is getting along with the current administration. Assuming that they interact with Congress as well as the Executive Branch, my guess is that some higher-ups in the U.S. government (from /both/ parties, mind you) have made their MACUSA counterparts aware that the President is mostly just a blowhard and a showman, and not to let his outbursts interfere with their governance of American Wizarding society.

*** Unless it's another Grindelwald/Hitler situation (and Rowling has said these sorts of parallels often happen) and there's /also/ a loud-mouthed thinly-veiled-bigot as head of MACUSA at the moment.

**** Yeah, I was thinking of the Grindelwald thing when I posted the question.

*** Well I tried to phrase the question as neutrally as I possibly could.

Do you reckon it isn't just the President then? In the chapter with the British Prime Minister in the book I remember his thoughts being along the line that he'd never tell another soul and the interaction between him and Fudge seemed to suggest that he was the only Muggle that was told outright.

**** Well, the thing is, the US government is structured differently from that of the UK. The UK PM is technically a member of both the legislative and executive branches in his country, since they participate in meetings of Parliament. That's what makes me think that the MACUSA head meets with the Senate Majority Leader and Speaker of the House in addition to the President (and possibly the Supreme Court's Chief Justice, when necessary).

***** Hmm... But I never got the impression wizards seemed too overly concerned or interested in Muggle politics and they just went for who they considered the most important person. I think also one of the reasons they only told the Prime Minister was because of the whole secrecy thing. If I remember correctly in the book it mentions that the Prime Minister couldn't tell anyone else because nobody would believe him. Telling the three (possibly four) people you suggested seems a bit risky, with the quite high possibility of them meeting and such.

I'm now wondering if it's possible MACUSA just wouldn't tell anyone? Fantastic Beasts is set a long time ago, but maybe the tension between wizards and nomajs could have remained to a certain degree to the present day.

****** My guess is maybe the MACUSA head arranges a joint meeting with whoever they consider the most important person (or people). Rather than the President, perhaps they meet with the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

"General, there's something you should know. There's Wizards in America, and their representative needs to meet with you."

"Is that all? Well, that's no sweat. I mean, hey, I've already met the Aliens, right?"

******* Aliens???

Now I'm imagining Tom Riddle travelling to Roswell after graduating Hogwarts where he encounters some little grey men...

You have to admit the whole greyish pale skin thing he has going on, as well as the baldness and the no nose thing gives him more than a little resemblance...
