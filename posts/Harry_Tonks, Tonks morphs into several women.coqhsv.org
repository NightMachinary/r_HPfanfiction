:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Read a fic a bit ago on a website called fanfics.me, had Harry and crew as aurors, with Tonks being their trainer, and at some point Harry and Tonks end up in a FwB situation, and one time she morphs into Hermione and has her wicked way with Harry in the auror library. Would love it if someone could set me up with a link.


** Not the fic you're thinking of, but I can think of two other fics with a similar element (Tonks in other people's bodies):

- The Metamorph Bet by MayorHaggar

- The Tonks chapter in It Could Only Happen to Harry by HoosYourDaddy

** It has been some time since I read it so I might be wrong, but it might be [[http://hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=37][Anyone You Want by Strider]].
