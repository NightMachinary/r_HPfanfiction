Christmas, fifth year at Hogwarts.....

The weather was grey, the cold, which the fire in the chimney couldn't keep from seeping through the ancient walls, filling up the manor. A tall man stood in front of the big window, a dark figure against the snowy storm howling on the outside. He turned around as the steps of two women approached him, stopping to bow deeply before their Lord.

Voldemort: Ah, Bella, Narcissa I require your assistence with a-

Bella: Yes.

Narcissa: /sighs/

Voldemort: I need you to summon a certain houself...

.......meanwhile in Grimmould Place.......

Molly: /mixing punch/

Sirius: /entering the room grinning/ Ah, Molly, on Christmas even you and I can get to an agreement!

Molly: There is no alcohol-

Sirius: */groans/*

CREATURE! Where did I put the whisky?....And where is that blasted elf again?

...........malfoy manor...........

Voldemort: I've come up with a brilliant idea to weaken our enemys and finish them once and for all!

Creature: /appears/

Voldemort: Ah, elf! You will take this /takes out bottle/ and see to the order drinking it.

Narcissa: What is it my Lord, poison?

Voldemort: No, far more cruel! A potion that completely fools the mind and weekens the sences!

Bellatrix: /checking the bottle/ Vodka.

.......Grimmould place.........

/everyone gathering around the table and opening their presents/

Molly: /puts punch on the table/

Moody: /looks at Sirius/

Sirius: /shakes head/

Moody: /visible diappointment/

/everyone except Moody still takes a glass/

...........one hour later........

Hermione: /with hickup/ Harry sit /hick/ your golden arse down you /hick/ you're barely able to sit!

Harry: Mione...Mione my golden arse does what ever it want's and I verry much can sit!

Ginny: /giggles/ that's only cause you haven't seen Malfoy for a week...

Ron: /falling of his chair, shaking with laughter/

Harry: /trying to stand up and failing/ You immature...immature ....sandwitches. I have a serious matter-

Sirius: A lightweight just as your father....

Harry: /manages to stand up/ I'm flooing to malfoy manor! Gotta...gotta tell Draco- /stumbles through the door/

Sirius: /actually wants to follow him, but gets distracted by Lupin/ Um Moony?

Lupin: /laying casually in his lap/ What?

Sirius: Nevermind.

Fred and George: /circling Moody, dressed as ballarinas./ ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOUUUUUU

Molly and Tonks: /trying to make dessert and thereby spilling half of the fridges content and starting a flour war/

Ron: Bloody hell, it's snowing?

Ginny: That's flour... wait, where are Harry and Hermione?

.......Malfoy Manor.......

Harry and Hermione: /stumbling out of the fire/

Hermione: Harry don't you dare floo- OH FOR CHRISTS SAKE!

Voldemort: Potter!

Bellatrix: Who's christ?

Hermione: Seriously...you really think this is the right moment to-

Bellatrix: I am the one asking the questions here, Muddy. So who is that guy?

Hermione: my god...

Bellatrix: ANOTHER ONE

Hermione: Oh lord...

Voldemort: You dare speak to me?!

Hermione: Jesus!

Bellatrix: Who the bloody hell-

Hermione: The same as the first one!

Harry: /from the other side of the room/ It's the ciiiiiirceeeelll.....

Narcissa: Wait, what is the potter boy doing?!

Harry: /picks up three wands from the table/

Bellatrix: /screaches/ It's all been a trick!

Harry: I will build myself a broom! I already got these twigs, only few more and I will fly to find my beloved....

Narcissa: /to Bellatrix/ I very much doubt that.

Lucius and Draco: /enter the room/

Hermione: Expelliarmus!

Draco: What the fuck?

Harry: Which leads me to the reason for my being here. Mione, you got this! /drags Draco out of the room/

Hermione: Sometimes I really question why we are friends...

Lucius: /awkwardly cleares throat/

Bellatrix: Now, Muddy....how bout you surrender and I won't crucio you to death but use Avada Kedavra straight away?

Hermione: Ah yes, the negotiator.... But no thanks. Anyway....I um take a seat over there!

Narcissa: Watching you trying to assert dominance is an utterly sad thing to do.

Bellatrix: /coughs/ bottom

Hermione: Excuse me?

Bellatrix: Nothing

Hermione: Now take. a. seat.

Voldemort: Young witch-

Hermione: /deathglare/

Lucius: This is outragious..

Voldemort: This isn't fair...

/grumbling they take a seat/

Hermione: /after a few minutes of silence/ It's really awkward to be the only person who's drunk in the room...would you..would you guys mind...?

Bellatrix: Aw does the little Muddy try to get us drunk?

Hermione: You know that mudblood is actually a very derogatory term that physically as well as logically makes absolutely no sence and therefore shouldn't-

Bellatrix: Yeah changed my mind. Not gonna get through this without some hard liquor.

Hermione: /accioing a bottle/

/the death eaters after short hesitation take a swig/

Bellatrix: So ...who's that Jesus now?

...........one hour, a long discussion about the sensibility of the christion religion and one bottle later ......

Lucius: Bella...gotta ask you that...how do you get all that knots in your hair

Narcissa: /leaning against his shoulder, giggling/ not everyone can spend two hours in front of the mirror everyday, straightening their hair

Hermione: Yeah, curls aren't easy....

Bellatrix: The struggle of my life

Hermione: same..

Voldemort: /hick/

........another bottle and several hours later.......

Harry and Draco: /slendering into the room/ Hey, guys. Did we miss something?

Hermione: /from Bellatrix's lap/ Nah, you're just in time, the alcohol just kicked in with him.

Harry: With whom?

Hermione: /points towards the table/

Voldemort/: standing on top of it, starts singing/ I'm dreaming...

Harry: Aw

Voldemort: of a cruel murder

Harry: Huh

Voldemort: Just like the ones I used to knoooow

Harry: I think we better go now..

Voldemort: Where the blood lakes glisten...

Hermione: /ignoring the protests at her standing up/ Might be for the best...

Voldemort: death eaters listen...

Hermione: And I think we can all agree to keep this evening a secret?

/and so it happened that this evening remained a hidden secret from the rest of the world and so hidden it was that not even the author of the books could find it when writing the order of the phoenix./

/^{no animals nor humans were hurt, only Voldi might experience quite an headache on the following day}/
