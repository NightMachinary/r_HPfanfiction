Albus Dumbledore studied the glossy black door set into the richly painted green framing. A similarly glossy rectangle of wood in the centre of the door informed him that he was currently standing on the doorstep of the Hughes family, so evinced by the neat golden block letters carefully engraved upon it. Behind him, a short set of stairs led to a small gate in the low, brick wall that encircled a small but well-cared for garden. Beyond the gate lay a street filled with duplicate front gardens and apart from an occasional change of paint, seemingly duplicate houses. Albus was in one of the more recently developed parts of London, reserved for the “upper-middle class” Londoners. He would expect that if he were to enquire at all the houses on this street, he would meet many a doctor, or engineer, or professor. The last made him smile, and those watching him then would find that he wore the smile like he was accustomed to doing so very often. Albus Dumbledore was also a professor, though he very much doubted that he would find a colleague of his field on this street. No, for Professor Dumbledore taught a very special subject that very few in England would ever have the pleasure (in his opinion) of studying. Albus Dumbledore was a professor of the noble art of Transfiguration. Albus Dumbledore... taught Magic.

 

Elizabeth Hughes (nee' Garneau) was just finishing up the last of the sandwiches for a light lunch when there was a polite knocking from the front door. “Just a minute”! She half-yelled before hastily wiping her hands on a nearby towel and checking her reflection in the hallway mirror to make sure she was presentable. Even as an attached lady, she paid great care to her appearance, and was constantly reminding her dear Thomas that appearances were very important. Therefore, she (and here dear “boys”) strived to maintain a healthy lifestyle. A habit of hers that her darling Volker was very “appreciative” of. She smiled cheekily to herself before arranging her features as she graciously opened the door to find a handsome man who looked to be in his early 30s. He had wavy auburn hair and a short trimmed beard of the same colour; and as she looked into his blue eyes she was slightly taken aback at how vibrant they were. “Good morning, madam”, the man demurred, his voice carrying despite the low tone that he was using. “Might you be Elizabeth Hughes”? He inquired as he held out his hand in greeting, showing perfect fingernails and unblemished skin.

 

“Oui,” she replied, automatically slipping into her native French as a tingle ran up her spine upon shaking the gentleman's hand. “Pardon me, sorry. Yes, I am Elizabeth Hughes”, she apologised, snapping out of her daze and switching to English. “Are you a friend of Volker's? It was her best guess, for she certainly wouldn't have forgotten this man if she had met him before. However, if this man was a friend of Volker's surely he would know that her husband preferred to spend as much time with Thomas and herself on the weekends and generally only entertained guests at his office?

 

“It is no hardship, my lady”, replied the man in perfect French, once again derailing her train of thought. “I am not a friend of your husband. Which is not to say that I am an enemy either,” he continued with a gentle smile. I am here, actually, to talk to you about your son, Thomas”.

 

“You are a gendarme, then”, she interrupted, her mind instantly making connections between the man's well-groomed appearance, his fluent french, and the slightly electric feeling in the air, making the hairs on her neck stand on end. Then she thought about her beautiful Thomas, and his “gifts”. Fear welled inside of her, as she quickly studied the still smiling man, her eyes looking to his free hand and, finding it empty, to his coat, looking for the telltale bulge that made the man in front of her very dangerous. “I'm sorry”, she stalled, her hand slowly reaching around the door frame to the handle, ready to slam it, just in case. “Volker”, she half wailed up into the back of the house, unable to keep the rising panic from her voice. Instantly she heard footsteps hurrying from the back of the house. A small twitch in her peripheral vision caused her head to snap back. She caught the man slowly removing his still empty hand from his inside coat pocket. He was still smiling, and there was something about him that seemed suddenly not so threatening. Was she overreacting?

 

“Guten morgen”, came a masculine voice from behind her. A stronger sense of calm washed over her as her husband's deep voice came to her rescue. She felt his hand on her back and drew strength from it that she didn't realise she needed. She glanced at her beau as he took in their visitor, piercing eyes trying to determine the source of his wife's concern. “Can I help you? He challenged, subtly shifting her behind him so that he was between the man and herself.

 

“Guten morgen, Herr Hughes”, replied the man in a confidence that suggested he was just as fluent in German as he was in French. “I would like to talk to you and your wife about your son Thomas. I'm here to offer him a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry”.


** In paragraph 1, you use some words twice in close proximity of one another (glossy, duplicate, London and Londoners). Also, a new paragraph should've been started with "Albus was in the one of the more recently developed...". In the last line, you don't need the ellipsis. You can have that sentence be, "Albus Dumbledore taught magic."

For paragraph 2, you don't need to add Hughes' maiden name unless it becomes a focal point later on in the story. Any punctuation must be inside the parenthesis and new dialogue indicates the start of a new paragraph (this is a running theme throughout your piece). After a semicolon, you don't need to add the word "and". The semicolon is used to link to independent sentences that are related to each other.

In paragraph 3, you're missing closing quotation marks after "Volker's". Also, the last sentence in paragraph 3 isn't a question, in which the question mark should not be used.

All in all, it's not a bad piece though I can't make much of a judgement on it as it's so short. I would caution you that the first paragraph is tiptoeing into the field of "flowery language", something that generally is not well-liked by readers. There are other ways to describe different settings without using rarely-used words.

Any idea if you are going to post this on a FF site?

** I agree with [[/u/emong757]] that there seems to be an overabundance of flowery language here. For example, you use "evinced"--I had to look it up to make sure it was being used correctly and in this case it is, but it's distracting when you could just as easily use "shown". Never use a $20 word when a $2 one will do.

There are some formatting issues. When writing dialog, punctuation for the dialog goes inside the quotes. "Did you put your name in the Goblet, Harry?" asked Professor Dumbledore. As shown here, "asked" is not capitalized as it is part of the larger statement. Make sure to keep your capitalization consistent. You have "French" and "french", so watch out for those.

I am concerned that there is an awful lot of passive voice here. This is all telling, not showing. You're telling us about the neat garden and the glossy doors which is kind of boring. You have DD right there--make him experience these things.

#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore stood in front of a door so glossy he could see his own reflection in it. He took the opportunity to straighten his Muggle-style necktie, a device he'd always found extremely vexing. He caught the sound of his own namesake buzzing around in the neatly-kept garden and smiled indulgently.
#+end_quote

The description of Elizabeth is another example of passive voice telling us rather than showing. Why is it important to the story to tell us that she keeps herself well? You have an opportunity for her to reflect on that when she looks in the mirror before opening the door.

#+begin_quote
  Elizabeth heard a knock on the door and wondered who could be calling on Saturday at lunchtime. /Probably one of Thomas's friends, looking for a free lunch,/ she thought, mentally adding two more sandwiches to the spread. "Coming," she called, taking a brief moment to check her reflection in the hallway mirror. She neatened her dark hair and smoothed the front of her dress, skimming her hands over her slim figure, inordinately proud of how she'd kept her figure, even after having Thomas. Arranging her face in a pleasant smile, she opened the door.
#+end_quote

This gives us a more concrete time, something that was also lacking. What day is it? It seems like a weekend, because her husband, assuming that's Volker, is home. Also, why is she French and he's German and they're living in the UK? The reader is kind of dumped in the middle of things and there's not a lot of guidance as to what's going on. She assumes pretty quickly that DD is a gendarme--why did she open the door so readily if they're on the run?

#+begin_quote
  Elizabeth heard the knock on the door and froze in the middle of making a sandwich. She was not expecting a visitor and unexpected visitors were usually something to be wary of. Her eyes darted to the clock and she wondered if she should wake Volker, but she decided against it. He was so tired these days and needed his rest. /Perhaps I should have Thomas open the door,/ she thought as she wiped her hands. /No, it's probably nothing./ She paused in front of the hallway mirror, relaxing her facial expression until she was sure she looked merely curious and not frightened. Taking a deep breath, she opened the door.

So, all in all, I think you would do well on reducing the flowery language, concentrating on showing rather than telling and giving the reader a little bit more background. Good luck on your story!

*** Thank you for the feedback. I'll work on moderating my flowery language. Elizabeth jumps to the wrong conclusion quickly because Thomas' (Riddle's) magic has been manifesting itself for a couple of years now. Naturally, public opinion would be very afraid/hostile if their secret got out. The government would definitely be interested and would certainly send someone to investigate. The chances of her successfully keeping Thomas if that was the case are very slim, so she is naturally a little quick to jump to the worst case scenario. I can definitely show this in the text, as I can see you've pointed out already.

**** That's an interesting premise. What is the starting point for this story? Is this the very beginning or is the actual starting point further in the past? For example, do we see Thomas doing strange things? If this is where you plan on starting the fic, I'd say back up a little bit and give some background. One thing I struggle with in my own writing is not rushing things. Just because I know where things are going in my head doesn't mean the reader does. I have my husband pre-read my stuff and he's good about pointing out something that's just coming out of nowhere.

Let us know if you post it somewhere!

** Interesting idea. Is Thomas truly muggle born or adopted early in life? Personally I like the second idea better (its a nice point of divergence).

I had no problems with the flowery language, but I can see why the others did.

Hughes? Why does a German guy have the last name Hughes? There may be an explanation to this, for example that Volker is actually just half-German or that he anglicized his last name, but if there is not it would annoy me throughout the whole story (I notice things like this as I am German myself). - Also, when he speaks German, please capitalize the words properly (nouns are always capitalized).

I actually am curious about this strangely multicultural family. We have a German man and a French woman living together in England, possibly having adopted an English orphan.

*** Volker anglicized his last name (Hugo) after World War 1, during which he was just a little too young to serve. He carries his grandfather's name out of familial pride, but his opinion of Germany as a state is mixed (especially with the Nazi Party in power).

Thomas is still the biological son of Merope and Tom Riddle. He still has Slytherin's blood in his veins, and can still speak Parseltongue. The difference here is that he was adopted shortly after his birth, long before the trauma he would have suffered at the orphanage.

**** thanks for the answer.

Hugo is usually a first name in Germany, but I am sure if I looked hard enough I could find somebody having it as a last name (only last-name Hugo I can think of is the French writer Victor Hugo).

I think Volker is very clever. He must have been out of Germany well before Hitler came to power (adopting Tom soon after birth means Volker and his wife had to be in the UK and well established by 1927), but just by your description he strikes me as one of those (often intellectual, well educated) people who would have said "I am out of here!" by the time the story begins anyway. - Your Tom is for sure going to grow up with a completely different set of influences, isn't he?

So, Tom is, genetically, canon Tom. You will explore how he changed through having a family, then?

I wonder how much of who Tom became was trauma and how much were genetic influences (several mental illnesses have a genetic component, as do intelligence and personality traits. But nurture does play a role, too, in development!). - I am curious about your interpretation of this, too. :)

*** I thought Hughes was an odd choice for a German last name as well, especially when paired with a super-German name like Volker. Good catch on the German nouns--I should have caught that as well with all of my one year of high school German. :D
