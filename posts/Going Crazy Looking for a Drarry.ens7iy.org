:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
1. Harry is part Veela
2. He works with Draco in the Ministry (I think as Aurors but I can't 100% remember)
3. I THINK the fic starts with Slughorn explaining that the Veela heritage comes from Harry's mother's side in Shacklebolt's office - Slughorn says some pervy things, Malfoy is cracking up
4. Harry's Veela heritage is causing problems at the office; Shacklebolt basically orders him to get laid
5. Malfoy is seemingly unaffected and helps by putting peppermints (which apparently alleviate the symptoms of talking to Harry) all over the office
6. Ron ends up dating Pansy and I think they get married or engaged?
7. Ron is successful and owns his own flying car business
8. Non-Plot Stats

   - The fic was rather long
   - I believe it is completed
   - I did not read it on AO3, which means it probably is not on there b/c I always go there first
   - VERY slow burn-y

*/PLEASE HELP - I AM LOSING MY MIND/*


** This fic is Drop Dead Gorgeous by Maya. I believe it's been removed from the net. If you DM me I can send you a copy unofficially.
