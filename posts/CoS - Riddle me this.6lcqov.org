After having re-read the Chamber of Secrets, a thought occurred to me: what if (with everything Harry had to deal with in the lead up to his confrontation with Riddle) Harry was too late to save Ginny, with Riddle having completed the somewhat vague ritual/process/exchange involving his and Ginny's life forces. Would he - Riddle - have become flesh and blood? Ive read and heard of multiple variations of what just might've occurred. Personally, I want to say that he'd be magically inclined to reunite with Voldemort himself, providing the means for current Voldemort to be born anew with this body of his past and have his soul fragment reintegrated (or otherwise used to make another horcrux). Questions, problems, queries?


** My favorite interpretation is him gaining a new body (A 16 years old Riddle). Riddle would then look for Voldemort, and him having a body, while Voldemort is just a soul/wairth, and will absord Voldemort knowledge and soul.

*** I don't think this is possible within the HP canon. We're told quite clearly that the only way to reunite a horcrux with the master soul is remorse, which is not a factor in the above scenario.

I think the embodied horcrux would simply seek out Voldemort and then assist in his resurrection, much as Pettigrew did... only much more competent.

**** Doesn't that require the Diary Tom deferring to the original? We obviously don't know if there is some in build sense to help the 'master' or original but to me there is a chance that diary Tom would consider himself superior to someone who is quite literally a shadow of a man and so rather than seeking to aid him would rather supplant him. The idea of Voldemort sharing power, even with himself strikes me as wrong. He's too ambitious, of course the wraith Tom still has more knowledge and experience but how does that compare to a functioning body?

***** Firstly I think it's important to remember that horcruxes are not the equal of the master soul. For example, the horcruxes only anchor the master soul to life - they don't anchor each other, nor does the master soul anchor them. The relationship between master soul and horcrux is very one-directional (as is indicated by the fact that the original person is referred to as the master soul in the first place).

Secondly I think it's important to appreciate that horcruxes are not clones or copies of a person's mind. A soul is more than a mind, and there's a good reason why wizards are genuinely and viscerally horrified by the concept of splitting the soul, beyond the mere immorality of the method of creating a horcrux. Though we don't have a precise definition of the soul in HP, it is generally considered your essential being, your very sense of self and identity.

Given this, it seems unlikely that a horcrux would consider itself a separate entity from the master soul or in competition with the other parts of itself. An embodied Riddle horcrux is not a clone of Tom Riddle, it is literally the same person, just happening to be split between two separate bodies.

****** If the diary consumed Ginny's entire soul/life/whatever it was up to then would that elevate the Diary Tom above a standard Horcrux? With the memories that Tom imprinted into the Diary its almost a save point for his sixteen year old self. We know so little about the other horcuxes and their behaviour I hesitate to say but the Diary might well have been enchanted to be special and be independent, would that bleed over to a resurrected Tom?

Obviously in the hands of Ginny it wouldn't be possible to travel but does the fact that it never tried to seek out Voldemort, instead aiming to reopen the chamber of secrets tell us anything? The diary never tried to work its way into an adult's hands and while that might be because it wasn't confident in controlling them, it never seemed to want to help Voldemort other than learning how Harry survived which could be more about self preservation over learning for Voldemort.

Sure, flesh and blood, or rather magic solidified, a permanent transfiguration type deal maybe.

Ha, not a good chance, can you see any Voldemort sharing power with another, even himself? If there were two I imagine, despite fanfiction to the contrary I admit, that they'd decide to take out the other(s), no one commands Lord Voldemort! Though I guess Tom may have been stupid and young enough to try, he'd probably get his soul sucked up by his main body and turned into a new hocrux right after the main guy gets a new body.

*** I see the confusion here, my bad. When I said reunite with big Voldemort himself, I meant it in that their souls would reunite, as one. Call it as a part of the design of the diary horcrux, or even just the will of Voldemorts magic. Essentially, Voldemort would eventually find his 16 year old horcrux returning to him, providing a body and a soul fragment to boot.

**** Seems to defy the purpose of the hocruxes of remaining separate, if it was that easy I could see the fragments being killed and joining the one in Harry's scar, perhaps even the locket and scar becoming one since he kept it around him so long, not to mention voldy passed through harry's body in spirit form in year one without reuniting, seems a thin premise.

***** Sure, there are kinks and quirks with the idea, but this is magic we're talking about. It isn't clearly defined, even with what we already know. Horcrux wise, the short of it all is that they are a means for Riddle to live forever. The diary horcrux is also significantly unique in its function, as shown through its use of communication with Ginny and Harry as well as the potential to how memories. It's never disclosed just how Riddle could've used his horcruxes as they're all destroyed promptly. However, I think it could be plausible for any capable horcruxes to make their way to the "original" soul if said soul was in danger or in need of a form. This is all just theorising tho, I just like the idea that 16 diary Riddle would be pulled by the will of his original soul to reunite and, in the process, provide a body.

** A portrayal that I particularly liked was from linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense). I'd like to think that his horcrux is a separate entity to Voldemort with different thoughts and behaviors depending on his life experiences up to the point of separation. Obviously as a horcrux, he is living some sort of half-life with merely a portion of a normal persons soul and would not be able to last indefinitely.
