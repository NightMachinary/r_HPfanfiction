You know how in Indie!Harry stories where he runs away from Number 4 for a holiday or to do his own thing (sometimes with a pairing girl), everyone panics, Dumbledore (often the caricature Manipulative!Dumbledore) sends people to look for him, et cetera et cetera?

Well...

Harry vanishes from Number 4. People panic, thinking he's been kidnapped. Nope, he left of his own free will. They eventually find him via remote means gallivanting around with some girl, and Dumbledore? He's like, "eh, okay". People are baffled, and Dumbledore explains that:

- He's running around with a witch that has no connections to Voldemort or Death Eaters, and it just exploring his youth
- If he's happy for the summer before returning to Hogwarts and all the baggage it entails, let him be happy
- If they had trouble finding him, there's more chance of Fenrir Greyback deciding to become a priest than Death Eaters or Voldemort discovering him while he's puttering about, globe-trotting
- He's not some manipulative asshole: just concerned for Harry's safety

One major oversight from Dumbledore: just because Death Eaters/Voldemort aren't a threat doesn't mean there are others out there that he wouldn't have expected.

The double-whammy? Harry /was/ kidnapped, /technically/.

The girl he's with? Yeah, she's a nutso yandere-like personality who has something on him to stop him running off, so he's stuck being dragged around with her.

So, the Order think he's off on a nice vacation somewhere -- "young love and freedom" and all that -- while Harry's being dragged around by this batshit insane, loving girl, wondering "why the fuck hasn't Dumbledore found me yet! Help!"

If there's one useful thing Vernon told him, it's "don't stick your dick in crazy, boy!" -- yeah, he's having trouble not being attracted to the hot yet crazy girl dragging him around.

Over time, I could see Stockholm Syndrome kicking in a bit and she drags him around for zany, cracky adventures.

Katie Bell could work, I think: maybe she just snapped, snapped after a traumatic event, or thought "hey, this is my chance to nab the bloke I've had a torch burning for!"

Daphne Greengrass could work too, given she's a blank slate.

Hmm... Susan Bones after losing her aunt? Going nuts/paranoid? Megan Jones? Lilith Moon? Plenty of options for lesser-used characters.

So, yeah: Harry's being dragged around, Dumbledore and co think he's having a relaxing/adventurous time around the world.


** Well, this is delightfully convoluted! You know what would make it even more ridiculous? If you had Dumbledore actually meet the yandere and found her to be a perfectly fine young lady, and even left her some trinkets to help protect them (yes, along with some cheeky items for the other kind of protection).

** I mean, this is sort of the plot of Behind Blue Eyes. :D

Also, it'd be an incredibly funny ending if all of that happened, the Order return to Hogwarts, all slightly baffled over how Unreasonably Chill 'ole Dumbledore is being, only to have one of those 'flying pigs' moments Dumbledore cites to counter the probability of Voldemort finding Harry actually happen and the story cliffhangers on them all freaking out and dashing back for the floo. :D
