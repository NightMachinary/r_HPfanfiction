In canon it said that Harry is basically wizarding jesus to the masses but he never actually gets that outside of colin creevey. I want a fic where Harry has to deal with fangirls or fan mail or paparazzi and the press. Thanks!


** Listen, I shouldn't be linking this story, because while it does have some fresh ideas and isn't the worst mechanically, it's fucked up.

It has what you're looking for, but to an extreme. Harry gets so famous he literally gets groped and raped by fangirls. Not even in a way that makes sense either. It's illogical and one of the bigger 'what the fuck is going on' moments I've had while reading a story.

It comes so far out of left field too. One minute it's a fairly normal story, some interesting things happening, then Harry is posing naked in magazines (while being like, 14) which for some reason makes all the females of Hogwarts think it's a grand idea to grope and rape him whenever they see him.

I really do think the author has some issues, so just keep that in mind while reading.

It has what you require. Different characterizations of some well used characters. It sounds more like a slice of life rather than the usual adventure fic.

** Hey,

that sounds like a SPLENDID idea (because Harry gets to hide from his fame too much in canon, I mean if he literally is the second comming of Jesus (well: Merlin!) in the WW, then why isn't there fan-mail, the press, him receiving gifts for his birthday, chrismas etc. and him getting companies asking if they could use his name for advertising or giving him their products for free so they can say "look, Harry Potter is using this!" etc. etc.) - if I could read the stories on here (this thread) I'd love it, but either the bot is broken or I just don't see it!
