After remembering that Nagini in the Fantastic beasts movies was an animagus, i thought that SHE would be the one who attempts to Reign with Voldemort or secretly desire to Reign alone and using him for this path.

Well, i dont want to display Voldemort as a simple and stupid puppet. Maybe he team-up with an Crossdimensional Dark Witch or something.

Maybe Bellatrix is jealous of said Woman, because Voldemort behaves in her Present, like she is an Equal.

Anyway, i thought that said Woman would get interested in Harry and try to tempt him for "her side". Lemon scenes can happen.
