** I don't mind authors notes so long as they are relevant. So if the author had a few people ask the same question, I could totally see answering that question in an AN. What drives me nuts is when authors leave notes that no longer matter in the story. Like a paragraph about how the next update will be late because of reasons, left in a chapter of a fic that was completed five years ago lol. Every time I post a new chapter for my fic, I update the previous chapter to delete the AN...

**** Yes! Ugh I hate it when there's a authors note at the beginning of the chapter that has spoilers! I mean, trigger warning are one thing (and even that I debate on. If I say my story has graphic depictions of violence or abuse or drug use or rape or whatever at the beginning of the story, do I really have to remind people of these warnings at the beginning of the chapter too? So far I haven't actually written anything graphic enough to be a concern, but I'm really not sure what I'll do if it comes up). But to start a chapter with "Finally! I know you've been waiting this whole time for them to get together, so here it is!" or "Please don't hate me for killing Ginny!" or some other crazy spoiler, ugh!! I don't mind if author notes at the end of a chapter have spoilers, but why would you put a spoiler at the beginning?? I just don't get it!

***** I see end notes more often, but they sometimes spoil things that won't come to light for ten or fifteen chapters.

I've seen at least one fic that ended each chapter with an excerpt from the next -- which would have been okay as a teaser when you're reading it as a serial, but they didn't edit out the teaser after the fact. It was a bit frustrating.

****** Huh. Wonder why the author would put a spoiler like that... I've had a few people that asked the same question in a chapter, and I posted a comment at the end of the chapter saying basically "no this wasn't a mistake, you'll find out why later" but that was it lol.

I've seen the teaser thing before, also drives me nuts... drives me just as nuts when they post the last paragraph of the last chapter in the beginning on the next...

******* Maybe not pasting the last paragraph, but providing a summary of the previous chapter before a new chapter starts is actually a very smart thing to do when a story is in progress. Readers who return to the story when it updates after months won't remember exactly what happened, so a summary is really helpful with that. Plus, even after its complete, anyone who takes some time between reading the fic can use them to keep track of the story progress.

***** For me personally, I like when the chapter has trigger warnings for violence. I like a lot of stories that have darker themes, but I just really can't stomach the violence that goes along with that.

****** In your opinion, what's the best way to give a warning without spoiling the chapter? Would you just put "trigger warning apply" or something vague at the beginning of the chapter, or would you prefer something more specific like "this chapter has sections of extreme graphic violence". Especially for stories with multiple warnings? I always feel a bit bad about the warnings on the fic I'm currently writing. It's not a dark fic, but I show Death Eater meetings and raids, and those can get... messy.

******* I think the best experience I had reading a fic that had extremely graphic violence the author would put a page break before and after the scene with a set pre determined pattern that she noted in the authors note that meant trigger warning for violence. For example at a page break if there was a ********** instead of qpqpqpqpqp I knew that I should skim , or skip altogether that scene. Though I could see that being something that takes away from the immersion in the story and having a note just at the top would be the least intrusive way still have a warning, I think as long as you don't say xyz happens to someone in this chapter and just say extreme violence occurs be warned, it doesn't actually spoil anything, but is sufficient warning - for me at the very least.

******* What I often see on AO3 is that authors will say, in the pre-chapter AN, that specific spoilery trigger warnings are in the post-chapter AN. That way, you can scroll down to see the warnings if you want to or ignore them otherwise.

** I've complained to authors about this before. Truthfully, I only think it's done to pad word counts. Because really, if you actually cared enough to have dialog with the author (or reader, if you're the author) about a certain aspect of the story, you could just PM them. The last time I complained about this, the author of the story actually went through and removed them all.

I also make sure to include WHO I'm talking to if it's something specific - oh and their actual question.

With this though, I try to keep the length of these notes to under 10% of the overall chapter. I also go through after the fact and remove them when we're further along in the story as a lot of the questions asked are no longer relevant.
