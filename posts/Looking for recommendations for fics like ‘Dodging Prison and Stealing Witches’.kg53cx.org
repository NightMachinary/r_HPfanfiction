** If it is a WBWL fic you want linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) is your answer if you are looking for a powerful Harry and are ok with Fem!Harry then linkffn(The Odds Were Never in my favour by Antony444) should float your boat.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

I would say that this one /almost/ fits, it's a slytherin fem!Harry that gathers a posse of followers. the crossover comes into play during the end-phase of the Harry Potter story if one ignores some 'lost magic'...
