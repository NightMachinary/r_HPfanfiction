Possible ways it could play out: Deckard is training Harry in the ways of the Horadrim in case the forces of the Burning Hells make their way to Earth; or perhaps there is no threat of infernal invasion, and the old guy's just enjoying his impromptu retirement while passing on his vast wealth of arcane lore and obscure knowledge onto the next generation.

*** Or maybe he stays awake to pick out the inaccuracy in Binn's class since Cain already told him how the Nephalim put down the last goblin rebellion in kick ass fashion.

** Dude when he gets to 3rd year he can use the Horadric Cube for alchemy, runes, potions, and enchanting. Deckard spent a lot of time teaching him recipes after all.

** Hah that sounds like it could be interesting I love stories that have Harry taught other kinds of magic by characters from elsewhere. Not sure on the threat of infernal invasion, I mean that's cool too I suppose, but just seeing Harry going through the wizarding world as a walking OCP is always fun enough. I'ma just going to camp out in this thread in case someone decides to start writing something.
