JK is an amazing author, and she created the weird and wonderful wizarding world and what not, but the little details kinda suck. Why is the school a castle, with so few students, teachers, and classes? Why is there only one school? Why are the wizards stuck in the Middle Ages? Magic would make society more advanced, not less. Elevators, skyscrapers, portable communication devices, long distance ocean voyages, space travel. All of it would be so much easier with magic. What does everyone else think would happen to a society with magic?

Does anyone know of any stories like this, or interested in writing some kind of magic/fantasy/sci-fi hybrid fic?

(Edit: Doesn't have to fulfil any of these things specifically, they're just examples/suggestions)


** I very much enjoyed Runaway Dragon. Which... Kind of makes magic a bit more everyday? It's just about playing football and hanging out with friends. But it does feature another school in hogsmeade and Hogwarts is actually a very expensive boarding school that most people don't go to. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12867188]]

  (Continuation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) It's easy to make big plans and ask big questions, but harder to follow them through. Find out what happens to Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, Hermione, Draco, and everyone else once they grow into their roles as leaders, leave the shelter of Hogwarts, and venture out into a wider world.
