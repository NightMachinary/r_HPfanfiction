I have read quite a few fanfics, and it differs greatly how fast paced the story is written. I personally hate stories where a situation is resolved in a few lines.

I want a background for it, a reaction to it, a thought process about it and an action resolving the issue. For instance there's the age old thing about him suddenly losing his glasses. So apparently in about 5 lines Harry suddenly knows he can cure his vision and does it? Really?

Well, enough about how I feel. How do you feel? How much should happen in a thousand words or ten thousand?

I ask because it is an interesting question to ask people who've read a multitude of stories, and because I am concerned my own story is too slow paced.


** You might be asking the wrong question. It might be appropriate to have the problem be explained thoroughly if it's important to the story or if it sets a certain mood--essentially, it has a purpose of being there. But if it's not important, then maybe its part could be shorter or the passage shouldn't even be there at all. You can't explain or show everything in a story, nor should you. Time is a delicate quality. If you're worried about your own story, I find it's best to step away from the story for awhile and then reread it with a fresh mind, so the pacing has time to "reset."

Me personally, I like the feeling of a story constantly moving forward, be it slow or fast, as long as I feel like there's a destination at the end.

** Novel-length is a preference for me, and if a plot point is meant to be significant, then it should take a while to set up and resolve.

** For me, I'm not bothered by pacing at all really, which causes a lot of problems in my own writing because when I get bored or dont have time I just make things happen. Its a habit I'm trying to break but its a tough to beat, so I dont give much flack for others when they do it.

** Its an interesting line to walk. For instance, the highly acclaimed Methods of Rationality basically have Harry the First year revolutionize everything within a week or two, which, ugh.

On the other hand, the actual books would have big stretches where nothing happened.

*** Yeah, well. The actual books have the big problem of nothing really happening all the way though them. What many writers do, is make Harry a person that changes the society, often for the better, instead of just following around in the tracks of other men.

** Well, that's a very vague question, and I could give you many different answers. I suppose it depends on the genre, mostly, as well as writing style, characters, my own mood, etc.

Thinking of my favorite stories, the pace varies quite a bit. Some stories cover several months in a matter of pages, and others stretch an hour or two over twenty chapters. On the whole, I guess I'd say that I gravitate towards stories with slightly slower pacing.

*** My problem is not skipping time, sometimes that have to happen. My problem is when things that are seemingly incredibly complicated are resolved in the matter of a few lines.

I gave an example with the glasses. LetÂ´s have another. You say it depends on the genre. Let's think romance then. Do characters who don't know each other suddenly discover they like each other, and as soon as they kiss everything is just peachy and/or rolling like an avalanche? I would in those cases have the characters get to know each other, and in no way would I think the story would be sufficient if everything was suddenly peachy between them and the outside world. I mean just because you have the two characters kiss or make out doesn't mean you can suddenly change everything between them. I have read a H/HR fic or two where as soon as they become a couple they tell each other EVERYTHING and they have no problems between them. They treat the characters almost as if it is one person. Why do they do that? Well, instead of a conversation where they have them talking back and forth they can gloss over it by having them say "ok" and then move on.

**** I think your problem isn't that you don't like fast pacing. It's that you don't like poor writing.

**** I agree with someorangirl, but i would also like to add that fanfiction by its very nature is teenage driven, both in mind-set and fantasy. In the teenage world relationships are a big blind spot where one kiss can equal love and 'let me tell you my deepest dark secret person I've hated till today', and sometimes you just have to roll with it if the overall story is worth it.

** Okay then let me ask you this. Would it be too slow pacing if you had Harry talk to the proprietors instead of just writing the results of his shopping trip?

*** That would really depend. None of us could give you a good answer without reading the story in question. If you want to share something for critique, perhaps you could start a new thread?

**** I agree. Maybe a customer's conversation with the store proprietor contains an important plot point. Maybe it serves to illustrate some condition of society the author wants to convey. Or maybe it just sucks the air out of the room. There's no hard and fast rule.

**** yes, well I will. I just have to be done with the whole pre-returning to Hogwarts time. Which may or may not be ten thousand words more. I just don't want to show people something that feels as if it is leading up to something that is missing.

I always try to find and read epics, so it will naturally be an epic I am looking to write. Of course in this regard I mean length wise, but a man can hope that it will be on more points than one :)
