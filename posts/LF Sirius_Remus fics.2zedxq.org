So I just read [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1651109/chapters/3501239][Text Talk]] out of pure curiosity, and now I think I'm starting to ship Sirius/Remus. Now I need all of the fluffy fics with these two asap to feed my addiction. (Thanks in advance?)

** Text Talk is amazing! It's the only modern AU I've ever read, but I absolutely melted. When I found it on Tumblr, I didn't think I would actually wind up reading an entire story...but I couldn't put it down.

Anyway, to answer your question, THE quintessential Wolfstar fic is "Shoebox Project". You'll have to Google it because it isn't on a website, but you'll find a link to download a PDF. It was written before DH, but it does a pretty good job sticking to canon. I read it on the way to LeakyCon last year, and maybe it was just the fond memories of going to a Harry Potter convention, but I absolutely love that story. Haven't read too many other Wolfstar stories, so I'm curious to see what also get recommended.

Warning: rape, violence.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10775981/1/Matters-Of-The-Heart][Matters of the Heart]] - Remus struggles with his feelings for a certain charming wizard and Sirius is as ignorant as ever. But what will happen if they follow their feelings, but still put their trust in the wrong person? SLASH (AU ending)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10622307/1/This-is-You-and-Me][This is You and Me]] - Sirius listened to Remus's heart beat slow down, returning to its normal pace. 'I meant it, you know. Even when I gave it to you, I just wanted you to know,' He brought Remus's hand to his lips and kissed it, 'that this is forever. We are forever.'

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7519003/1/Highland-Fling-podfic][Highland Fling]] - 2004, non-magic AU: The summer before college, Sirius goes backpacking through Scotland to escape his family's expectations. In a small village in the Highlands, an unexpected flirtation turns his whole world upside down. Alternately, the story of how Scotland loves Remus and wants him to be happy. Edited Sept 2014, with new Ch 11 added, podfic available at AO3.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10350781/1/The-Sickness-Unto-Death][The Sickness Unto Death]] - University AU. Sirius is not keen to take notes for the sick, sweater-wearing boy in his Gender Studies class.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8926554/1/Wolfstar][Wolfstar]] - Remus and Sirius have been friends since they met at Hogwarts. That's all they've ever been. Until Remus' seventeenth birthday - during sixth year. So, what happens after the two make their feelings known? What will the two face along the way? Will they be able to cope? But most importantly, how will their friends and Remus' family react? Because we all know Sirius won't tell his.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7869001/1/Backwards-Desire][Backwards Desire]] - "Think about it Evans, were almost one in the same. Denying ourselves something we want, just because we might get hurt" After a drunken mistake can Sirius fix his and Remus' friendship and maybe make it something more? Maruaders Seventh year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7785242/1/The-Pursuit-to-Slow-Realisation][The Pursuit to Slow Realisation]] - Remus has always had bad taste in men and he tops the polls when he starts to find Sirius Black attractive. Sirius is pompous, loud, plays horrible pranks and is ridiculously flirtatious. Worst of all, he is Remus's best friend. Muggle AU.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6787968/1/Between-Dreams-and-Reality][Between Dreams and Reality]] - Amber eyes, pale skin, and whispered love confessions: they were fine as dreams. But when Sirius finds himself drawing closer and closer to a point of obsession, he knows he has no choice but to push against the thin barriers between dreams and reality.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3378356/1/Casting-Moonshadows][Casting Moonshadows]] - Lonely and outcast by his classmates, Remus wishes on a moonshadow for a friend who understands him. To his amazement his wish is answered not once, but three times, by his former enemies, the Marauders. SBRL and some JPLE as well, of course.

I haven't read some of these fics in a while, so I can't really remember how fluffy they are. I do remember enjoying them all though - Remus/Sirius makes up most of my favourites list. Casting Moonshadows is definitely not fluffy, it's extremely angsty, but it is a brilliant story. It's unfortunately not complete and updates very rarely, but I'd still say it's worth reading. Hope you like them. Also, thank you for mentioning Text Talk, I'd never heard of it before and just spent the last few hours reading it and giggling at the adorableness.
