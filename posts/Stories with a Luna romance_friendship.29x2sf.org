Preferably stories where she isn't as crazy as she pretends to be.

Having recently finished [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]] and it's sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3759007/1/Turn-Me-Loose-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Turn Me Loose]] (both highly recommended), I have something of a Luna fascination.

Any recommendations are appreciated.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] has one of the best Luna characterizations ever. This is a story without a real main character, and is totally awesome (wildly AU though).

... and Luna isn't crazy. She's just different. How dare you.

*** I apologize for my ignorance, oh great Walrus. I seek only to learn, to mend my ways, and to gain a better understanding of all things 'Luna'.

**** Between stages of hope and the other stories here, you're covered :)

Luna, unfortunately, is by far the trickiest HP character to write and most fanfic authors that try fail spectacularly. It's a shame because I absolutely adore her.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood][Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood]] is pretty funny.

#+begin_quote
  It takes two thieves, a Dark Wizard, and a Tentacle Monster named Tim.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][The Firebird Trilogy]] has eventual Harry/Luna, but the premise of this fic is what really sets it apart. I'd encourage you to give it a few chapters to wet your feet. I wanted to not like it, but it was so well written that I loved it.
