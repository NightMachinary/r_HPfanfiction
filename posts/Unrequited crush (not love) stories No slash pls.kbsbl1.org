I love the romcom type stories where you're rooting for the characters to get together and will continue to read them. I just would like something different than 'X likes Y. Y suddenly notices X has morphed into the prettiest girl in the school. They get together.' I'd like to see a story where a character gets rejected and how they cope with the feelings of rejection. Can be short or long, funny or serious, and would like to read from Harry's era not the Marauder's era. No slash please.

And I don't mean unrequited love/deep feelings like Merope/Tom Riddle Sr in canon (not sure if that's the best example).


** I remember reading one where adult harry gets sent back in time and becomes the defense prof and McG has a thing for him but they never get together. Cant remember the name though

*** Don't know about going to the past, but I think one of the NonJon "Where in the World is Harry Potter?" parts has this.

How do we activate the spoiler thing?
