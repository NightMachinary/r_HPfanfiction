  It might never have happened. In fact, it was a decision she nearly didn't make, and yet she did. See how everything can change when Dumbledore's Army recruits a Slytherin member, Daphne Greengrass, who just wanted to pass her O.W.L's.

** The Legacy by storytellerspw linkffn(9774131).

The story unfortunately hasn't been updated in 3 years but the 732k words do give the reader a lot to enjoy. I am not much for romance in my stories but when it finally did happen I was ecstatic.

Caution. This is about as slow of a burn as you can get. I hope you enjoy the story and please leave the author a review or two if you get the chance. Maybe we can lure them out of hiding and get the last few chapters.
