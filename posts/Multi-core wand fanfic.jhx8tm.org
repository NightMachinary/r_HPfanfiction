:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This is repost, since my search is still on.

The fic that I am looking for specifically is one where Ollivander gives him a multi core wand that is apparently one of his most ridiculous creations and has 3 wand cores (I may be off on the number here). Apparently it is a very volatile thing and he even goes in to explain that the magical backlash could have taken out half the Alley if it had gone wrong. Also, he mentions that Grindelwald also had a multi core wand.

I seriously need to find this fic now cause it's been stuck in my head for a long while now..

  This story is dead and WILL NOT BE UPDATED. It may be rewritten at some point, but that is a very far off thing. Check my profile.
