So, I'll admit it to the World Wide Web. I intentionally scour through Google and AO3 and FFN for Abused!Harry fanfiction. Usually at 2 in the morning in bed with my cat after a rough day. It's an overdone trope, I know. I can't even put a finger on why I keep searching for it. The best explanation is that I'm looking for the gritty reality of what a “real” Harry Potter-esque 11-year-old boy would have to go through in an an abusive household - something Rowling simply couldn't address, at least directly, in a children's book, but only hint at the horror. So, fellow fanfictioneers, any favorite recommendations? Here are some of mine. I'll admit I'm still trying to figure out this Bot linking thing.

  Oneshot, Abused!Harry. Before Hedwig the owl, there was Alastair the spider. In an unforgiving household, 10-year-old Harry has no one else who cares whether he lives or dies. He'll need every ounce of vigilance if he is to survive. Warning: descriptions of physical child abuse.
