  I have always wanted to think of how a dystopia in a magical world would be like. How much worse it could be.

  That would be extremely horrifying given that memory charms exist.

      Harry Selwyn is happily feeding mudblood artefacts into an incinerator, as he has done as a career his entire adult life (which was not as impressive as it sounds, being only 21). He flips open a rusty old tin box to pour out its contents, when... something stops him. A familiar face in a photograph, nestled between a red and gold scarf and a battered, well-used copy of Hogwarts, A History - a book which has been made illegal for its many outright fabrications.

      Its his face.

      He frowns, and plucks the photograph out of the box. It does indeed appear to be him, seated at a table in the Three Broomsticks with a bushy haired girl and a ginger bloke. They were laughing, clearly having a wonder of a time. Harry doesn't recognise either of them.

      He flips the photo around, and notes the date scrawled on the back. He shakes his head and scoffs. Must be some cursed mudblood crap, designed to cause discord in the minds of good, honest purebloods.

      He tosses the photo into the incinerator cheerily, shortly followed by the scarf and the offensive book.

      After all, Harry Selwyn knows exactly where he'd been last Friday. He'd been here, shredding mudblood memorabilia like he always has been.

** Here's my alternate hopeful ending. I have put it in spoiler tags so that if you want to keep the overwhelming despair from the original piece you can.

        Sorry If this dilutes your work but I'm in a bad place and needed to add a slightly happier ending.

        The sound of a loud thump indicated that it was time to do his least favorite part of the job - burning the portkeyed in bodys of mudblood terrorists. He didn't hate the job because of the sight of dead mudbloods, no the reason he hated it was he had to go through pockets and find their wands (no doubt stolen) and move them to the incinerator - all by hand of course, couldn't let his magic get dirtied by their corrupted magic could he.

        He turn to the pile and starts his routine, He picked up a blond girl with weird earrings, frisks her for a wand and into the fire she went. This went on for awhile, until he was down to two bodies... there's those people. He shrugged it off and started on the ginger. Wand? check. Body in the fire? check. Body burning into ash? Wait... Wha- and that was the last thought of Harry Selwyn as Hermione stunned him in the back.
