I remember a scene where Draco tries to get him banned from Quidditch for having wings but fails as harry didn't use his wings under the game. I think Harry used his wings to save someone right after the match ends. I also think his eyes got healed by whatever gave him the wings or at least they got healed and "better" in some way.

Do any one know the fic?

EDIT: (Additional info I remembered that might be relevant for the fic) IF I remember right this fic starts in 6th year or something. this change with the wings is something that happened over the summer. I think the summer is part of the fic and that it might go over several years.


** Two stories come to mind, linkffn(On Crimson Wings by Contramancer) and linkffn(Cold blood by DerLaCroix). Wings? Both check. Improved eyesight? Both check. Quidditch ban? No, not really.

  Response to GoldenSteel's My gf is a what? challenge. GoF: Hermione has a secret. One that even she doesn't know. When she unearths a highly dangerous ritual to help Harry in the first task, the two of them never expected that secret to hit them both and change them into Great Dragons! Are they doomed to be treated as beasts? What does this mean for the TWT? H/Hr; AD/RW/MW putdown.

** Might also be linkffn(6307611). Takes starts in the summer before 6th year. Not sure if there's any attempted quidditch ban. Harry/Daphne pairing, since you didn't mention any pairing.

** Could this be With Strength of Steel Wings? It has been ages since I read that though.
