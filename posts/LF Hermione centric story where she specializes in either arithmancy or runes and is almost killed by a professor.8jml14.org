I may be mixing plot lines, but I remember a story where Hermione is using either runes or arithmancy and is a prodigy at that branch of magic. She uses a special chamber at Hogwarts, and the professor of that subject compromises the safety of the chamber to attempt to kill Hermione (unsuccessfully). The teacher ends up being a Death Eater or at least a Voldemort supporter. I think it ends with Hermione defeating Voldemort by solving a puzzle/equation/rune whatever in Dumbledore's office while the final battle is taking place.

Thanks in advance if you can point me to the right story!


** I don't know what this fic is, but It's not the arithmancer, I'm pretty sure.

** Some elements you describe seem to loosely fit linkffn(Patron by Starfox5), but I don't know of any single story that has all those elements.

Was there a 'ship in a story? That might help narrow it down.

** probably talking about Arithmancer by white squirrel I cant say for certain because I didn't read past like 10 chapters when I realized Hermione was an emotionless hunk of a human being in that fic

*** Yea, her being so "logical" bordered on (if not strutted naked into) sociopathy.

*** I stopped because everyone except Hermione was borderline useless and the author insisted on writing useless elements like her going to beauxbatons or homeschooling for the sake of "realism" instead of putting her where the plot needed her to be.

It's an interesting concept and the writing is fairly good but when an author writes 500k words when 200k would tell the same story better just because they let their characters wander around any regard to plot or character development, it's a shortcoming of the author. It's not a side effect of "the muse" or creativity or what have you. It's a lack of discipline.

** I found one of the stories! I was mixing plot lines, but the one where she uses an arithmancy chamber is linkffn(Where No Shadows Fall by Saavik13). When I find the one where she defeats Voldemort with a puzzle in final battle I'll post again. :)

  "If I do this, you won't have done anything, Harry. You won't exist. You'll probably never exist." Hermione coughed roughly, the damp irritating her lungs. "None of this will have happened." Hermione has lost everyone and everything in the war. Left with only one terrible choice, she honors Harry's sacrifice and goes back to change history. Reposted from AO3
