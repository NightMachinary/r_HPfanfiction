I was thinking of writing a fic that completely changes how the magical world works, to make it more fantasy setting and add a lot of magic from other media into it. This would also change some of the characters to do different things and have different roles. I would keep characters acting the same but they might do different things (like if I removed quidditch, characters like Oliver wood might be a dueling captain for a team or something)

I would keep the muggle world the same so harry and all muggle-borns would be in character but experience a different world.

Would this be too much of a change or would it be okay?


** I generally prefer bigger AU's over all the canon rehash that's out there, as long as it's done well.

For example, i really loved the idea behind 'Firebird's Son' which is pretty much the biggest AU i've found so far. The plot bored me a little and i didn't like the idea that everything the characters do was already decided because of various prophecies and visions and i could go into a philosophical rant about the nature of free will and "fate" but that's beside the point.

I liked the idea of a matriarchal society in that fic, how love was viewed and how different witchborns where from muggles. It still stayed true to the characters i love and just put them into a vastly different setting that was still familiar enough to interest me.

So yes, if you put enough thought into to make it consistent and interesting i would very much like to read your fic. What is important however is that you don't just change the world but keep the plot essentially the same. I've read stories where some things would greatly differ from the canon world but the characters acted exactly the same and the plot was pretty much exactly the same as in canon.

If you go through all the work of creating a different world then make sure that everyone and everything else also gets adapted to that new world. I'm not saying your characters have to be completely OOC and your plot completely new but they have to be adapted to the new circumstances you put them in.

** Go for it. I personally prefer fics that play around with elements from canon. Take them to extreme, twisting, filling gaps etc. But heavy AU it's interesting too - if the worldbuilding is good. Especially when we consider high amount of generic indy Harry and canon rehashes out of there.

I only hope that you will keep good elements of the magic system from the books. Too much fics completely screw this up.

*** I am just worried that I am going over the top. I would be making new classes, professors teaching different classes. (Example would be having a different Herbology class, which would fuse potions and canon herbology, and have both Snape and Sprout teach the class on different days.) Different houses with students being with different housemates. (Example: Warlock house (full of battle mages), which Draco and Ron would both be a member of, and Professor Flitwick would be the head of house Warlock) Lots of OCs. Different races going to hogwarts, like gnomes, elves, and halflings.

I was also going to make divination useful and iconic role in the plot, remove useless characters like Binns, have magical items, and remove questionable magic like fidelius charm, apparation, and occluemency and legilimency.

What's so questionable about those? Fidelius requires some rebalance, but it's still workable.

But about scale of changes. I have important question for you. Why is this Harry Potter fanfic? Do you have some core elements that you want to keep and change things around? Is it just a way to find audience?

***** I want to change the core elements, have a different magic system, fix things that make no sense, remove or alter all the dead-end ideas like history of magic (which is so useless the characters even fall asleep in it), and remove all the stations of canon that are in most fics.

I would keep the characters acting the same, and have it character focused but just in a new setting for a change.

It would still be a "Harry Potter" fanfiction because it focuses on Harry, it's just an AU

****** Then go for it. What's the point of writing fanfiction if you can't think big? The worst that can happen is that you fail spectacularly, which is probably better than getting bored with a story because you limited yourself.

  have a different magic system Also I would like to hear (and possibly complain) about your new magic system.

******* A lot of the spells work....for reasons unknown. Like the killing curse avoiding all shields and just killing the person.

Instead i would have characters cast fireballs, use waves of kinetic energy, summon arrows or pools of acid. The magic will be based of willpower, casting what you want instead of just saying an incantation and the magic happens (like harry using sectumsempra against draco, but not knowing what it did).

I recommend reading this doc by Taure - [[https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/edit?usp%253Dsharing%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1475562351423000%26amp;usg%3DAFQjCNFGbJMdzwL9pr-FWNVTlTZ8QKXIYQ&sa=D&ust=1475562351560000&usg=AFQjCNFRaqSEHtTjatqUUe8U2uU8NsLszA]]

I disagree with him on some details but it's probably the best analysis of HP magic system.

****** I think that sounds pretty cool but you should keep some things from the canon. Like keeping the house names but changing what they represent, although it's your story of course so you can do what you want. Also, I wouldn't get rid of history of magic generally speaking it's important to know where we come from. Although yea they definitely should've taught more relevant and current info in it.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** There is a real danger, that changing too much about the magical world would also mean, that the back-stories of any non-magically raised children stop making sense. That's especially concerning, when you try to shoe-horn your original take on the magical side into a story, which features the strict separation between both worlds as we know it from canon. EDIT: just for clarification purposes, what I'm talking about are those kind of (high) fantasy settings that would be difficult if not impossible to believe can be separated from a non-magical society that has spread itself all over the world except for some of the most remote places.

Over the years I have started to read many of those stories and in most cases stopped soon after. It's annoying when you are prepared for a Harry Potter story, but instead you read a completely original story with the characters' names being the only familiar thing.

But that said, if you can pull off writing a story that doesn't fall into the in-name-only trapping, go for it with my best wishes for success.

** It would be really cool if how you changed the magical world would affect character's desires/how they get them, i.e. a more dangerous magical world might make Voldemort's pursuit of immortality more acceptable/Dumbledore less pacifistic/Harry different impression of magic etc. etc.

I like massive AU fics. I've always wanted to read something like Fate/Stay's Clocktower/Dresden Files' Council interacting with the IWC/Wizengamot or something.
