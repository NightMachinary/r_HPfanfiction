** Tbh a magic spaceship wouldn't be that difficult. With fuelless everlasting flames being something a first year can make it's practically trivial to make a rocket engine with unlimited specific impulse, which means that you can take a normal orbital capsule that usually has very little delta-v and fly anywhere in the solar system. Get a bunch of welders and some stainless steel, build a spaceship body, enchant it to be stronger and airtight and radiation blocking, add a magic rocket on the bottom, and you already have something pretty flyable. The computer navigation system might be difficult, there aren't many software devs in the magical world. Life support is a bunch of air freshening charms, aguamenti for water and vanishing charms for waste. Easy. With a magic fuelless rocket, the moon is a few hours away, Mars and the Belt a few days, the outer planets 1-2 weeks. Interstellar would be a bit tricky without FTL, but certainly possible.

****** This fic genuinely was the reason I stopped reading fanfiction for a solid month. The author is brilliant at creating plotlines and tech stuff but god damn are his fics the most cliched "Good Guy Harry" fics on FFN. I mean seriously, giving Hogwarts a rape problem out of the blue, without any follow-up, just so that Harry can fix it in a single temper tantrum? Come on!

That being said, for anyone who's interested in magic technology fics, his other fic is a must-read. It falls flat after a huge buildup on every single plotline, but the MCU plots are enough to keep reading.

  Harry finally defeats Voldemort, but only after the world has been destroyed. Harry has his vengeance, but gets pulled into Voldemort's ritual and is dragged with his body to an alternate universe. First Chapter sets up the first scene. You can skip it reasonably safely. - Complete - Now up on webnovel under my original author name, burnable.

**** Cause I doubt that house elves can apparate that far or are born with the ability to fly a spaceship with celestial navigation only. The magic fire engine I described would need several PIDs and an inertial integrator and a newtonian gravity simulation in order to successfully make interplanetary voyages, all of which is maybe a year of work for a small team of programmers. About as advanced as the stability assist and navigation in KSP.

*** How would they visit?\\
The enforced separation and rather cold relations between sides would probably significantly delay the information and stop cold any attempt to piggyback on muggle tech. After all, by then muggle government would have had to deal with decades of increased malicious activity from magic mask boys by then, so they would have every reason to prevent magicals expanding their reach.

And on Mars, a planet where magical infrastructure is absent, so would be the SoS. It would only take a few 7th year muggleborns being bribed to get copies of the Hogwarts library up there and start an unified colony and their own magic school, without the nomaj separation.

Several more such operations would assist in relocating a breeding population of various magical creatures and plants and blaming it all on poachers and dark wizards. With both knowledge and material base secured, there would be no reason to keep in contact with terrestial magicals - government agents visiting muggleborn well before 11th birthday would ensure that the in-flow of new blood would stop, and then the clock would be ticking for the death of that society. (Unless Weasleys stepped up their efforts. Hero Weasley?).

Most of the muggle installations on Earth would be possible to remove once a few other planets were colonized - with all the smog, mining damage and failing environment it would be less viable option to live on anyway.

While it would be hard to uproot the hidden, entrenched wizarding world, it would not be that much of a problem to ensure it stayed there. And that is all that would be needed.
