I was thinking about this the other day after seeing many comments on here about certain tropes that I enjoy, or have enjoyed in the past. So, I was wondering if some of you would be willing to explain certain tropes you enjoy that others might not particularly like and why you like them? I ask this in the hopes to maybe explore different stories that I traditionally might not be attracted to. In good faith, I will go first.

Soul Bonds: I know, I know. What a disgustingly overused concept that has characters falling head over heels for one another after hello! However, a part of me is a romantic who enjoyed reading about how close you can feel to a person you love. After falling in love myself, they seem to get under my skin a bit now. However, there are instances where I give it a pass... when done (somewhat) correctly - relative to myself of course!

Super/OP! Harry: Gasp! You didn't expect this... no you probably did. Who doesn't love a Harry who's able to slaughter the wizarding world with only Voldemort and Dumbledore able to possibly best him!.. not me to be honest. I enjoy the rare few of these stories where magic is really explored. Harry can be as strong as he likes in any story that I read, but I need there to be a solid foundation behind this. Recently I have enjoyed stories that use other mythologies as the basis of magic. Super Harry can be done in good taste... sometimes!

Dark Harry: This one is a real weakness for myself right now, I seem to enjoy reading some more questionable Harry stories as time goes by. Having spent years reading FanFiction, I have exhausted my Light!Harry wonder... for now at least. I think this one goes hand in hand with Super!Harry stories as well so perhaps that's why I am beginning to enjoy them. As with my previous two, there are a few stories which truly allow me to enjoy this trope, with many being nothing more than a lust filled combination of words where Harry is the Supreme Rapist of the world.

If anyone is willing to explain their own, even if it's one of the ones I have already mentioned - perhaps also explaining why you enjoy them. I think it would be cool to see what others see in stories and potentially link any in particular that are your favourites! Thank you for taking the time to read ☺️!


** Fluffy moments when everyone is older. I get it, when you are 13 and your crush says they like your hair your going to blush and maybe giggle. But when you're 23 and your friend for the last 12 years mentions to someone how awesome you are and that they couldn't imagine a life without you, it just hits harder.

Picnic Panic by LeQuin is the perfect example of this. Small moments that make the characters feel good while not being suddenly bashful.

** Court scenes - I love reading about Fudge and Umbridge getting arrested and freaking the hell out as they're charged with all the crimes they've committed, bonus points if the author is clever with how the evidence was discovered.

Different Hogwarts House - Sometimes it's nice to mix it up and put Harry into a different scenario and see what comes of it, there have definitely been some good Slytherin ones recently.

Good non-manipulative Dumbledore - Let's be honest, with the number of people who bash on Dumbledore (which I just think is lazy) it's basically a trope in and of itself.\\
The friendly grandpa-like figure who makes mistakes like any human but is ultimately trying to do the best he can for Harry is my favourite.

Occlumency - Harry learning how to better organise his mind is one of the best ways to make him more efficient/powerful and I love how different authors explain how it works.

*** The dumbledore bashing trope is absolute bullshit. He was the fucking Leader of Light. A war general. You dont become a leader by being kind. You need to be ruthless and manipulative to get the job done. It was literally a case of one life vs hundreds if not thousands. Dumbledore being manipulative is exactly what he is supposed to be. People who bash dumbledore in fics are just lazy and incompetent in my opinion.

Edit: As pointed out, my opinion is a bit harsh so dont take it hard. Take my words with a bit of salt and use as a reference points for your fics plz.

No, he wasn't. He was the headmaster of a school, and a member of the government's /judicial/legislative/ branch.

He wasn't a "war general"; if he wanted to be that, he should've joined the Aurors where his power and responsibility would come along with /accountability/. Being the ineffective leader of a largely ineffective vigilante group only worked because the villains were /even more stupid./

***** Case being everyone expected him to pull a solution for their every single problem out of his ass and eventually he began thinking it was his duty to solve all their problems too. Being a powerfull wizard does that. On top of that he had to defeat and imprison his own lover. He was a bit unstable in his mind ( just a tad little wee bit) and he was tired old man being over 100 years old. Though yes, he wasnt a war general. I concede on that point.

**** I think to a certain extent, depending on the setting of Harry's life within a story, the bashing of Dumbledore can be (within taste) justified. I for one would have a certain amount of malice aimed towards Dumbledore if it was he who had condemned my life in the way that Harry's was. The abuse of the Dursley's is not in fact a Trope, it is canon. There was enough evidence within the books to indicate physical abuse at the hands of people whom Dumbledore had left him with. With no one to come and check up on him or to make sure that all is well and send him back year on year to receive the same abuse.

I do agree with some aspects of what you say however, it is possible that some authors may use it due to the ease of it having been done so many times. There are stories out there where this trope is done well, and many where it is not done so well. It's all about finding the ones which keep towards your particular tastes. We disagree on some other points, however you did say to take them with a pinch of salt and I shall.

** I love the stories where it's like characters have no interest in being hero's or somehting. Either the main character is an oc or a character from another series that is at hogwarts a couple of years older than Harry and is just like living their lives there, with their own stuff going on vaguely aware of what's happening. Or like Harry himself is just isn't intrested in Voldemort or in discovering all the secrets at hogwarts and just like misses stuff that was planted for him ( like the mirror of erised or something )

** Overly complicated descriptions of magic. I like nothing more then to see how an author thinks how magic works. I love seeing long winded explanations breaking down how various spells work, or swing some one use that knowledge to make new spells. I like seeing the reasons and justifications on why dark magic is considered “dark” and not simply “taboo”. When authors include the history of magic and how it has improved over time, I love it even more.

I also like canon goblins. I love the rude, angry little blighters. I love their total disregard for anything other then wealth. I love the idea that they won't betray you due to ideological differences, but because you have something they want and have judged it to be easier to do so then to keep the agreements.

** OCs. A good, non mary-sue oc can be absolutely amazing for a story. Adding people to fill character types that aren't explored in canon is a real test of someone's writing skills.

Alternatively, you could use a canon character and give them a new personality, but a brand new character can be customized from the ground up for perfect development... assuming it's done right... which it often isn't.

  The words be careful what you wish for had never rung truer. "Wait... what did she just call my father? Oh, oh god no, anyone but them! Please god no! I'd rather scourgify my own blood then have them for a family! I would take the Malfoys- no, even Voldemort over them! Anyone but...!" SI-OC. Pairings undecided.

** Mpreg. The first time I heard of it I was pretty grossed out, but then I examined why and found it was rooted in ideas of gender roles, cisnormativity, and misogyny. At least for me. Once I acknowledged that it was easy to get over most of the squickiness of it. And in a world of magic, who's to say what's impossible?

I like reading romance stories, I like reading stories where two people (or more ig, polyamory is a real thing and there's nothing wrong with it) love each other and are happy together and want to start a family, or have a “happy little accident” lol. I typically prefer to read slash/femslash fics, thus the Mpreg. I of course won't turn my nose up at a good het fic, and sometimes I'm even in the mood specifically for that. In fact, one of my favorite ships of all time is f/m. I just typically prefer to read LGBT fanfic, since it's much harder to find original LGBT media than it is to find original het media.

But anyway, Mpreg is probably my “guilty pleasure” trope. But don't confuse it with a/b/o. (I've read a few well done a/b/o fics in my time, but they are only written once in a blue moon. Usually I can only stand them if it's a trope inversion/subversion. Otherwise they tend to be really gross and r/pey and I am very much *not/ into that.) A/b/o is not necessary Because Magic, and if someone adds it to an HP Mpreg story “to suspend disbelief” I am immediately suspicious lmao. I've learned the hard way it's just an excuse to write hardcore p*rn, which is a no-no for me. I don't even really like to read sex scenes. I prefer that stuff to happen off screen, unless it's done in a tastefully abstract way that is meant to show the characters love for one another.

(Also, as a disclaimer, when I explained my reasons for my original aversion to Mpreg, I was not saying that those are everybody's reasons. Some people don't like pregnancy stories, some people don't have any slash ships they are interested in enough to read fics about, some people can't suspend disbelief enough to enjoy it. All those and more are valid reasons.)

If anyone wants me to recommend any HP Mpreg fics, lmk. I've not read a ton tbh, as there are other tropes i like better, but I do know of a few, and one I can definitely personally recommend.

*** I have been avoiding stories tagged with MPreg despite maybe giving them a chance in the future.

I think that what makes more sense is that there be a potion/blood ritual (kind of like how Voldemort got his body in GoF) that allows two men to have a biological baby. I'm not a fan of slash pairings where it suddenly becomes very toxic het top/bottom dynamics. I think it would be more romantic if the couple had to work together for 9 months to combine their magic and create a baby.

There are a few sex scenes if I remember correctly (it's been awhile) but they're not gratuitous. The ship is Charlie/Harry and takes place after the war (so everyone is of age) and is around 115k words.

I know /of/ a few more but I wouldn't be able to personally recommend them, either because I haven't read them yet or I have and they were not good.

#+begin_quote
  Moments after she strikes down the Dark Lord Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts, Harriet Potter is sent back 20 years into the past, her parents seventh year of Hogwarts. With no hope of ever returning to her time and a new, Magic made identity, Harriet joins forces with Slytherins and Gryffindors alike to collect Tom Riddle's Horcruxes as quickly as possible and finally be done with this gods damned war. No longer a Potter, Harriet is desperate for some kind of family and stability in this foreign time. Is there any chance when Magic made her the biological cousin of the Dark Lord?
