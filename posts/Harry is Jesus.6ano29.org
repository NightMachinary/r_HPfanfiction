*** I started out serious because I thought wouldn't it be weird to have Harry as Jesus and then I was like maybe he should also be merlin and then wizards are inbred right and then it devolved into having the badass hive mind of harry potter and when faced with the choice between meta misc and request I chose request because I thought you know someone probably wrote this already
