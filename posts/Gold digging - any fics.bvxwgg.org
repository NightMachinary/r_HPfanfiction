There's a lot of fics with gold digging Ginny/Wesleys and with Harry lamenting his fate that most girls are interested in his fame/gold/status/etc. before he finds his "true love!!one!**9one!!!". Simple question - are there any fics with gold digging Hermione that are not a bash fic?


** On the same note, it'd be fun to read a not-PG fic where he shamelessly takes advantage of both his money and fame and polishes his wand in all the sluts of Hogwarts ;)

I mean, there's a precedent, isn't it canon that his father was a bit of a man-whore? Or is that fanon?

And sorry OP, I can't help you with that :(

*** It's fanon, from all we know, canon James Potter liked Lily Evans from the start and merely evolved from "hair pulling idiot" to "acceptable boyfriend".

**** Well, canon is rather PG-friendly. I wouldn't put it beyond him. Fits the character to a 'T' - a sportsman, from wealthy home, a bully and a social person.

** I'd imagine Hermione would be less of a gold-diggers and more of a status climber. Think Warner from Legally Blonde "If I am going to be a senator by the time I'm thirty, I'm gonna need someone /sings/ Seeeeriouuus"

Still kind of a gold-diggers I guess, but in a less traditional way

*** That would IMO also fit the definition of a gold digger. Hermione going after Harry - because there is no one else with better status than Harry after book 7 - not for love, but just because she needs his status and support to become MoM.

**** Eh, seems more like a plot for a HermionexDraco, than a HermionexHarry, at least if you are keeping canon friendships.

"Gold Digging" usually implies the initiation/maintenance of a relationship due to material (non-emotional) benefits. "Friends who decide to get married because it helps both their careers" or even just "Harry wants to help his friend achieve her vision and he can do that by marrying her" don't really fall into it, that is kinda a separate thing.
