What if Petunia discovered that she could do wondrous, unexplainable things, while Lily was non-magical like their parents? Are there any fics that explore this AU idea?

Petunia wouldn't feel sidelined -- justified or not -- by her parents. From what limited knowledge we have of Lily, I don't think that she would be jealous. What about Snape? The Mauraders?

How different would the Potterverse be, even whilst assuming that some things still happen? E.g. James falls in love with Lily, and they have Harry.


** Well maybe jealousy made Petunia what she is so she would have maybe a better person. We don't know enough of Lily but I don't think she would have been jealous. A bit envious maybe but still supporting of her sister.

But, if jealousy wasn't the cause of Petunia's pettiness then she would more likely have been a stuck up b... always showing off to her sister but at Hogwarts she would be either bullied or a mean Lavender like (gossiping and so...).

**** Nowhere. That's why I said she would be a "mean Lavender like". Meaning she would be like Lavender but mean as an added malus.

** You'd have to come up with a different explanation for how James and Lily meet if you want them to get together. On the train platform as she's accompanying her sister? It seems unlikely. And does James crush on some other girl at Hogwarts? Does he hate Snape without Lily to fight over? It would be a totally different story.

** I did read a fic which had Petunia as the witch and Lily as a muggle. It was a rather lengthy one-shot (around 35k words), and it was quite strange.

Petunia was a Slytherin, but gave up magic after she finished Hogwarts, and works as a typist, Lily works in a bar, James and co spy on Snivellus' house and meet Lily, and it goes on from there. Lily isn't jealous of Petunia or anything, and is fascinated with magic. Petunia was hostile towards all wizards and witches.

To me, it felt very odd to have Lily be a muggle since she's widely portrayed as the finest witch of her generation in both fanon and canon.

*** It's a great fic, but it's more about James and Lily than exploring Lily and Petunia. Although they do have a good relationship.

** hmm, I don't think Lily is embittered by jealousy, but loves magic. and Petunia isn't bitter because she is the special one. Snape doesn't fall for Petunia, but when he reveals knowledge of magic, wizards, and Hogwarts Lily is fascinated. Petunia isn't antagonistic, but Snape still falls for Lily, who is taken with magic and is very positive towards Snape who can do it.

This creates much of the early friendship bonds- praise/positive attitude making Snape feel good about himself, and he gets to share all his knowledge to an eager listener.

As for Hogwarts I'm not sure of Petunia's House, or what contact there would be with the Marauders, but I suspect without Lily there isn't the personal antagonism and rivalry.

Af for the war, frankly I am less interested. But when the war comes I don't think Snape would be caught quite so hard since he has his school world, and then Lily is separate. Petunia might make issue, but I think Lily wouldn't break their friendship off given she isn't living the experience and it would be easier to accept Snape's explanations for needing to behave a certain way.

Snape and Lily being an item I think is certainly possible given Snape is an old friend, and they are joined by a secret, and Lily is taken with magic etc.

All that said I think Snape could well go down Death Eater road again (Voldemort in canon seemed willing to leave Snape his toy, if only so he had a loyal servant with a weakness to be exploited, to hold over/threaten).

From there I think canon has to be thrown out the window. Prophecy, choice, could always go with Neville. Lily might die/be punished/hurt horribly, and thus Snape might still betray. Otherwise he is walking line of servant of Voldemort and keeping others, especially Lilly, unawares.

Oh, and Petunia certainly wouldn't go for Vernon or anyone (or thoroughly muggle). I suspect, being special, she would seek someone who had something- whether a quidditch star (but I can't see James and her), or a Slug Club type, or a Smith (rich and connected to Hufflepuff).

Anyway, that's where my thoughts ran, but given the changes I don't think it makes a good story like canon.

*** I don't think Lily would stay friends with Snape if Petunia tells her that he is joining a terror group that aims to kill her.

Petunia would set Lily an ultimatum and I think Lily's moral compass is too strong to not stick with her sister there

** I read a fic with this premise once, but the author besically swapped their personalities, so witch!Petunia was just Lily 2.0 with blond hair, and Lily was a bitter redhead Petunia. I think even their age was swapped.

I don't think Snape would have the same kind of relationship with Petunia he had with Lily, if only because of the age difference, but they could still be friends. In fact, since they are alike in some respects, both jealous with a cruel streak, they would either hit it off like house on fire or become bitter enemies.

Petunia would also be less likely to get involved with the Order, though probably would do it if she married its member. All in all, she would try to fit in and become a "normal witch", emulate rich pureblood girls while simultaneously resenting them. A lot of potential to become bitter, just in a different way.

As to whether non-magical Lily would be jealous, it also could go either way, we just don't have enough characterisation from canon. But she sure could hold a grudge, so it's not a given that she would treat her orphan nephew Hadrian Potter (Longbottom? Prewett? Snape?) well, even if she's unlikely to stuck him in a cupboard.

  When the letter arrives, Lily is almost as excited as Petunia. She writes Albus Dumbledore to ask if she can go too, and if she cries a little when the answer comes back no she doesn't tell anyone. Lily waves from the train platform, writes diligently, and listens with excitement whenever her big sister deigns to share stories of magic. --Anonymous asked for "what if Petunia was a witch and Lily a Muggle?"
