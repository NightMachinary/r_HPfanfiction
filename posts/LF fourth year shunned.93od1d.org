Where everyone tells him to sling it. Even Hermione


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12405748/1/Harry-Potter-The-Curse-of-Undeath][Harry Potter - The Curse of Undeath]]

In this one theres the canon abandonment by Ron, and Hermione sitting on the fence, after which Harry severs ties completely. Theres even a rational reason for it, instead of the usual indyHarry 'you weren't my bootlickers, i hate you' motive.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unforgivable Tournament by questionablequotation) certainly fits. It is very short, only a one shot but the premise of why they abandon him is highly unique.

** Well, I guess linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane), though that is partly by his choice too.

** Linkffn(the queen who fell to earth) it's an HP / Dragon Riders of Pern x-over. But it starts with Harry being shunned.
