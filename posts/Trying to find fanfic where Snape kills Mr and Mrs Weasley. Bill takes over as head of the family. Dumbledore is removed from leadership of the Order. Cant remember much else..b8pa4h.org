**** I'm glad someone remembered it. It's very good and the take on Hermione is very accurate. Herd are some more links to it. [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/the-final-straw-by-bellerophon30-t.454/]]

** I've read it before but can't find it. If anyone can help, the story begins by Harry becoming an adult to leave the Dursley's, he dates Luna, he stops listening to dumbledore, and Harry makes his dueling club in hogwarts with the teachers permission

**** While I do not know the fic in question. Killing Luna? That's pretty impressive in itself.\\
After years of fanfiction, I only have 2 other exemple of her dying that comes to mind (while she was with Ron who died just before her and another from a terribly depressing fic from what I remember), this girl has one of the biggest plot armor I have ever saw. She could walk in the middle of a Deatheater meeting to talk about Heliopath to Voldemort and the author would still make her leaver relatively unscatted.

** If it's the one I'm thinking of they die when snape is on trial grabs a wand from an auror and the seats they are in collapse. I'm pretty sure it is a time travel fic. I also think it is Harmony fic maybe even Lunar Harmony...

*** You're thinking of the End and the Beginning by muggledad. I'm currently reading it again, so weird timing on this question.

  My stab at the Harry travels through time genre. Significant inspiration from "HP & Nightmares of Futures Past" with a twist. Harry/Hermione

**** Man back in 2010 I was so stoked for muggledad's stories, Harry and Gabi in particular. Sucks that life got to him and cut a lot of his writing short.
