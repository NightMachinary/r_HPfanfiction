All the marauders' era people go back in time and view things with each other's POVs.

- Snape goes into James 'mind' and see SWM from his POV
- James goes into Snape's 'mind' and see SWM from his POV
- Lily goes into Snape's 'mind' and sees the SWM from his POV
- Snape goes into Lily's 'mind' and sees the ''Mudblood" incident
- Different people go into each other's minds to experience things from their POVs

I feel like it would be interesting for characters to see things from each others POVs in death. Later in the fic maybe they could make up and become 'friends'?

If there's already a fic like this PLZ REC! Annnnnnnnnnd if you do write a fic with this prompt PLZ LINK!
