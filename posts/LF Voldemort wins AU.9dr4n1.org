Something like linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom), where the war is won before Harry goes to Hogwarts.

Or just plain Voldemort wins the Second Wizarding War.

  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.

** Slightly different variation on that idea here, but stay with me:

linkffn(Reign of the Serpent): Salazar Slytherin won 1000 years before, and still rules Britain in Harry's time.

linkffn(Skitterleap): Grindelwald won the duel against Dumbledore, made Britain part of his Austro-Hungarian Empire.

Hope you enjoy.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

Honestly, it sounds like to me you don't think there's a massive difference between casting spells and potions and actually creating them. Plus, I've looked to be sure and the Protean charm is not her spell, she 'merely' used it. As for the jinx, there seems to be no source saying that it was her own jinx and not one she found. Don't get me wrong, she's a brilliant witch, but I think there's a line between realism and fantasy.

But it doesn't really matter. The point is, no one gives a damn and calls "Mary Sue" or "god-like" when it's a male character doing this. Snape improving potions and creating his own spells as a teenager, the same age as Hermione, spells people can't beat twenty years later? No one says "Oh, young Snape was god-like!" But a female character doing the same? "Overskilled!"

And that's the problem right there. Girls doing the same great things as boys their age is somehow bad. Not because it's OP or whatever, but because girls aren't allowed to be great.
