Any story, where Harry takes care of a younger girl, wether it be his AU sister (The standard fem twins and Rose Potters), another character from the standard universe, (I read one where hermione and him are both orphans), or even a crossover (A Reborn! and HP crossover with Chrome comes to mind).

I don't mind genres, but nothing humour or parody...maybe fluffy and or angsty. Examples would be

1. Mismatched Wings by Arawn D. Draven
2. Or You Could Say by Silencia20
3. Hadrian Potter and the Daughters of Chronos by Hallowtide, at least the start
4. Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is by Tsume Yuki

Thanks!

  Post HBP. HHr. Harry and Hermione's odd behavior during their 6th year explodes into a maelstrom of chaotic, bitter emotions, caused by a strange 'illness.' Help comes from a young, orphaned girl who is much more than she appears.
