I'd like to read a story where someone is able to use one horcrux to somehow destroy the rest (without having to find each).

#+begin_quote
  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.

#+begin_quote
  Harry had noticed a lot of things that didn't add up around him. He did something about it. When Ron left the tent during the hunt for the horcruxes, he finally manages to get the true Hermione back. With a better plan they start the hunt anew.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10387771/1/Public-Safety][Public Safety]], just dropping one in the Veil of Death is enough for the rest to be pulled in too, regardless of distance. It was, after all, the very reason it was built.

** I've used that in my story "Patron". The Order had no choice - Voldemort had spread his Horcruxes far too far for a hunt to work, and had used an even nastier trick to protect them.

*** I really liked Patron, especially your focus on rituals and voodoo magic since many fics I've read don't do it justice or just don't include it.
