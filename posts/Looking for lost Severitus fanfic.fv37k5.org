:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember the whole fic exactly, but it was definitely on fanfiction.net

Harry was sorted into Gryffindor, as a punishment for something he got put into Slytherin for a period of time? Anyway Snape made him get diagnostics run in the hospital wing as a routine thing he did with all his Slytherins and it turns out he's had a glamour over himself to hide the abuse. Snape ends up legally adopting him. After his punishment ends he gets resorted and he's found to be a Slytherdor and spends equal amounts of time in the Gryffindor dorms, Slytherin forms and his home with Snape. There's one year where Snape loses his memory and forgets that he's become a father figure to Harry and it was heartbreaking. I think Harry got with Daphne Greengrass but I could be confusing that with another fic.

I've been looking for months but I just can't find it. If anyone recognises this fic and knows what it's called so I can find it again, I'd be forever in your debt.

Update: I found it!! It's On The Flip Side by MusicMelis, thank you all for your help
