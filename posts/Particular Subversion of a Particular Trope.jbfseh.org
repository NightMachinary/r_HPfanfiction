The "marriage contract that's been sitting unexecuted for generations" trope has always kind of bothered me, especially when they seem to be optional or have been ignored for generations.

I just had a thought on how to make that make sense - they're not /supposed/ to be executed - they actually are munchkining magical/legal contract stuff to create magical effects. Actually executing the contract destroys the purpose.

Modern magical society, or even the way magic functions, is /built/ on a network of such contracts. (For example, as long as a particulsr properly worded contract is open, every magical person is technically a potential member of the family, and gets access to a bloodline-locked set of spells. If that contact goes away, sudden most people can't Apparate anymore)

An ignorant !Lord Harry Potter executes one... and singlehandedly destroys everything by doing so.


** I like the idea. But I imagine that, unless the contracts were very specific with extra conditions to fulfill them beyond just "marry someone from this family," it would be way too easy to accidentally fulfill them. And that would make muggleborns and even muggles much more attractive spouses.

*** Agreed.

They probably are crafted something like "by signing here, X marries Y and fulfills this contract", with other language preventing the /effect/ by itself (a couple satisfying the conditions) from counting as a fulfillment.

In other words, that part works like an open-ended options contract - you can execute it to transact shares of the stock at the strike price, but transacting that many shares with the same party doesn't count as executing the contract.

Alternately, they might have attached a standardized impossible condition to prevent accidental fulfillment, say for example... "at least one party must have survived the Killing Curse".

** - Harry Potter inherits a ton of titles, but has to turn them all down because he'd have no way in hell enough time or knowledge to fulfill all the duties that come with them
- He inherits lotsa moola, but has to turn it down because he'd also inherit lotsa debts with it that'd "eat" all that money and leave him in debt to all kinds of unsavory characters

*** The latter is questionable, as generally the creditors will take their stuff from the estate either way.

***** That depends on how the inheritance/debt laws are formed, and each combination (below) has had representation throughout history:

​

|                                                            | Inherit automatically, unless heir specifically rejects | Must claim inheritance by some act. |
|------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------|
| Debts cannot be inherited                                  | Case 1                                                  | Case 2                              |
| Debts are inherited if and only if one inherits the estate | Case 3                                                  | Case 4                              |

​

For example, in Germany, one inherits the debts with the estate unless the heir specifically repudiates both, while in the UK, debts that exceed the estate vanish into nonbeing.

So if we're in the first row, if the debts exceed the value of their corresponding inheritances, they just vanish - Harry has nothing to lose by inheriting (he would get whatever things have no real market value (basically the stuff connected to the inherited title, if any), or items that are exempted from being seized by creditors (if we're going by usual tropes, possibly the primary ancestral family home or a family grimoire)).

It's only in the second row where Harry runs into issues, and then only if the debts /exceed/ the assets

*** I agree with you. These tropes are overused and boring... On another note, I find these tropes also quite off-putting:

-!Trans Harry. Don't take me wrong, I don't really care if an OC is trans at all. But Harry being trans seems so weird for me...

-The pairing Severus x Harry (or Lucius x Harry) is just sooo creepy in my opinion, tbh.

-Sirius and Remus calling a teenager Harry "pup" and "cub" respectively.

-Harry having a disability. Just... Why? Why is there Blind! Harry tropes (for instance)? I don't understand...
