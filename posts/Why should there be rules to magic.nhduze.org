So I just read and fell in love with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4300345/][prodigal delinquent]] and one of my favorite things about it is that Harry discovers magic early, then when learning he's just like “it's feckin magic, I already figured out how to make physics my bitch why should this be any different?” And proceeds to just use intent based wizardry when alone.

So that's what I'm looking for, any fics where Harry just disregards the limitations of magic/physics and des shit anyways?


** Because why does no one other than some random teenager that shown no special genius or intellect be the only one to figure this out? If HP was a real world there would have been hundreds of thousands of people before him all trying to "disregard the limitations of magic/physic and do shit anyway" and failing. Why did Harry succeed where they didn't? How does having a Harry without any limits improve your story?

To answer your question, here is an archive of superpowered Harry fics.

** There don't necessarily need to be rules for magic. It could be a complete free for all, anything goes kind of deal. But narratively speaking that's terrible for s series about magic users, because it means that you can solve any problem you want with a bit of magic. You might argue 'you can do that now', but readers are more or less aware of the rules that exist and expect them to be followed (more or less). Introducing a magic system with no rules lowers the stakes of any conflict because, for example, if a character dies, they can just be brought back no questions asked.

It means that readers aren't going to be on board with using magic to solve problems: any problem that's introduced can just be solved with an ass pull. Rowling gets criticised for her lackadaisical approach to her magic system but it does at least have some rules. You understand that Harry can't bring his parents back to life, you understand that Merope Gaunt couldn't make Tom Riddle really love her and so on.

Magic having rules serves a narrative purpose, not a world building purpose. If your characters have access to all powerful magic, where's the conflict?

*** I may have phrased badly in my post, using prodigal delinquent as an example, Harry may be powerful, but he's not super proactive in fighting Voldemort, heck, he stops the theft of the philosophers stone accidentally (he found fluffy earlier in the year and started playing catch with him because he's a very good boys) and didn't realize he stopped Voldemort until afterwards when dumbledore congratulated him for doing so

** There's always a limit in the story, even if Harry is the only one who seemingly disregards limitations. Because otherwise, he can just raise his wand to send Voldermort and all Death Eaters to Azkaban.

** It's the difference between a hard and a soft magic system, a lot of people subscribe to the idea that hard magic (think avatar or full metal alchemist) is better, because problems can be solved without feeling like A WIZARD DID IT! A soft magic system can work, just look at lotr, but one has to world build it differently, and what fanfics do is often better suited to hard magic.

** My take is that there doesn't have to really be rules for magic, but people invent rules for magic because they make controlling magic easier/safer. Perhaps people simply need established rules to be able to understand what they can do with magic? Or at least how they can do it? Magic could be without rules and be able to do anything, but you probably still need to know how to get it to do what you want.

I seem to remember a story where Ron is seen as a true Seer because he makes a prediction and when everyone believes it, their collective belief makes the prediction true. Harry later learns from Dumbledore that a lot(or was it all, can't remember) magical rules are made up to stop magical society from destroying itself or something like that.

** Narratively speaking, magic with no rules can't be used to satisfactorily resolve complications.
