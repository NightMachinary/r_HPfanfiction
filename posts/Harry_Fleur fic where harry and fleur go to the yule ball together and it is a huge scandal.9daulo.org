A scandal Like "two Champions cannot associate in such a way" and "it would be against the Sport to do that"


** Usually the scandal is 'Oh my God that Veela is controlling the Boy Who Lived! Why else would he turn down beautiful English witches?' or 'She much to old to be dating a boy in his 4th year, she is robbing the cradle!'

As for those saying it's in all Harry/Fleur stories, that's not true since most usually start post second event with Fleur beginning to get closer to Harry as friends due to His selfless act in saving Gabrielle.

*** There's a few, few that they are that make them meet at/during the Quidditch finale and their relationship begins before the drawing of the names. There's also other stories that have them be basically pen pals and they meet each other in person for the first time when she arrives at Hogwarts. And lets not forget those that just have Harry ask her out because... reasons, I can't recall right now. Think it was: Part - because they lust after her because of her heritage that makes us so similar. Part hot girl that turns down everybody, might as well try.

In that subsection of the pairings story, it's rather usual for that to happen.

***** Gonna have to wait till friday evening/saturday morning. I've got a paper I've only found sources that's due tomorrow. And then I've got another thing due monday that I at least have only read the assigned material from one book (The other one's swedish and few/no norwegians manage to read that easily- frustratingly it's also the one with the most material to read) So I'm cramming one 2 week assignment into one day and a week assignment into 2 days. I'm so fucked.

  Harry has been alone his entire life, Dudley had made sure of that. On the brink of heading off into a whole new world, Harry finds himself scared he always will be alone. He writes a letter, more for himself than anything. Then Hedwig takes it upon herself to deliver it to someone just as alone as him.
