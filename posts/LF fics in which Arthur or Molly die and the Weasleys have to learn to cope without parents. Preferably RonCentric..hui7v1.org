#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

**** Actually, I just read the latest chapter of White Rook and was really enjoying Ron's arc over the series, which is what spurred this. Did you have any inspirations when writing the arc? Any recs? I love your work btw.
