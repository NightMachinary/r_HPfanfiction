** Ah, a man of refined tastes.

This is, I think, the quintessential Harry/FemBlaise:

Also read Ascension of the Scorpion Sorcerer if you dare to uncover an ancient indy!Harry classic.

*** I have read a couple Fem Draco and Fem Voldemort but after reading ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28853076]]) this I realized I haven't really read any Fem Blaise.

  No one ever said being Harry Potter's girlfriend was going to be easy, but after 7 months at it one sly Slytherin thought she'd mastered it... that was until she was forced to explain their relationship to the inquiring minds of the Order.

** Apprentice Potter/Journeyman Potter/Master Potter by [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/][Draco664 on fanficauthors.net]] - this was written before most of the fandom noticed Blaise was a boy's name and no one had glommed onto Daphne Greengrass as the alt Slytherin of choice.

**** Blaise is both a male and female name. Until the character showed up, a lot of people thought it was a girl.

****** Yup.

I actually have a Great Aunt with the name of Blaise. It's not used much in the States anymore, but still.

It's mostly a boy's name nowadays in the US, though. It's more commonly a girl's name in other cultures.

**** I remember going through a distinct mental shift for the default Blaise gender in my head. Some of the first fics I ever read had female Blaise, then over a couple years it was about a 50/50 either way, now I don't think I've read a new fic with female blaise in years.

***** For some reason I can't remember a single fic where Blaise was in for some reason (even as a background character).
