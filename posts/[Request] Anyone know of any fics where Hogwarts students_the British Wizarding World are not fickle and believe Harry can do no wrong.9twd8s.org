  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** So long as there is an expectation for Harry to be great and awesome, then people are going to criticize him for not being great and awesome enough. I mean, Dumbles had the same issue - people were very willing to think he was senile even though he'd spent a hundred years proving his brilliance.

*** Dumbledore also had followers that believed he could do no wrong.

Edit: Where's the faction of Hogwarts students that are in love with the Boy-Who-Lived and adamantly stick up for him/defend him no matter what?

Ex.

"Woah! The goblet picked Harry Potter, without him even entering! As to be expected from the Boy-Who-Lived!"

"Dark? /Harry Potter/ is Dark? Pfft, yeah, sure, and Merlin was a muggle."

Realistically, I think they had their world-view shattered when they realized that Harry Potter had come to Hogwarts with as much knowledge of the Wizarding World as your average Muggleborn.

**** I suppose... I mean, the Gryffs were mostly with him? Part of it is also that he gets into a lot of shenanigans but doesn't spend enough time socializing outside of his group. I'm just saying, if you're not going to put effort into maintaing the public image, don't be surprised when fame bites you in the bum.
