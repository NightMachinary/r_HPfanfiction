There's quite a few fics that do a "Snape travels back to his school years upon death" thing. But the one I'm looking for is finished, starts at first year and ends with Snape and Lily in a relationship with Voldemort defeated at that time.

Thanks.


** *His Greatest Wish*, linkffn(6548167), has things going pretty well for everyone except James Potter.

  It has been Severus Snape's greatest wish to go back and fix his life with Lily. What happens when he suddenly gets the chance, remembers everything, and has changed enough to avoid Slytherin? Marauder-era, pre- and established Severus/Lily. 50/50 COMPLETE!
