I'm not a big fan of the arranged marriage stuff or HP/SS, so I'm really just looking for any fics that have anything like the calling or the circle/elite from this story. Anyone have any recommendations? Thanks!


** Remind me what these terms mean again? Do you want pureblood culture, royal Harry, or something else? If so, maybe check out some Harry/Daphne?

*** The circle/ the elite were the most magically powerful witches and wizards in the world and the calling was when they all gathered at Stonehenge. I just thought it was entertaining how some people were more magical than others and nobody necessarily knew who they were except that group.

**** I can't think of any, but maybe reword your request for just that and not mention the marriage stone (you may get more responses if you don't have a well known slash story in the title).
