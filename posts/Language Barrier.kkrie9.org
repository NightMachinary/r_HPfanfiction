A somewhat... well meaning prank from Fred & George in the Great Hall has the Hogwarts Students and their visiting counterparts (Beauxbatons and Dumstrang) cursed to be entirely unable to speak, read and understand in any language other than their first...

For the Hogwarts students, this is mostly fine. Only a few outliers (Malfoy, the Patils etc.) who learned the language of their ancestral home first before English have much of an issue.

In the visitors camp, with both schools sourcing students from all over Europe, it is far more disastrous, leading to a disastrous breakdown of communication that turns the prank from fun to... not fun.

Fred and George now have to ensure no one can prove they did it.

Harry discovers a surprising amount of fellow Parseltongues in the foreign students (and within his own student body).


** You do realise the Brits would just talk more slowly and loudly in English? Once the foreign students realised that they could suddenly understand the louder, slower Brits they would start doing the same and the problem would be solved.

*** Did you forget the bit about understanding any other language but their first? No matter how loud or slowly brits talk, No one can understand. You might find students from Durmstrang who speak English as their first language, or brits who speak welsh, but nonetheless under the spell a French speaker can't understand english

Edit: how on earth I missed a joke that obvious I'll never understand

***** The joke is that generally when English people encounter those who either can't speak/understand english, they speak louder and slower, as if that would work. It was sarcasm, but I read it as if it were serious.

Another idea is a spell that randomly swaps everyone's language with other, random languages. Hermione is suddenly speaking Hindi, Ron Basque, Harry Russian, Madame Maxime Portugese, etc

** I would love to read this! Especially Harry finding out he isn't the only parseltongue of Hogwarts, while everyone judged him for this. I kinda wish for Wood to do an extra Hogwarts year just like Flint did, because I love that character, and his Scottish accent. Wood and McGonagall speaking with eachother in Scottish would be awesome.

****** Boring. The Babel effect in such a fic is maximized by as many different languages and as much confusion possible. Should I come to Hogwarts and be hit with such a spell I know I definitely wouldn't be speaking my countries language Dutch, but rather a strange Rhine dialect that is a mixture of Dutch and German, and not just words and pronunciation, but grammar as well.
