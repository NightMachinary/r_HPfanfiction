[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/52/For-Love-of-Magic][Here]] is a link to the newest chapter of for love of magic. I think its pretty good, but the latest chapter has harry railing against muslims for some reason. I reached out to the author, and he tried to give an excuse that it was just his character's opinion and not his own, but then said that "[islam] is a piece of shit anyway." So that makes me think its his own opinion.

You know, I'm mildly annoyed when people make HP characters fans of their favorite band, but alt-right bullshit just takes the cake as far as i'm concerned. Like alright I can just skip over a lengthy scene about how great the band Blur is, but this soils the entire story for me.


** Given everything that has happened in that story before now, this isn't surprising. It's far from the first thinly veiled author rant through Harry.

**** There are lots of unapologetic self-insert power-wank harem fics. It's unusual for the author to take the additional step of having Harry rant about their pet social and political issues. "Partially Kissed Hero" is famous for it, as was "Knowledge is Power". But "For Love of Magic" joined that club ages ago - pretty sure Harry has had rants about feminism before.

***** Yeah he went full fascist and started talking about how men and women are inherently different, and how men are biologically designed to rule over submissive child-bearing females. Noodlehammer literally wrote the sentences, "some form of marriage and the basic family unit is the foundation upon which a strong society is built", and "[feminism] permits and even encourages ruinous levels of narcissistic selfishness in women"

He then ramped it up by having Harry openly talk about how some people are born naturally superior to others, and it is necessary for them to seize control of national industries and rule with an iron boot to ensure the survival of society Like, it's always been pretty obvious, but he just made it explicit.

That's not even counting the obvious racism and hatred of all non-white minorities. Or, "knuckle-dragging subhumans", as he once called them.

------ ------ ------

Hey FYI, If you disagree with me calling this fascism, I understand, but I encourage you to read Umberto Eco's [[https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/][Ur Fascism]], one of the most influential works in the modern academic study of fascist ideology. The way I'm using the term isn't the catch-all for authoritarianism that's normally used, and I ecnourage /everyone/ to read at least his [[http://www.openculture.com/2016/11/umberto-eco-makes-a-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html][bulleted list]] from the essay as to what constitutes fascism. It'll only take 5 minutes, I promise. It gives me at least a lot of insight into understanding many political events and movements, both modern and historical

I'm super open to having a conversation over whether FLoM's Harry is a fascist or not, because I think it's a very debatable issue, but only in good faith, and with the understanding that "fascism" has a much more nuanced meaning then "authoritarian and violent government". I know it's often used that way in the news, but fuck those people for ruining a perfectly valid academic term to describe anyone and anything they don't like, from Theresa May to Bernie Sanders to Vladimir Putin to Greenpeace.

Just educate them on it and carry on your own way. It's never stated to burn down libraries (quite the opposite, actually, because a thirst for knowledge is a must for every single Muslim, just like praying or fasting) or kill random people because of it.

As for the perpetrator in question, I'm not saying some aren't completely cray-cray. But he's not religiously motivated because it's clearly forbidden to do that in Islam. We call these people 'متطرفين' meaning they're not really Muslims, religiously motivated but wrongly so, not quite knowing what the Quran actually says about such things. So he /seems/ religiously motivated but in reality, he isn't because it's clearly forbidden.

The majority of Muslims in Germany are antisemitic, something that won't win you any popularity contests here either. Then there are the countless crimes committed by members of that religion, which are not related to it directly but to the culture which developed in Muslim countries. I mean stuff like honour killings if the girl is "impure". Add to that the general unwillingness of many Muslim 3rd generation immigrants to integrate into society (still keeping their Turkish passport, overall negative behaviour in public places) and you have your fair share of reasons.

TL;DR: It is not as much about the religion as about a significant amount of its followers who do fucked-up stuff with blurry lines between religion, culture and nationality. People from Muslim countries are leading the German crime statistics in all areas besides crimes against property.

** Personally I don't care if it's the authors views or not, the characters opinions in the latest chapter are completely in character. Harry in this story has been a piece of shit all the way through, this isn't a random rant out of character, and so I don't mind it. If it came out of nowhere and made no sense in the context of the characters and story it would be bizzare, but this fits.

If you suddenly have a problem with this just because it mentions islam specifically that's a problem on your end, not sure why you're getting so worked up by this. Especially with all the other shit the character has said and done throughout the story.

I enjoy this story, and I will likely continue to do so, whether or not I agree with the character/authors opinions has no bearing on my enjoyment of the story as long as it doesn't derail the plot or start causing characters to act against their already established character, which this hasn't.

If you're only just now realising that the Harry in this story holds these views you haven't been paying attention. If you don't like it unfollow and move on.

It's indeed true that most terrorists are not muslims or Islam followers. But (quotes from the report):

#+begin_quote
  In recent years there has been an increase in the frequency of jihadist attacks, but a decrease in the sophistication of their preparation and execution. Jihadist attacks, however, cause more deaths and casualties than any other terrorist attacks.
#+end_quote

And

#+begin_quote
  Recent attacks prove jihadist terrorists' preference for attacking people rather than other targets provoking less of an emotional response from the general public, such as damage to premises or loss of capital.

********** So how about making rape illegal instead of making being a witch/wizard illegal? And I think in those times, nobody would fault a husband for killing his wife's rapist, no matter if the rapist was a wizard or not (as long as the rapist didn't happen to be a nobleman).

Killing all known witches and wizards just because they /might/ do bad things without anyone knowing is kinda like killing all men because they might rape. It's just not rational. Like, killing a witch that uses her powers to heal the muggles in her village doesn't make any sense in terms of protecting the muggles. Those witches and wizards who /actually/ harm muggles are likely those who don't get found out anyways.

So maybe in the beginning the main reason for "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" was because whoever wrote it had some really bad experience with witches and couldn't imagine there being any good ones, so in their eyes it made sense to kill them all. But at some point, people started believing in what was written without asking questions, and at some point the rationale for killing witches changed from "we believe they hurt us and we can't defend ourselves otherwise" to "God's word says they consort with the devil and that we need to kill them for that", and that is definitely more religion than anything else.

If the European wizards were as strong as to force everyone else to hide as well just because of that, they could have easily dealt with the European muggles.

****************** Seems to me like we are quite lucky that the reaction of wizards and witches to being hunted was the Statute of Secrecy and not a full-scale war against muggles. They could have won easily if they were ruthless enough. There are dozens of ways for a wizard or witch (damn it isn't there some term that includes both genders?) to control a muggle leader, from simple threats to love potions and the Imperius. Probably wouldn't be hard to kill off most muggles within a few decades, or at least throw their societies into total chaos.

In other words, I don't think that offending an advanced species by killing their members is a good idea, no matter if they sometimes do things we consider crimes.

For me it means that mundane world (in Europe it's most likely Church) has something to oppose wizards and witches. The confrontation between them led to a bloody war (including the Witch Hunt) and as result the Statute was introduced as sort of agreement in order to not destroy each other completely or to avoid more causalities.

Magical community is very small and corrupted. They didn't want to think that mere muggles forced them to hide and therefore they rewrote their history erasing all mentions of their shame.

And this creates a hypocrisy which brings us to the crux of the issue. Protestants are not lumped in with Catholics because, in the West, people are aware of the distinction. Yet in the two sentences before you want a more visible split to differentiate. The reality is that distinctions in the Muslim world /do/ exist just as prevalently as that between Protestants and Catholics. If you think there needs to be more visible split then you are simply not doing enough to find out about the splits, because they are apparent and people are trying to raise awareness about it every day.

  Speaking of dumb monkeys, Harry had never realized how many foreigners there were in Europe these days. People from failed African states and backwards Middle Eastern ones, every variety of sub-optimally cultured human. Which idiot thought it was a good idea to open the gates for the barbarians? London even had a Muslim mayor for fuck's sake.
#+end_quote

But of course, that's just the opinion of Harry in the story and not part of a shitty alt-right ideology.

I was super confused especially considering there was an entire arc where Harry has to accept what the magic does and how it affected his relationship with Tonks, only for him to rape Narcissa.

** It's a really problematic fic for a lot of reasons (borderline misogyny, extremist views of all types, occasional nonsense, unnuanced reactions by side characters) but despite all its flaws, I've really enjoyed it up until this point. Some of the sex is really fun and original, some of the side characters are genuinely intriguing, the world building, when it makes sense, is fantastic in the original sense of the word--- the fic has a lot of depth and a lot of great qualities. The shape of the plot is dynamic and it never fails to entertain.

But this just disgusts me. Monkeys and human garbage? It doesn't matter who the group is, that's just unconscionable. That's not hatred of a religion, that's straight up racism. This is the sort of person who would've joined he Nazi or the Klu Klux Clan, because he sees an entire culture of people as not only inhuman, but repulsive.

It's super unfortunate. I hope later in life he realizes his views were extremely ignorant and matures. Until then, I can't bear to be around it.

By his own words he says he has no contact with the outside world, describes himself as fat and so on. He is your typical neckbeard and could easily fit in on [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]]

It's pretty evident he has nihilistic beliefs as shown right from the beginning of the story, and his depiction of Harry is how he wished his life was. With no one to tell him otherwise and only the internet at his disposal, he's clearly been infected with right wing propaganda, and it is easy to be infected with both far right and far left propaganda.

Instead of being angry or disgusted with him, I honestly pity him. We should look at disenfranchised people like this on the fringes of society and instead of pushing them further into nihilism, we should try pulling them out of it.

Europe has been in conflict with Muslims for close to one and a half millennia now, starting with the Moorish conquests in the 8th century and the crusades during the Middle Ages, the defeat of the Muslim Hordes in modern-day Russia and Reconquista in the Renaissance while most of the Modern period was spent battling the Ottomans for Hegemony over Eastern Europe. Hell, during the HP era there was the Yugoslavia conflict, where religion was one of the main issues.

** Quite honestly, it does not seem that you know what the Alt-Right is. You could have called it right, or even far right and you wouldn't have been wrong, but hating Islam has no connection to the Alt-Right. After the Alt-Right split into multiple different groups those who stayed in the Alt Right were Nazis. Nazis and muslim Extremists actually often worked together, as has been seen countless times during the Second World War. They share similar world views, thus Nazis/Alt-Right have a strong favorable bias towards muslims. (of course especialy towards extreme ones) The hate on muslims in the right mostly comes from part of the establishment republicans (Ben Shapiro etc.), the new right (also jokingly called alt-lite) and identitarian movements in europe. Finaly, as the Alt Right actually is a group of Nazis, it is highly offensive towards the author, no matter what his believes are. To say that a religion/a belief system is shit is something different from asking for mass genozide, a Nationalist-Sozialist state and the end of freedom of speech as well as the murder of every homosexual, communist and disabled person on the planet. I personaly believe that no one should in their fanfiction try to cramp their political views down ones throat, but neither do I believe in name calling and stating wrong facts.

i'm as liberal as an american citizen who was asian by birth can come(my parents are still asian). true believer muslims are garbage no matter where you go.\\
i donated to bernie, then voted for hillary - that's how liberal i am. trump is an asshat. i still believe muslims should stay in their hellhole countries unless they renounce islam. they need to be shamed out of believing their toxic conservative hate spewing religion.\\
name any aspect of their religion and i can debate you on whether it's garbage or not.\\
spoiler alert:it's not gonna be good.

btw liberal muslims don't even exist to their own people. they're branded non-believers. make of that what you will

also threads aren't "over" til they expire

** Religion is a stain on mankind that needs to be cut away.Religion is a cancerous growth that spreads and infects and destroys. Christianity did it, Islam does it.

Fact is, as soon as Islam is target of critic, people freak out.

I wish people would keep their shitty Religion in their private life, where it belongs. I wish our Nations would ban religion from public space. Shitheads posting their "Deus Vult" comments, when Arabs die, or an Migrant has commited a crime. Islamists slaughtering people in the name of their god. How can anyone seriously expect that this is something we should uphold? Banish Religion from the public. Tax the churches, the mosques.

But it wont happen. As long as there are countries ruled by christian parties, or straight away by radical islamists. Nothing will change.

I wish the Enlightenment would have spread through the world and burned away all those silly beliefs.

Gotta move along and hope for the best.

Sidenote: love how some of you freak out 'cause someone got an opinion.
