Looking for fics where Harry somehow ends up in a different dimension and sets up his own powerful faction(?) group(?) kinda like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8933408/1/Wizard-Runemaster][Wizard Runemaster]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12397161/1/Same-Song-Different-Verse][Same song different vers]]

For Wizard runemaster specifically how he brings the goblins over and sets them up. And Same song is basically how he just takes over via robots and has baby's with everyone. I'm finding it hard to specify what exactly I'm looking for here so I'll leave this here and if you think you have something please drop a link.


** I feel like linkffn(havoc side of the force) was something along these lines.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

  Harry's unspeakably bored, and bored Unspeakables make bad decisions. Like jumping through the Veil of Death, when they're barely even certain it's safe. Where it goes? ...That's still a mystery. But hey! "Chase that flighty temptress adventure," right?...Right? - Harry steps through the Veil, and into Mass Effect. The Reapers won't know what hit them. MODHarry.

** That reminds me of A Third Path to the Future by Vimesenthusiast linkffn(9443327). The story is ultra long and has been posting for more than half a decade now. I lost interest a long time ago due to the author's verbose nature and long chapters that progress the plot by too little, but if the subject matter is to your liking, you can give this one a shot.

I think The Swallow and the Dragon by Flameraiser linkffn(12343855) should count too. It's a Harry in the Witcher verse tale and those are pretty rare.

I'm drawing a blank after that. There are plenty of crossovers where Harry joins another local faction, such as the Avengers in the MCU, but I can't think of any more that would fit your request.

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.

  Harry finds a dying ashen haired girl in his backyard being attacked by men in skeleton armor. He obviously swoops in and kills them saving the girl before taking her to his home to heal her. He didn't know the far reaching consequences this would have on him personally. This will start in Harry Potter world but ultimately take place in the Witcher for the most part.
