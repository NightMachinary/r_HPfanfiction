** My first thought was having them end up as Sherlock Holmes and Watson. With George being super mad because everyone thinks he is the sidekick.

Another idea is them being swapped with Ron time-wise. Making Ron the big brother would make them quite upset. It would end up being canon rehash unless you make it 7th year or something.

You could also do a time travel fic where in the end they are Merlin.

** u/Deathcrow:
#+begin_quote
  AU where both survived, never married and became very successful inventors/alchemists in their thirties
#+end_quote

You better have a good explanation for this. Are they asexual? I'm not gay at all, but they should be extremely swarmed by women. They are extremely successful, witty and not disgusting to look at. They also come from a somewhat traditional large family, so I'd expect them to desire a family of their own at some point.

*** I'm thinking they've both had multiple relationships throughout the years, but none have stuck. In canon, everyone kind of married really young, but it's entirely possible that F&G could have just been swallowed by their work and could have developed some issues with accepting additional commitments. They have each other as constant company, so probably don't feel as lonely as others in similar situations might've. No incest whatsoever. I just don't want romance to be a central element.

**** But how would a background relationship be in the way of that? You can have a few lines here and there and still keep the narrative focus on other things.

***** I don't think it would be â€˜in the way,' but it would divert attention from what I would like to be the focus; their adventures and the challenges they'd encounter. Would the lack of romantic partners be a minus? They'd still be the flirty fellows you'd expect them to be, but I don't want to spend time on developing a deep relationship when it isn't strictly necessary.
