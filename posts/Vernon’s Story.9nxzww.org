Vernon Dursley was a very normal man. He exceeded at his work and was always thinking hard when walking to work. But this particular day he couldn't concentrate. When he left that morning, after giving his loving wife Petunia a kiss goodbye and hugging his wonderfully cute son, he got a bit distracted. On the stone wall there was a sweet little grey and striped cat. Vernon wanted to pet the cat, but figured he'd might scare it, and he had to laugh to himself after a double-take; it looked like the cat was staring at a map. The cat just sat there watching Vernon, so he waved at the cat. He'd call it Minnie, Vernon always loved to have a name for things.

Before entering his office Vernon heard someone saying the name “Potter”. He began to smile, he hadn't thought of the Potters in a long time. The Potters were Petunias sister and brother-in-law. Vernon found his brother-in-law a bit strange, but always funny. Last time they'd spoke, James Potter got mad after a misunderstood joke that Vernon told about a Japanese golfer. James got offended, and said that “Japanese people are nothing like that, we've visited Mahoutokoro during my time at Hogwarts, and they are all very nice”. Vernon didn't really believe James' stories about this Hogwarts, but both Petunia and her sister insisted on it being true. During that dinner James and Vernon got into a bit of row, James talked about his family's money, Vernon made fun of James not having a car. The evening ended with Vernon and Petunia storming out. Petunia and Lily shared a last moment of eye contact when Vernon dragged Petunia with him. Both Vernon and James told their wife that this did not go as planned.

“How's it going, Vernie?”, said Marvin Finch from behind Vernon's back. “Oh, hi Finch. Nothing much, just thinking about long awaited family reunion. How's the wife and the kid...Justin right?” “That sounds nice! They're fine, Justin's been getting out of his crib in the weirdest ways these last few days”. Vernon always enjoyed it when Marvin told stories about his son, and how the strangest things always seemed to happen to him.

That evening Vernon mentioned to Petunia how they should try and invite the Potters over for dinner sometime. Petunia lit up, she knew James was mad at Vernon, but figured it was both ways. “Really?” she said. “Then Dudley can finally play with his cousin and we can meet little Harry!”. “That'll be great! I've been meaning to apologize for my insensitive joke from last time” said Vernon.

Vernon looked out of the bedroom window, wondering why the street lights hadn't turned on. He shrugged his shoulders and laid down next his wife. “Petunia? Do you think James would want to come? Maybe if I say he should bring that broom-thingy?” “Yes, dear. I think he'd like that” said Petunia. “I think so too” said Vernon while slowly dozing off to the distant sound of an engine closing in.
