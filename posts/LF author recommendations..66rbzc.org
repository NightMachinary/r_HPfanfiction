So I know this is a bit vague but can anyone recommend some authors that have a similar writing style to LeQuin? They don't necessarily have to feature the same pairings but lately I've really enjoyed reading LeQuin's stories and wanted to see if there were others out there with a similar style. Thanks in advance.
