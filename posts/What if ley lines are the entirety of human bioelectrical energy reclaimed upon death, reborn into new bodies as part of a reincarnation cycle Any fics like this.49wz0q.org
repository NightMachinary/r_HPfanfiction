** This premise makes my head hurt. The human body isn't a giant battery. And one would think people would start exploding from overcharging with all the energy accumulated in life after life.

*** I never said it was but energy isn't destroyed, just changed, and the human body creates electrical impulses as ions cross cell membranes. So no, we're not batteries. But we are partially generators.

And why would you automatically assume it's a cumulative process?

**** And the electrical impulses we generate doesn't just keep floating around inside our bodies. They are used in processes and the energy leaves out bodies as heat, chemicals etc. There remains no bioelectrical energy to be "reclaimed".

** Yes.

It's called 'final fantasy 7'.

The process you described is the energy powering the Mako reactors and acts as the excuse for why you start the game after having shacked up with eco-terrorists.

*** Is that the premise? I beat ff7 then never played a final fantasy game again.

**** Yeah, you remember when you blow up those Mako reactors? And when you discover the truth in furry faux-indian disco land? That's basically this.

** I can't see how this would change or inspire the plot. What would be the point of the fic?

** I would prefer the mechanic be interpreted as the magic from dying witches or wizards goes to ley lines. This would make a small degree of sense (nothing physically tangible including energy passes to the afterlife).

By itself it wouldn't be a concept large enough to base an entire fic around but it does have potential to serve as an interesting mechanic used by either the protagonist or antagonist.

*** I forgot a word in the original post. 'Potential' after energy. And I saw it as basically

"Protagonist[Harry?] breaks the reincarnation cycle in someway. Either reborn with all knowledge in a new body in a Voldemort controlled world" or it's a redo/time reset fic and his reincarnation is rerouted to his birth, potentially repeatedly. The latter is ick because too many already.

Edit: it could also be used as a living godhood fic. Protagonist has to stop antagonist from tapping the power to become a god.
