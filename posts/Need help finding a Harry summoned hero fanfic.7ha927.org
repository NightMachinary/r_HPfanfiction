I remember only a few things distinctly about this fanfic. Harry was summoned from another dimension but he isn't able to go back. I think the Mirror of Erised broke? Harry's best friend/love in his original universe, Hermione, has given up magic and left hogwarts. She goes to a normal school, and Harry watches her because he misses his old friend. One day, Hermione is cornered by three muggle boys and Harry steps in and fights them off. I think he also fights death eaters at a Weasley party, but I'm not sure.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

**** His last update of that story received severe backlash from readers. A lot of them unfavorited and unfollowed it, so he took it down.

***** do you know if its better for an author to have his story be favorited or followed? cuz i always favorite but never follow, so i don't know if i'm screwing the author or not.

****** Eh... Personally I appreciate them all the same. Some want reviews more than favs and follows, but generally I think it's no problem even if you just favorite.

James Spookie got a lot of UNfavorite and UNfollow, that's why he took down the story.

******* yeah, i got the part about James (i think the only story of his that i haven't read on FF.net is The Fourth Champ. Really like his style of writing). Yeah, i only review if its a new story for me, or if its a particularly good chapter.
