I don't like how Ron is portrayed in most fics where he's basically a total loser who eats a lot and only redeeming factor is that he's friends with cool people. AFAIK Ron and Harry were about equal magically and mentally, it's just that Harry was the main character and had a slightly better work ethic.

Are there any fics with a Ron that's roughly equal in power to Harry (ex. if Harry is overpowered, so is Ron to even it out) and plays a bigger role than "sidekick"? No slash fics please.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging_the_Sword][Forging the Sword]] has one of the /best/ Rons in my opinion. While he isn't quite on the same level as Harry power-wise or magic-wise, he has other talents/skills/knowledge to make up the difference, and still have a well-rounded and balanced trio.

*** Personally, I think it makes sense that Ron isn't Harry's equal one-for-one. Canon clearly shows that Ron is very strategic (though doesn't expand upon it in his later years) and I don't doubt that, in a slightly different setting, that Ron could flourish with that skill in mind. Great recommendation!

** Here's an interesting one for you. Linkffn(weasley girl). Ron weasley is Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley. This is a "ripple effect" fic (one where you change one or two things and watch what happens). This is my favorite of those fics because most of them have slavishly similar plots to the original and this one gets off those rails pretty quickly. There's also a really old fic where Ron is a seer. I wonder if I can find it . . .

*** Found it. Linkffn(the book of Morgan le fey) and its sequel linkffn(the final reckoning by lavenderbrown) are great fics written after OotP and before HBP. This leaves the fics feeling very odd. No Horcruxes. No Slughorn, no scrimgeour. That being said I really liked them both and Ron goes from being the co-protagonist in the first to the main narrator I'm the second. Also, here's a link to my thread where I asked if anyone had (ron-centric seer fics)[[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3xnerh/lf_fics_where_ron_is_a_seer/]]]

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

** Two one-shots that are both Ron-centric and where he excels, although not necessarily in the same areas as Harry: linkffn(Number Games by jbern, Raiders of the Lost Horcrux by NothingPretentious).

I also second Forging the Sword, but other than that I can't think of any. I look forward to seeing new ones in this thread - I think Ron generally gets a raw deal in fanfiction due to the number of people who focus on the films rather than books when it comes to characterisation, and I like stories he's strong in.
