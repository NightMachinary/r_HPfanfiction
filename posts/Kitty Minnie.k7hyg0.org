** Does anybody remember the title of the fic where Harry time travels back to his kid body and vows to have fun and mess with people? He caught McGonagall in cat form while she was spying on him in Privet Drive and proceeded to give her a bath, pretending that he was just a kid who wanted to play with the kitty.

*** linkffn(4594972) Comes to mind

I'm sure this has been done a few times, I know I've seen it before in another (longer) story, but can't remember which one it was. I really hope someone else replies with it though :>

** It happens hilariously in chapter 3 of To Catch a Thief by Elvirakitties, but the writing style is not for everybody. linkao3(12429789)

There's also a rather sweet (in my opinion) story of a school-aged Severus who tries to protect a cat from being used in transfiguration class. Out of the Bag by iibnf linkao3(289292)
