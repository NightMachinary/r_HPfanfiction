Why is it that types of duties just get delegated to Gringotts, a /bank/?

Need your whole bloodline checked? Gringotts!

Need someone to make sure your will is carried out? Gringotts!

Need some new credentials? Gringotts!

Like, I can understand some things, but a completely new history and the abillity to dissapear. What kind of banks do you go to that you get these ideas?

A lot of the tasks that are given to Gringotts are things that I'd rather see done by the government.


** Same here. But, one fic did it, a bunch of others copied and others copied them leading to a vicious cycle.

Although having the goblins do it kind of makes sense, as they guard vaults full of items not just money, so say if your grandfather was someone you could claim it and get another key. Instead of going to Ministry than Gringotts, why not do it all at Gringotts.

Saves more time for us lazy writers that want to show 99+ marriage contracts, all the money in the world and the Merlin-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Armami-Versace-Einstein-Potter Lord to find out Dumbledore betraying him.

Although I would love to see a more economical centred fic. Like it's not smart to leave all the money in one bank for all the Wizarding world. I feel like the Malfoys should have made a bank and use it for money laundering to support Voldemort.

God I need a fic like that now!

#+end_quote

Gnome is from one of the french words for 'small earth-dwelling people'. The swiss gnomes could be goblins or dwarfs as to species, or something else entirely.

The "gnomes of zurich" was a snide name for Swiss bankers during the 1950s, when they were suspected of conspiring to cause a run on Sterling. Its currency as a way of referring to the secretive and (presumed) sinister practise of the Swiss banking industry was helped along somewhat by the Swiss finding it hilarious and, in a few cases, actually adopting it.

I've come to the conclusion that since magic does so much for people, Wizardry is in many (but not all) ways a post-scarcity society. And the Ministry is a giant job creation scheme to keep as many people as possible occupied with non-work.

#+end_quote

Gringotts isn't even a bank, at least not in any useful sense. Or, at the very least, it is a remarkably /shitty/ bank.

You see, the key function of any bank is to /make loans/. This is how a bank makes money, and that is how it can convince people to make deposits: by offering its depositors a return of some rate on their deposits. The logical, effective way to do this is through fractional reserve lending; you keep /some/ percentage of all deposits in reserve so you can meet any demand for withdrawals while loaning the rest out. Gringotts, with its system of literal coined, hard currency sitting still in inaccessible vaults, cannot do this. (Unless its constantly moving coinage around in between personal vaults, but, seriously, why would they be doing that when you can do the same thing on paper?)

So canon Gringotts is a bank that doesn't do any banking; canon Gringotts is a glorified collection of safety deposit boxes. Amazingly, the fanfiction world often manages to have it make even less sense.

*** While I agree with the fact that Gringott's is a remarkably shitty bank by human standards, we're never told WHY the goblins are bankers. It may be that Goblin magic depends on proximity to gold or some perceived value of stored wealth, making it far more valuable for them to hold all the gold in storage and not loan it out.

There's no evidence of this in canon, but it's a possibility at least.

*** How would they constantly move money between vaults? Magic. Nice and simple, magic could do it. And if they can do it easily with magic, why would they develop any other way of doing it. Paper banking might seem obvious to us, but at some point someone had to have the creativity to break away from "this money belongs to this person, so much be physically kept separate from that money which belongs to that person". If you've got no impetus to change the status quo, then it won't change.

** You're kind of preaching to the choir here, for the most part. But for the sake of argument, /some/ of these make sense within a certain school of worldbuilding. Let me demonstrate:

#+begin_quote
  Need someone to make sure your will is carried out? Gringotts!
#+end_quote

If wizards really /do/ entrust all of their money, in the form of piles of gold, to Gringotts, and have done so for a while, then consider that this must mean they have been doing this since before there was a Ministry of Magic. There was, of course, a Wizards' Council, but they sound like people who made important diplomatic decisions, not a bureaucracy. So if there was a legal authority then that could have overseen the carrying out of will, it would have had to be the Muggle one, which wizards wouldn't trust, because immoral wizards could easily tamper with a Muggle solicitor's memories. Ergo, Occam's Razor suggests the easiest way out of this is just to let a neutral party who won't ever let itself be corrupted by wizards, Goblins, handle it --- especially as the practical effects of the will being carried out will be Goblins moving the money from one of their vaults to another, without it every leaving Gringotts.

(It's perhaps interesting to note that while in canon, it /is/ the Ministry that handles the execution of Dumbledore's last will and testament, it is a testament concerned with personal items like books or the Deluminators, which were /not/ contained in a Gringotts Vault.)

#+begin_quote
  Need your bloodline tested? Gringotts!
#+end_quote

Once we have established this, let us turn to the issue of the bloodline tests. Goblins, we are told, have developed their own schools of witchery, even if they wish they could learn wanded magic too. If their people are bankers and will-executors, what sorts of magic /would/ they have developed? When you put it like that, it's perfectly sensible that Goblins would have developed a potion or whatever that performs more or less like a Muggle genetics test.

So why would you go to Gringotts to get your bloodline checked even if it's not to prove you're the rightful heir to a fortune kept at Gringotts? Simple: the Goblins, of course, jealously guard /their/ magical techniques (i.e. Goblin Silver) from the wizards, just as the wizards conceal the secrets of Wandlore from the Goblins. Hence the secret of the magical bloodline test will remain in Gringotts' hands unless a wizard goes through the trouble of inventing it all over again on their own. Being businessmen, the Goblins will not allow that to happen and instead milk their advantage by selling, on the side, this service of bloodline tests, for a price that is harsh, but not so unreasonable that the wizards would be compelled to hunker down and replicate the spell themselves.

#+begin_quote
  What kind of banks do you go to that you get these ideas?
#+end_quote

This line of reasoning is the weakest of the "Gringotts shouldn't do all these things" argument, I think. Most banks don't do bloodline tests, but neither are they run by Goblins; neither do they overlap with sovereign nations; neither do they keep the money in the form of literal piles of golden doubloons kept in literal underground vaults guarded by literal fire-breathing dragons.

Also:

#+begin_quote
  Need some new credentials? Gringotts!
#+end_quote

There I'm simply not getting what you're referring to. Do you mean new titles (i.e. "you are Lord Peverell!")?

In this case, I would say the issue is with the assumption that Lords are a thing in Wizarding society, but that aside, this extends fairly obviously from the aforementioned bloodline tests. If the bloodline test turns up that you are the scion of an old noble line, then obviously, in a roundabout way, the Goblins have "made" you a Lord --- and I don't think even the worst Lord Potter stories posit anything more than that; the Goblins don't /confer titles upon people/, they're just the medium by which people realize a heritage that had supposedly been theirs all along, and might have come out in all sorts of other ways with the same result of Lord Potter being proclaimed.

The (entire) wizarding economy run by creatures the government actively discriminates against. I don't think the whole Goblin Nation running Gringotts is cannon, but if is, given how controlling so many of these characters are, there is no way they would let a separate legal system control their economy.

Forget about all the crazy stuff you see in fannon: A deposit bank as described in the books wouldn't have tellers. And in an economy where most if it is actively ignorant and hostile to external influences, the bank wouldn't run a currency exchange.

** Some banks, particularly the ones catering to the wealthy, have a concierge service that will do pretty much whatever you can stand the charges for. Coutts* are moderately famous for having a fairly resourceful concierge service.

Most retail banks will provide an executorial and trustee service, although it's more usual to put that in the hands of the law firm that wrote your will for you.

Magical Britain is quite a low-trust environment, from a business point of view, and so it does make a certain amount of sense to go to an independent third party for things like probate to keep it out of the hands of the Ministry (which was only just coming within the purview of the Royal courts around the time of the Statute of Secrecy, so it's by no means obvious that it's being done by the Ministry of Magic at the present day) who we /do/ see intercepting bequests and interfering with them.

And clearly there /is/ some way around Ministry interference: Sirius Black's estate was able to pass to Harry even though the Ministry had been shown no evidence he was even dead and as far as they knew he was a felon on the run at the time.

We don't see any evidence in canon of Gringotts providing anything other than vault storage, not even banking as we currently understand it. We don't even see them providing cursebreaking services: for all we know Bill Weasley did his work solely for Gringotts themselves and not for any of their clients. Although my personal headcanon is that they /do/ offer contract cursebreaking services, and their presence in Egypt is because the Nile Valley is the post-statute-of-secrecy equivalent of France's Zone Rouge, unlikely to be fully cleared for centuries yet.

* Headcanon: a lot of the old retail and merchant banks have at least part-goblin ownership in the HPVerse, and are the goblins' means of trading with the surface that don't involve dealing with the insanity of wizards. Coutts and Hoare & Co. would be the usual suspects in London.
