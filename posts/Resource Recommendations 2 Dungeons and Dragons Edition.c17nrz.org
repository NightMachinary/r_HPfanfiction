Hello again, it is I, csmalley1992, come to shout into the void that is Reddit about the fact that I mine tabletop roleplaying game books for material and inspiration.

This post is about what I use from the TRPG granddaddy, the series that has had as much of an impact on fantasy as Tolkien himself, Dungeons and Dragons.

“But I've never played D&D!” I hear some of you cry. Yes, neither have I, but have you, for example, ever played any Elder Scrolls games?

The entire game-world of TES series sprung from a homebrew D&D campaign, at least in the beginning.

So, Dungeons and Dragons; the very first edition was published in 1974, as a spin off of a miniature medieval wargame, Chainmail. Both were written by Gary Gygax and Jeff Perren and D&D was published by Tactical Studies Rules, a company founded by Gygax and Don Kaye because no other publisher would take the risk to publish a fantasy game like D&D.

Since 1974, Dungeons and Dragons has changed publisher hands several times, now being published by Wizards of the Coast, a subsidy of Hasbro (yes, the people in charge of magical ponies and morphing alien robots also owns Dungeons and Dragons).

The most recent edition is the 5th Edition. But I use books from all editions and will try to mark from which edition each book comes from. Mind you, these books are all from the mainline game. And away we go;

After the success of the original D&D, TSR decided to split the game into Basic Dungeons and Dragons, for beginners, and Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, for everyone else.

From Basic:

Book of Marvelous Magic [published 1985]: A supplement book that expands the magic rules from Basic. Covers spells and magic items.

From AD&D, 1st Edition:

Unearthed Arcana [1st Edition, published 1985]: Variant rules, including spells and magic items.

From AD&D 2nd Edition:

Tome of Magic [Published 1991]: More variant rules for magic; also lists spells and other magic.

Player's Options: Magic & Spells [published 1996]: Another supplement for magic.

The Complete...Handbook Series was a series of extra reference books for each class, listing options, variants, and extras, and I have found the following helpful;

The Complete Wizard's Handbook [1990]

The Complete Priest's Handbook [1990]

The Complete Druid's Handbook [1994]

Then there's the Spell Compendiums for Priests [3 volumes, 1999-2000] and Wizards [4 volumes, 1996-98], the Magic Encyclopedia [2 volumes, 1992-93] and the Encyclopedia Magica [4 volumes, 1994-95].

College of Wizardry [1998]: details a magical school.

And finally, the World Builder's Guidebook [1996] is about how to make a homebrew campaign.

Edition 3.0 was published in 2000 and a revision, 3.5, was released in 2004:

The Book of Vile Darkness [2002]: This is a supplement book for truly evil things; stuff that would make Voldemort look like an alter boy and Horcruxes and the Unforgivables like Fischer Price toys.

The Book of Exalted Deeds [2003]: Vile Darkness' complete opposite book.

Complete Arcane [2004]: Covers more magic options

Complete Mage [2007]: More magic options.

Magic of Incarnum [2005]: Soul magic options

Spell Compendium [2005]: Collects various spells from various previous books and some articles.

Unearthed Arcana [2004].

Fourth edition was published starting in 2008:

Players Handbook 2-Primal, Arcane, and Divine Heroes [2008]

Arcane Power - Options for Bards, Sorcerers, Swordmages, Warlocks and Wizards [2009]

Primal Power - Options for Barbarians, Druids, Shamans and Wardens [2009]

5th Edition, started in 2010:

Xanathar's Guide to Everything [2017]: A good all around book.
