So, my OC Carrie Wood will attend the Quidditch World Cup in 1994. These are the situations.

1. She's reporting on it for Quidditch Weekly and sits in the press box.

2. She attends it with her Uncle and Cousin Oliver and sits with them.

3. She's close friends with Aidan Lynch (the seeker for the Irish team) and he buys her a ticket to go. He has parents but they don't accept him being a wizard.

If I use 2 or 3 I can have her report the right facts about the Triwizard Tournament.


** 1 and 2 sound the most believable to me. 3 just makes me care more about Aidan than your OC.

*** After the match, she'll end up interviewing the team anyway if I go with number one.

If I go with number two, she'll end up going to congratulate the team.

** If she's reporting on it for Quidditch Weekly then why would she be reporting on the Triwzard Tournament, which, unless altered, does not contain any quidditch?

If you want her in a position to report on both events it's cleaner to make her a 'Sports and Games' (or something) reporter for some other publication or something that would have press credentials for everything. It's an easier sell than a Quidditch beat reporter being sent to both events. Unless your plan is to drastically alter the tournament to include Quidditch, it's not really feasible for her to cover both. A suggestion to eliminate that would be rather than 'Quidditch Weekly' have it be like 'Magical Games Weekly' or something and imply that she, or the magazine, covers things like local Quadpot or other sporting events.

Your premise with three both does what [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] says and also isn't really a mutually exclusive thing. As someone who's worked in professional sports I can tell you it's not very difficult for an athlete to get tickets for friends and family for anything. So the implication that he got her a ticket rather than his parents, rings false. He could have easily gotten three tickets. He could probably have easily gotten fifty tickets. She could certainly be there to support her friend, but I wouldn't imply that him giving a close friend a ticket is something that cost him anything at all. Most athletes are allotted more tickets for events like that then they actually use.

** I like 2 and 3! Good luck. If you need someone to read any story you have up eventually, I'd be down.
