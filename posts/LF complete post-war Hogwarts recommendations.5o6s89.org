I haven't been reading fanfic for very long, so I am pretty clean slate. Are there any particularly good fics about the students of Hogwarts after the war (not so much 8th year, but I am not opposed to that either)? Maybe with Harry or someone coming back as a professor? Anything else you think is a good post-war fic is welcome as well. Thanks!


** linkffn(contractual invalidation)

Just read this. A great romance fic and a different than usual take on the marriage contract trope. Highly recommend.

Linkffn(the sum of their parts)

Harry becomes a dark lord, but mostly because the magical world is in serious need of reform. Pretty popular because of its plot, though the writing could be better.

*** Thank you thank you thank you!!! Wow. Not since A Black Comedy and jbern's writings I was so taken by a story. R-dude is awesome, and I want to read some original stories by him. Wow. I'm hugely under impression of Contractual Invalidation - /this/ is Harry I want to see, this is what he should've become. That's and I'm a sucker for H/D, too :-)

** I have a bunch of fics saved on my laptop, some of the longer ones I haven't gotten to read all the way through, but I've at least skimmed through them. Here's what I've got for postwar:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/63383][A Rose, By Any Other Name]] (George/Lee, Explicit - 9922 words) - George picks up the pieces of his brother's life.

[[http://www.potterficweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/AtE.pdf][After the End]] (Ron/Hermione Harry/Ginny, Mature - 632204 words) - Deals with the aftermath of the war. It was written before OotP, but it's interesting to see what the authors speculated about the end of the series. Different characters live/die, so it explores character directions that weren't in canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4798208/1/][An Interview With Justin Finch-Fletchley]] (Gen, Teen+ - 23153 words) - Ten years after Voldemort's defeat, Lee Jordan interviews Justin about his experiences.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/840575][Not What She Expected]] (Gen w/ Canon Pairings, Teen+ - 12072 words) - Hermione returns to Hogwarts after the war.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day]] (Harry/Ginny Ron/Hermione, 251033 words) - The first year after the battle.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7562379/1/][Australia]] (Ron/Hermione, Mature - 340509 words) - Ron tries to figure out life after the war and navigate his new life with Hermione.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2573990/chapters/5726924][Crazy Little Things]] (Luna/Hermione, Explicit - 95748 words) - In her own way, Luna begins to romance Hermione. Hermione doesn't return to Hogwarts, but instead studies at the University of Magical Studies and Theory in London.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7286113/1/The-Whiskey-Checklist][The Whiskey Checklist]] (Gen w/ Canon Pairings, Teen+ - 95377 words) - After the war, George and Percy are haunted by Fred's death, but must find reasons to keep living.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1077118/chapters/2163748][Death and Resurrection]] (Draco/Harry Remus/Sirius Ron/Hermione, Teen+ - 58667 words) - A month after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry goes missing and people start coming back from the dead.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3895585][Grazed Knees]] (Ginny/Luna, Teen+ - 5483 words) - Bittersweet take on Ginny/Luna postwar.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]] (Gen, G - 1648 words) - Dennis Creevey takes up his brother's camera after the war.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/184767][Repetition is a Form of Change]] (Percy/Oliver, Teen+ - 8229 words) - Postwar Percy, focusing on him grieving, moving on, and righting his wrongs.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5631352/1/][Right Here]] (Ron/Hermione, Teen+, 214635 words) - The story of Ron/Hermione post-Deathly Hallows.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=313068][Run]] (Gen w/ Canon Pairings, Mature - 133958 words) - The village of the dead, Post-Deathly Hallows. Every year, the village hosts a tournament with the prize being 24 hours on earth. The catch: the runner-up is eliminated from existence. Well-written with some interesting world-building and focus on dead characters moving on.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/478539][The Particular Resilience of the Refugee]] (Gen, Teen+ - 7777 words) - Petunia takes refuge at The Three Broomsticks after the war.

** I have several fics in which things went SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE after Voldemort's fall:

"A True Daughter of the Black", linkffn(8288341): An OOC Bill Weasley became the new top villain, and magical Europe basically self-destructed.

"Abraxas", linkffn(11580650): Muggle religious fundies turned on magical world after Voldemort's defeat. [[/spoiler][In the end, a few magicals fled with Harry to a new world, and Muggles destroyed the Earth in a global thermonuclear war]]

"Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution", linkffn(10595005): he old establishment was insane enough to push through a tyrannical marriage law after Voldemort's fall. Harry and Hermione basically went over the edge and became radical revolutionaries. They organized a huge mob, overthrew the Ministry, and executed anyone who supported Voldemort and the marriage law. Foreign pureblood regimes were not happy, and a much bigger war was brewing on the horizon...

"The Last Enemy", linkffn(11564067): [[/spoiler][Harry became a serial killer in search of immortality and finally followed Voldemort's path]]

"The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig", linkffn(7135971): Muggles in this fic were even more effective than in "Abraxas". Harry fled with a few thousand magicals in Starship Hedwig to a new planet, but their troubles were far from over.

** Seconding Luolang's "The Last Enemy", it's brilliant. Here's a few other recs:

linkffn(3120832), "Some Say" -- tales about a monument to Snape.

linkao3(1049966) - "Azoth" (Draco/Harry) - an 8th year story about the [[/spoiler][Philosopher's Stone]].

linkao3(392764) - "The Pure and Simple Truth" (Draco/Harry) by lettered - people going to the bar and reconciling, sort of.

** Admitting my own preferences and biases: triofic (Harry/Ron/Hermione)

Slytherin rehabilitation (which generally ends up being Dramione, Hansy, PottGrass, Ronsy) I also like and subscribe to the idea that Slytherin's reputation for genocidal blood purity and the Dark Arts is massively escalated by the Voldemort War, but that all the houses had a less bloody, more universally-adopted "casually racist" attitude toward Muggleborns and Muggles pre-20th Century (not upset until the world wars) and that the Dark Arts themselves overlap with older/family magic and are more dangerous and destabilizing than straight-up evil. (TobermorianSass/Postmodern Potter, Vera Rozalsky, and Colubrina are really on that train)

Post-war trauma war fics (really screwed-up reprisals by Gryffindors, truth and reconcilation process, Order of the Phoenix overstepping their credibility.)

linkffn(Rebuilding) 8th-year-and-further-on Dramione, realistic PTSD recovery (not always healthy) and truth/reconciliation process with Slytherins and what happened to younger years under Snape/the Carrows and how they recovery. Also - Hogwarts adapting to religious minorities (Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu ickle firsties!) Colubrina is one of my favorite writers and I should tell her more often. Anything by her is excellent

linkffn(Amends, Or, Truth and Reconcilation) Draco/Hermione/Neville - incredibly complex, incredibly rich, stylistically diverse, focuses on the post-war recovery and Hermione's own role. I really don't enjoy the characterization of Molly and Ginny Weasley (the latter as running with Auror death squads is, however, delightful) but it's probably my absolute favorite. I hope Vera finishes. Most of her other stories in within the Amends universe and very good.

linkao3(Always and Forever) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/951061]] Harry/Ron/Hermione carry on a 19-year affair between the death of Voldemort and the Epilogue. Tragic, and the Trio are as easy to hate as they are to understand. linkao3(still forcing yourself to bear your cross) is a similar concept

  Post war coping mechanisms, and Ginny once more being the odd man out. Ginny POV, HarryRonHermione, RonHermione, HarryGinny. Or: canon all screwed up.
