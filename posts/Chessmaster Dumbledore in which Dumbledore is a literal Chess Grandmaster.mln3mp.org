Has someone written this? Please tell me there's interaction between Dumbledore and Ron?!

It would be like a magical Garry Kasparov and Magnus Carlsen!

***** Well, obviously everyone who's a ginger is actually the same person.

This proves it: Ginny = Albus confirmed!

If there are Time Turners involved he could be the entire Weasley family too!

****** There's also the height, the long nose, the shared Gryffindor house background, there were a few more things but I've mostly forgotten them now.

** So I haven't read this since it last updated, which was 2013, and it probably doesn't hold up near as well as High School me thought it did, but there was a brief scene in linkffn(6008512) A Butterfly Effect (Per My Memory) where some of the wards around Hogwarts had to be activated by a game of chess, and the more intense that game, the stronger they become. Dumbledore played a game against Ron to activate them.

Again, I may have misremembered which fanfic this was in, and this story is a little too grim just to be grim, but it was a pretty good scene if I got it right.
