Luna has a lot going for her. She's quick witted, funny and absolutely adorable. In my mind at least. At then she's not /boring/. No, never that.

So my question is thus: Do you know any good stories with Luna as a central character? Harry/Luna pairing preferred but not necessary.

I would prefer stories without Weasley bashing.

I could write a list of stories I have read, but I can't quite remember all of them. However I will point out I am aware of the Firebird trilogy and Bungle in the Jungle + sequal.


** No rec, I just want to come back later to read stories.

But my biggest problem with Luna-centric stories is that they change Luna from a quirky, possibly crazy girl with a surprisingly deep insight into loss and personal pain, into a Seer or otherwise inexplicably mystical person.

*** My favorite characterization of Luna has been that it was actually her father who went crazy over the death of her mother and her persona developed as a way of continuing to relate to the only parent she has left.

*** true. I can understand why people mock about with her character because if you want a seer she is the most obvious go-to character if you don't want OC's.

I only really dislike it, if it seems they are taking the changes too seriously, or they say she 'acts' Loony because she doesn't want to get hurt and she is able to flick a switch and suddenly become Super!Luna. Well, fanfics do have a tendency to attract writers that bend /everything/ to fit a new, optimal reality.

*** I had never seen her in that way, and that was easily the best articulated explanation of her I've ever read.

Maybe you should write a fix about her.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7352166/1/Protection-From-Nargles][Protection From Nargles]] is one of the best HP/LL fics I've read. Very fluffy, and very cute.

The author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1327362/JJ-Rust][JJ Rust]] has several HP/LL one-shots as well; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3961411/1/Not-Right-For-Him][Not Right For Him]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4236132/1/A-Little-Push][A Little Push]], to list a couple.

Oh, and there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3862145/1/Contemplating-Clouds][Contemplating Clouds]]. It's unfinished, but it has quite a few nice moments.

Harry takes a chance in hope of saving Sirius from the Veil, assisted by Luna and some stolen Time Turners. Working with Luna comes with its own complications, though.

** I've posted it before, but just in case: I think my favorite Luna is in the [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Matryoshka_Vignettes/index/][Matryoshka Vignettes]] By Jeconais.

Some of the more common ones, in case you haven't read them: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2919503/1/Luna-s-Hubby][Lunna's Hubby]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7548963/1/Help-of-a-Seer][Help of a Seer]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6583426/1/Death-s-Doorbell][Death's Doorbell]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5371934/1/All-The-Dementors-of-Azkaban][The Dementors of Azkaban]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5140198/1/Jackalopes-and-Jobberknolls][Jackalopes and Jobberknolls]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5107098/1/Voldemort-My-Pet-Inferius][Voldemort My Pet Inferius]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4818454/1/Of-Veils-Gates-and-Magic][Of Viels, Gates and Magic]] (Stargate-1 crossover, oneshot), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3022004/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freak-Parade][Harry Potter and the Freak Parade]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7382549/1/When-Is-It-a-Contract][When is it a contract]].

Silently Watches' [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] and WIP sequel are billed to be Harry/Luna. Of course, It is also a Fem!Harry, and the pairing hasn't occured yet. Luna has had a minor role so far. His story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes][Faery Heros]] is Harry/Hermione/Luna.

While looking up stories for this post, I found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3226536/1/The-Blood-Tipped-Feather][The Blood Tipped Feather]], which is Harry/Luna.

Do you have any Luna stories recommendations for us?

** Well, if you're not opposed to Luna/Voldemort, I would definitely recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3037156/][Twelve Dark Moons]] by Sophiax. The storyline is a little predictable and cliche but the writing is excellent and the characterization for Luna is one of the best I've encountered. I always find myself going back to it.

Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

This is the one where he makes the essences of plants and stuff, if you've read that before. I don't remember if it went deep into harry/Luna's relationship though.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7245318/1/Sight-of-Spangled-Silver][If you pardon the late response]]. Warning: hard fic to read, due to perspective. It's written as a stream of consciousness from Luna's pov. Just her thoughts, no description of what's going on or dialogue. That said it is very well done, and once you get used to it, extremely enjoyable.

Also see a ton of protection from nargles and contemplating clouds, I recommend both.
