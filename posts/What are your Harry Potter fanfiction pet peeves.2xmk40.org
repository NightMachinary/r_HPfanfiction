What it says on the tin. What are things you've seen in Harry Potter fanfictions that really annoy you?

Mine are as follows:

- Head Boy/Head Girl dormitories. This is an /extremely/ common trope, and most often used to get a couple together, usually Hermione with a Head Boy of the author's choice (take your pic). Said Head Boys can range from anyone like Draco Malfoy, Remus Lupin (Marauders era), Tom Riddle (Grindelwald era), or even happen to be AUs where Harry or Ron becomes Head Boy. However, there is absolutely /no/ mention of Head Boys or Head Girls having separate dormitories from the other Hogwarts students in the books.

- Calling Hermione "Mione", "Hermy", "Herm", and even "Mion". Ron only calls Hermione "Mione" /once/ in the entire series, and while he's stuffing his mouth full of food. Not once in the series does Hermione have a nickname. However, somehow, in many stories, the main characters just start calling Hermione "Mione" out of the blue. This just doesn't happen once, either - it happens /all the time/.

- Using Snape as a mentor/father/best friend figure to Hermione, Harry, and/or Draco. In the books, Snape is just /not/ a pleasant person, and especially not to Harry and/or Hermione. True, Snape seems to have developed some feelings of concern for Draco's well-being, but ultimately, he and Draco don't really seem to have that close of a relationship. Additionally, Snape bullied and verbally abused Harry, Hermione, Neville, and pretty much any student of his that wasn't in Slytherin.

- Evil, manipulative Dumbedore. Why...just.../why?/ It doesn't fit in with the canon portrayal of Dumbledore /at all/.

- Introducing an OC sibling or child to one of the following: Harry Potter, for example, "Harry Potter's sister"; Tom Riddle, for example, "Tom Riddle's daughter"; or creating an OC child for any of the Marauders, when James was the only Marauder to marry at a young age in canon. It's also annoying to see "the daughter of Sirius Black" floating around, or "the sister of Draco Malfoy". These characters are extremely common, cliche, and usually very poorly written, one-dimensional, flat, and static [in that they have little to no character development or, y'know, /an actual personality/.]

- Super Harry/Pimp Harry. "Super" as in an AU where Harry finds out that he is one or more of the following: the Heir to one or more of the Hogwarts Founders; a Pureblood, in that Lily Evans was "really" or "secretly" one; becomes some sort of Lord of "the Ancient and Noble House of (insert name here)"; etc. May or may not include Hermione finding out that she is really a Halfblood/Pureblood and/or also an Heir; Dumbledore paying off the Weasley family to spy on Harry; Dumbledore promising Ginny's hand in marriage to Harry as part of the Weasleys' payment; etc. Also, Harry becomes "Lord Potter-Black", even more rich and wealthy, and suddenly has a bunch of marriage offers/contracts.


** It's amazing how many authors don't do even the most basic of research, such as learning how to spell characters' names. I mean once or twice is ok (no one's perfect), but when they never spell it correctly, it gets quite irritating.

Edit: One more thing: Familiars. Maybe it's been too long since I've read the actual books, but was this a concept that Rowling actually mentioned? I'm fine with the characters having pets, but calling them familiars bugs me.

#+begin_quote
  A magical familiar is a animal that has an intimate and affectionate bond to a human. More than just a "pet," a familiar cannot be "owned"; rather, they are a consciousness in their own right and deserving of great respect. A witch or wizard would never really refer to a familiar as "my owl" or "my cat" as a mere possession. On the contrary, a familiar has its own name, personality, and independent desires and thoughts. A familiar acts as an intermediary for the wizard. A familiar, as a wizard's partner, will perform tasks such as the carriage of messages, aid in spellwork, companionship, and guard and protect the wizard from any danger. Unlike pets, familiars will go wherever the wizard goes, even if it means going into the arms of death. An [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Owl][owl]] familiar will fly around the world if the wizard requests it. Familiars will gladly offer themselves as tools for spellwork, such as allowing themselves to be experimented on in [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Transfiguration][Transfiguration]] or offering hair for [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Potion][potion work]]. Some animals such as ravens or parrots can be taught to speak. It is possible that in countries where such animals are familiars, wizards ask the animals to relay spoken messages as well. At [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry][Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], a student is allowed to bring a [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Cat][cat]], [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Owl][owl]] or [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Toad][toad]] as a familiar. Though [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Ronald_Weasley][Ron Weasley]] was allowed to bring a pet [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Rat][rat]], it turned out [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew][Scabbers]] was not a familiar at all, but a unregistered [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Animagus][Animagus]] named [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew][Peter Pettigrew]] in disguise. Shortly before her third year at [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hogwarts][Hogwarts]], [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hermione_Granger][Hermione Granger]] bought a half-kneazle cat named [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Crookshanks][Crookshanks]], who became her magical familiar. [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Tom_Riddle][Lord Voldemort]] has a snake named [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Nagini][Nagini]] as a magical familiar. As a result, he turned her into one of his [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Horcrux][horcruxes]], and cared for her more than any other living being, other than himself. Due to these bonds, he can communicate with her through not only [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Parseltongue][Parseltongue]], but also silently and over great distances, as well as possess her. ^{Interesting:} [[https://harrypotterfanon.wikia.com/wiki/familiar%20corner][^{Familiar} ^{Corner}]] ^{|} [[https://harrypotterfanon.wikia.com/wiki/familiar%20rituals%20(1977)%20(short%20story)][^{Familiar} ^{Rituals} ^{(1977)} ^{(short} ^{story)}]] ^{|} [[https://harrypotterfanon.wikia.com/wiki/president%20of%20magic][^{President} ^{of} ^{Magic}]] ^{|} [[https://harrypotterfanon.wikia.com/wiki/magical%20committee][^{Magical} ^{Committee}]]

Some fanfics force this through some kind of destined soul-bond of a familiar, where Hedwig more or less /forces/ Harry to buy her. That's even worse.

It doesn't change the story, it is just sloppy writing that makes the readers lose interest.

#+begin_quote
  *Suspension of disbelief* or *willing suspension of disbelief* is a term coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge][Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who suggested that if a writer could infuse a "human interest and a semblance of truth" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. *Cognitive estrangement* in fiction involves using a person's ignorance or lack of knowledge to promote suspension of disbelief.

Would you swear a magically binding oath not to harm whomever or whatever is sovereign where you live "in any way, shape or form"? I am guessing that you wouldn't; at least, I wouldn't. Why would the wizards, who are (probably) far more self-sufficient than you are, so they need their government much less than you (probably) need yours? /Maybe/ something like that could be started and then become self-perpetuating, but how would it start in the first place?

*** I believe the whole magical oath idea comes from readers of "The Dresden Files" as in that series, a magical oath is a combination of tying together word, intent, and a little bit of the person's personal magic. If they break the oath, then they break a little bit of their magic. Break too much magic, then the person will be unable to perform magic.

For fans of both the Dresden Files and Harry Potter, it is difficult to consider that the Unbreakable Vow is the be all end all of magical oaths in the Harry Potter universe. There must surely be some way of making oaths and promises that has a less final consequence than some vow that results in the death of those who break it.

Granted, in DF, there is no ceremony or words that cement the promise, just the intent. Some people writing HP FF inevitably add some flair or ceremony to it since there is a sort of ceremony for the Unbreakable Vow.

Potterverse definitely does contain magical contracts of some sort. Goblet of Fire's may or may not have been magical in nature (/Forging the Sword/, for example, postulates that it was a contract between governments and/or schools to force their Champions to participate), but Hermione's DA parchment jinx certainly was something along these lines.

The thing is, it can't be easy or reliable. Because, if it's as easy as fanon makes it out to be, /Harry Potter/ cannot happen.

- Anytime in OotP: "I, Harry Potter, swear on my magic that I remember seeing a person calling himself 'Lord Voldemort' restored by a potion brewed by a man responding to 'Pettigrew', ..."

This is a valid complaint about the complainers, but I think that in fanfic in particular, a variation on the principle on economy of writing (whether expressed by Anton Chekhov or Kurt Vonnegut) applies: don't put in deviations from canon unless they add to the story (or are necessary consequences of deviations that do --- merely plausible consequences need a little more justification). In particular, don't make so many arbitrary changes that the reader is left guessing what should be the same and what should be different.

Note that "deviation" should be read pretty broadly here. Anything from "Harry gets Sorted into Slytherin" (and logical consequences of that in an otherwise-canon universe are explored) to "Grindelwald won" (and the whole setting is different as it plausibly would be as a consequence of that). Even in the latter, there is still an argument for economy of deviations: the world may be a different place, but, for example, Hermione should still be a brilliant Muggleborn bookworm, but now living in a world where the Statute of Secrecy no longer exists.

Whether or not a deviation adds to the story is pretty subjective. One person could say deviation X adds no narrative value, while the author might argue that it helps establish the setting in which they want to tell their story. I don't think any author should feel any more beholden to canon than they want to be.

Well, yes. In principle, all notions of good taste are subjective. And yet, it's meaningful to speak about good taste and complain about poor taste.

As another way to approach the question, consider that invoking "Harry Potter" (or whatever franchise) comes with an implicit message that everything in the universe is as in canon, except as stated otherwise. OOC behavior that is not explainable by explicit changes is therefore deceiving the reader in some sense.

At the moment, /Reign of the Serpent/ is in my top 5 favorite fics, and that one diverged more than a thousand years prior to the story, and the wizarding society is profoundly different. The problem is when the "straying" is inconsistent and incoherent.

To give a recent example I ran into, suppose that the premise of the fic is that Hermione is sorted into Slytherin; but it turns out that Draco (and Lucius as it happens) is A-OK with Muggleborns, as long as they are Slytherin Muggleborns. That's a huge deviation from their canon characterization --- bigger than Hermione's sorting --- but it's treated as a matter of course. I would call that Draco OOC.

Personally, I have no issue with this. I know it annoys some people, but there are some couples out there with significant age differences between them in IRL who are quite happy and work out well. On example is David Tennant and his wife; if I recall correctly, there's an age gap of about 13-14 years between them.

As I said, age differences really don't matter that much to people if they can truly make a romantic relationship work well for them. It doesn't matter if one is 40 and the other 20. As long as both are above the age of consent, and it isn't rape, personally, I have no issue with it. Anything romantic that occurs between a student and a teacher while the student is still at Hogwarts, however, definitely presents a major ethics issue.

Of course this applies only to rather newly formed couples (or couples around the time of...formation) e.g. a couple in the fifties and together for 20 years would not be counted as a couple in the fifties with an age gap of lets say 7 years, but as a couple 20 years ago in their late twenties/early thirties with an age gap of 7 years.

I've taken this even farther in my AU where a portion of the magical population speaks an entirely different language: the descendants of the original Celtic inhabitants before the Anglo-Saxon and Norman invasions still speak a Celtic language called Góiddelg (I'm a conlanger, so this becoming a part of my fic worldbuilding was inevitable). English is still spoken by the majority, though.

The constant influx of muggleborns and intermarriage between witches/wizards and muggles prevents the magical population's speech from diverging too much.

******** Dammit. I was typing this all up and then accidentally used a hotkey to go back because I've been typing on a Mac all day at work and the bindings are different.

In my AU (so very, very AU) the ethnic and political boundaries in the magical world aren't the same as in the muggle world. Infodump time.

Góiddelg is spoken in Ireland, the Isle of Man and most of what is Scotland in the muggle world. It was originally spoken by the magical peoples of Ireland who later migrated across to what is now Scotland. Those magical Brythonic speakers that once lived in the north of Britain were either displaced or assimilated. The speakers of it consider themselves a single ethnic group called /na Chéaddoíni/. Ireland is called Éry and the part of Great Britain inhabited by Góiddelg speakers Álbu. They and the Anglo-Normans who inhabit most of what is muggle England form the two dominant ethno-political factions in the magical British Isles. There's also Wales and Cornwall where they do speak Brythonic languages, essentially the same Welsh and Cornish as their muggle counterparts as they were less isolationist, though they've preserved their language better than their muggle counterparts.

Anglo-Norman territory is divided into Counties along similar lines to old Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: East Anglia, Essex, Kent, Mercia, Northumbria, Sussex and Wessex. Wessex lays claim to Cornwall and Mercia to Wales, though the inhabitants of Cornwall and Wales tend to have other ideas. The entire magical population of the British Isles is under a single government, the Wizengamot, which consists of representatives from na Chéaddoíni, East Anglia, Essex, Kent, Mercia, Northumbria, Sussex, Wessex and Cymraeg. Wales' independence has been officially recognized by the Wizengamot, while Cornwall's has not.

Feel free to pick that to pieces if you're knowledgeable about the subject. It would be helpful for fleshing out the setting.

1) The big one: it is canon that Molly used a love potion on Arthur. Sure, they play it as a foolish mistake from her youth. But what f it wasn't? What if Arthur only forgave her because he was/is drugged the entire time? This proves that she both knows how to do it and is willing to go through any lengths to achieve her goals.

2) The relationship with Ginny came out of left field. It really absolutely came out of nowhere. The "meta"-reason is that Rowling sucks at writing romances, but inside the universe this could be interpreted as Harry being forced to fall in love with Ginny.

3) Rowling admitted that up until the last books H/Hr was way more likely to happen and that she forcefully derailed that relationship because she had some other ending in store from years earlier. In-universe this gets translated as the natural couple being forcefully broken up.

Also, as said by other people: Ron's case is not at all how love potions normally work.

**** Magical cores don't explain anything. You might as well say "Midichlorians" or just "magic"; they "explain" just as much.

Anyway, I do see the appeal of the mechanic typically associated with them --- a sort of a magical battery, with limits on capacity ("magical exhaustion"), power ("magical power"), and rate at which it recharges. While not supported by canon, (because, for all the stuff people do in canon, nobody /ever/ runs out of magic, and it's never mentioned, even though you'd think it'd be a big factor in DADA) it does make magic a resource that acts kind of like some real-world resources do, from electrical battery charge to muscles to ATP.

So, mostly, I think their bad rep comes from guilt by association. /Nobody/ seems to be able to introduce magical cores without also using them to give different characters inborn, arbitrary, and unearned differences in magical ability --- usually used as a power-up for the protagonist (almost always Harry). And, I don't think I've seen a story unambiguously improved by this element; but I've seen scores degraded by it.

Before you demand citations from others, where's the canon evidence for the physical fitness hypothesis in the first place? In the immortal words of the late Christopher Hitchens, "what can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence."

That said, I'm happy to attribute it all to skill and personality, and have the limits of magical endurance be a consequence of non-magical factors, like tiring of the wand arm, hoarseness from shouting spells, and cognitive and emotional exhaustion due to concentration.

***** A bit late, but this is actually the first time I went looking for the HPfanfic reddit.

There is 'some' evidence supporting the core theory. Or at least a similar theory that explains the power of a wizard.

Dumbledore being the most powerful wizard, Neville being 'almost' a squib, Harry using the patronus when 7th years can't do it...

There simply has to be some sort of explanation why there are differences in power between wizards because if there isn't one then knowledge would be the only factor deciding how powerful a wizard is. And then Hermione would be the next Merlin.

The magical core theory is both a limiter and a power booster in fanfiction. A limiter because Wizards actually get tired when casting and a booster because Harry will get a core the same size as Voldemort.

So, conclusion: While there isn't any evidence of the Core theory, there is evidence of differences in power between wizards. These differences aren't purely linked to knowledge so the easiest way to explain this is an inborn talent for magic, AKA the magical core. Some wizards are stronger than others and no amount of practice is going to close that gap.

#+end_quote

There is some evidence that "power" is a measurable concept, but the "core" mechanism it ain't, and the same evidence indicates that Harry probably doesn't have that much more than someone of his age. (There is the Cave scene in HBP with the boat that measures one wizard worth of power --- and Harry's is low enough to be masked by Dumbledore's.)

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore being the most powerful wizard, Neville being 'almost' a squib,
#+end_quote

I think that doing magic being a function of general intelligence, skill (which intelligence facilitates obtaining), self-confidence, and personality is a better explanation for these.

In fact, Neville went from "almost a squib" to a formidable wizard through hard work and a change in attitude, which is an argument /against/ inborn magical capacity.

It's important not to confuse knowledge with skill: spells --- particularly more advanced ones --- do need to be practiced to cast them well and reliably, and more difficult spells require more practice. (I suspect that Dark spells are slightly different in that, in that they "want" to be cast because evil temptation.)

I think that a useful analogy might be that wanded spells are like musical pieces for an instrument: some pieces are harder than others, just memorizing the sequence of notes is not enough to be able to actually play the piece; but rather practice is required, though a sufficiently experienced or talented practitioner could "sight-read" a sufficiently simple piece.

#+begin_quote
  Harry using the patronus when 7th years can't do it...
#+end_quote

Well, the reason that most 7th years can't do it is that most students don't take a NEWT in DADA, and it's not taught before NEWT-level DADA, because unless one knows Dumbledore's Patronus message trick, it's completely useless unless one deals with dementors, which vast, vast majority of wizards never do. (For that matter, recall that most wizards can't cast a proper shield, to say nothing of the Patronus.)

Pretty much every student in DA who tried the Patronus --- including some just a year older than Harry was at the time he learned it --- learned the beginnings of it in a few sessions of irregular practice, and several got a corporeal one. Nor was Remus particularly pessimistic in teaching it to Harry. Casting the Patronus as such is not that hard.

The more likely reason why the Patronus has the reputation it has is that while casting it under ideal circumstances isn't hard, casting it while facing down a creature that drains the very thing that one needs to cast it (which is when most would actually have to cast it) is hard indeed. Whether someone can do /that/ is a function of personality and emotional disposition (particularly, nerve) more than it's a function of magical skill or "power".

#+begin_quote
  There simply has to be some sort of explanation why there are differences in power between wizards because if there isn't one then knowledge would be the only factor deciding how powerful a wizard is. And then Hermione would be the next Merlin.
#+end_quote

Not just knowledge: intelligence and skill (i.e., practice). Hermione is very bright --- borderline genius, according to Rowling (IIRC). And, in fact, she masters new spells and other magic faster than anyone in her cohort, learns complex spells from books regularly, possibly invents one or two, and is always the first to master skills related to general magical ability, like nonverbal casting and Apparation. But, she is not in the same tier of intellect as the Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald, or, for that matter, Merlin.

#+begin_quote
  The magical core theory is both a limiter and a power booster in fanfiction. A limiter because Wizards actually get tired when casting and a booster because Harry will get a core the same size as Voldemort.
#+end_quote

Yes, which is why it's not consistent with canon. Canon wizards don't get tired from casting --- or at least no one in all 7 books ever reaches, approaches, or even mentions the mythical "magical exhaustion" --- and if Harry were as "powerful" as Tom at that age, we would have noticed. (Dumbledore and Tom were recognized as a genuine magical prodigies from a pretty young age.)

#+begin_quote
  So, conclusion: While there isn't any evidence of the Core theory,
#+end_quote

I'd go farther than that: the Magical Core model is /disconfirmed/ by canon (i.e., there is strong evidence against it). Like I said above, I understand its appeal, but it's not how Potterverse magic works.

#+begin_quote
  there is evidence of differences in power between wizards. These differences aren't purely linked to knowledge so the easiest way to explain this is an inborn talent for magic,
#+end_quote

There is no evidence for a magical capacity limit (i.e., exhaustion), and inborn general intelligence (or a particular facet of it) that allows the practitioner to acquire the relevant skill, along with emotional disposition --- both being things that we /know/ affect capacity to learn and do magic --- explain the differences in displayed abilities and have the benefit of not requiring an arbitrary "power meter" to be bolted on to the setting. There is no chakra in /Harry Potter/.

From the point of view of storytelling, they have an additional benefit of integrating nicely with a character's personality. For example, Bellatrix's sadism helps her cast as powerful Cruciatus, but it also makes her choose suboptimal methods to extract information, such as torturing Hermione when the Imperius or Legilimency would have done the trick faster and more reliably.

From the same point of view, Magical Core is just the author deciding, "Imma gonna make muh favrite character moar powafull!!!"

#+begin_quote

**** For me personally, magical cores seem to only be included to set up power tiers (where Harry is at the top) and used by writers who feel like they need to add rules to the Hp magic system. I see magical skill like riding a bike: some people are never any good, some reach a basic level and stay there, some learn how to do amazing tricks through years of hard work, and some are talented and still have to work for their skill, but it doesn't take as much time as the previous one. Why reduce it to magical gas tanks or mana points?

And why does it need to be explained why magicals can do magic? Mutants in Marvel Comics have powers because of a gene and nobody asks for a detailed scientific explanation. Wizards do magic because they have a particular gene (and it's magic).

I'm not its biggest fan but I certainly do not like Dumbledore either.

See. In canon if you look into Dumbledore with any depth he isn't clean.

Strip away every argument or ignore every thing. But you can't turn a blind eye that Figg exists.

In the same context that Harry Hunting and Accidental Magic exist.

A member of the Order/contact for the Order/Whatever you want.

She's there to watch Harry. And there isn't anyone good that says Vernon is a good man.

He's loud and obnoxious and abusive. (Skip the argument on physical abuse. Harry was made to sleep under the stairs. He was wiry and underdeveloped for his age. Even if no physical abuse occurred other types did). And Figg knew. She had to know. She was tasked with watching Harry.

And she reported to Dumbledore.

And he ignored it.

So what does that say about him?

Especially in the context of the Prophesy.

That he was the direct recipient of.

So when a writer begins to write in a preset world in their own views, they can take things and twist them.

A great evil Dumbledore is a stretch.

However if you have determined him guilty from your own reading, it's not a long stretch.

a) That isnt Dumbledores decision to make.

b) My point was that when harry was abandoned at the durseys, Sirius was not accused of anything, he had given his bike and Harry to Hagrid and set out to hunt down the betrayer, Dumbledore took it upon himself to then abandon the baby on a doorstep, and not look in on him for over a decade.

Not necessarily a malicious action, but I can definitely see where those fanfics are coming from, I tend to settle on him being negligent in the extreme, something his later actions a decade later reaffirm.

I'm fine with whatever story you want (i've my cup of tea obviously , i ignore slash , i like H/Hr and despise H/G) but it has to be logically found. I'm reading and i'm a big fan of the firebird triology : it completly ignores canon , but it's well! plotted and written.

Many people ignore the fact that for making a good story you have to be able to ballance a good ammount of conflict , relief , romance , angst , emotion in general. /It's a really hard thing to do/

**** I don't agree completly. I don't like the pairing either but saying that it doesn't make sense (completly) is a bit too much imho. Remember that they are teenagers , teenagers are not known for logical decision in relationships , furthermore from what we understand from canon we can see without much doubt that Hermione has some serious confidence and social relation problems . So the fact that she chooses Ron is not so far fetched. Obviously we can surely say that such a relationship wouldn't last at least without *serious* behavioural change (maybe some marriage counseling). After all hermione's indipendence and ron lazyness (not in itself but the behaviours coming from it) are fundamentally incompatible.

Considering that Hermione has had a crush on Lockhart in COS; was accused of liking Cedric Diggory [by Ron] because he was "handsome" in GOF; and seems to admire and value handsome guys who achieve a lot in the books, yeah, it made no sense to me that Hermione chose Ron. Ron isn't overly handsome, nor is he an "achiever".

****** Well the fact that it's not farfetched is an issue about her confidence not her crushes. The context is important , she choose ron because it was the most "sure" choice , lack of confidence equals with fear of rejection , at least subconsciously ron was the safest becaue of the unlikelyness of him rejecting her (opposed for example by harry that was , or seemed, committed with Ginny). Now , we can argue if she had a lack or confidence or not , but from what we get from canon it surely seems so (lack of friends in early childhood , overstudying , high faith in autority even irrationally high).

So yeah i can see *why* , i don't like it, but it /makes sense/ ; it's not optimal at all , but it reflects real life : not all relationships are healthy , not all marriages are optimal. It sucks but it happens. It's one of the plot points that make the end more realistic , less happy obviously , if all would have been fantastic the HPUV would have been shallow. Remember the last words : "All was well" not "all was bloody perfect"

******** Thanks, in fact i can add that the reason i like JKR is exactly that : she treats her characters as *people* she doesn't ignore their defects and put on light their strengths , in fact expecially at the end she does the opposite. We clearly see that she makes really clear that all the main characters are imperfect , from snape (the most obvious) to Dumbledore. Obviously she has authorial fiat so the plot is advanced via deuses ex machina but her writing flows well and the story has a good ballance of dark and humoros themes. That is her art and that's why i apreciate her work and still follow the hp universe.

It's easy to critique plot holes and whatnot once the story is arleadly written , like the old saying "everyone is a general after the battle" . She doesn't care about how the plot is advanced , she follows the growth of inperfect people that fight a war caused by corrupted people that fell into an ideology led by a mad megalomaniac.

Many think that her story was born as a childs tale , i disagree : she wrote it because she wanted to show to a generation that no matter the hardship they find themselves in they can grow and understand and maybe , with luck and persistenece , win. Harry potter is not a saga about magic , it's a story about overcoming what seem unsurmontable odds and becoming ,in the end, someone better.

Now let me be clear , i don't completly agree with her belief system. I dislike the "moral lesson" that she repeats many time which is to accept mortality , I'm a transhumanist and an immortalist my faith in umanity is almost endless and i'm firmly convinced that with enought time our race will be able to unhinge itself from the limits that biology puts on us , i believe and facts confirm that our finiteness is contingent on the fact that we are the faulty result of natural selection and by understanding how the universe work we will be able to perfect ourself in ways today uncomprehensible.

Sorry for the rant , had to blow it off . I was brewing it for a really long time :)

**** Sorry to hear that. My parents firmly believed it was morally abhorrent, and it has been strictly banned in my country since the 70s as well so I never had to deal with it myself, thankfully.

I think it's the systematic way people go about it that makes my stomach turn. Like, if a parent looses it momentarily and slaps their child, I can understand it. It's not OK, of course, but it's human and I understand it. But to do that whole measured and controlled assume-the-position thing and then count out 20 or however many strokes. .. it's just sick. It's a bit like how I can understand someone killing in the heat of the moment while a planned execution (legal or otherwise) chills me to the bone. It's inhuman behaviour.

My other pet peeve... not so much with the story, but with the stuck-up, pretentious reader base. "That's awful, its just a trope...". I for one would rather read a work full of tropes that were well written or with an interesting twist than some of the garbage that is spewed forth in the name of "Originality".

There's a reason tropes are so common people! It's because they usually work well given the setting and characters!

He is when written by most fanfiction writers, and Sturgeon's Law applies: 90% of everything is crap. Additionally, "Super Harry" is an extremely common cliche now, and it's been done to death. I think writers need to try something new for once, rather than just hopping on the "Lord Potter-Black" bandwagon.

** Really shouldn't be bumping such an old thread but I need to vent.

-Attempt to explain the mechanics of magic which is fictional and should not follow the same rules as science. If this was true then some brilliant squib should have figure out how to use magic in my opinion. This annoys me because it belongs to sci-fi category and not fantasy. And 90% of the fanfics that do this are labeled properly.

-time travel being a major plotline. How it should have ended:harry potter on youtube summed it up. Just travel back to when Voldemort started and kill him early rather then fight him at the height of his powers.

-Harems are just terrible ideas. Both male or female versions. If your not ready for marriage or monogamy, then your not ready period. The only societies that allow harems currently have terrorism issues, parts of Africa and the middle East.

-Pro-muggle stances that are just as bad as pure-blooded bigotry. For example just because the magical world doesn't have the internet doesn't mean they are living in the dark ages.

-Unification of the muggle and magical race will ultimately propel the world into some golden age. Face it the stature of secrecy is there for many reasons. Everyone seems to ignore the negatives and only include the positives.

Negatives 1. Muggle economy will collapse, magic will make certain things too efficient leaving to a severe lack of jobs. (brooms, portkey, floo vs trains, cars, planes) There are way too many examples not listed. 2. Muggle's being too good at killing everything. If certain muggles get a magical eye and hunt the magical creatures used for wand cores, later magical wizards would barely be able to use magic with wandcore of kneazles.
