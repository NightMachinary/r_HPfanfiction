Are there any fanfics in which the prophecy is /literally/ true? By which I mean, nobody but Voldemort can kill Harry: no matter how seriously he gets injured or how many people hit him with the killing curse he will just not die unless Voldemort does it himself?

There are a couple I've read which work around this such as The Many Deaths of Harry Potter or Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon in which he simply has to re-live part of his life but I'm looking for something more visceral, where if he got his head bashed in by the troll he'd just get back up like it was nothing.

** *The Power of the Press* - linkffn(8831374)\\
Harry won't compete in the tournament, so forfeits his magic. BUT~ because of the prophecy, he is equal to Voldemort. Voldemort either loses his powers too, or Harry keeps his magic. This is that whole "Dark Lord's equal" bit.
