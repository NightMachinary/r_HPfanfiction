It may not be 65 million people but that's how many copies of the Harry potter and the Order of the Phoenix sold. [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books][Source]]


** If anybody has ever hated an actor for the role they played, they clearly don't understand what acting is

**** According to [[http://www.wetpaint.com/does-jack-gleeson-harassed-streets-626838/]] , he has never actually got any hate for his role, he just decided that acting wasn't for him.

***** Yeah, playing a role can often leave a bad taste in your mouth, sometimes even having a deep emotional impact.

** Slightly off topic but she's a brilliant actress - I rewatched Pride last night and it's pretty odd to see Umbridge Welsh and dancing with shirtless gay guys, but I would recommend it if you are struggling to separate the actor from the role.

*** I'm taking it as the point of view that they hate her role. Not they hate her as a person. If you look up her pic you would never make the connection. But it's a little nerve racking to be hated by 100 people never the less millions of people even if it's fictional

** She may be hated by some people, mostly by morons who are incapable of making the mental connection that playing a role of a character does not mean being the character, by I find the claim that nearly 65 million people hate her to be dubious.

I have a copy of the book and I don't hate her. I expect most people who got a copy don't. If anything, I expect that the only people who do hate her are the ones stupid enough to bash Weasleys and Dumbledore and write Draco as some kind of perfect character; in other words, “and nothing of value was lost”.

**** I don't hate her role either. I dislike the character, for what that is worth, but there is no hate to be had for it, it's pointless. And honestly, when talking about global scale and about people who are more or less well-known, being [insert anything] by 100 people is more or less “meh, whatever” unless they happen to be close to you which is very very unlikely on global scale. Sure, if you are active on social media and they matter so much to you it can be a tougher issue, but not everyone is and not everyone does.

I can understand if some people would feel nervous due to [insert whatever number] people disliking them, or hating them. Some people would not be, however, so while I can understand it being nerve-wracking to you I can't just out and say that it would be to her because I do not know her well enough (in fact, not at all) to decide this. And as I cannot find any mention of some inexplicable mass hatred towards her after her performance as Dolores Umbridge and only a mention that she got a nomination to an award for it, I'm inclined to think that it's less of an issue that you seem to think it to be.

And I will repeat that I find the claim made in the post to be dubious ... in fact, I'll go right ahead and claim that you've made it click-bait on purpose. You can do that if you want, of course, this sub has no rules against it, but it is going to make some people look at the possible reasons you may have for pushing it before they reply.
