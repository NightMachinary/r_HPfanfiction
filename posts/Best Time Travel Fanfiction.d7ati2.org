I would like for Harry to be the only one time traveling and not be a dark!harry fanfiction or OP harry. I do not want any bashing of dumbledore and I would like some romance, slash or not. I don't care what time it is he travels to but I would like for him to travel to the present and meet or reunite with people he met in the past.


** linkffn(a long Journey Home by Rakeesh) comes close

- fem Harry is the only time traveler
- she isn't dark, perhaps gray on the fanon light gray dark scale
- she's a little OP but for /very/ legitimate reasons
- there's some poking fun at Dumbledore in one chapter but it isn't close to bashing
- there is definitely non-slash romance
- she does return to the present
- in the present she does sorta meet someone from her travel into the past if visiting their tomb counts

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), sounds like a great fit:

- No bashing
- Some romance
- He returns (with Bellatrix) to the new future he has created
- Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Draco, and several new kids all have some roles to play

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  Regulus Black wakes up in a dark cell during one of the most eventful months of his life, not very sure of how he came to be there, and with only a stranger named Harry for company. An awkward almost friendship is born. Meanwhile, Harry Potter might have made a mistake. Or two. All he knows is that things aren't really going his way right now, and that his cellmate's mostly alright. Mostly.

  She had a life once, but she doesn't remember. All she knows is the ashes and blood she tastes as she wakes up yet again... She's got one more try to get it right. - Haesel hadn't quite thought of this when she'd accepted Death's 'chance to live with those she'd lost'. AU, time travel, fem!Harry, T for now?
