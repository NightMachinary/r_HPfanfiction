Points for alternative use of magic and a sense of whimsy/adventure!

Have read and loved: Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run, Fantastic Elves and Where to Find them, Secret Language of Plants, Life Outside the Curriculum

Anything similar to that I'd love to read, pairing doesn't matter! Thank you!

Edit: thank you for all the suggestions!!! Reading them all tonight for my new years solo celebration!


** It's crack as hell, but Escapologist Harry by Racke is amazing, it\s a oneshot of a pretty much insane Harry escaping the Durselys constantly while Dumbledor keeps having to track and obliviate him. Linkffn(9469775)

  Harry runs away at age four. After bringing him back, Dumbledore's attempts to keep him at Privet Drive gets progressively more ridiculously extreme with each of his escapes. Animagus!Harry, Crack

Its been years but I don't remember there being any pairings. Harry's magic is explained later and I still remember this fic as one of my favorites for the ending.

  Living with the basilisk is going to take some adjusting, like learning to navigate hidden tunnels, keep himself secret, and figure out how to use magic (easier said than done). The castle and forest are full of dangers, and as Harry tries to fit into a world of elves, ghosts, and talking portraits, he'll find out if he's up to the challenge.

  The centaur tilted his head. “And what is a human boy doing riding a thestral into the Forest?”“I'm going to visit a friend. Well, a friend of a friend. Sort of. It's a snake in the castle.”In which Harry meets a garden snake, discovers magic, and sets off for a better life.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhkäse.
