Hi, I am looking for any good ff where Harry is lamia/naga, the best if he will be dark!Harry.

Any recommendations? I found only one in Polish (Harry/Snape) but I crave for more.


** Only one I've come across is linkffn(10187441) Crossover with MGQ, Harry turns into Alipheese XVI

  Harry Potter understands you fight fire with fire. So does Hermione. Voldemort has done all sorts of rituals to increase his power (or so the word goes), so why not try one to increase Harry's? Unfortunately for Harry, they picked one that will leave him feeling a little... blue. (Now in its proper category!)

  Harry's 5th year was probably the worst year of his life. First Voldemort happened, then Umbridge, then Voldemort AGAIN, and then Sirius died. Harry doesn't even have the time to properly mourn Sirius before he's shipped back to the Dursley's for the summer. He can't even think straight and with each passing day since losing Sirius, Harry feels more and more exhausted. By the time his 16th birthday rolls around, Uncle Vernon has to literally beat Harry just to wake him up. After a rather brutal beating given to him by his uncle on the eve of his birthday, Harry wakes to find something he had never thought possible. He wakes up to find a long snake tail instead of his legs. A few days later, his family abandons him in some random forest. What a wonderful way to start his 16th year of life after the worst year of his life.

** Lomonaaeren has one I think? At the very least he gets trained by one. I'm pretty sure it's Brother to Basilisks, sorry if I got it wrong, it's been a while since I read it linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2435531/chapters/5393471]])

  AU of PoA. Harry wakes in the night to a voice calling him from somewhere in the castle---and when he follows it, everything changes. Updated every Friday.
