We know the Carrow siblings were awful (although why did Voldemort forgive them?!),

What do you think Snape was like as a headmaster? I assume he had to put on a show in front of the staff. Did he try to be secretly lenient or do you think he participated in harsh punishment of the students??

What were classes like?

Meals?

Dormitory?

What was Minerva like during this time? The other, professors? Why would they return - just to protect the students?

And on that note, why were students sent back to Hogwarts? Surely their parents would oppose this!?

I know Voldemort wanted them for his own Army, but surely students would have refused to return with Dumbledore gone?


** Brah, did you read the books? Most of these are answered in the text!

He pretended to be a tough guy in public, but assigned lenient detentions to students to keep them out of the Carrows' hands. Their punishments involved Crucios.

Same as usual, but they have Dark Arts instead of DADA, and Anti-Muggle Propoganda instead of Muggle Studies.

The Ministry made homeschool illegal, and sent Snatchers out to catch truants for a cash reward.

  ‘They do more than teach,' said Neville. ‘They're in charge of all discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.'

  ‘Like Umbridge?'

  ‘Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don't, though, if they can avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do.

  ‘Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defence Against the Dark Arts, except now it's just the Dark Arts. We're supposed to practise the Cruciatus Curse on people who've earned detentions---'

  ‘What?'

  Harry, Ron and Hermione's united voices echoed up and down the passage.

  ‘Yeah,' said Neville. ‘That's how I got this one,' he pointed at a particularly deep gash in his cheek, ‘I refused to do it. Some people are into it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they've ever been top in anything, I expect.

  ‘Alecto, Amycus's sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for everyone. We've all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals, stupid and dirty, and how they drove wizards into hiding by being vicious towards them, and how the natural order is being re-established. I got this one,' he indicated another slash to his face, ‘for asking her how much Muggle blood she and her brother have got.'

*** It's been so long since I read it! Thank you for the reminder- how do we know Snape was giving lenient detentions?

**** Phineas Nigellus' portrait in the Headmaster Office was watching Snape hand out detentions to the DA members who stayed at Hogwarts.

  ‘Who else is here?' he asked, turning his head from side to side. ‘Your tone displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardy in the extreme. Thieving from the Headmaster!'

  ‘They weren't thieving,' said Harry. ‘That sword isn't Snape's.'

  ‘It belongs to Professor Snape's school,' said Phineas Nigellus. ‘Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity!'

  ‘Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!' said Hermione.

  ‘Where am I?' repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with the blindfold again. ‘Where have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?'

  ‘Never mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville and Luna?' asked Harry urgently.

  'Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some work for the oaf, Hagrid.'

  ‘Hagrid's not an oaf!' said Hermione shrilly.

  ‘And Snape might've thought that was a punishment,' said Harry, ‘but Ginny, Neville and Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The Forbidden Forest ... they've faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest, big deal!'
