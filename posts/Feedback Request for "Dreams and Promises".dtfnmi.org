Title -- Dreams and Promises

Genre -- Adventure/Romance

Rating -- T

Links -- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13427139/1/Dreams-and-Promises][Dreams and Promises]] / linkffn(13427139)

Summary -- What would have happened if Harry had been more determined and interested in his future. Independent Harry.

Notes -- This is my first fanfic I have ever written and I am trying to explore the little details and adding lore to things people usually overlook. I am 40 K words in and Harry hasn't even boarded the Hogwarts Express yet, and it won't be happening for the next two chapters at least. I would love for people to review my story and give me any feedback they have, I am not sure if I am doing a good job or a terrible one so far. Please let me know and feel free to suggest things to work on.
