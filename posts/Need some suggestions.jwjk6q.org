Any way to foreshadow an ocs death in a fanfic? My marauders oc has a son with his wife Lily and then dies. But want to have signs of it before hand. Any suggestions?


** Think about how they die. If it's a surprise, think about what someone would whisper in their ear to tip them off of it happening, or something they could notice to see the event coming. If you can hide that tip-off early on, it works super well as a reveal later on. It's usually best to have three clues to any foreshadowed mystery or revelation, but that number is up to you.

Any specific suggestions kinda depend on what you're doing to kill them.

If they get killed by someone, maybe make your OC have a moment where they think someone is watching them while they do something else. You don't have to take that moment anywhere, but it gives people something to look back at and go "Oh, that person watching was the murderer person!"

If it's an accidental death or a consequence of something they do, make the point they do the dangerous thing earlier. "Oh, OC, you really should take your spikey shoes out when you go on the ice" or "Oh, remember the time, you don't want to get swept out by the tides!" or something.

If it's a disease, you could have someone see your OC frowning down at a textbook on medicine, or have them wave off an early symptom as 'just a flu, I'll be fine'.
