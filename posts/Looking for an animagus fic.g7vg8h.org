I'm looking for some kind of fic where harry can transform into some kind of animal and lives permanently as that animal while being a pet to someone from the magical world if anyone knows something like this please tell me


** Then you have The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel (part of his Animagus Verse) where Harry turns into cat (kitten) and lives with the Grangers.

** How about a Panthers Heart by Copper Vixen. It's a Drarry but no explicit scenes. He doesn't permanently stay a Panthers but he's a Panthers for like half the story. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2869358/1/A-Panther-s-Heart]]

** Try Instinctive Behavior by Knife Hand. Harry changes into lemur as a child and finds Hermione. It's a WIP and is a little over 5K words so far.

  Harry gets cold waiting on the front porch of number 4 as a baby, so he does something to get warmer, which changes things immensely (Animagus young Harry, no living with the Dursleys)

** Not exactly, but sort of:

linkao3(Parsel) he turns into a snake and doesn't get found until he's already Hogwarts age. Although he isn't anyone's pet.

Linkffn(Might and Magic) He becomes a kneazle animagus and lives with a feral pack for a while before getting adopted by Nymphadora Tonks.

  To escape the cold night on November 1, 1981, little Harry Potter's accidental magic kicks in, and he manages to turn himself into a snake and slither away before his aunt can find him in the morning. Raised by snakes, he forgets that he is actually a boy...and then one day he accidentally wanders into a place known by humans as the "Forbidden Forest".

  Little Harry Potter was not the biggest fan of his own life, but what could he possibly do about it? Escaping to play video games in the dark of night helps... but only a little. A Gamer Fic.
