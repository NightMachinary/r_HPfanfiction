Ever since that first Alohomora, Hermione can't deny herself the thrill of figuring out a lock/spell/ward. She did always have a passion for breaking rules which contradicted her desire to be a good student.

The professors can't figure our who keeps getting into places they are not supposed to be. At first, they thought it must be the Weasley twins, but nothing was ever taken, no sign left. Such restraint is not characteristic of the 2 boys. It would be fun if only Flitwick or Dumbledore knew that it was Hermione, but instead of confronting her or punishing her, left extra challenges waiting around for her.

It can be crack or just a story. Make it sweet or scary or whatever you like.


** I'd read that.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief by Starfox5) sort of does that, though it's mostly post-Hogwarts, and she certainly does steal stuff.

IIRC, in linkffn(New Blood by artemisgirl), Hermione concludes that the corridor is an obstacle course set up as a challenge to the students and figures out how to get to the Mirror of Erised after several attempts.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))
