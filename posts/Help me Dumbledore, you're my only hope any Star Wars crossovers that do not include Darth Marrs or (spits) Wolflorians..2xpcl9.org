** I'm a fan of The Havoc Side of the Force: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force]]. As long as you don't mind first person it's a wild ride. WIP.

Author: Tsu Doh Nimh

Summary: I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

--------------

I love both HP and SW so I'll even read shitty ones to get my fix, but there is a lot of shit out there.

** Heather Sinclair's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10016768/1/Discordant][Discordant]] is quite good. 45k words, last updated Jan. 2014.

  It wasn't the bright and shiny Jewel of the Galaxy you've all seen on the HoloNet. Harry's story started in the Underworld, a kilometer below the upper levels of Coruscant, where you never walk the streets alone, especially if you don't have a blaster hanging by your side. He left for a little while, but now it's called him back, whether he realizes it or not.

Another (subpar) story is Bluminous8's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6353083/1/Sword-and-Magic][Sword and Magic]], 52k words, abandoned.

#+begin_quote
  After a devastating battle in the Department of Mysteries, Harry Potter finds himself transported in a strange world in the company of Jedi Knight Aayla Secura. Is this the will of the Force that their two fates intertwine?

** I'm thinking about starting a fic that has Revan somehow end up on HP-verse Earth during the events of the 5th book. I'm still thinking on how to go about it, but I would really appreciate any comments/suggestions.

*** Darth Revan? Amnesia Revan? Redeemed Revan? SWTOR Revan? Which one makes a difference I think...

If you do Darth Revan or post KotR Revan then with alchemy gone wrong could do it. In your world building sith alchemy could be the same as HP alchemy. Maybe when Dumbledore destroyed the stone at the end of first year, he flubbed it somehow? There's lots of ways to make it happen though. Good luck!
