What are some of the spells that Harry, Ron, and Hermione could plausibly know in year one?

The list I have right now:

---the things from Standard Book of Spells Grade 1: Wand-Lighting Charm, Softening Charm, Severing Charm, Fire-Making Spell (eleven year old with free access to fire? /really/ Hogwarts?), Unlocking Charm, Levitation Charm, Locking Spell, and the Mending Charm.

---Petrificus Totalus (used by Hermione at the end)

---The Leg-Locker Curse (learned by Hermione and Ron to protect Harry from Snape, which is laughable).

---Bluebell flames (used by Hermione)

I'm pretty sure I'm missing at least a few prank spells. What've you guys want?


** I'm not going to find it believable that a 1st year can cast but a few simple spells during the 1st term, but 2nd term I think you can get away with a lot of charms related spells they learn years 1-4.

Minor offensive spells; whatever is listed for Curses and Counter-Curses. Nothing Harry learns for the tournament, though. You should keep these light, kiddie, jokey.

Transfiguration: only what they learn 1st year. I think that amounts to transforming inanimate to inanimate and inanimate to animate.

*** Thanks for the advice! I'd forgotten about Curses and Counter-Curses.
