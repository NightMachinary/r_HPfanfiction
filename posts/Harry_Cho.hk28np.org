We need a lot more of this. It must start by GoF with her saying yes to Harry.


** Must it? I have always wanted to have sequel to linkao3(The Stag and the Swan by White_Squirrel). However, more I think about it, more I am uncertain: what do we really know about Cho? What could she really bring new to the table to make this pairing unique? I don't know.

*** Personally, I've wanted to see a harry/cho post hogwarts

they've both matured a bit, moved past/still dealing with loss, decide to give it a fresh try

maybe a quidditch rivals or something more normal

unique wise- she doesn't have any of the tropes/baggage associated with the other pairings that im so sick of i.e. daphne- pure blood lordness, susan- ministry , ginny - weasley brothers being the stereotype "dont touch our sister hur hur"

  One shot. Harry's Valentine's Day date with Cho goes a little better.

*** I've never read the fic you linked, but there's a tonne to make the pairing interesting. A few ideas:

Cho is equally into quidditch as ginny, but being in a different house, there's more options for some fun, flirty interhouse rivalry.

Depending on when you start it, Cedric's death is a great unifying factor. In canon it effectively dooms their relationship (or rather Harry's handling of it does), but if things go a little different you could easily have them grieving together. It'd be really interesting to have an exploration of grief and loss through their relationship.

Cho is a little older and in a different house - that's an entire different social circle Harry can become embroiled in!

Depending on when you set it, Harry and Cho meeting again after Hogwarts and giving their relationship a second, more mature try? That's a dynamic we don't really get anywhere else (and would be really interesting if paired with an exploration of grief, trauma and recovery).

**** I suppose. I am so much Hinny guy, that I don't expect any non-Hinny romance for Harry after the war (except for situation like linkao3(Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19)).

From the post-war Cho I know about these small stories which are kind of neat: linkao3(19475812) and one of linkao3(651870;7449106;11431638;945805), none of which will probably satisfy you.

  Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he meets Harry's friends, discovers some fascinating wizarding adult beverages - and meets Cho Chang, who has her own reasons to find herself out of place and drinking heavily at the wedding of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley.In the months to come, this unlikely encounter will make him rethink his attitudes towards the magical world, drastically change the course of both of their lives, and change Dudley's relationship with his family forever.
