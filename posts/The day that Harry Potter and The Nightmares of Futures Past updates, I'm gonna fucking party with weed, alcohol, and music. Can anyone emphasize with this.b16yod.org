** Same here except with A Long Journey Home.

I don't know where to buy weed though, and I'm white enough and socially awkward enough that I'm not sure dealers wouldn't think I was a cop.

** Sorry, but I don't.

This is the fic where adult Harry was teaching a bunch of 12 year olds to become masters at occlumency. He felt the need to tell these children all about the future, and he felt like he needed their forgiveness for having the short-lived common sense to keep that information from them.

We've also got Snape regularly assaulting their minds in class, which they're aware of, and he knows that they know.

I enjoyed the fic when I first read it, but some time later I went back to reread and found that it did not age well, imo.

Canon Dumbledore apparently felt that it should have been feasible for Harry to master it at age 15, if he'd had a better teacher. And the in-story explanation is that they're using a simpler, more obvious form of Occlumency; an attacker would immediately know that they're being blocked, rather than the subtle misdirection that Snape tried to teach in canon. And they worked very hard on it for a year or more before Harry was confident in their skills. So it's not all that far-fetched.

Are you making a point here? I'm not sure what your point is. Snape's ability to read minds wordlessly and wandlessly is canon, and plenty of other people have speculated that he was using it throughout the series before Harry knew about the ability. In this case, Snape found that he couldn't get into Harry's mind, and became very suspicious of him as a result, and regularly dug whatever information he could out of Harry's friends.

Eh, to each his own. I reread it from time to time and always love it.

*** On the author's website, the progress bar for the next chapter is at 94%. It jumped to that percentage some time ago so I'm pretty sure the author is still writing.

** fffffuck yeah, bro. My plans are the same

The author is apparently trying to continue writing both this and Team 8 from a sick bed. If he actually gets a full chapter out, it's cause for a party.

** The trouble I have with stuff like this is that I feel the need to reread the whole thing from the start to get back into it, which often kind of ruins the magic of the story (no pun intended.)

Specifically in this case, isn't the story longer than the entire original HP series at some point into 3rd year or something like that?

If it's ever completed, I'd probably pick it up again. Otherwise it just feels like a waste of time.

*** It's not longer than the entire original series, no. It is longer than the equivalent time period from canon, which is not all that hard since the first three books were the shortest.

** No big party, but yes: I am going to read it as soon as it updates. No, ths truth is that I will have to reread the whole story first ( just like when the last update came out), but that's ok.
