Trying to find a fanfic series that I previously read years ago... Harry had a twin sister who got sorted into slytherin but she doesn't really talk. I don't remember if she was mute or just chose not to talk. She looks like Lily while Harry looks like James. Harry sorta abandons her once they get to hogwarts because of the separate house. Part of the series had Snape saving them from the Dursley's.

If anyone has read this fic or has any idea where I can find it? It was a really great story from what I read so far.

It's a story that's centric around the Sister.


** Ahh i thought you were going the star wars way -- Harry grows up w Dursleys while his twin is raised like wizarding royalty. IDK... let's say.. by the Longbottoms -- since technically the potters are related to them distantly or whatever.

and they just come from different worlds. where she knows wizarding stuff, and is SO aware of the stigma about blood purity and how evil lord voldemort is. and is like "in the thick of it" and had schemed with Lady Longbottom to get into Slytherin and learn all she can, track any resurgence of the enemy.

AND THEN. She -- unofficial princess of the rebellion -- sends a Patronus (AS A FREAKIN FIRST YEAR?!) to Dumbledore, to get help, when Harry and squad overhears. and they come to her rescue but she is really really not impressed. But is thankful, while being a lil bit like "daamn, Hermione is kinda good looking, but her furry companion, Crookshanks is V skeptical of me."

THIS IS WHAT I WANT.
