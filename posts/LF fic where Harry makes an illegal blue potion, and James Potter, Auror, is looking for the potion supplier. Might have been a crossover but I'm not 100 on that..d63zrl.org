He has a secret hideaway in the school for brewing, uses the potion to avoid sleep at times, and Hermione later finds out his hiding spot and comes for the books. Might have become a H/Hr but I didn't read that far.

Just started reading this, and it's excellent so far! Thanks for bringing it to my attention (and [[/u/Ash_Lestrange]] for the link). I'm only five chapters in so I don't know if it's a /true/ crossover, but "elderglass" (and I believe the Eldren, as well) is a concept borrowed from /The Lies of Locke Lamora/ by Scott Lynch. If you enjoy roguish fantasy and you haven't read the Gentleman Bastards series, I can't recommend them highly enough - they really are brilliant.

*** I read it quite recently and there's no explicit crossover references. That is to say, I have no knowledge of that series but I still understand it fine. The author is definitely big on drawing inspiration/references from other works though. I'd say it's less crossover and more reference, though
