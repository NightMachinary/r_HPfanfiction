Looking for long, well-written, plotty fics, especially with a mystery or twists.

I love fics with characters other than Harry as the protagonist (especially well written minor characters leading), but I'm happy to read Harry-centric fics too. I'm not crazy about Voldie/Snape/Malfoy leading characters, but if the fic is good enough, I'm sold.

Any era.

No bashing fics please.

Also, I prefer light on the angst.

Prefer the focus to be on PLOT not ships, will read almost any ship though as long as it doesn't interrupt the plot. I have a tendency to prefer GOOD H/G and Hermione/ Lupin, Sirius, Weasley other than Ron, but am happy to branch out. (Again, not super fond of Hermione/Voldie, Snape, or Malfoy, because those fics tend to drown in angst, IME. Slash is fine, but Harry/Voldie makes me want to throw things)

I love, love, love, facinating complex, well written characters. Give me a plotty fic with lots of grey characters and that would make my day!

Completed, or close to completed by authors with reputation for completing!


** Try [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=313068][Run]] which features all the characters who've died in a competition in the afterlife. Great read if you like minor characters.

Also [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=325749][Clash]] which has been very regularly updated since it started, and I believe is nearing completion. Lots of morally grey goodness and set in a next gen war.
