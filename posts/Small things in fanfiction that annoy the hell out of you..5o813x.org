Like calling Voldemort and Dumbledore ridiculous nickname. I can understand, to do it in their face, if you want to try and rile them up. But constantly referring to them as ridiculously insulting moniker? Oy, these are elder, mighty powerful wizard. They'd mop the floor with you without trying, have a bit of respect.

** Okay on to the topic of small things, :)

This is hypocritical of me, but I HATE when they call Hermoine 'Herm'. ... Herm is not okay. Herm is short for Herman , or more commonly these days, a shortened for of "hermaphrodite." Not Herm.

To other things... people who can't remember what year the books take place in.

OH MY GOSH. Hermoine of 1991 does not understand how to use the internet (1995ish for 'somewhat mainstream' use). She does not know how to google (1997). Sirius Black was not a fan of Metallica (1981, first album in 1983) during his school years, if at all. James Potter did not call Snape a 'whiney little emo (mainstream in 2002) goth' (early 80's)

On that matter, people who can't do any research on a topic. I read a story once where they rather randomly inserted a US ex-military person into the story. (apparently just to give tonks someone to get with other than Lupin...?) .... oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Okay. it's like 1997 or whatever in this story and this army dude's talking about having 'finished 2 tours' in an implied warzone (which isn't really that plausible in that era and he still be the age he was described as..) ... and was somehow both, like, a tank driver AND a medic AND an officer, which again, doesn't really WORK. But the author sure took some time describing EXACTLY what kinda gun he used, and what sort of bullets.... and... ugh.

I hate when characters don't act their age. I mean, yeah. Harry is an abused kid. He does not have excessive logic skills at 11. he does not sob and cry at the drop of a hat at 16. He doesn't snuggle up for cuddles with his new favorite family-figure adult, or sit in laps. These things CAN be okay IF IF IF IF they're carefully managed and explained. realizing you're starved for affection can be a hell of moment. Mentally regressing due to trauma? Yep. sure. but not.. jsut so casually stated like it's normal. Ugh.

I also hate stupid character bashing. I mean. "Ron stops being friends with harry and due to a long series of circumstances ends up becoming a death eater" is fine (seriously, I could see that). "Ron is a whiny prat who is really just as bad as a death eater" isn't. Dumbledore can be a clever schemer and not have harry's best interests in mind or have evil schemes, and becomes an antagonist and that's also okay. But just bashing and calling him a barmy old senseless senile bat who can't figure out anything, and is just here to make things harder for harry and wouldn't you like a sherbert lemon? not so much.

I also hate when the romance goes something like... "Okay I love you Harry!" <kiss kiss> <fucking like experts despite being 14 year old virgins>

.... stories where the romance doesn't add to the story. I mean, I've read a lot of stories in some fandoms where it's like "okay and Harry and Hermoine are together, now time for the story to start." ... This is a little fiddley in places, and it can be handled elegantly.... or awfully. Just if your'e gonna have Harry and Padma together, make it relevant to the story, not just "And here's my favorite pairing." (this is more okay with background characters, but....)

Okay I think I'm done. for now.

**** Hahahah.. Well.. you asked for it ;)

Poorly executed Time Travel. I read one the other day where Harry (and Luna and Hermoine) traveled back in time and they were like, "So here's Ron, he's 14. He betrayed us when he was 22, so he's clearly a irredeemable jerk. But we'll make SURE by placing a spell on him to make him wet himself whenever he thinks poorly of us, then exclude him from everything we do. Huh, iamgine that, he things poorly of us when we're jerks to him. Imagine that. Let's also put a bad luck spell on him that will give him the worst few days of his life and do nothing but giggle when he does things like stab himself in the groin with a fork, to see if that teaches him a lesson. Wow! It didn't, because he has no idea what's going on and we're just being assholes who aren't even asking our supposed friend if he's alright when he was on fire a moment ago! Well, it's a good thing we've cleared that up! Glad we're the good guys here!"

But hey! time travel can be fun! But geeze. No matter the hell you lived through as an adult, you will not:

a) Spend every last instant training with no relaxation so that you can kill Voldemort, because you are a robot who's sole purpose is voldemort killing.

b) Fuck off and spend every minute sleeping around with every person you can because, man you already know what will happen, relax and enjoy life!

...I mean, I read a time travel fic where Harry made a few changes then had NO IDEA what would happen because he changed things. I liked that. Better then the idea that Harry can go tapdancing through time and somehow assume that everything will work out exactly the same as before because he had knowledge of the ONE way things worked out that ONE time.

I actually read an AMAZING timetravel story a few weeks ago--the time traveler isn't he main character at all, but is one of the supporting characters and you didn't even find out about it for most of the book. seriously great story. Biggest problem with it was that it was a supernatural crossover, so I spent parts of it going "uhhhhh I feel like I'm being spoiled..." but it was probably worth the spoilage. Probably. Good story though.

and since I'm ranting:

.... when people do something like... give Harry a pet! and then... the pet just... disappears while not needed for plot reasons. (Sometimes it's not even people, but real characters. I think it was the Saving Connor series that did this a few times? "YAY! we saved the guy!" /guy disappears for 4 chapters/ "Oh Harry, thanks for saving me, 4 chapters ago.") But seriously, I love when Harry gets a pet snake or something! Yay Parsel!Harry! I love Harry learning to care for a little critter and taking care of it. Seems healthy for him! Petting it, chatting with it, finding food for it, etc. I mean we don't need repeated pages of Harry casting /accio mouse/ or something, but it'd nice to be reminded that his pet snake is a thing during mundane little moments like... "Harry was working on his potions essay when Hermoine stormed into the tower. She looked furious. He hastily set the quill down, and hissed at Snek to slither off of his wrist and into his robe pocket as he hurried over to where Hermoine was about to terrorize a group of unsuspecting 2nd years."

But no, countless fics where the pet Snek's a big deal (because ooooo snake), then they're never mentioned again, until they're plot relevant. Then, like batman... gone. Until Gotham needs them again.

... Not resolving all of your loose ends. I read one where Lupin was introduced as being in a relationship with Tonks (I mentioned this one in my previous post :) ) he made an appearance or two, then kissed Tonk's cheek before she went to work one day, or something. 10 chapter later, she's getting involved with random american gun exmilitary gun nut, story's over and.. what happened to Lupin? Who knows. One of the great mysteries of life. (Seriously, I can understand not liking Lupin! but if you're gonna include him or any other character, don't just... make them vanish. wrap up their story.

This one might be a little more controversial, but Womanizer!Harry. Sex is great. No one's gonna deny that. But man! Somehow it just doesn't seem like it fits Harry's character to sleep with anything with 2 legs. At least not to me. Well, I could see it? but it seems like something he'd be doing as an escape mechanism and is probably paired with a problematic drinking habit or something. I could see RON sleeping around, I could TOTALLY see the twins sleeping around. Sirius, sure. Lupin? Not really. And Harry? Not Harry. Harry seems more like the sort that has a lot of trouble letting people emotionally and physically close. Harry seems like the sort who, after he and Ginny drift apart/break up/whatever spends his days utterly baffled about 'what now'? ... a Harry who has trouble making more friends beyond a very superficial "yeah, the Chudley Cannons are great." sort of level... He doesn't really have practice with it, after all. Spent so much of his time trying not to be killed after all, and being emotionally stunted, He seems like someone who has even more issues than just that, because he spends his time wondering 'is this person wanting to really be my friend, or do they just want to get close to The Boy Who Lived and Defeated Voldemort?" ..... there is joy to be had in many different characterizations, but Playboy!Harry is one that's so far off from Rowling!Harry that I feel like it needs a lot of explanation to justify.... Explanation that playboy!Harries almost never get.

Yes, this means I didn't like "A Black Comedy" :( It was funny at points, but at the same time, MAN was it disrespectful to the ladies. and I just couldn't get past how ... casual "LOL nothing's serious EXCEPT SIRIUS" it was. ....I have clearly grown up since I was 16 and enjoyed crackfics :(

Hm, another one: Fics where.... hmm... you suddenly realize that "this story was written by a man".. and you know this because you've read something like... a paragraph detailing EXACTLY what Harry's gazing at when he's watching Cho Chang leave the room. Sometimes it's fine. Seriously, Harry's a teenage boy, I don't mind an arse-or-tits fixation here and there. But.... it's so rarely a subtle thing. Like. It's not just "Wow, Cho looks great even walking away" once or twice. it's a near obsession with describing how her breasts look in that shirt, or what the broomstick does to her quidditch uniform. Repeatedly. All to describe "Harry likes Cho"... not "Harry is unhealthily focused on Cho" or "Harry is a healthy young man who is dealing with repeated thoughts of sex" or "Harry is becoming sexually aware!" ut to say "Harry thinks Cho is attractive." ...roughly on par with "Ginny blushed". I mean, I could understand it if the point was to tantalize the audience, building up to some eventual smut.... but you said this story wasn't gonna have smut?? There's not even a sex scene in the whole story?? Harry and Cho don't get together and don't even really become friends? He's literally just staring at her for no reason that advances the plot in any real way? Why bother with such INTENSE and nearly pornographic detail then??

Let me be clear: I don't mind reading about Harry as-written-by-someone-who-used-to-be-a-teenage-boy-too. I mind when it's excessive and gratuitous.

Related, I hate it when characters stop being "teenage boy/girl" and become "what the author thinks a teenage boy/girl is." When it's... Hermoine giggling vapidly and being obsessed with clothes because, to the male author, all teenage girls do that. Just like all teenage girls are interested in is boys and kissing and clothes, and who the DREAMIEST is. Just like Hermoine, Luna and Ginny are pretty much the same characters with different wigs you know? (To be fair, girls do do their own version of this stuff, but it tends to be a lot less... aggressive. More Harry thinking about how pretty Cho is, and having long conversations with Ron about how he FEELS, with lots of Bryonesque sighing out the Tower's windows, gazing across the misty moors. It's equally out of touch with reality, but a lot less obnoxious.)

OH and MAN! There've been a few where I've stopped, set my kindle down, and SIGHED, saying "This author is the father of a young girl who isn't ready to deal with the idea that his daughter might have the same urges he had at her age, so he's projecting the air of maturity onto these 14 year olds who are deeply and totally in love with each other but have no desire to have sex, kiss or anything like that because they are Too Young. Just hug sometimes, or maybe a small kiss when Harry is EXTRA brave." or "Oh, this person is clearly a (political affiliation) who thinks that (political opinion) and is using his fanfic as a medium to share his opinion with everyone else." Or, the one I possibly hate most. "Ah, shit. I know what this guy's kink's are."

***** If it makes you feel better, consider that the fanfiction pool is disproportionately large with regards to other fandoms. With every 50 or so shitty knockoff fics, you find a gem. It's like panning for gold. Sure there's a lot of gravel, but finding the good fics is rewarding.

Circular Reasoning

HPMOR

Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus

Without Thorn, the Rose

The Last Enemy

Too Young to Die

The Arithmancer

Applied Cultural Anthropology

There are lots of great fics around, and there's something for everyone. At the risk of sounding optimistic, I would say that fics I enjoy as much as these are worth every minute of slogging through super Darth Potter Voldemort slash fics.

More... I was encouraged to write more, so I did! and.. I've been reading fanfic for several years every day. my guilty pleasure I guess ;) my husband doesn't really care, my best friend just SIGHS and asks why I'm reading that when I could be reading something GOOD, because Harry potter wasn't any good after SIGH the first few books so clearly no fanfic is SIGH worthwhile either. So I don't have anyone to really gripe too about my pet peeves. :) So I guess you could say It's been building up for a bit. :)

That said, the gold is seriously worth hunting for and thank you for these recommendations! I read almost exclusivly off of recommendations these days... where I can anyway :)

Even so, I do read through some crud-- but it's worth it. :)

Even the super darth potter voldemorte slash fics can be fun if well written. :) (well written is ALWAYS the catch, though. Thankfully I'm not TOOO picky? but MAN, I hate when I see a story that everyone raves over only to find that I hate it. XD

******* Lol, I have some more gold fics if you want to read. At least gold to me. I went to look for The Last Enemy, but I saw that it was taken down by the author. It is kind of depressing, because it was a very well written work about 100k in length, but had only 20-30 favs follows because it was about the Peverell Brothers, who aren't often searched for. I have a copy of the fic in my mobile app, but still, it's tragic that my shitty fic I wrote with only half the length and a fourth the quality, has orders of magnitude more love than his does.

Anyway, if you ever feel the urge to get some decent fics, I can point you towards some of the ones I have read and liked. Just PM me.

**** (this is part 2)

ONWARD!

I hate when the author excessively details, but does so poorly. "The room had mossy green carpet, and silvery wallpaper, there was a table with ornate carvings, and 2 matching chairs, as well as a bed with green covers, and a big window with green curtains. There was a lamp, and a chandelier with candles."

I hate when they detail excessively and go on for AGES about the EXACT color of the pillows and the pattern on the pillows and the wallpaper, and everything in it... all in a room that Harry will never be in again. Ever. But the black tassels on the silk pillows (of which there were 3) on the black-and-burgundy loveseat with the ornate black wood trim depicting a pair of dragons delicately entwined together are ESSENTIAL.

On THAT note, I read one the other day where EVERY scene included a mention of what each character is wearing, even when it really, REALLY doesn't matter that Harry's wearing a blue shirt and a dark gray jumper with black khakis today. EVERY. SCENE. DRAMATIC SHOW DOWN WITH VOLDEMORT! Who is wearing charcoal robes with a high manderin collar. His sleeves have very subtle green trim, and he's wearing a loose coat over top with long billowing sleeves.

.... I have a special hatred of "11 year old Harry buys a chest. a GOOD chest. Like Moody had. With a big storage room under it and stuff." ...because these scenes almost inevitably turn into long descriptions of how cool the chest is and how it has 4 locks, spelled to Harry by blood, and it has an apartment in it, and a library and googleable self-sorting bookshelves, and a potions lab, and here's the user's manual and here's how you change the colors of the walls and be careful you can only do this once, so be sure before you do it, and here's how you open the 12 hidden compartments, and here's the fake hidden compartment and and and... ..... and they're almost always followed or preceded by excessive description that is basically summed up as "and then Harry, who is smart, buys a lot of things that are smart to buy. Here's his shopping list. See how smart he was?" or "see how much better letting Snape/McGonnagal/Flitwick/Sprout/Lupin/the pope/the queen herself/Sirius/whoever take Harry shopping went versus that oaf Hagrid?" ... it's like those gun-nuts who like describing weapons and ammo, but for Harry Potter. I mean, I like a good 'Harry goes to Diagon Alley for the first time scene. The key word there is GOOD. Not "Harry buys all of the fancy stuff."

Okay, I think I'm done again. ;)

  I absolutely hate it when people shortens my name to "Air". My name is Aaron. It's isn't hard.
#+end_quote

In contrast... I went by the name my parents called me ("Jenny" or the occasional "Jennifer"... ) until I was a late teen. The first time I had a friend who took it on to themselves to give me a new nickname ("Jen") honestly made me feel really special. It was the first time someone had really thought about who I was and didn't accept the old name..... without them, I'd STILL be Jenny, which is a very poor name for a woman of 33.

Myself aside, I could easily see Hermione having a similar set of feelings: They like her enough to give her a pet name. That's... a level of friendship she probably hadn't experienced before. That FEELS special.

Names have kind of a magic to them, y'know? These days, I have many names. There is a name that my husband calls me and no one else is allowed to. Nothing dirty about it, it's just HIS name for me. There is a name that my best friend and her family calls me... My blood family calls me another name, while many others call me another name. I have special names for my husband, and my friend and several others as well. These names are a way of showing affection, and I treasure all of them.

You don't have to. That's okay. Aaron is a fantastic name that should be respected. :)

I imagine that Harry, who didn't even know his name until he went to school, would be very firmly attached to his. And Hermione, who likely never had any friendly childhood nicknames and had only had her names used insultingly when modified, would as well make it an issue that her name was used correctly.

******* Fandom has this habit of latching onto small details and expanding them into huge things. It happened with Dumbledore and sherbet lemons/lemon drops, and Lupin and chocolate (although I believe The Shoebox Project had a lot to play in that particular trope).

But actually, after looking, Harry is nearly always "boy" to Vernon, both when addressed directly and when talked about; "you" is also used. Petunia never uses a direct term of address at all, but tends to use "the boy" when talking about him. Dudley occasionally directly addresses him, but he always uses Harry's name. Only twice in the whole series does Vernon call him Harry, both in PS, and the first time it's very obviously a stylistic choice ("Get the post, Dudley." "Make Harry get it." "Get the post, Harry." -- clearly going for symmetry) and the second time it's a clear effort on Vernon's part of be polite (when he's giving Harry the second bedroom). "Freak" is never actually used towards Harry, but Petunia says it about Lily in PS and then again a few times in DH, and Dudley calls Hogwarts "freak school" a couple of times, so it's plausible that they might have used it against him, off screen at least.

So while I'm not in the camp that thinks Harry went the first five years of his life not knowing his own name, I can see where it came from and how it got picked up by people who write extremely abusive Dursleys.

Yet even in this very thread below we have someone thinking that it wasn't until he got to Hogwarts!

**** Whereas, I could see both Harry and Hermoine having the absolute opposite opinion as you think they would :)

Harry not having ANY attachment to his name because no one ever really used it. (there's an interesting story detail: a Harry who, over his first few months at hogwarts, has to get used to the fact that when someone is saying "harry" or "potter" they mean him. ... or having the automatic "is someone talking to me?" reaction when someone says the word "freak" within earshot...) Hermoine liking nicknames and modifications because her mum and dad always insisted on Hermoine--up to and including for her School mates. Not to mention, it's a rather strange name. Lots of opportunity for mispronunciations and misspellings and "What kind of name is THAT?" ... (THere's another story fluff: a slightly older (perhaps after her first year of being a prefect) Hermoine who spent part of her schooldays INSISTING on her full name.... and realizing that she really doesn't LIKE it and that it frustrates her and that she's happiest when people are just calling her "Granger" because it's straightforward and not easy to mangle etc. ...deciding that she wants to have a nick name that her friends use in place of a personal name. Maybe Jean? Maybe somethign more creative....)

Ultimately, though, I think it all depends on what sort of characters you're trying to create and what sort of personalities they'll have.

AS for me: I actually am more attached to my nicknames than my given name these days. Still Had a Moment the other day when someone called out "Jennifer!" in the store and my head automatically turned..... as I said to my husband after "well, good to know I still respond to that."

YES YOU CAN REPEAT NAMES, stop using hyper flowery prose such as the "black haired boy" , "the avada kedavra green eyed 16 year old teenager boy". Use his name, readers won't see it.

On the same line of thought: said can be used a lot. Just like names, readers erase it from their mind and it becomes more like a punctuation. Always using different speech verb is what breaks the flow of the story.

I suspect a lot of that might also be not having easy ways of proof reading.

(the answer was google docs! but that wouldn't have been an option a few years ago) ... plus it can be a really touchy thing for an author and a friend: if you get a lot of comments about things that need to be changed, it can get discouraging, and as an editor, it can get a bit intimidating to 'pick' so much. because 'what if they get upset because i corrected so much?"

(this is actually a thing by the way. I used to edit for two friends. One friend we amicably agreed that I didn't need to edit for her anymore. She got too upset and discouraged, and i got too anxious and the whole thing jsut went awfully. Part of that is her problem, because she has that even with her own partner... and the only person who she 'trusted' was the professional she hired for editing. ... until she started to doubt them too, haha. I love my friend, though, before there's any misunderstanding. but pouring out creative works and tellin other peopel to "tell me what's wrong" is super hard and scary.

was not to worry about it.

There were places where I wrote the sentence, and it was awful, but it communicated an action, and some words. and then I moved on to the next sentence. Some sentences were easier than others. Then after I wrote down all of the sentences in an area (the short story, the chapter, the scene, whatever) I went back and I edited. and it was so much easier to change the rough stiff sentences into words that flowed when I already had a framework there. I looked on it as doing a 'sketch'... and then refining it later. :)

That said, a lot of brit/americanisms aren't so much in pop culture, but just in phrasing and word choices. I think everyone knows about trunks and boots and jumpers and sweaters etc... however, the fact that Brits tend to say "going to the shop" instead of "going to the store" and chemist vs drug store, and lift vs elevator. Or the fact that Brits don't consider pancakes a breakfast food... less common.

And generally one can tell when it's forgotten about, even without an author note. If it's done purposefully, it becomes a 'what if?' story, classic fanfiction. If not, it's little details that jar.

Hopefully you can just let them slide over you. But when it's something you feel you know a fair bit about.... ugh! (for me, it tends to be us military stuff -- I'm nooooo expert, but when people start talking about how their character has been an army captain for 10 years and is one of the best in the force.... I start twitching. Or how they made colonel by 25..... or..... ugh.. it's basic research. (for the uninformed, in the US military, at least, in the modern day, there's generally a minimum number of years you must have served before you can be promoted, and there's kind of a maximum too. The 10-years-as-captain should have been promoted years ago, and the young colonel needs about 16 years in service so he's about a decade short on experience. )

but what if stories can be fun! as long as they stick to their own rules :)

....how much of "all that" is the horse being well trained? I mean, I'm like 98% positive you can't just slap a bridle and saddle onto Ye Olde Wilde/Feral Horse and expect it to understand...?

Reminds me of another pet peeve: Wolf packs. One alpha, all others shall bow before him. Real wolves are family groups with a mated pair 'in charge'... because all of the rest of the pack is generally offspring. Sometimes a few wolf families will get together , but most packs are well under a dozen members. They tend to leave the pack when they reach sexual maturity and go wandering away til they find a suitable mate. Not another pack, but a mate. joining another pack is rare as hell. ....They will take in immature animals though! None of this 'massive 100 wolf wolf pack, the alpha is a cruel unrelenting stranger who rules the pack with an iron paw. I'm the omega, everything is awful. But I will FIGHT MY WAY UP THROUGH THE HIERARCHY!"

....turns out the whole alpha, beta omega thing was based almost entirely off of the behavior of captive packs in zoos... Much like humans, animals in 'prison' act differently than free animals. Yet, prevailing opinions prevail.

************** Yeah, there's a lot of training of both horse and rider, and the equipment allows for finer communication after the horse learns it's basic training with it - it's possible if horse and rider know what they're doing to ride without equipment (have tried it myself!) but you lose all finesse of communication. That in a battle when you're both fighting for your life? Stupid. Even magical elf horse bond is at least an explanation - the worst is poor farm girl/boy who has never sat on a horse hops on and naturally just rides amazingly with no equipment because they have TALENT.

AS for wolves... yeah the requirement in fiction drives me nuts. Even more so as... I have a friend who writes urban fantasy. From day one, when she starts telling me about her story and game world I've told her 'but wolves don't work that way.' and every time it's disregarded... ugh. No one says your wolf pack can't have a leader, but realy, if your wolf pack gets into a bitchfight every time someone looks at the other the wrong way, then you're not living in a healthy way, then that's not really a healthy living environment is it?

I mean, why talk about a thing you don't understand like you do? i'ts not hard to gloss over it! If you want it to matter to the character, talk about the horse! "She was a sweet mare-young enough that there was a bounce in her step, old enough that she wasn't silly. She seemed to have something against rabbits, but otherwise took the travels of the road well." "As with most every horse Marcus had met, the old stallion took to him quickly. Mist wasn't very fast, but Marcus didn't need him to be. The steady walk was more than enough to take man and horse across the countryside. All that mattered was that they were far enough south by the time the first snows started to fall, but that wouldn't be for months yet. For all that, Mist was hardly a docile beast. Marcus had misjudged that at first, but about month into their journey, he'd woken up one night to the sound of enraged yeowling. He'd been terrified he'd been about to see Mist be shredded by one of the mountain cats, only to find the opposite: The cat's skull crushed by a strike of a hoof, and the horse standing over the body with an air to his posture, as if saying 'serves you right!'"

Then again, I guess that's about the HORSE and not about how COOOOOOL marcus-the-horse-whispererer is.

As for the knowledge of radar and other modern muggle terms, Harry wasn't kept in a hole; he saw television shows and was exposed to culture through schoolmates and his cousin's blatherings, if nothing else. Also, Draco made mention during first year of escaping helicopters on his broom. Young wizards made get less immersive exposure to modern concepts, but most purebloods live in the midst of muggle communities. There will be some overlap.

Also, Draco mentioning Helicopters is non-diegetic:

it is relayed to use through our point of reference, Harry, who does understand what a Helicopter is. I find it easier to picture Draco saying something more along the lines, "/I wanted to see the Arrows play the Bats but of course Father was busy, so I jumped on my Cleansweep and took off, was chased all the way to the game by one of those ridiculous Muggle flying contraptions, but of course they were no match for me on a boom./"

He was a dick, but he grew up into a half decent person, thanks to Lily and the war.

Sirius was a different kettle of fish. Brought up in the family he was, the huge difficulties he faced having to leave home and the hatred and ostracisation by his family, he was probably in a similar sort of mental place to Snape. Like Snape, his morals seem to be pretty skewed - setting Lupin on Snape was beyond throwing hexes in a corridor (and lets be honest, if they got snape 4-1 on occasion snape would have repaid that with his Slytherin buddies), it was outright evil. Sirius is reckless, uncaring and amoral. His stint in Azkaban didn't help, either, as we see him egging Harry on and his still obvious hatred of Snape. Sirius is a really grey character, and very mercurial with his moods too - the kind of guy who seems fun and outgoing and clever but can turn in a minute. if it weren't for his fierce loyalty to his friends, I do wonder if Sirius would have ended up a really awful person.

And I'm a massive marauders fan. Do I sometimes like to write them as if Sirius' life hadn't been so difficult, and James more of a popular prankster instead of a bully with a god complex? yeah. But from what we know of them in canon, none of the marauders or snape had better than complex, grey characters.

**** Oh hell no. Sirius tried to kill Snape via lupin. The Marauders had a huuuge file where their bullying records were laid open.

They attacked Snape 4 to 1.

Just because lily and Snape may not have been friends anymore does not justify the attack.

Plus lupin and Sirius admitted that they were jerks.

Lupin admitted that he was too joyful of belonging and having friends that he would stop Sirius and James.

( And the only memory tempering we ever saw was very open and telling. )

We have absolutely no evidence that the Marauders were justified in attacking Snape or bullying the whole school except for people who want it to be that way.

I'll go one further - the Marauders went so far as to learn to become animagi just so they can roam around with their werewolf friend. They basically risked the safety of innocents just because they felt like it. They betrayed Dumbledores Trust in lupin and they did it just for the fun of it. Just like they targeted Snape that one time.

Seriously why and how could you excuse their behavior? War time? No, I'm sorry but I think they might have led Snape to the death eaters. How could he not become one? He was being bullied and probably the only people who would give him any time of day were the death eater jr's. In his house. And let's not forget that Sirius and James bullied Snape from day one. It started on the train ride when the two rich kids made fun of the poor kid and gave him a nickname that would stick.

I'll admit to being a little biased where Snape is concerned, but you's reachin'.

Snape was also a dick. Considering the attitude he already exhibited towards Muggles before entering Hogwarts, he was no angel to begin with. Let's not forget the Word from God herself:

#+begin_quote
  #+begin_example
    Yes [on possibly having feelings for Snape(?)]. She might even have grown to love him romantically (she certainly loved him as a friend) if he had not loved Dark Magic so much, and been drawn to such loathesome people and acts.
  #+end_example
#+end_quote

It should be made clear that Snape began his experimentation with the Sectumsempra Curse in (at the very latest) the same year that Sirius plotted to kill him. Not to mention that one of his subjects happened to be the very wizard who stopped him from being mauled.

To scrutinise James, Sirius and Peter for engaging in highly dangerous magical activities in the hopes of helping and protecting a friend is, frankly, rather short-sighted, especially if Snape's exploits as a Death Eater aren't equally examined.

The number of casualties resulting from James, Sirius and Peter's Animagus project equalled (ostensibly) zero. Snape's allegiance and service to Voldemort cost the lives of two young adults, the minds of yet another two, and left two young children effectively orphaned. Not to mention the fact that he proceeded to bully said children for six years out of pure spite,

The fact is, as Dumbledore maintained many times over, it is one's choices that defines a person's character, and Snape chose pettiness at almost every juncture.

Lots of children are relentlessly bullied: I was one of them. Did I ever fantasise about my tormentors being hit by a bus? Maybe once or twice. I never thought about murdering them, though. Whichever way you want to slice it, Sirius and Snape were both that disturbed kid who ends up using the guns in his mum's basement.

James, while an arsehole, fell far short of that.

i don't see how, when it's criticised by lupin himself within the text. what they did was essentially drunk driving. they don't show an abundance of sensitivity for lupin's feelings either- speaking carelessly about it in swm, bullying snape despite his obvious discomfort and admonishments, (sirius) using him as a murder weapon to spite snape. it's myopic to not criticise them.

as for sectumsempra- we don't know when he started with it, but we only see him using it after the werewolf incident. also, lol, said wizard attacked him out of nowhere. i also doubt that he actually 'saved' him, but that's whatever.

The fact is, Snape was passionate about the Dark Arts, and there is nothing wholesome about them. Yes, I know you hate James and Sirius, but their nemesis was equally as detestable, and even when confronted with the consequences of his actions, refused to change until his final breath.

******** lol, sirius is one of my favourite characters, in part because he is capable of genuine viciousness and callousness while also be earnest and having, more or less, noble intentions. he's a more well-adjusted snape, in no small part because of his emotional support systems. i admit i don't like james though. he's not interesting

snape was fascinated in the dark arts as a child and adult, but i think it's more important how it's acted upon. as an adult, we see him using that knowledge, mostly, to protect and heal- as with dumbledore, draco, sectumsempra'ing to save lupin, etc.

********* To be honest, your first reply to my post seemed like a knee-jerk response, because you might have noticed that I pointed out how similar Sirius and Snape are.

You've accused me of not addressing your points directly, and yet, your first counter-argument is based on quoting me out of context.

#+begin_quote
  i don't see how, when it's criticised by lupin himself within the text. what they did was essentially drunk driving. they don't show an abundance of sensitivity for lupin's feelings either- speaking carelessly about it in swm, bullying snape despite his obvious discomfort and admonishments, (sirius) using him as a murder weapon to spite snape. it's myopic to not criticise them.
#+end_quote

You've already admitted to not liking James, so your perception of why he might do certain things is clearly skewed. JKR has made a point of talking about how much James loved his friends. If you're honestly going to claim that he didn't really care about Remus beyond the thrill of having a werewolf as a friend, then there's little point in arguing further.

#+end_quote

Contextualises, but doesn't excuse it, which is my point.

Admittedly, I do like the idea of James. I like writing him, and when I do, I make sure to emphasise how cocky, lairy, vindictive and discompassionate he can be in his dealings with others. But people seem to forget that he was twenty-one when he died - barely out of school. Sirius was the same age when he went to prison for a crime he didn't commit.

Snape, while he lost his only true friend, braved the First War with his life and relative freedom. He - an avowed Death Eater, spy or no - became a teacher. He had the time and exposure to turn a new leaf. He declined.

When I wrote that post, that was what I was trying to get at. Yes, the "Marauders" were jerks. They were also friends, and they grew up to fight a noble cause. Many of the reckless things they did were in service to each other. Snape was also a jerk - a product of his environment as much as the others were, so no free pass there. He also chose bullies as friends, and he also did reckless things. And yet, I doubt that he created the Sectumsempra Curse to preserve Lily's honour. In fact, I distinctly remember his annotation specifying that it was "for enemies".

Sirius tried to kill Snape, yes, but Snape was just as ready to do the same. And James did save his life, otherwise no wizard's debt would have been incurred.

This entire paragraph essentially apologises his behaviour. "Product of environment" is a silly argument when Sirius managed to shrug that stuff off so early. Harry could have grown to hate Muggles - I can't remember many treating him all that well.

Snape assumed the daily duty of terrorising his students until his final year of life. If that is character development, then pardon me. Yes, the "Prince's Tale" was a stirring revelation at the end, but it doesn't wash away his character. Likewise, you can't wash the characters of his school-age enemies with one memory. Even Draco Malfoy was given multiple opportunities to show how unpleasant he was.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

no...it's stating that different people react to different circumstances differently. sirius also had a different environment than him. it's implied that there were adults (alphard) who were willing to help him even if it meant opposing his parents. he was in contact with andromeda who also defied their family. the social dynamics are dissimilar. snape, unlike harry, had an implied pureblood mother to likely influence whatever beliefs he developed as a coping mechanism.

** I have a couple really specific pet peeves relating to Fantastic Beasts fanfic:

Anything that mentions Tina or Queenie playing Quidditch at Ilvermorny. Quidditch isn't popular in the US! They play Quodpot.

I will admit that this one is sooooo ridiculously nitpicky but I see it a lot. I've been seeing a LOT of fics (again, FB, Newt and Tina, long distance, lots of letter writing) where someone will be writing a letter, write something, decide against it and cross it out with the quill. A full grown wizard would not do this! I'm sure they would manipulate the ink on the parchment using magic. When Ron has that broken autocorrect quill, Hermione uses her wand to fix the mistakes. And then when he spills ink all over the completed essay, Hermione fixes it up again. And look at the diary horcrux - some fucked up dark magic going on there, sure. But the ink on paper is being manipulated with (what we can assume to be) benign magic. I get all "magic xylophone" about a lot of things WW related but this is my most ridiculous gripe.

Oh and 'Mione bothers me so much that for a while I used a chrome extension to replace it with "Hermione" so I wouldn't let it get in the way of otherwise good fics.

  Animagus transformation. They never use them unless it is a mythical one. Except for spying it is extremely useless.

[radio sports announcer voice]

Here we have the long-awaited confrontation between Neville Longbottom and Bellatrix Black. Black, known as one of the most enthusiastic practitioners of the Dark Arts aside from You-Know-Who himself, who once beat Mad-Eye Moody in a duel. Longbottom, known to most as a squib who wandered into the wrong door at King's Cross for seven years running.

Folks, this promises to be unfortunately one-sided, not to mention messy, so if you want to look away for a few moments...

They've met at the edge of the Southern Courtyard. There's a fair bit of rubble. If Longbottom intends to use the terrain to his advantage, he's chosen a fairly good spot.

They're exchanging insults. Longbottom looks furious. They're preparing their first spells now. Black is going for an entrail-expelling curse. Longbottom ducks out of the way -- he's transforming -- Longbottom's a bear animagus! He's halfway through the transformation --

Oh, Black steps in with a shredding curse of some sort! Longbottom manages to complete his transformation, but he's missing his left foreleg at the shoulder. A bear's best offence is a good swipe with a forepaw, and that's going to be difficult for him now. He staggers forward -- a swing from the right -- Black ducks under -- a concussion charm! Longbottom goes flying.

Black's moving in for the kill now. She raises her wand high. What's it going to be, the Cruciatus or the entrail expelling? The Cruciatus is what took both of Longbottom's parents, and from the very same wand, but lately she's been using the entrail -- no, she conjures a stream of lightning! Longbottom's twitching and his fur is on fire. The lightning is continuing -- it's turning black -- this is a rare treat, folks, she's showing us Jogloran's Decrepifying Bolt all the way to the end. A very dangerous curse, tends to backfire on the caster, but Black's using it as confidently as a Levitation Charm. In a moment we'll see -- yes, Longbottom's body is crumbling from the inside. His flesh is turning to ash. All that's left now is his skeleton.

Well, that was a better showing than I think anybody expected, but the long odds for Longbottom didn't pay off in the end. Good showmanship from Black, and here's to another fine duel -- I see Molly Weasley's arriving at the courtyard now.

**** I think the main complaint is that so many fanfics just substitute "Merlin" for "God." Like "Thank Merlin" or "Honest-to-Merlin" or "I swear to Merlin" or just the exclamation "Merlin!" Neither of which appear in the books.

You get the very occasional "in the name of Merlin," but usually the exclamation is "Merlin's beard," not plain "Merlin." (Or, if it's Ron Weasley, it might be "Merlin's pants" or "Merlin's saggy left --")

Main thing is, wizards do say "God." In fact, the wizard who says "God" the most in the books is Draco Malfoy.

***** I think the general consensus is that it's a cop-out. It's just an easy way to explain away different power levels and how magic is used. Like, oh, he has a massive magical core. And this other guy's magical core is below average. It just doesn't sit right in a world of Rowling's making, where magical strength is not always so clear-cut and measured by the 'size of magical cores'. Basically, magical cores over-simplify magic.

Also, I do have a personal opinion that magical cores make it sound like magic is not truly a part of witches and wizards, more like an extra organ that can be removed and transferred to a Muggle, and voila, we have a new wizard/witch. And a new Muggle.

****** Huh. For me, the core is definitely part of the wizard. Take as another example the soul. One couldn't say where in the body the soul is produced or located, just that it has probably something to do with the brain. I think the same way about cores. They're just a metaphor for something too complex to talk about otherwise.

***** I've seen magical cores done decently only once in all of the fanfics I've read linkffn(Core Threads). Even there, I am liking them less and less as the story progresses, and while it is the entire /point/ of the fic, it may be the everything or just the magical core I am getting tired of there. I have seen them used poorly every other time I've seen them, and a ratio of 1:everything else, its an easy flag to let me know I will not enjoy a fic.

***** To understand why we generally dislike magical cores here you need to understand why people use them most of the time. In cannon there is a power gap of sorts, but the gap is almost entirely skill, mentality, and the level of magical education each character has. In fanfiction authors try to emulate that power gap, now many of the authors aren't actually good authors and use cop outs, magical cores often allow them to say Character A is actually 4x more powerful than Character B rather than showing us that Character A is fundamentally more prepared to use powerful magic and defeat Character B. You will often see it used to explain why Harry was only above average in canon and not the same level of Dumbledore or Voldemort, basically the author will state his core was bound and his skills were blocked then they make him really ooc and basically the most powerful character in the story. Also it doesn't help that magical core is almost synonymous with cliche-ridden crap in my head.

Now some people will argue magical cores are a fine and dandy concept so you can explain magical exhaustion easier or stop infinite spellcasting (I think there are a few more arguments but I can't remember them.) But here's the thing, even when magical cores are introduced, they never actually seem to run out of energy when someone is in battle, and only occasionally does it actually affect the use of magic in the story. Magical cores might help understand the concept of magical exhaustion, but in practice they are discarded when they would force the author to rethink their story. And the argument for infinite casting is a joke, never once have I seen it in a story, it's a bad argument because it's covering an issue that isn't really an issue.

Now the reason we hate them here is because most of us accidentally started analyzing fanfiction at some point and cannot stop and as a result cliche-ridden stories that use bad concepts make us cringe internally. Now we don't hate on every story that uses cores, we hate on stories where Harry is literally born more powerful than Dumbledore, if you only ever mention magical cores for exhaustion while in the hospital wing or something we'd probably give you a pass.

*** Mainly when people make it an important aspect of the story without going into any more depth. It's unconsidered. Why is this person more powerful than others? Because they have a larger magical core -- which tells me nothing save that they're more powerful.

If you take the time to flesh out how magical cores work, how they grow, and what effects they have on a person, that's better. If it's used to create problems, that's better. Stories thrive on conflict, and creating solutions like "Harry has twice as large a core as any other person" smacks of a deus ex machina in advance. Which both leaves us unsatisfied and robs us of tension.

A bad (and common) example of magical cores:

#+begin_quote
  Some people are stronger than others. There is a simple spell to determine someone's strength. Harry's is off the charts. That's why Harry can beat Voldemort.
#+end_quote

A good example of magical cores:

#+begin_quote
  A magical core is like a muscle. It grows with use, and it grows as you grow toward adulthood. There isn't much innate variation. Purebloods have access to potions and dietary supplements and exercises that help their kids out, and it gives them a decent advantage at Hogwarts and after. It's a large part of how the British magical class system evolved.

  Voldemort found a way to eat other people's magical cores, adding a fraction of their magical power to his own.

  The scar horcrux gave Harry a tiny fraction of Voldemort's core -- a boost to be sure, but only enough to put him on par with purebloods. However, it's /Voldemort's/ core, tainted with years of dark magic use, which has a psychological impact. Harry is reckless, thrill-seeking, and callous because of that fragment of Voldemort's magical core adhered to his own.

  Furthermore, sympathetic magic means that Voldemort can cast spells that impact Harry from anywhere in the world through that core (provided Lord V is willing to suffer the effects of those spells), offload certain ill effects onto Harry, and sometimes read his mind.
#+end_quote

Here, magical cores were used to give Harry a benefit. They were also used to give him a huge set of problems to overcome. That means he will need ingenuity, unusual hard work, teamwork, etc to overcome Voldemort -- all of which makes the story more interesting and provides more tension.

** Any version of the soulmate trope in slash. Ugh. Lazy writing used for mashing two characters together, creating a pairing that would require three times as much development without it.

Overpowered genius Hermione who is suddenly smarter than McGonagall and everyone else around her.

Ron/Hermione pairing. Nope. Sorry. Just not seeing that working out long term.

People who write in Scottish accent, because most of the time it turns out abysmal and unreadable.

People who write dialogue between two French characters in French using google translator, and then including the original english sentence at the bottom of the fic, so you have to constantly scroll back and forth like an idiot.

Someone calling Voldemort "The Big V" Yep. Thankfully I've only seen it once. But... Just no. Please. (it wasn't meant to be a crack fic)

Authors not using the A/N feature, instead just writing the note into the body of the fic.

Sexual use of Transfiguration. And engorgio... something.

*** I agree with you on Magical cores and the " 'Mione" issue.

I don't see the point in hating the nickname 'Mione, it's better than Herms, or almost any other nickname one could give her, I mean, I'm not overzealous with it, but I use it when the Trio are talking to one another, like Ron or Harry using it as a term of endearment.

I don't see the point of the hate for "Magical Cores" either, it's not like the books explain how their magic works, so of course the fans make up their own way of it's working. It's used so much in fan fiction, that almost the majority of Hogwarts era stories that mention how magic works in some way, tend to use the magical core explanation.

It's better than "wizards direct the magic in the air with their wands or hands" or straight up ripping off Fairy Tale with Magic batteries, or Type Moon, Fate/Stay Night, with Magic circuits.
