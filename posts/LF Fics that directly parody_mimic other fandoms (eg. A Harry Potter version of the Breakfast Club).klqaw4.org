As the title says, I'm looking for fics that directly mimic other fandoms - ie. more than just a reference. To expand on the title example, this could be Harry and several strangers from across the school getting stuck in detention, then slowly learning to understand each other and become friends. Can be alternate universes, but I don't want actual crossovers (ie. No Harry and co meeting the Breakfast Club kids themselves, or the 'Harry goes to the Star Wars universe' type things), just parodies/mimicries.

(Is there an actual fandom word for things like this? The closest I know is just 'Whatever-the-thing-is AU' and that doesn't seem quite right to me).

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. Basically, anything goes. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

  Andromeda did not weep for her daughter. She could not. It cut deeper than tears, deeper even than pain. She felt nothing as she watched a yawning crevasse open where moments ago the Hogwarts stone had kissed the edges of Dora's body. The vines and soil of the next place rose up and engulfed the body, the last remnants of Andromeda's husband and child. The tendrils wrapped around Dora and wrested her from her mother's grasp, swallowing her beneath this mortal earth. A magical realism retelling of the myth of Demeter and Persephone.

** The only one I can think of right now is a Harry Potter take on the Boy Meets World episode "And then there was Shawn" (the one where they're trapped in detention with a killer on the loose). I remember thinking it was the most hilarious fic I ever read, but I was also like 12 when I read it.

**** It's an anime about a fight to the death between 7 humans and their magical servants who come from history and myth, with a lot of creative liberties. The main character's servant is King Arthur, but instead of a dude she's a cute anime girl. I recommend the Unlimited Blade Works and Fate Zero series on Netflix

** Here's a one-shot of mine: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27034639/chapters/66000553]]

Caveat, it's a fic of HPMOR, but with the characters and dialogue retooled to match the tone of Rick and Morty. If you're not familiar with HPMOR there's some context provided but I suspect it's not quite enough to provide the necessary context.

An.....interesting and slightly poignant meta one-shot that, as the author muses, is written in the style of a conversation scene from the show Community. May or may not be what you're looking for but here ya go
