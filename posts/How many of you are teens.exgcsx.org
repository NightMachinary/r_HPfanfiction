I'm 16. How many of you are teenagers like me, because it comes across as this sub consisting of mostly older readers. Also what is your experience of other people reacting to you reading FanFiction?


** I'm not a teenager anymore, but I've been reading fanfiction since I was 13.

No one knows, but I suspect that if they did, they wouldn't really care

** I think this sub does yearly surveys and age demographics is part of it. Try searching for that. If I weren't on mobile I'd try and find it myself.

** I personally appreciate that a lot of people here are fans that have been around the series since the beginning (or there abouts) because everyone seems to know so much, and sometimes recommend those old stories that are just amazing. It's also nice to discuss things with people who are older/younger and not have to worry about how old they are and how to act around them.

** I'm 15. I'm happy with the demographic of the sub right now. Older readers tends to mean well done writing.

*** Exactly. I am 15 too but a sub with all 15 year olds would be dreadful.
