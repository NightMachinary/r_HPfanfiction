** *Hermione:* Mum, dad, I am most certainly not evil because I'm a witch. I'm evil because I modified your memories without your permission; that I did it with magic is entirely incidental. Honestly, Muggles are as bad at basic logic as wizards!

*** :) Well done - I always had a problem with her doing that (mostly because I myself would rather DIE than give up who I am (because what's left in my body after a mind-whipe/memory-modification etc. sure as hell ain't me - it's no wounder that in some science fiction universes this is used as an alternative to the death-penalty (personality-death!)) and not feeling a ton of guilt (note: I don't know if I wouldn't do it in her situation or at least think about it - I know: Hypocrite! - but I'd feel like crap...hell, I don't know if I'd actually go through with it!) and I love reading about her parents being very very very cross with her (personally I'd probably say something along the lines of: "You are not my daughter! I don't have a daughter anymore! Get out of my house!")

**** Meh... I could've had her recite a litany of things she'd done (set a teacher on fire, kidnap and impersonate her classmates, kidnap and blackmail a reporter, etc.), but I went for the most salient one to her parents. That's actually the only vicious thing she'd done in canon that she shows any guilt at all about.

That said, we don't really know what transpired between Hermione and her parents. My headcanon was that it was something like this:

*Hermione*: ... And that's why you need to go somewhere far away from there --- ideally Australia. I've Charmed these forged papers to appear real to any Muggle that examines them.

*Parents:* Thank you so much. But, there are only two sets of documents here.

*Hermione:* Mum, dad, I have to stay. Ha- I can't tell you the details, but it's our only chance to stop Voldemort.

*Parents:* If you're staying, we're staying.

*Hermione:* But you can't! They'll go after you to get to me. I can't protect you!

*Parents:* Yes, and you might hate us for it, but if taking ourselves hostage is the only way to make you leave with us to safety, then we will do it.

*Hermione:* Mum, Dad, I'm sorry...

*Parents:* We are sorry too, but...

*Hermione:* No, not about that. /STUPEFY!/ /STUPEFY!/ So sorry... /CONFABULUS!/ /CONFABULUS!/

#+begin_quote
  (personally I'd probably say something along the lines of: "You are not my daughter! I don't have a daughter anymore! Get out of my house!")
#+end_quote

And evil!Hermione reply would be something like "/OBLIVIATE! OBLIVIATE!/ OK, there goes Plan L. Time for Plan M: blame it on the Obliviators."

/CONFABULUS!/ is a plausible incantation for a False Memory Charm.

*** I've read at least one fic where all muggleborns are taken from their parents and put into a magical orphanage, the parents are obliviated. In another, the parents are told at the outset that if they try to prevent their child from attending school they could be obliviated, as untrained magic is considered to be so dangerous.

**** I've seen one or two like that. I usually nope out. There was one where Harry and Draco were both for legislation to remove muggleborns from their parents. I could see the writer's pov.

I really wish muggleborn parents were informed the first time about their children performed accidental magic. Even if they have to keep it a secret from their kids since they can't be stopped from blabbing as kids, it would help the parents deal with it all.

Her parents tried to lock her up, but that would be totally impossible since she still had her wand. Confundus charm, stunners, body-binds, disillusionment, no, muggles won't be able to stop a witch with a wand.

** At no point is it even suggested that her parents care much. It's Britain and they're dentists. The odds are they're not particularly religious, if religious at all.

So unless she does something completely horrible with her magic, and from a certain point of view the memory charms certainly count, it seems like a bad way to make an angsty story.
