I love Hermione and Ron and I think that they are great characters, but so many stories have Harry befriend the same exact people even if Harry is sorted in another house, and that just doesn't make any sense to me.

So for my story idea that I'd like someone to write I do not want Harry to befriend Hermione, Ron or Draco. I love Hermione and Ron and I love stories where Harry befriends Draco but I've just read way too many of them at this point that I'd like something different.

Now he can become friends with Neville sooner then he did in canon, see if that has any change in Neville's confidence. Or he can befriend Blaise Zabini or Theodore Nott from Slytherin.

Or Justin Finch-Fletchley, Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott. How different would it be if he was to befriend Susan whose aunt is someone from the Ministry?

Note if you have him befriend Daphne DO NOT have Daphne as a ice princess/ice queen. I cannot stand that persona of hers, no offense to anyone who likes it, I just don't. I don't see her as that at all. So yeah if you write him being friends with Daphne do not do the ice princess/ice queen personality.

Or he can befriend other characters that I didn't mention. Just as long as it isn't Hermione, Ron or Draco. Now he can be friendly with them but I'd rather him not become friends with them. Again no offense to them; and I love the Weasley's, they are my favorite magical family after all. And I do feel bad for the bashing that Ron gets in a lot of fics. That's another thing, NO bashing. I can't stand bashing in stories.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash. Any rating is fine. Would like to see how AU it can get while being believable in its own right. (Note no super powerful Harry, he can be slightly more powerful then he was in canon, but don't make it unbelievable). And likewise he can be a little more smarter then he was in canon just don't make it unbelievable.


** "Call Me" has Harry making different friends and ending up in love with one (Lisa Turpin) of them. It is a summer holiday fic that has him doing his own thing and running across Luna and the twins on occasion. A bunch of muggle OC friends are also present.

  A found phone number, the decision to tale a risk. What does a different summer of 96 hold for Harry? A tale of light romance. No secret training no major angst. For once Harry meets someone normal. Now completed. A tale of one summer.

** Even Susan Bones and Daphne are used too often. What I'd really like to see is some good Ravenclaw stories that don't involve Hermione as a friend. And don't give me Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven, because that's pretty mediocre as far as this sub's standards go. We all need some more Su Li, Luna, and Lisa Turpin.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

  Spinoff to 'HP: The Lone Traveller'. The story of Harry James Potter, the brother of the supposed BoyWhoLived, and his friends... My take on the old 'Harry the brother of the BWL' & 'Harry the Slytherin' plotline.
