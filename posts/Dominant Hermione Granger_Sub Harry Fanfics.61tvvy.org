Anyone know about some? In the BDSM sense


** You didn't specify whether you meant dominant or submissive in the BDSM sense or whether you meant character relationship dynamic, in which Hermione calls the shots more so than in canon. In case you are interested in the latter, there's linkffn(Rule of two, dreams come true by Darklooshkin) and linkffn(Labyrinth by Kroontjespen), though neither has been updated in a long time. ([[/u/darklooshkin]], I'm looking at you.)

There's also linkffn(Adorable Violence by Cloud Zen), which flips the typical relationship dynamic of a male protector with a female who keeps his violence in check through romantic influence.

  Fast-forward, ten years later. Mistress Hermione is so proud of her little Harry! She knew this was exactly how things were supposed to happen right from the start. She's sometimes slightly dysfunctional, just a little possessive, but still adorable... although disagreeing with Mistress Hermione is not recommended. She has a little problem, though. “Happily forever after” is more complicated in real life than in books...

** linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) has a very competent hermione and it is h/hr, but the best part is that it has zero ron bash, ron is actually very competent as well and has an unconventional pairing. It also has non pussy! dumbledore who actually kills his opponents and great aberforth characterization

*** This is a very good story, but Harry is definitely not sub here.

In this fic, several 'bad' canon characters were not bad at all: the Dursleys, Fudge, Lockhart, Pansy, even Umbridge wasn't nearly that bad.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
