It starts with the Doctor and Jack Harkness walking up to Hogwarts. Jack's saying something and the Doctor snaps at him to shut up. Apparently he has a massive headache because Jack is a fixed point in time. But Sherlock and John were in it, too - John was called out by Flitwick for doing homework for the Doctor, as the Doctor's math is completely different.
