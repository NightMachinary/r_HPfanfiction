I really really think Harry and Voldemort would make a great couple under the right circumstances. The problem is that almost every story I come across is borderline pedophilic or wildly OOC, and I have to close the tab in horror. But the masterpieces keep me going.

What story types do you love that are mostly complete shit?


** Time-travel, the number of "fix"-fics where the characters use their second chance to "correct" every single detail in canon instead of doing something innovative is staggerigly huge.

*** I posted this below (or above) and it's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again.]]

Harry can't truly die, when he dies he is reborn into his infant self with all of his memories. At first he tries to save as many as a possible and sees his extra life as a gift but eventually starts seeing it as a curse and starts killing himself in different ways to try and stop from being reborn. Eventually he comes to the conclusion that the reason he can't die is that he always kills Voldemort and that maybe the prophecy actually mean't for him to help Voldemort win.

He's pretty OOC but for good reasons and are explained really well. The only problem is that its unfinished and probably abandoned.

I believe that a good author can make any pairing work, even Vernon/Hedwig (Harry does accidental magic and turns Vernon into an owl, for example. Not remembering he's actually human, Vernon starts courting that beautiful female. Heh, now I want to read that))).

** Alright I'll say it.

I fucking love some good Harry/Sirius slash.

Dear god do I ever LOVE some good Sirry slash.

The problem is that after years of reading it I think the only one that is decent is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6482502/1/Come-Starlight][Come Starlight]].

There have been a few where Harry goes back in time to when the Marauders were still in Hogwarts and a few of those were good too.

I can't even remember any others that weren't just pure smut that were good.

--------------

I also like some Remus/Lily but there aren't even any bad ones because there aren't any stories of it to begin with.

--------------

I also love !ImmortalHarry but there are only a small handful that are novel length and not shit.

Most of those happen to be Avengers crossovers which isn't a bad thing just something strange I've noticed.

--------------

Oh hey OP try giving [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness]] a try. It's eventually Harry/TMR but is pretty good. It has a half finished sequel that is abandoned but together are 500,000+ words so are enough for a day or two of reading.

Another good one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again.]] Also eventually Harry/LV but it's pretty good too. Probably abandoned. I just now realized that they are the same author too. Huh.

You might enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5356546/1/Their-Verdict-of-Vagaries][Their Verdict of Vagaries]], which takes a few chapters to get good, but when it gets good, it gets great. It has immortal!Harry and HP/TMR and tons of original plot while somehow not contradicting the canon except for the very end of DH. I just finished it the other day and I'm still getting over it.

I have to admit that aside from Harry/Snape(who I hate with a passion) and Harry/Draco(who I just sort of dislike unless he is written really well), Harry/TMR-LV is one of the only pairings I haven't really read a lot of.

Not for any particular reason mind, just haven't found a lot that interested me.

I've read the hits like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6953303/1/A-Snake-Named-Voldemort][A Snake Named Voldemort]] which I really liked and a few others but I haven't really read many others.

If you have any other suggestions let me know!

These are my favorite fanfictions of all time. The are humorous, but filled with suspense. The cave incident/The Love accident is HP/LV, set in a post-DH world where Ginny dies and Voldemort gets away... It seems pretty crackish in the beginning then it becomes more serious. The development of the HP/LV romance is some of the best. There is not any soul-magic or like fate nonsense bringing them together...just themselves. (End Rant)

So, I recommend them whole-heartedly!

** I adore "Harry raised by someone other than the Dursleys" and to a lesser extent, "Wizarding schools in other countries an no involvement from the HP cast."

I thrive on those two categories (the first in particular), but even though I see a million fascinating premises, very few of them end up being decent stories, most of them read like a ten year old attempting fan-service. Give me a novel-length take on either of those and I'm happy. I'm actually debating writing a "Harry Raised by Augusta Longbottom" fic right now, but I'm terrible, so consider that idea up for grabs if you like it.

I can't stop reading them. Even if they were last updated in 2009, if the summary and first chapter pull me in, I can't help myself. I like seeing those initial burning ideas that the authors had presented so lovingly, even as I know those bright starts ultimately never went anywhere or were actually immediately ruined in the second chapter.

Most such fics are really bad, sure, and were dropped by the writer as soon as they realized that fact themselves (or when they graduated high school).

But every once in a while...

On one side, Snape chooses to see the worst in everything, while Luna chooses to see the best.
