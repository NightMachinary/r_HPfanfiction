This FanFiction is basically Minerva accidental traveling to a parallel universe where her counterpart died. Broken with grief, Albus decides to succumb to his demons. Albus basically persecuted everyone who didn't disagree with him. With the love of his life not there anymore, he fell apart and became cold.

I like the concept and if there are more stories like these, feel free to comment them below.


** Thanks for the recommendation! I think the world needs more deconstructions of the whole "Dumbledore didn't do enough / was too nice to the Death Eaters / needed to kill more people / needed to turn Harry into a killing machine" complaint.
