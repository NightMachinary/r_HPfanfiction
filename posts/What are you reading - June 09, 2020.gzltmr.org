** Title: Rise of the Dark Lady Hermione Rating: 7/10 Link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20312032?view_full_work=true]] linkao3(20312032)

Comments: it's a hilarious crack fic. That's it. A few grammar errors and the authors forgetting what they named their characters but that's it. Solid 7/10.

  This is a mix of genres, first and foremost it is a 'Fix It' story. There are also hints of 'Muggles do it better', and more than a little crack, with the BDA being one of the most feared organizations on the planet, along with a bit of fun with Tom Riddle's 'You Know Who' pseudonym. Clell started it. I'm adding to it. I've taken it as far as I can. Feel free to write a sequel

** Literally just finished Harry Potter and the Fifth Element by Bexis1 (rated M) Its bloody good, but so very long, I'm a huge fan of epic length fics (theyrr all I read), but this one feels long and can be a slog to get through, you can feel that it took a decade to write, and it needs a sequel, it has an ending, and nicely concludes 6th year, but it needs the 7th year and a proper conclusion. Its the 2nd time I've read it though, so its obviously not terrible!

Now to decide what to read next, will have a good look through this thread for some inspiration!

** I just finished Fantastic Elves and Where to Find them! And its sequel Handbook of Elf Psychology. They are about Harry being abandoned by the Dursleys, and grows up finding a way of life by making deals with people to acquire stuff. He's also a Newt Scamander-like friend of nature and creatures, and it leads to quite a few hilarious moments.

** Recently read all the available chapters of linkffn(Stunning Shifts) which is a story where Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco and Zabini travel into an alternate universe where Voldemort wasn't defeated but just disappeared about when Harry was about to be born. The thing about the fic that stuck out to me the most will be the Phoenix story that evokes similar feelings as the tale of the three brothers and quickly and concisely delivers important information. Also this is the first time I have actually been interested in a Harry that grew up with his family. Most stories of this kind make the FamilyHarry way too perfect for CanonHarry to moan about but in this one both feel kind of lesser than the other one. FamilyHarry is actually troubled by just how much weaker, and dependent on his family he is compared to CanonHarry.

Am now reading both linkao3(Black Ink, Red Rose) about a Ginny that can't move on from her obsession with Tom even after the diary is destroyed; along with linkao3(Train to Nowhere) which is about a Harry that grows up in a world ruled by the Dark Lord ushering in a supposed golden age of pureblood supremacy.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

** I came across [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/67654/][illjwamh]]'s work yesterday; it does a really nice job of keeping everyone in character.

I now want to print out linkffn(Chapter 37 by illjwamh) and glue it into our copy of Deathly Hallows :).

linkffn(Sling Shots) is ongoing, though I'm not sure where the name came from, and is a decent Peggy Sue fic with Harry and Ginny both having traveled back. Several aspects of it reminded me of Nightmares of Futures Past (one of my favourites), such as Harry and Ginny being in contact from the time they meet on the platform.

** Title: The MARVELous Harry Potter

Author: evildaystar.ca

linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/13011075/1/The-MARVELous-Harry-Potter]])

The issue I have with 99% of crossovers, even the ones I like, is the meshing of the worlds. It niggles at me. There is always something I don't think meshes well. The MARVELous Harry Potter, in this regard. Is a pleasure to read.

It feels like a origin story. A natural addition to the original Avengers roster. For that reason alone, I would recommend it.

No character feels out of place. There is no weird bashing of Fury or Tony or Steve! No Gary Su either. Again, for that reason alone. I would recommend it.

The pacing is perfect. At no point, is the story bogged down by meaningless scene holders. Each part of the story plays into it's greater whole. The difference this makes, cannot be understated.

Harry himself is a joy. Characterisation is on point. Harry has come to the end of his arc, in the Harry Potter series. The extension of his character growth into the Marvel universe, is both believable and likeable.

At no point did I roll my eyes. For a crossover. A rare treat. Go and enjoy.

** linkffn(13230340) Harry is a Dragon, and That's OK. For anyone wondering, as I did, no, Harry's not a dragon animagus, he's literally a smaller, humanoid dragon. The Dursley's don't notice because of a spell the magical world uses to make muggles not notice dragons and other magical creatures. Wizards see him as a dragon and are shocked, but get over it fairly quickly. Not that far into it, but it's a funny and enjoyable story so far.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Last night I just finished reading Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia by arekay. It's the first time I read a story by this author. It starts the summer after the Goblet of Fire concludes. Harry is upset that no one is telling him anything. But instead of only getting angry his mind creates a conspiracy against him. He becomes so paranoid that when he hears the sound of apparition from an OOTP guard arriving he believes it's the beginning of a deatheater plot/attack so he takes off. His disappearance eventually leads to all the people who would be in harm's way from Voldemort's return (muggleborn, halfblood, and "blood traitors") to all leave the country. The story explores that aspect and winds it's way to how Voldemort is eventually handled.

Overall it was a good story, though it does include Dumbledore and some Weasley bashing. Since I liked the story I followed my usual procedure and went back to the authors page to check out their other stories.

I then read the author's drabble/oneshot collection called Harry Potter and the things that could have happened, which contains stories with a few interesting twists. It would be nice if the author would flesh some of these out but since the last update was in 2015 that's doubtful.

I then started reading the author's oneshot/abandoned story (since it wasn't marked complete) called Life Debts. In this twist of the genre the story tries to explain the golden trio's relationship especially how Hermione acts during her sixth year. The story ends (or was abandoned) with Harry taking some strong steps to handle the Horcrux hunt.

I then finished my night by starting to read (yes I'm both a voracious reader as well as a very fast one) the author's completed story called Lily's Changes. Premise is that Lily meets Harry at Kings Crossing instead of Dumbledore and lights into Harry for the actions that he has taken. The story is definitely in the Evil Dumbledore genre and so far has a different way of Handling Voldemort than I typically see. It's also a time travel fic as Harry goes all the way back to being a baby.

All told I like the author and it's a shame they are no longer writing (eg no signs of any current activity). Once I finish reading the last story I'll continue to follow my normal procedure and examine the favorite stories that this author likes and see if any of them strike my interest. The author doesn't list any favorite authors so I'll only have the favorite stories to check out.

*** I have great respect for you...

I tried my best to get through Lily's Changes after reading the author's other works, but I had to give up after a while. It's typical of most fics in the subgenre, but like those other fics, only 11-year-old me could stomach that.

**** Thanks. And Not a problem. I've always had a strong stomach. 😁

In a partial defense of the author it looks like it was the first long story the Author ever attempted and only the 2nd story they wrote (1st was only 6k). So I didn't truly expect great writing (in fact I almost never expect great writing so I'm pleasantly surprised if and when it does happen).

***** Good point. I'm not really one to talk, either. My first story (which, thankfully, I only planned to start posting once I'd completed it--- which never happened) was a rip-off of 'Harry Potter: Junior Inquisitor' where Harry was a Lord who didn't care about titles and used his position to become the epitome of Goodness (capitalisation is necessary) in Hogwarts and eventually, in Magical Britain. My first few drafts were complete with Anti-Dumbledore and all the associated cliche tropes before I discovered Reddit and 'saw the light'. That story has now been purged from my hard drive, but not from my memory, try as I might.

** Just finished linkao3(Come Once Again and Love Me). The prose quality - grammar, vocabulary, flow - is really excellent, showing that the writer really knows how to craft words, although I could have done without the amount of swearing.

As a Severus/Lily time travel fic, it reminded me a great deal of The Peace Not Promised, which I also read recently ([[/u/valleyofpeace][u/valleyofpeace]] have you read both?). However, Peace not Promised is four times the length, and slower paced. Furthermore, I felt like where The Peace Not Promised focused first on Severus' devotion to Lily, and second on his bitterness, prickliness, and general misanthropy, Come Once Again put them the other way around, such that Severus spends a lot of time keeping Lily at arm's length - while still being deeply concerned about her health and wellbeing. It emphasises his Occlumency and the resulting stifling of his emotions, with him frequently being closed off, much to Lily's frustration. They definitely don't fall back into old friendship as easily (Peace Not Promised still makes him work for it, but once Lily's convinced that his reform is genuine, she's thrilled to have her friend back).

I particularly liked how Come Once Again addressed the Marauders and the Whomping Willow incident. The impact of that day on Severus and all four Marauders - especially Remus and Sirius - could have been extremely serious or fatal, and canon never really followed up properly. It's also nice that it's complete (although Peace Not Promised is steadily updating and likely near the endgame).

*** Hi and thanks for paging me (first time getting paged yay) because come once again and peace not promised are both my #1 Sev/Lily fics!!!

Your description and analysis of the fic is just spot on. I personally liked the aspect where both Snape and lily had time travelled back, it really made the playing field a bit more equal than your usual time travel fic in the sense that both of them are their canon selves and their reconciliation happens in a different way.

Most of the time travel fics Snape always has this emotional baggage because he has done these terrible things but he even if he shares it with lily I don't think it's the same because lily has not lived through it. But in Come once again it's more of resolving the canon loose ends bwt Snape and lily and I absolutely love that, the author says it's more of a goodbye story and that's very true. I really loved the end of the story where they both realize their feelings it just punched me in the gut and made me wanna scream in joy honestly I wanted to read more of them together after that point.

I feel like in Peace not promised Snape digs down and works on correcting all the things he felt he did wrongly the first time around but in Come once again he more like moves on from it. And yes liked you said it felt good that come once again addressed that werewolf prank, it really highlighted how it should have been handled and it was quite an eye-opener for me.

Honestly reading this subreddit got me back into the hp fandom again and it's only this time around I'm reading all this wonderful sev/lily fanfics. I don't know if you've read this fic linkffn(In Another Life by MyPhoenixLament) but this is another one of my faves. It's not time-travel but it's more of a what-if scenario and also has muggle AU in it. It just made me feel really warm fuzzies in my heart gosh it's very comforting.

** Linkffn(Something Borrowed by it'slaterthanyouthink)

Rating: 10/10

Impressions: this is one of the best Hermione time travel fics I have ever read. The plot is spectacularly planned out and interwoven, and every character is meticulously shown to be full of their own faults. Many fics make Hermione out to be some sort of superwoman but here she suffers from maladies abundant and stays IN CHARACTER. Not to mention the way the author flawlessly integrates the older Snape with the younger, showing the differences age has wrought. And then back to the plot: so many twists I never saw coming, and I adore that though this is marketed as a romance of sorts it never stops with plot, plot, plot. I typically hate the snamione pairing but it is a very, very slow burn here, with an on/off sirimione to distract from it as well. The lestrange brothers make interesting characters here as well, and characterized in a way that is interesting and unique from other portrayals. I highly suggest taking a look at this fic; I'm obsessed with it!

** I've been on a Harmony fluff kick and am reading "Baby, It's Cold Outside" by Potato19. This all started when I read probably my now favorite fluff, "Picnic Panic" by LeQuin. I've always filtered out fics that were less than 40K words because I thought they wouldn't be complete or weren't fleshed out enough. I now know I did myself a great disservice by thinking so. However, I'm quite enjoying this new discovery.

How do I find the FanFiction.net ID numbers for stories on mobile? I will list what I've read in the last few days.

Edit: Thanks to [[/u/reddog44mag][u/reddog44mag]] for the formating help!

** A million years ago I read one with an alternate timeline/time turner situation where Harry was in Slytherin and Snape was his stepfather. Harry had grown up in Scotland and had an accent, and he ends up involved first with Hermione and then eventually with Ginny. I can't remember what it's called though and I haven't been able to find it again. I feel like towards the end Harry ended up having to go back to the original storyline. Does that ring a bell? I would love to read it again. Thx!

** Recently stumbled upon linkffn(Harry Potter and the Polymagus) and I'm pretty stunned it's not more popular. The prose is extremely solid and the worldbuilding is superb. As for the story, the premise of a more talented Lily and James Potter as well as an academically reworked Hogwarts already makes for an incredibly interesting story, but on top of that nearly every character is wonderfully competent and multifaceted.

Highlights for me include:\\
- Hagrid as an expert of wandless magic after getting his wand snapped\\
- Clueless Ron who happens to be very into classical philosophical logic and platonic idealized objects, etc.\\
- A Harry whose hard work is driven by realistic insecurities about living up to expectations, along with the pits and downfalls of such an outlook\\
- Really, /really/ weird house-elves. Like seriously befuddlingly funny.\\
- A single book title about werewolf rights by James and Lily, which is one of the best, most meaningful titles he could have thought of: "Twelve Nights a Year"

jlluh's probably best known for Geek of Magic, but his stories in general are incredibly charming and I can't recommend him enough.

** Title: Harry Potter and the Power He Knows Not Book 1 The Reluctant Champion

Author: ACI100

Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13160344/1/]]

Comments:

A fairly boring Harry/Gabrielle story to be honest. In fact it's not even a real Gabrielle story because she's two years older than Harry, so it's really Harry/Fleur except Fleur is still around and the author prefers Gabrielle. Why am I still reading? Because there are so few remotely decent stories about this couple and I wanted to see if this could be added to the list. Verdict? Nope.

The good:

It's reasonably well written. Not brilliant at first but the author admits that, and it definitely improves as the story progresses.

It doesn't fall into the usual Veela tropey nonsense, eg that Harry and Gabrielle are mates. Or the even worse trope that because they're mates they can start having sex at age 13 or something. The elements that could be described as tropey are different enough from usual not to be totally predictable.

The bad:

Harry is overpowered for no obvious reason. The author refuses to admit this in ANs but it's difficult to see how a Harry who's suddenly brilliant at potions, charms and transfiguration as well as being the school champion in DADA can be described as anything else.

Nothing challenges Harry. There's a thing at the start but that's pretty much breezed through, and of course the tournament is coming up but I fully expect that to be a breeze also.

Conclusion:

It's just about worth reading given the current dearth of any decent fanfiction.

I love how we get a better look into the characters. Cho, the Black family, and (briefly) Lily are given more of a spotlight here. There's a bit on the treatment of women by pureblood society, especially the Blacks, which I found interesting. Also, someone /finally/ does something about the Defense curse.

For once they use interesting, creative magic such as transfiguring Samurai rats, charming dummy's so that they follow your every command. Usually it's just expeliarmus and stupifie things that any muggle with a gun could achieve.

Also I get the impression that Harry is autistic and it just makes for the must optimistic version of Harry I've ever read.

** Highly recommend the Barbed Wire, Grass Crown series. The first one is complete and follows the rise of Tom Riddle at Hogwarts from the perspective of Amy Benson an OC. Really loved the first book, the characterisations are spot on. Tom is manipulative and cruel and Amy is loyal but pragmatic. The second book is different and a bit darker but with great pacing and continued excellent characterisation.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1628140][Barbed wire, grass crown]]

By the same author I recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14074770/chapters/32426100][In the language of flowers]] which is a brilliant AU of Petunia as a witch. It's the Sirius/Petunia pairing you didn't know you were missing....but with this Petunia it works perfectly. It's a coming of age/war/ love story. It just works and I wanted to reread it as soon as I finished.

** I just caught up linkffn(Fabula Post Bellum: A Potter Fanfiction) and its two sequels. I read a bit of the first book three years ago or so and didn't really like it, but it definitely held up on the second read.

It's a pretty Hogwarts-centric next-gen work that manages to do a lot with simple school conflict. Sometimes it can get slice-of-lifey, but there's always some historical context going on behind the scenes that's interesting, and the slow introduction of Gladius Leo is done really well. There's also a self-aware aspect that Hogwarts drama is stupid, /but it's a big deal to the kids anyway/ - I haven't seen many Hogwarts-centric fics that acknowledge this.

The fic's real strengths are the characters and their conflicts - they act like(smart) kids. While James and Albus are written well stick pretty closely to their fanon renderings, the OCs (Brynne, Serra, and Murphy in particular) are distinctive and their individual personalities come across in their dialogue, not weighty descriptions of their actions. The characters (particularly those three) change and mature noticeably through the first three years of the fic.

The Quidditch writing is stellar. The matches are really colorfully written, and the Quidditch team dynamics really feel like a throwback to a dysfunctional high school sports team, with petty conflicts popping up all over the place.

It's not a high-stakes suspense adventure like a lot of big next-gen fics, but it's worth reading just for the color and variety the author inserts into the story and characters.
