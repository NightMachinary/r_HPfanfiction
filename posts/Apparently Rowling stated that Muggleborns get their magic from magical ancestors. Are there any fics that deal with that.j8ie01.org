Relevant part:

KM: How exactly do muggleborns receive magical ability?

J.K. Rowling: Muggleborns will have a witch or wizard somewhere on their family tree, in some cases many, many generations back. The gene re-surfaces in some unexpected places.


** "So, through mum I'm a descendant of one of the darkest witches to ever live? Who brought down an entire kingdom and killed the ruling monarch at the time?"

"Yes, Harry."

***** Lol. I do hate it when Harry has all of these titles and stuff usually, but I don't mind Harry being called Harry (or Harrison if you wanna make it sound all pureblood-y) Potter-Black. It just makes sense that he inherits the Black name and forture. The Peverell title adds onto that, as well, if you want to add an extra thing. Or you could say the name was (forget the word) added into the Potter name so that's how the Potter's got their lordship or whatever? Then you can add Gryffindor on if you're doing a Founders thing or are shipping Harry with Tom who takes up the Gaunt and Slytherin titles.

****** His name is Harry, not Harrison or a shortened form for Harrison. Harry. Son of James and Lily, not Jamificus or Lilian.

Potter-Black is fanon, and bad fanon at that. Being a godfather doesn't always mean legal adoption, just guardianship, and even if he were adopted by Sirius, it's unlikely the name would be changed or hyphenated unless it were specifically requested and agreed to by both parties (and that'd be an in-story development, not something automatic by law or presumed by culture). Being an heir for money and property doesn't equal inheriting a name, too. If Titles were a thing, then yeah (we see precedence of this in real-life with the peerage), but they're not. It's just overused, terrible fanon that needs to be burned on the whole.

The Queen could drop dead after naming me her heir over her biological family, but I wouldn't be called "Blah Blah Windsor" or "Blah Blah Lastname-Windsor".

Peverell? Dead name from the past, and it ties back into much overused fanon "wizarding nobility". A historical curiosity and part of the background plot, nothing more.

Lordships? Again, bad fanon. There are no wizarding lordships or nobility outside of tropey fanon. The only canon "evidence" was one line on a tapestry from an inbred, incest-obsessed crazy family that came off as being more egotistic than an indication of being a "noble house".

Same deal with the "Marauders": it was called the "Marauder's Map", not the "Marauders' Map". As in a reference to their little friendship group's activities (no, not focused on 'pranking', but I have no doubt they enjoyed doing jokes on people). The latter implies the they called themselves the Marauders, as per fanon.

As for the Harry/Tom thing... eh, whatever floats your boat, I guess, but Gaunt and Slytherin "titles"? Fanon. Voldemort claims to be (and is) of Slytherin's (through Gaunt) lineage, but claiming the name? smh

I apologize if I'm being a bit condescending, but when people presume (bad) fanon is canon, it makes me wince on a deep level.

******* I know Harry's name is just Harry. I was just saying that some people (in fanfiction) want to make Harry sound all pureblood-y with titles and so they lengthen his name to Harrison or Hadrian. That doesn't mean I like it. I was just stating that.

I know that Potter-Black was fanon, I never said that it wasn't. And Sirius named Harry his heir, meaning that he gained the Black fortune. Sure, he may not be called "Potter-Black" because hyphenating isn't a thing with adoptions, but you can play around with it. And I don't really care about how titles work in real life (though I do try to stick close to it if I write fanfiction about it), but you could just say that Titles work differently in the wizarding world.

People who write about fanon know that it may not actually work that way. But guess what, it's fanon and fanfiction. We make it work. Just because you personally dislike Lordships, that doesn't meant that other people don't. I personally love it if it's done well enough, or even if it's cliche. It's a guilty pleasure of mine.

And no wories about sounding condescending, I'm sure I sounded a bit condescending in this comment and I apologize for that. I just wanted to state that I know that Lordships and the Marauders and the hyphenated names are fanon. I know the difference between fanon and canon most of the time.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

This interview essentially made it so that Squib is defined by having magical ancestors but having no ability to cast magic.

This in effect makes either (or both) of Lily's parents a squib.

Honestly, in the grand scheme of things, this is like Schrodinger's box. Every non-magical person is both a squib AND muggle at the same time. Until you "open the box" by checking their ancestry.
