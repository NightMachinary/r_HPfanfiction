Is someone stalking this post and downvoting every comment I make or what?


** I do not see a way for frank bryce to escape

*** Depends on where he went. He probably doesn't trust the local police over all the controversy he suffered through with the death of the Riddle family. Maybe he contacts MI5.

***** I don't know, but I'd imagine they'd be paying attention to certain keywords popping up in reports after the big todo in the 70s and 80s. Also, the only reason Bryce was spotted was because of Nagini. If the snake hadn't spotted him, it probably would have been easier for him to get away.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  In a dynamic system, two points, no matter how close they are to one another, will eventually be very far apart as long as there is a small difference between them. So when the Riddle's gardener decides to take action, how will that small change have a large impact on our favorite hero and the greater wizarding world? Rated T.

** I'm not really sure how that would work bc Pettigrew is at least marginally competent at murdering and the locals all think Frank Bryce is crazy. Even if the ministry was somehow contacted they don't seem to investigate muggle complaints very well, just apply obliviate.
