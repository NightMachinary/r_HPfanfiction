Any stories where instaed of a person talking normal, they instead talk like they have no space bar and all their words run together. More specifically, such characters in magical combat. I would think they could get off spells much quicker than a normal person, and simply overwhelm their opponent. Or just a motor mouth in general. Please and thank you.
