McGonagall in canon does nothing barring standing up to Umbridge about Harry becoming an Auror. She does nothing to curb Snape as well as doing nothing about the rather blatant bullying. Hermione on the other hand tends to be too forceful as well as slightly narrow-minded. I'll admit Harry in canon is rather unmotivated, but she tends to be somewhat hypocritical later on (Confunding McLaggen, then having the gall to complain about an annotated textbook). I'm a bit tired if seeing stories of them being perfect, but I also don't want extreme bashing.

** I prefer stories where instead, the characters are rewritten as realistic. Because McGonagall suffers from Plot, and also because she's written from a biased pov - an 11 year old's, in book one. She's seen through their eyes, and we're repeatedly told by them, that she's fair and strict. Except she's not, and if you look at it from any other House's perspective, she bent the rules for the first time in a century, and bought Harry an expensive broom. No other first year was allowed one, and Harry got on the team.

People like to complain about Lucius buying Draco a place on the team, but McGonagal did almost the exact same thing. I'd like to see Harry or Oliver go complaining to her about the Nimbuses, and have her point out that she bought Harry's.

Now let's see, suppose you are a teacher and a once in a decade/once in a century talent catches your eye? What will you do? Will you shape that talent as soon as possible or will you be let yourself bound by rules, regulations and bureaucracy?

It's not unfair to polish a raw talent and bend rules a bit for it, because in the end, both that student and the institute benefit. But it's certainly unfair to bend rules for an inept or ineligible to be in team solely because of childish rivalries. It neither benefits student (it infact spoils the student even more) nor the institution.

Not that I support McGonagoll, but there are better examples to point out her flaws. Like her teaching methods for example. She seems to encourage rote learning and memorising. As much as I hate to say this, it is the twins who are really applying what they learnt, not Hermione, although they shouldn't have crossed certain lines.

Or, how she blindly trusts Dumbledore in Ootp. Ignored safety concerns. Or her prejudice towards divination and encouraging Hermione's prejudice towards that subject. Just because Hermione doesn't have aptitude for divination, it is supposed to be wooly/trash. Just imagine what would have happened if Harry was able to identify the difference between Trelawney's real and fake prophecies.

Teenagers often unconsciously imitate adults. McGonagoll should have instead said that divination is only for those who have inner eye, it's not for everyone, instead of influencing many students with her prejudice.

  What if, in fifth year, Harry did just that? An independent Harry story with some OOC, no real bashing, but not a big fan of some of the big players. No pairings. Rating for some curse words. First attempt at publishing on this site... we'll see.

** Hermione also doesn't stand up to bullies! She insist that Snape deserves the title Professor, when in truth that guy is NOT teaching, he's writing recipes on the board every first year can do that! Hermione only stands up for herself, hell she tries to stop Harry and Ron from going after bullies and she looks away when Ron is the bully who uses his prefect's badge to confiscate stuff for himself (if I remember this right, I haven't read the books in a while and have only read fanfiction for years when it comes to HP!)

Abuses of power by the staff should be handled by the Headmaster, with her only filling in if he was indisposed.

Very little of it is logical or frankly believable when you look at it from the perspective of anyone who's not the same age as the characters (or when you've read it 3000 times and are actually analyzing it).

If we're going to talk about the shortcomings of the story, we do acknowledge that it goes against the story. That's why it's a shortcoming and we're discussing it.
