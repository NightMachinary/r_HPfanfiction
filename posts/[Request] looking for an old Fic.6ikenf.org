I'm trying to find an old fic that had Harry acquiring Dumbledore's memories through his wand (his wand prior to acquiring the Elder Wand) . The story goes on to Harry trying to fight Voldemort and figure out how the ministry became so corrupted. I'm pretty sure it ended with a fight in the Ministry itself with Voldemort being banished.

I'll try and put all of the details I remember here.

- Fawkes Gives Harry the Wand
- There's a suspension of Magical Travel that Harry tries to push the Minister (Scrimgour) into using (The Sound?)
- From what I remember the last scene is Voldemort fighting against the old kings in the Ministry and being run through and banished with... Sic Semper Tyranus? (I think)
- The First Chapter goes through Dumbledore meeting Grindlewald and their fight also Ariana's deaath.

I'd appreciate any help in finding it.


** linkffn(The one he feared by Taure) might be the one you are looking for. I haven't finished reading this but in the first chapter dumbledore does meet grindlewald

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.
