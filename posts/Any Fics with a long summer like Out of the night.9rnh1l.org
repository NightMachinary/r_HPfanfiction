The Majority of Out of the Night linkffn(12723942) takes place during the summer, with 29 out of 36 chapters dedicated to things that happened in the summer.

Are there any other fics with summers just as long?


** linkffn(HP and the Summer of Change by lorddwar) - classic Harry/Tonks with all the cliches that weren't cliche when that story was written

  COMPLETE! - PostOOTP, noHBP or DH. Harry finally grows up over a long difficult summer with a lot of help. Slow moving & Mature Themes. HPNT honks, maybe some HGRW but don't hold your breath. HarryTonks!

**** Is it any good or just the author's own rewrite of Summer of Change?

***** Hmm I found it ok. Not exactly a rewrite and in both case I was hoping for some sequel but never got my wish.

Sorry if I can't be more clear but it's been a while since I read them and I read too many other fics in the meantime

****** No worries, I actually just finished it. Definitely similar vibes as Summer of Change, but original enough to stand on its own and is clearly only inspired by it. It's not as well written but has plenty of unique ideas and I enjoyed it. I was also disappointed by the lack of a promised sequel but oh well.

  After 5th year, Harry takes charge of his own life. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war, and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Long, slower-paced fic. Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, NOT Evil!Harry, No Romance. -ABANDONED-

** The entirety of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations][Realizations]] linkffn(1260679) takes place during the summer between 4th and 5th year. It's abandoned, but most of the plot is wrapped up by the last chapter.
