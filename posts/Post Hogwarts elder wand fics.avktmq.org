LF any fics with an adult Harry that uses the elder wand, preferably with the plot surrounding the elder wand. Something like the subplot of Contractual Invalidation where a group of wizards attacks Harry in order to take the wand.

*** One of the better dark fics out there. Truly earns the Horror/Suspense tag

This is a really good start to finish fic which does explore the Elder Wand, the other hallows, and some of the metaphysics of death as well as dealing with the post war political scene.

*** It's one of my greatest fanfic-related wishes that the author will eventually come back one day and finish this story. There's enough there for it to be more than worth the read, I'd say enough that the story has a compelling climax and even a resolution, but I'd really like to see the loose ends tied up.

Also, a note for anyone just finding this fic: ffn only has chapters 1-45. There is a chapter 46, which was originally posted to the now-defunct porkey.org. However, you can find that chapter here: [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/8073/46]]

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?
