There are 3 ways I can think of where someone has post Hogwarts education in fanfiction.

The first is the mastery, which is either done via some sort of college, or is just another name for an apprenticeship, with oversight.

The second is guilds. I've rarely seen it, but it has potential.

The third are straight up apprenticeships. This actually seems the most canon.

Which do you guys like or follow?


** Personally, I enjoy the mastery and apprenticeship path mainly because I can see some basis in canon first like you said.

For mastery, I can certainly see the Auror programs as qualifying for this, considering you require further training like both McGonagall and Tonks state in OOTP. You'd likely even have to shadow a senior Auror, sort of like in the police force, which could qualify you as an 'apprentice' of sorts, or mastery even (give the definition of 'apprenticeship with oversight'). Healers too could fit into this, considering they likely have to also undergo additional training in order to be fully qualified, even if we don't know much about what they have to do after getting their NEWTs. If Healers operate similar to our own doctors, they'd have their own 'residency', which is like an apprenticeship in its own way.

I have seen apprenticeships more in fanfiction to be honest, but I haven't actually found any fanfics with guilds yet. Do you have any good ones you recommend that explore them?

*** I really don't. linkffn(Defiance) has guilds, but it's poorly done (also the most cliche Daphne Greengrass in existence).

I've read a couple others over the years, but I can't for the life of me remember. One had guilds like unions. The other was the Dark Lord's equal, which used it as a throwaway line.

I lean towards the apprenticeship being the best route of Post Hogwarts education, although having guilds be like unions also seems neat.

  Memories are tricky things. Sometimes, they cause us to lose nights of sleep. Sometimes, they bring light to darkness. Sometimes, they change the course of destiny. Set after the events of Fourth year. Follow Harry Potter as he finds his way across his strange problems, his notoriety and of course, the resurrected dark lord trying to kill him. AU. Powerful! Harry, Harry/Daphne.

**** Okay! I'll check out the fanfic regardless, but ugh cliche Daphne Greengrass. And yeah, apprenticeship definitely has more weight and presence in canon to say the least.

** Mastery via apprenticeships are the only version I've seen for post-Hogwarts education, but I'd love to see a stoner-comedy fic about the HP crowd attempting to party their way through college degrees.

*** There's nothing lighthearted unfortunately, although zArkham has something and someone has a fic where Harry is a fake like Lockhart.
