I'm looking for a Rational thinker Fanfiction with Draco Malfoy as the main character.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Like this one.]]

Is there any other Fanfiction where Draco Malfoy is an intelligent villian, and he replaces Voldemort? Or a Fanfiction where a dark wizard causes a war against the muggles?


** I don't have any stories to recommend, however you should also consider asking this question in [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and [[/r/hpmor][r/hpmor]].

** Not with Draco, no. Many fics give him a general competence and proactiveness upgrade, but they tend to be Dramione focused on the romance and little else. Perhaps linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19) might count.

linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew) is what HPMOR /should have been/, in my opinion, but that one features Hermione as the protagonist. (Theo Nott and Tracy Davis may be considered intelligent villains in that one; Draco isn't really on the radar.)

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  Chaos: when the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future. One gene varies, one neuron fires, one butterfly flaps its wings, and Draco Malfoy's life is completely different. Draco has always found a certain comfort in chaos. Perhaps he shouldn't. Featuring Genius!Draco.
