Hey guys, I'm looking for a dramione where Draco and Hermione's relationship moves excruciatingly slow, and where Draco doesn't just suddenly become nice. I'm not looking for headboy/headgirl fics, veela fics, or marriage law. I prefer post-hogwarts. I was thinking something akin to We Learned the Sea by luckei1 (at least in pacing). I've already read The Fallout, Isolation, and most akashathekitty fics. Would love to see your suggestions :)


** linkffn(2603288) , Water by kissherdraco, basketcase by attica, Parade of the sun by sage (you probably already read this, same author as fallout but if not...lucky you!) , god of the lost by gravidy (hard to find, incomplete but amazing), and Adamo Fidelitas on hpadultfanfic.

  The Ministry takes action against the remaining prejudice in the wizarding society and asks Hermione for help. “What do you want? Money? Power? Name your price, Granger. I'm not about to let pride get in my way when an Azkaban sentence is on the line.”
