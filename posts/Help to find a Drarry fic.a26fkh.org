Hi y'all .... I read a fic some time ago that was about Draco being cursed/in a coma and forced into a ghost-like state that only Harry can see. Harry then has to find a way to free him or something- It was on ao3 but I can't seem to find it anywhere ;-; If you know the title or author, please comment! I've been looking for it for ages.


** Is it perhaps [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378][Running on Air]]?

*** He isn't only apparent to Harry in In Pieces, but it is one of the first Drarry fics I read and really liked the characterizations in it, highly recommend to anyone who hasn't read it
