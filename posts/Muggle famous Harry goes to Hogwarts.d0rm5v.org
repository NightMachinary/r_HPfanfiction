A Harry Potter that enters the wizard world already knowing how to deal with fame because he was already famous for something in the muggle world. Maybe he was a famous child musician or an artist or something similar. I read one fic (I can't remember the name) about a femharry who became a rather famous child model so wasn't really fazed by the "girl who lived!" non-sense that they threw at her when she found out she was a witch.

On a side note: A musician/artist Harry that learns to use musical instruments or whatever art he makes use of to create a new form of magic would be rather cool but is also unrelated to the request at hand.


** There was a story, where he somehow partnered with Microsoft and introduced some super successful computer game, so when he came to Hogwarts and there was the Sorting Scene, it was not only magical-raised who were shouting “*THAT* Harry Potter?”

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

** I remember reading a fic where the Dursley drop off at an orphanage, then adopted by a celebrity couple. He was basically a accessory to them "We adopted an orphan look at us". So he is pretty used to dealing with people with ulterior motives. Though the title escapes me.

*** I did find one set in a more modern era. (Jumped ahead 20 years. In canon Harry was born in 1980, in this story the twins were born in 2000) linkffn(12918161)

It's another femharry fic. It's also a 'wrong girl who lived' fic. Belladonna Potter gets sent to the Dursleys then to an orphanage. She gets adopted by her ice skating coach. She eventually becomes a minor internet celebrity (with a vlog and everything). Hermione recognizes her immediately due to talent shows and internet searches.

Lots of Potter bashing though. In fact James and Lily go to Azkaban and Prunella Potter, who is fantastic at Quidditch (she plays professionally by the time she starts Hogwarts) but awful at everything else, is basically the 'light' version of Draco...

  Karma is real. It's a lesson that many have to learn the hard way. James and Lily Potter made the biggest mistake of their lives. The daughter they abandoned was more than they thought, and she becomes everything they wanted her twin to be. Belladonna Potter has her own plans for her future and no one will stand in her way. Hard work forever pays. A/N:fem!Harry, Wrong-GWL, Tomarry.

***** Harry performs magic before Hogwarts and has a channel dealing with 'magic' where he uses magic on camera but it's easily explained away with the excuse of 'camera magic' and while people think that it's amazing to watch most think that his videos are well-done but fake skits.

  What if Harry had been born Kali Potter? What if Kali had been beautiful? What if Kali learned how to use that beauty as a weapon at a very young age? What if her work as a child model meant that Kali was already used to some fame? The Wizarding World gains a powerful young femme fatale in the making who won't allow herself to be used as a sacrificial lamb. FemHP/?
