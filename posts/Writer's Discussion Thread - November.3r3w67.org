** It's been literal years since I've written anything, but all of a sudden I've been on a big HP fanfic kick. Nothing's completely satisfied me in terms of what I wanted to read, so I have half a dozen stories going on in my head! I think I'll have to start putting figurative pen to paper (fingers to keyboard really) to work some drabbles out and then hopefully I can string them along together in a coherent story...

** I finally got my fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]] going with Ginny at Hogwarts and actively doing stuff that we don't already see in canon, so it's getting a lot more fun to write. But this month I'm hoping to start on a new story that's been bugging me, and I'm worried about juggling the two. I definitely won't abandon any, of course, but this new story is distracting me so much that I can barely focus - I need to write it down.

*** Ooh, exciting on both fronts. Any details about the new story?

I write too slowly to justify writing many long new stories and that hasn't changed for as long as I've been writing, but writing two stories at once was very helpful, especially because they were quite different. They challenged me in different ways and I don't think I would've improved as much if I only stuck to one.

At some point, it's more distracting not to write something new down. Then at another point, it's more distracting to have too many stories waiting for updates :p

**** Aww thanks :) Yes, I want to look at the time from the Potter's death to Sirius's arrest - it was my boyfriend's idea actually, but I think it would be exciting to write! I know it's not an especially popular opinion round these parts but I'm a huge stickler for canon, and much prefer to do missing moments than AU or completely OC characters. But this story would let me get away from Hogwarts which would be nice, because I don't particularly enjoy writing school life.

You're so right about the distractions - I don't want it to get to the point where it feels like a chore or that I'm under too much pressure, but I don't want to be that person that abandons their fic. I try to aim for one or two updates a week.

******* Maybe some confirmation bias is at play, because I thought I heard the opposite more often - that fic is worse for not being canon-compliant - and I prefer stories that explore/twist new ideas. I only take issue with people who think fanfiction /has/ to be a certain way to be better, whether it's canon-compliancy or canon-fixing. It looks like there's a healthy audience for both? :D

I meant for the chapter to be longer, but it works out better stopping there, so I'm still happy with it. Less pitchforks than I was expecting /author worries

My goal for this month is to finish what's left, sans epilogue, and then finish that in December. I just edited a huge chunk as well, so I'm /slightly/ less cringey about the whole beginning. Probably going to work on updating my stories across three archives today. edit: good lord, ao3 tags.

** I'm in a bit of a slump. In order to set up my story properly, I have a lot of stuff to write that isn't really exciting. I've already omitted the first 2 years of Harry at Hogwarts and explained it in flashbacks, news articles and snippets of conversations instead, but still...

It starts just after Harry rescued Ginny from the Chamber, but Harry is in Slytherin, so their friendship still needs to develop, and it's important for the story.

So now I'm itching to get on to the action (and there's going to be A LOT of it), but I've still got to write and develop things before I get get on to the good stuff. And I'm a very impatient person, so that's why I'm in this slump.

** 2015 was so awful that it trampled all over my concentration and my ability to participate in fandom, which means I haven't written anything but occasional hand-jotted notes for an entire year. I'm not pleased with myself, but I feel weirdly insecure about pulling out my stories and continuing as if shit never happened. It's a strange sort of reluctance spiked with self-doubt. Or maybe not so strange; maybe just neurotic.

And there are so many things I want to work on! Should I sign up for severus_fest on LJ and bang out a fic for the mod, who's a wonderful contributor to Snape fandom and largely alone in her devotion to her favorite pairing? She is incredibly talented and generous, and I want to give her a gift designed expressly to make her happy. Or should I finish the Snape/McGonagall canon-compliant fic I had planned to write for minerva_fest before my life went down the toilet? The mod for that fest is another of my favorite people, and I want to give her something good, preferably something that will deliver an emotional wallop. Besides, assuming I can pull it off, it has the makings of a decent fic.

Except, my OTP is Snarry! And most of my readers are Snape/Harry fans who are patiently waiting (if they're even still around) for me to get back in the saddle and continue my WiPs. Do I polish up the next chapter of my epic, self-indulgent romance "The Blood of Stars"? Or should I post the next chapter of my AU dysfunctional relationship with bonus amnesia, "Impossible Without It"? Does it matter? (Probably not.) Should I stop dithering and write whatever the hell comes out of my keyboard? (Yes.)

Two things I should probably /not/ be doing are hanging around on subreddits or scouring AO3 for fics I haven't read yet. What's the best cure for procrastination? A friendly boot in the arse? The realization that the clock's ticking and my fandom friends will soon be jumping ship?

Anyway, loads of luck to my fellow NaNo-ites. Even if you don't make it to 50K, all word counts are good counts, IMO.

I do miss the late lamented WriSoMiFu community, aka Write Something, You Miserable Fucks. Now /there's/ what I would call a good kick in the pants.

And on that note...

*** Cheering for you to write /whatever you can/. If you're itching to complete something, throw yourself at the shortest thing you think you can finish.

Writing exhausts me; it drains me in the same way comforting a distraught friend would. I'm tapping into stressful situations and stressed characters and I'm carrying their emotional debt. I try to remember that my writing block isn't just from an inability to spit out words but that it's actually fighting for my everyday mental/physical energy and I can be just /too tired/ to write, and I have to take time for that. My writing side will still be super cranky, but knowing that relieves some of the guilt for me.

My last chapter was my first update in six months (and the one before that was a year wait) and readers are saying they're so glad I came back and I don't think they know how happy I am that they came back. Whoever is waiting, most of them will still wait longer for you.

** I'm trying to get back into the writing swing. I've been on a bit of a break since August. I have a couple of novellas that I'd like to get done by the end of the year and started this year short story about Nott Sr playing around with the fanon I see that everyone has of him. I don't know why, but in every fanfiction I've ever read him in, it's implied that he killed his wife.

** I have far too many ideas popping into my head right now that I'm not actually getting much of anything finished.

The Witcher crossover I was talking about in the last thread is still going well, at about 7000 words into the first chapter. I even managed to make headway into the next chapter of humour fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9121877/1/Midnight-Blues][Midnight Blues]].

But, here comes the bad part; I've at least six different ideas for fairly lengthy one-shots, two of which are HP-related:

The first one takes place in a post-apocalyptic world in which Harry didn't defeat Voldemort (though Voldemort is /not/ in power in this fic). Ron and Hermione are dead, or are presumed dead, and Harry's been wandering around the wasteland like a living wraith for the past fifteen years, unable to cope with his inability to save the world or his friends. He eventually gets his chance at redemption when he passes by a wasteland border town and meets a girl named Rose, who happens to look a lot like his lost friends, and is treated poorly by the people she works for. In a moment of rare human compassion, he offers to take her with him, and they make way across a desolate Europe to a supposed promised land for magicals somewhere in Russia. So, I guess you could call it a road trip fic between Harry and Rose; if road trip fics were ever inspired by The Road Warrior.

But then, there's also the second idea, which stars James Potter as the main character, a first for me. It's an AU in which only Lily dies in Voldemort's attack on Godric's Hollow, and James is able to keep Harry. Fast forward three years to 1984, and James is back at the Ministry of Magic, working as an Auror. When a routine intelligence operation goes awry, James makes a chilling discovery: someone within the leadership at the Ministry of Magic, and with a head full of British secrets, has turned traitor, and has possibly joined a shadowy HUMINT network belonging to a wizard who could possibly be the next Dark Lord. Partially inspired by my love of Cold War-era spy flicks, this fic features James juggling finding a mole, his almost irreversibly fractured relationships with friends and family, and being a good father to a four year-old child celebrity.

That's not even getting into the non-HP ideas.

Just tell me the ideas suck or something so I don't feel compelled to write these two and can focus on Midnight Blues. Pls halp.

Maybe try to dissuade yourself by thinking about all the slow, boring transitional parts you're going to have to write for these fics, too. As cool as James' chilling discovery is, what about filler chapter 13 (edit: or the filler section 5000 words in -- just noticed these were oneshots)? Those ideas are only worth it if you can imagine yourself writing through the sloggiest parts too.

As for the sloggy parts, well, therein is the problem. I wanted to write these to see if I can embrace brevity over wordiness, so these two are meant to be really lengthy one-shots (20-30K), but short fics overall. I can't exactly imagine slogging through filler chapter 13, when there isn't going to be a filler chapter.

***** Ideas always sound cool because there's no actual writing commitment yet ;) when there's writing, I'll judge. You might post it as a single chapter, but lengthwise, it'd be a novella if it were published. Even if there weren't a chapter 13, you're surely going to find yourself thinking through some necessary parts that you don't really want to write halfway through; or a very tricky part you can't explain without sitting down and thinking for a week. If you really love the idea that much or have everything down pat, then I'd say go for it. But think of it as proposing to your idea for the rest of your life (because if you don't finish it, it will hang over you for what feels like the rest of your life :p). Once you put a ring on it...
