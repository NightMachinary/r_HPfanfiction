I'm trying, somehow, to build a timeline of life of some characters. Since Pottermore isn't much help, I ask for this information from fan fiction (more or less, I imagine there are many versions)

In which year were these characters born?

- Avery II
- Regulus Black
- Alecto Carrow
- Crabbe Sr.
- Barty Crouch Jr.
- Antonin Dolohov
- Goyle Sr.
- Igor Karkaroff
- Radolphus Lestrange
- Rabastan Lestrange

-Walden Mcnair - Mulciber - Nott Sr. - Augustus Rookwood - Selwyn - Travers - Corban Yaxley


** Look at the wikia, and its references. You will not get an better answer than that here.

** Nott Sr. I believe was in the same graduating class as Tom Riddle so he'd be born between 1925-1926

** I think Regulus is a year younger than Sirius and the other marauders.

*** I tried to do the math on this once for a FF of my own.

If Regulus was born Nov. 1960-Aug. 1961, he'd be one year behind the Marauders and could graduate Hogwarts before his death.

Otherwise, if he was Sept. 1961 or later (and two years behind), he went to the Cave before he graduated.

FWIW, the tapestry says '61 for him.

** Regulus is mentioned to be two years younger than Sirius, so his year of birth would come somewhere between late 1961 to early 1963.

Mulciber and Avery, from the way Lily talks about them, are in their year, so either 1960 or 1959.

Bellatrix was born in 1951, and if we're making the assumption that her marriage with Rodolphus was an arranged marriage (not the marriage contract nonsense), then his year of birth would be at least 2-3 years ahead of hers. Preferably 3-4. So around 1947.

*** Regulus is shown on the Black family tree given by JKR to be born in 1961. I don't see how you could come up with him being born in the early 1963 even if it had been said that he was two years younger than Sirius (which isn't the case).

** Probably 62 for Barty, maybe 61. 1981 - 19 = 1962 ("no more than nineteen" - Sirius)

Depends on the months and the exact date of his trial.
