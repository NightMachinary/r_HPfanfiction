Are there any good stories where Magic and Technology have been blended? Something like the last few chapters of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264843/1/Harry-Tano][Harry Tano]]. Also stories where magic is very advanced like the last few chapters of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards.]] I am specificlly looking for stories where the whole society has it not just Harry running around with a super space ship. Bonus points if the story is about the tech changing.


** I don't have any specific in mind but to point you in the right direction, look for Harry Potter and Tony stark Fanfics. not where it is Harry Potter and advengers crossover
