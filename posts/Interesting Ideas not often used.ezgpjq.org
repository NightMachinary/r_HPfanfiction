What are some fascinating ideas you've stumbled across in Harry Potter fanfiction that are woefully underused? The idea for me that I keep coming back to is goblin's power coming not from a pile of gold, but from the exchange and movement of gold. They are not dragons, nor dragonkin.


** What I'd refer to according to the first instance I saw of it: Lily Potter Clinics

Basically, somebody realizes that the Statute of Secrecy probably won't last forever, so they start finding ways to use magic to help Muggles without revealing it to Muggle society. Thus, when wizards are eventually discovered they've already got a history of secretly helping out to point to rather than the history they'd have in canon of Muggle-baiting and Death Eater attacks.

I think I've seen it twice, maybe three times overall, but the first was in the form of the Lily Potter Clinics which used magic to treat children that were beyond the help of Muggle medicine, explaining it as "experimental therapies" or "traditional herbal remedies" and modifying (with consent) the memories of the families that they helped.

*** I like any fic that doesn't assume all wizards are idiots when it comes to Muggles - there has to be some sort of contingency plan for when (not if) the SoS is irreparably broken.

**** It's definitely a "when". At this point, unless there are some skilled technomancers at Mahoutokoro using web daemons to clean up evidence, wizards doing dumb sh*t in front of Muggles would be all over YouTube if Potterverse-style wizards were real. That's actually one of the best reasons not to time-shift events in a fic forward, since even 5-10 years later there'd have been way too many cameras for there to NOT be footage of Death Eater attacks during the second war.

** All magic has a price, and the price for Horcruxes is that you literally cannot take the “grain of sand in the ocean” route. A Horcrux has to be an item of some significance to you, and must be in a place with significance to you, and Fate/Magic will ensure that both those conditions are met without the creator of the Horcrux even realizing that they SHOULD toss their Horcrux in the middle of the Atlantic.

** I've always loved the idea that it is the movement of metals in general that gives goblins their magic, as it explains why they are an warrior race as war is not but the crashing of tides of metal against one another

** Entrepreneurship and money making projects. Not just inherit millions of galleons and dozens of titles, but actually earn them by inventing and selling stuff. And I mean not prank items (because seriously, the market for prank items in a tiny population like wizarding Britain can barely be large enough for a single shop) but mass producable items that everyone wants.
