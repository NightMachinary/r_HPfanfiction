Preferably at least 10,000 words. Ratings don't matter. Drarry, Snarry, TomRiddle/Harry, Barty/Harry, etc


** - /[[http://www.silververse.net/hp/hp.htm][Tissue of Silver]]/, by [[http://www.silververse.net/][Fearless Diva]]. Harry/Draco; rated R. Been a while since I read it, but basically, Harry must protect Draco from those who want him dead. Very funny. Snape is perfect as Draco's snarky mentor. Starts with /Tissue of Silver,/ and there's a sequel, plus quite a few "deleted scenes," oneshots, etc. from the universe.

- /[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2493456/1/Bond][Bond]]/, by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/852780/Anna-Fugazzi][Anna Fugazzi]]. Harry/Draco; rated M. Harry and Draco are forced into a magical love bond. Wonderfully written, funny, realistic, and memorable. Check the author's page for more Bondverse fic, more Drarry, and other slash stories. Very talented writer.

- /[[http://hd-inspired.livejournal.com/61407.html][Ain't No Friend of Mine]]/, by [[http://lettered.livejournal.com/][Lettered]]. Harry/Draco; rated PG-13. Draco is transformed into a dog. No bestiality, no animal romance, nothing like that. Quite a romp. Fun, silly, sweet, heartwarming, etc., etc.

- /[[http://www.hdhols.com/sesheta_66.html][100 Ways to Heal Your Wizarding Woes]]/, by [[http://who-la-hoop.livejournal.com/36941.html][who_la_hoop]]. Harry/Draco; rated NC-17. Hilarious. Plenty of Snarky Mentor Snape (the only kind of Snape I can stand). Check author page for more well-written comedic Drarry.

- [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/authors.php?no=646][SilentAuror]]. Nice writing, solid plots, and excellent characterization. I've only read /Walking the Line/, /Allegiance and Sedition/, and /On the Wings of the Storm/ (all Harry/Draco, rated X) but they were all phenomenal and I recommend them highly. Mostly Harry/Draco, but plenty of slash pairings are represented.

Check out [[http://painless-j.net/blog/hp-recs/][painless_j's recs]]. (S)he has good taste, and I've never gone wrong with anything that's been recommended there. [[http://epic-recs.livejournal.com/][Epic Recs]] has quality, novel-length fics of any sort from any fandom, but there's a healthy amount of slash in there, and the recs are nice and thorough.

** Have you read Sacrifices arc? It's Drarry pairing and starts first year and goes up. It's the best fan fiction I have ever read. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave]]

Saving Connor is the first book.
