** The problem with time-travel fics in general is that, for the most part, everything is instantly solved with even a little bit of thought put into it.

I can't imagine a time travel fix with 4 closely tied people being more than a chapter long without resorting to some kind of AU dues ex machine.

Which is fine, obviously, but not many people write Draco into the Golden Trio without him being a direct replacement for someone. Let alone time travel fics where you increase the complexity of the story by a few factors by bringing back more people.

*** I see. That makes me sad now. But it would had been fun, and i was going for a new AU. Because staying close to canon isn't my thing. I prefer the real books for that. Thanks for the reply anyway.
