** See every shitty independent!Harry fic. Interestingly enough, those are also the fics where he is condescending, rude and plain idiotic.

** I can't think of specifics but I think the Harry in linkffn(a new kind of normal by brilliantlady) is like that. He doesn't stand up to the dursleys because he doesn't have the power to do that without being punished but he mediates a lot of conflicts between friends who are being unintentionally condescending to each other.

That's all I can think of that falls under 'makes the person being an arse realize they're being an arse' because usually people who are being douchebags are gleefully aware they're being rude and don't actually need it to be pointed out.

  Harry doesn't want to learn magic or go to Hogwarts -- he just wants to be normal, like the Dursleys. But a meddling, crazy old wizard won't take "no" for an answer. Harry might have to learn how to be a normal wizard instead - but will he learn from Light wizards or pure-blood friends? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore. Complete. Part 2 of "Perfectly Normal".

** I love a fic where the 1/2bloods and muggleborn push back. Starfox5 writes that sort of story well.

*** To be honest, the three biggest jerks in canon Books were all Halfbloods: Voldemort, Umbridge, Snape

Draco was a nasty taunter, but he got his shares of pain too: mauled by Buckbeak, punched by Hermione, bat-bogeyed by Ginny, gang-hexed on the train, sectumsempraed by Harry...

In Book 6, it was mentioned repeatedly that Voldemort's minions mainly consisted of Halfbloods. Only his inner circle was made of dark Purebloods.

In the DA, ironically, Purebloods made up at least 50% of the original 30 members. This was higher than their demographic representation in magical Britain (JKR once mentioned 30% Purebloods, 50% Halfbloods, and 20% Muggleborns).

**** On a random note, do you happen to have the link to the thing where she said that's how they are all split?

I'm asking because I'm kind of curious, what with the fact that we didn't really see many muggleborns in the series proper so I'd thought there'd be maybe a few percent of them tops.

** u/Deathcrow:

  or Harry just stands there like a slack-jawed moron for no reason at all and says nothing, or simply goes the route of "NO U" instead of coming up with a rational/logical/in any way coherent response?
#+end_quote

Weird, I always see the exact opposite: Harry yelling at everyone for daring to question him and absolutely incapable of forming alliances.

I'd actually like to see more fics of what you describe... The meek Harry from Canon can be quite annoying but fanfic seems to overcompensate by making him an unbearable, self-righteous, snot towards anyone else.

**** Okay maybe meek is the wrong word, he's just so bipolar in canon. He let's people walk all over him until it's too late and then he blows a gasket. His unproductive outburst towards Dumbledore after 5th year being the perfect example. It wouldn't have to have happened like that if he stood up for himself more.

***** Harry is subtly quite snarky in canon. Even if he doesn't say anything, he's pretty sarcastic in his thoughts.

I see a lot of fanon Harry that allows himself to be pushed around, particularly by Hermione. A lot of interactions that go:

--------------

"HARRY!" screeched Hermione, "Are you saying you haven't finished that essay? It's due in a week!"

"Err, " Harry mumbled sheepishly, scratching the back of his head, "I have started, but I've been busy, you know? Preventing the collapse of society as we know it."

"That's no excuse to neglect your schoolwork!" Hermione retorted tartly.

"BLOODY HELL!" bellowed Ron, for no apparent reason other than that's what he does in fanfiction.

--------------

In fanfiction, Harry seems to exist in extremes. He's either a complete push-over or he flies off the handle at the smallest provocation. What I assume the OP wants is a story where he's more balanced. Maybe not a complete jerkass, but willing to stand up for himself and say "Hermione, I will finish the essay in time but I really have other things I want to work on right this minute."

I have seen stories where a character (usually Hermione, because she's Harry's de facto nag) complaining about how he's not doing schoolwork, but at the same time urging him to give 100% to studying occulemency/sword fighting/dueling/mastering the language of the orcs. It's unreasonable and I always end up annoyed on Harry's behalf and wish he would just ONCE tell her to shut up and let him get one task done with before he has to start another.
