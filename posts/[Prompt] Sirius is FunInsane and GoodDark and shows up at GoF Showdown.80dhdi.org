Like, instead of wallowing in self-pity/misery and/or going on Vacation, Sirius decides to wreak vengeance on Voldemort & Death Eaters. He does this with a combination of Dark Magic (the Black family legacy) and typical Marauder sass. (NO SLASH, PLS)

I thought someone could have fun with this, I guess.

Suggestions:

- Sirius knows about the Horcruxes - he /was/ raised by the Black family, remember?
- [EDIT]: Or, yeah, he could read about them in a letter from Regulus or something?
- Sirius plays 'Back in Black' when he gatecrashes the GoF Harry vs Voldemort showdown
- He mobilizes the contents of Grimmauld Place, including the doxies and boggarts and various cursed items
- Kreacher is Sirius' Sidekick/Commander, who organizes the doxies and boggarts and cursed items and shouts 'For Master Regulus!' as he enters battle
- Kreacher uses the Locket to block a Killing Curse (preferably aimed at Sirius or Harry), removing the Horcrux.
- maybe Sirius could be held at wandpoint by Tommy Boi, before he grins and portkeys away, leaving behind his robes which promptly attempt to strangle Voldemort?
- Sirius just kinda casually takes a knife and cuts Harry's scar out from his forehead, before burning it with Fiendfyre or something.
- Sirius uses a sex-change ritual on Lucius Malfoy mid-battle. He is, after all, a pissed-off opportunistic prankster.
- [EDIT]: Unintentional Political Ramifications of the previous? Marriage to Narcissa gets annulled, with the Malfoy Fortune going with her. She moves to Australia with Draco.
- Remus takes advantage of the chaos to get his revenge on Snape (for treatment of Harry and the revealing of his secrets), and frames Sirius.
- Harry isn't sure whether or not it counts as kidnapping.
- Dumbledore and The Order show up to the Death Eater battles. By the third one, they start bringing popcorn.
- Amelia Bones is very glad Sirius is no longer an Auror - less paperwork for her.
- Sirius very publicly fighting and/or humiliating Death Eaters over the course of the War brings his PR status from 'Voldemort's Right Hand Man' to 'Harasser of Upstanding Citizens' to 'War Hero'.
- Sirius either introduces himself as 'The Dogfather', 'Padfoot the Majestic', or 'Voldemort's Girlfriend... get it? Cuz they say I'm his /Right Hand/?'
- Sirius teaches Harry the ways of non-stop inappropriate jokes. Remus teaches Harry how to incorporate subtle innuendo into natural and formal speech patterns. Only them, Hermione, and Tonks actually ever notice the latter.
- Harry learns to be an Animagus. Probably some kinda mongoose.
- Hermione, if she is a major character, should probably be the classic 'book-focused to the point of bribable, going to beat you up if you don't move from between her and the library, has a full understanding of Soviet torture methods, frighteningly competent whenever she gets her nose out of her reading material which does not exactly happen too often' type Hermione featured in many crackfics. Most other forms of her tend to be annoying or blatantly OOC.
- Sirius and Remus have matured beyond considering 'haha lets turn them pink and then roll on the floor laughing' as a prank. They'll turn them pink, but they'll use it as a mild irritant rather than the whole joke, ya know?
- Sirius will go to unheard of lengths, just for an opportunity to make a pun.

EDIT: Split up a few of them into multiple suggestions, added #2

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), Sirius is totally a Death Eater, along with Hagrid and Trelawney. As for Hermione:

#+begin_quote
  "Obviously," she huffed. "I'm just threatening to report that she's an illegal animagus. I also kept her in a bottle for a while."

  I frowned. "For how long?"

  "A couple of days," Hermione said.

  "Did you feed her?" I asked.

  Hermione paled. "It didn't really occur to me."

  "You gave her water at least..." I said.

  "Um..."

  I shook my head, caught between admiration and shock. "And now you're blackmailing her? I don't know why you didn't just kill her quickly. It would have been kinder."

  I have a great distaste for most forms of torture. My only exception to this is Crucio, which is much cleaner and does not have as many long-lasting side effects. Well, unless the victims are driven insane. I rarely kept prisoners long enough to reach that point, however, and opted to kill as often as possible. Further, I sought to never leave a child orphaned for more than a few minutes.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

  Remus sighed. "Padfoot, I thought you said you wanted /me/ to make your 'Fighting Death Eaters' playlist."

  Sirius nodded slowly and gestured at his friend. "Yea, and you're doing it, but I want 'Back in Black' as my intro every time, you know? It's ironic. It's fitting. It's funny. It's-"

  "It's beating a dead horse is what it is, Padfoot."

  "C'mon, Moony, I'm /Sirius/! That's what I do /best/!"

  Remus groaned and edited the playlist.

**** Yes, but a Killing Curse does not destroy anything, it just kills you /without any physical damage/, which obviously only works on organic beings (Killing Curses didn't work on the animated statues either, as I recall). So presumably a Horcrux would be unaffected by its primary function. Now, yes, a Killing Curse that splashes into an inanimate object causes an explosion, but it's just a big, essentially nonmagical "kaboom" --- if a regular /Bombarda/ or a hand grenade can't harm a Horcrux then this won't either.

  Sirius knows about the Horcruxes - he was raised by the Black family, remember
#+end_quote

I hate this plot point so much. Even if the Black family has that knowledge it is questionable whether they are truly the only "dark" method of immortality, whether Sirius was ever taught about them (he was kicked out at 16 and was not exactly the "good" kid before), whether he still remembers those lessons after a decade in Mindrape Prison and, even with Kreacher's story, would make the conclusion that there is more than one.

Having someone besides Dumbledore or Harry make the right conclusions about Voldemort's immortality, often without any research on the matter (Dumbledore worked years on that), is just lazy writing.

*** Or he could find a letter from Regulus talking about them, or Harry could tell him about the diary and Sirius gets curious and researches it since he has nothing to do stuck in Grimmauld Place... There's other methods to get to the same point (although I agree that he probably wouldn't know/remember much if he did know without being handed information first).
