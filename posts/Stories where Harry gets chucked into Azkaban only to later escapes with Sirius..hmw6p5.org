I would like to see a bit of them partnering up to survive and Sirius taking a more parental role towards Harry. A good example would be 'Fugitives of Azkaban'. linkffn(3595986)

I know this kind of premise makes it quite difficult but preferably no dumbledore or weasley bashing.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

*** Do you know if the author plans to finish this series? I just started reading the first one and I love it already, I'd hate for it to end up abandoned.
