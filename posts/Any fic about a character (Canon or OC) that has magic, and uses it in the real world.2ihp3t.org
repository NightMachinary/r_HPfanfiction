** Perspicacity wrote a couple one-shots with that premise.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4543379/1/The-Game-Is-Afoot][this one]], Harry is forced from the magical world and uses his divination skills as a trader for a hedge fund.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/9/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][this other one]], Hermione works for the British government and routinely employs Legilimancy.
