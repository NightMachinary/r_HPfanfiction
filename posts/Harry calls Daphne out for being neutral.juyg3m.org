We all know Daphne Greengrass. She's an ice queen with a heart of gold, smarter than Hermione, prettier than Fleur, and firmly neutral. She's no Death Eater, but she still won't fight for the mudblood scum that sully pureblood culture and want the Wizarding World to conform to their radical ideals. They even think having slaves is /wrong/ for Merlin's sake!

But how about if Harry called her out for being "neutral"? IMO, being neutral in a fight between people who want to eradicate those who are not pure and people who don't want to eradicate those people says something about a person. I'm sick and tired of fanfics glorifying being neutral. Neutrality is not a real position, but just "in the middle" of two opposing sides, so someone can feel like they're the reasonable one. If Death Eaters won? They would probably still be "neutral", because those types of people have no actual values. They will always try to act like both sides are equally bad even if it's literally a fight between good and evil, like in the Harry Potter series, and that annoys me to no end.


** Sometimes neutrality is portrayed in the context of the Wizengamots which I don't think is too terrible. But trying to claim neutrality against Voldemort (who is clearly a psycho) is like ü§Æ. Just make Daphne say she is against it, but is powerless to do anything.

Though, all in all, I still enjoy haphne and will eat up anything well written regardless if it has some tropes that annoy me.

**** In general it annoys me how Harry is the one who has to change over Daphne, because Harry always does what is right no matter the odds or consequences. But I think its cause most stories are told through Harry's POV and they need him to go through a character arc.

Its easy to complain about logic and plot holes when your the reader, but when writing a story its really hard to make things fit the way you want.

** Well as we know from canon the wizarding world is filled with cowards. Voldemort and his deatheaters are heavily outnumbered but literally a dozen of them send Hundreds running away.

So all those who state they are neutral are really saying is I don't want to join the Deatheaters because I know I would be sent out to fight (where I might die). And I don't want to join the "light" because then the Deatheaters might come after me so I would have to fight (where I might die). By saying I'm neutral they should both leave me alone.

**** Often I've seen it as her whole family's policy of "We don't like or agree with Voldemort, but openly opposing him would see us all murdered, at best." It's ultimately short-sighted, as the classic "First they came for..." quote illustrates, but in many portrayals it's worked to see them through multiple previous Dark Lords.

While I certainly can't praise such a position, neither can I condemn a man for not wanting his wife and daughters brutally tortured, raped, and/or murdered.

Now a more politically-neutral position, where they're definitely opposed to Voldemort's agenda (and to legalizing Muggle-baiting or Muggle-hunting and to oppressing Muggle-born) but are working to preserve the non-bigoted parts of wix tradition (Samhain instead of Halloween, for example) can work. In such fics, Dumbledore is made somewhat antagonistic by wanting to wipe away wix culture in favor of Muggle culture because... reasons?

** My main issue with the whole House Greengrass and, to an extent, "gray" Harry, is that they jerk themselves off over how much better then anyone else they are when they're very much conservative on the cultural axis. The only difference between Lucius Malfoy and Cyrus Greengrass is that one of them serves Voldemort while the other one really wants Harry to bang his daughter. (And what the hell is up with that, anyway?) They hold the same views on blood and culture, have equally inflated egos and neither really bothered to teach their children manners. Seriously, what's up with Daphne always being a worse female Draco at the start before suddenly "becoming nice"? (to Harry, she's still a massive bitch to everyone else)

has some of this. I thought it might have been the best part of the fic, but Harry ended up caving a bit and then it wasn't really discussed again if I remember correctly. Daphne also apologized and it ended up being a compromise of sorts. Decent fic, though it feels a bit like the author is having themself a wank over how well read they are. Muggle literary references coming from a pureblood heiress who doesn't really see why Harry would have a problem with her being around Bellatrix Lestrange was a bit like a cat barking to my mind.

** This is a response based on your comments to other users, and the more general tropes that I've seen in any (mostly poor quality) 'Grey Wizard'/Daphne fics that I've seen.

In my mind, Wizarding Britain's non-economic politics are based on two key issues: blood and 'dark' magic. The challenge is that we don't know enough about the dark arts based on canon to see if that's a reasonable position. Common fanon expansions include family magic that the Light is against because it is not shared, 'positive' dark arts like blood and ritual magic (including the ever-present Samhain and Yule tributes to the Old Way) that are banned, or that the intent of spells matters more than their composition.

We don't really know enough about the economics of the Wizarding world in general, let alone about economic policy within the government, to make an inference on how wizards adapt to a post-scarcity economy.

Parties within the Wizengamot are obviously a fanon development, but the 'Light' and 'Dark' parties are usually made to represent and ratify the views of Dumbledore and Voldemort respectively into law. In the type of fics you're talking about, the 'Neutrals'/'Greys' are the party of stragglers that fence-sit in between the two camps.

On the one hand, you have Dumbledore: believes in equality of blood and is firmly against dark magic. This is based on canon: the Muggle Protection Act was created to root out dark artifacts from ancestral homes, and Dumbledore's rooted out most of the dark arts books in the library of Hogwarts. On the other, you have the obvious 'Dark' beliefs of the Death Eaters, who espouse purity of blood and the use of dark arts.

Most fics do a poor job on developing a coherent platform of the Neutrals. In my experience reading, it's mostly isolationism against the others and letting God sort 'em out in the war. 'Grey' wizards are usually just defined as those that are willing to use lethal force and somehow have a loose morality.

A more developed look could be that there is just a legitimate third (or even fourth) party that have real philosophical differences with the Light and Dark. For example, some may be totally blind to purity of blood, but want the ability to perform some sort of 'dark' magic. I think this actually Grindewald's politics, though his were taken to an extreme. Others could be pro-wizarding tradition^{tm .}

Canon, as a YA book, does not delve into any of this and just pits good against evil. If there was a real party, it would be fine and good to be a part of it. It would not be inherently bad to not be a part of the Order and Dumbledore's group. You can still be good and moral and fight against Voldemort.

There's also the issue to consider of the role of law enforcement. There are probably a great many people that are against Voldemort but believe that the Aurors should be the ones handling it, especially pre-coup of the Ministry. That does not make them evil either, merely self-preserving.

*** Oh, I'm fine with neutrals as a party in the Wizengamot, but what I hate is when Daphne is basically a blood purist and thinks muggleborns are scum, but is depicted as good since she doesn't want to kill all of them. I just read a fanfic where Daphne ranted about stupid mudbloods trying to ruin wizarding culture and I'm so annoyed by how Daphne being a blood purist was never addressed.

**** It depends on the quality of writing and the context for me to make my opinion on that.

I read an interesting fic that differentiated mudbloods from other muggle-borns. The author had taken the time to establish a nuanced culture, with societal, quasi-religious, and political structure that was different than the Muggle world.

The argument was that 'blood-traitors and mudbloods' were totally against adhering to anything within the culture of the author's wizarding Britain and tried to enforce Muggle standards on every aspect of life in the wizarding world.

Neville was actually the character that called Hermione a mudblood (privately to Harry and only after a long argument) because she was so adamant about making the wizarding world more like the muggle one. He was progressive in terms of most issues and wasn't a blood purist, just believed that their culture needed to be respected.

It depends on how the argument is framed really and what the context was before it.

For example, you could have a situation like the Native Americans who are trying to stop the eroding of a rich history that's unlike the newer European culture that surrounds it. Or you could have a situation where people in privilege are desperately trying to keep the systems that perpetuate systematically grind down those in a less privileged position.

The other less disparaging argument is the tourist one that I've seen Harry use on Hermione a couple of times in fanfiction. The "if you were in Japan, would you force the Japanese to adopt your cultural values? This is not muggle Britain, if you want to go 'native', learn the culture around you"

That's a much more compelling argument. and the answer you want to give is based on situation. People being oppressed should push for change, but eliminating cultural traditions just for the sake of it is more than that.

I think traditions should be changed, and I would advocate for it even if I was an immigrant. There's a lot of unhealthy values that the Japanese (for example, they prioritize work over their lives) have that I think should be changed even if they seem harmless, so I don't think that argument would work on me.

******** But who can tell what's better or worse? Your vision seems more than a bit Imperialist.

It's kind of ironic because European were known for arriving at a place and start trying to change things to fit their worldview without caring for context and ended up completely fucking things up (see Africa and some parts of Asia)

This whole idea of "they should change things because my way is better" is incredibly dangerous and the cause of many a cultural genocide throughout history.

The truth of the matter is people have free will and their own culture, and preferences, as long as they aren't hurting anyone. And if they are, then changing part should be done with extreme care, to not make things worse.

One example is Daenerys conquering cities in Slaver's Bay and just changing things without thinking of the consequences(or ignoring counse)l, the only reason it worked is because she had dragons, and even then thing got really bad real fast.

Hermione is sometimes portrayed as someone who just looks at things superficially and starts criticizing without looking for the context, this is bad, and yes, authors change things up to make it worse, but sometimes it's used for character development.

********* I do think my view on the world is a bit weird, but I don't automatically assume that my way is better. I just think that every country, including my own, has flaws and attributes that can be fixed by bringing ideas from other countries. If we're talking about Japan, their culture of valuing hard work over everything else negatively impacts their people. They are expected to never take time off of work and have extremely long work hours. They have even have a name for death from overwork. The idea that every culture is perfect is a bit flawed IMO. Sure, we shouldn't change their culture if it's not hurting anybody, but some parts of it are hurting their people. The younger people in Japan have also noticed the problem and want to change it since they don't want their whole lives to be spent working all the time.

********** I am not saying it shouldn't be changed, but that the process of changing is not as simple as just complaining about it and telling them how bad/stupid/illogical it is and/or just making it illegal(as some depictions of Hermione do) that's just asking for trouble.

Japan's work culture is somewhat unhealthy(even if they normalized sleeping on the job) but as you said, they themselves are changing it.

Same thing could be said about the anti-social behaviors of some of their population.

Bringing it to HP, I think about how bullheaded Hermione was with the House Elves, she didn't talk with them, she didn't ask their situation, and how they felt. She saw something she didn't like and immediately tried to change it with little study.

Where would the House-Elves go? What would they do? Would they be happy? What forms of employement they could find out of Hogwarts?

They may be sentient, but their psychology is very different from a human's, even in canon you can see that.

It always reminds me of that scene where Daenerys frees ALL the slaves and one old man comes to ask to return to his old family because he was respected there and liked living there(he was treated like a teacher and family friend to the kids).

Blanket, generalized actions with little analysis have been shown again and again to only make things worse in the majority of the time. One of the exceptions would be US slavery because the conditions were much, much different than even slavery in GoT(in some aspects).

*********** But one of the reasons younger Japanese people don't like the work culture Japan has is because they were exposed to how other cultures did it. Of course I agree that change won't happen by forcing it to happen, but someone has to expose the people to those new ideas. With House Elves, I think they needed to be slowly taught what freedom is and how to embrace it. I think their psychology is different, but a large part of it is brainwashing. In the US, many people actually thought similar things about black people, because they never rebelled. Hell, the people who punished the slaves for stepping out of line were literally also slaves. Even when stretching the definition of a rebellion, and making it so that every revolt that had more than 9 people (white or black) participating, there were only around 30 revolts in total, and even the few "major" ones had around 50 people at most. They were enslaved for 260 years, and an 1860 census reported there were 4.5 million slaves, which shows that they were, for the most part, not fighting back. After the Nat Turner rebellion (probably the largest slave rebellion ever in the US), a Virginia legislator assured his people that Turner and his allies were just outliers and that their slave population "is not only a happy one, but is a contented, peaceful and harmless one‚Äù.

Many slaves in the US loved their masters and actually stayed with them after they were freed. Also, regarding Hermione, I think she was right, even though she went about it the wrong way. Brainwashed slaves aren't reasonable and you can't listen to them, since they'll just parrot that they love their work and their masters. John Brown thought he could convince them to fight against their masters, but he was wrong, and he payed for his actions with his life.

Human rights and war crimes are laws that went against the culture of many countries in the days that they were made but it was a good thing.

** even if the neutrality stems from ‚Äúi dont wanna die‚Äù, most stories depict voldemort recruiting them and then killing them when the refuse so i think the neutrals in the war are fucking cowards especially if they have political influence, like the greengrasses. still love haphne and daphne tho.

*** I'm not saying she has to fight, but it gets annoying when she acts like the neutral faction is the best while the other factions are too "radical". When one side wants to wipe the world clean of the impure and the other side is protecting them, you should be supporting the side that's protecting them. She shouldn't act like it's stupid to support either side when one side is clearly evil and the other is fighting against that evil.

**** I hear ya. It's rather like that quote; "the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing".

Some people can't afford neutrality, like you say. The only ones who can say neutrality is the best option is those who have the privilege to allow it. Ergo: purebloods. I would love to read a story where she's confronted with the reality of what it means to stand for nothing when people are suffering and dying. That's what her neutrality would contribute to while she sits safe, not a better world.

***** I think there was one story like that? It's been a while but I think it's daphne greengrass and the importance of intent of something like that.

Where daphne slowly realizes that being neutral is stupid and helps harry kill voldemort

***** Yes! I hate how it's glorified in fanfics when all she's really doing is letting the Death Eaters kill and torture people.

***** Wizarding Britain isn't like Nazi Germany though. Voldemort couldn't kill everyone who doesn't believe in blood purity, since there weren't many Death Eaters and a large portion of their soldiers were non-humans. He was quite willing to spare purebloods if they gave up on fighting him. Also, for a large portion of the books, Voldemort isn't widely known to be alive, so there's no reason to still worry since most think he died more than a decade ago.
