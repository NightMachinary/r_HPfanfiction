:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I think this is one fic, but I could possibly be combining several fics, maybe inspired by the movie You've Got Mail. Lily owns a small business: local coffee shop, caf√©, bookshop, and James owns several shops, maybe a chain. James' shop is Lily's competitor and because his business is doing better, Lily is almost forced to close or has her shop taken over by James. Meanwhile, Lily somehow met James online, chat, Tumblr, dating app, email, and they like each other. They eventually meet, and Lily is angry about almost losing her business. James didn't know it was hers, but it has a happy ending where they get together.
