I've read a lot of them so if you know of any good ones please let me know! Harry/Tonks is by far my favorite pairing. I'm always looking for more to read that involve the two!

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
