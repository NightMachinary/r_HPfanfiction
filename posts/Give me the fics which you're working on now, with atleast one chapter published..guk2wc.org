  Dimension Travel AU. Harry Potter jumped in front of Bellatrix's curse and was the one pushed into the Veil, not Sirius, in fifth year. Dumbledore needed a Chosen One, so he summoned one from...elsewhere. Only, a few others hopped on for the ride. This is the story of the Second Blood War. D/Hr with more pairings to come.

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

** The Might of the Architect, Linkao3 (23957842) is my main work in progress right now! Three chapters published, six chapters written, A Lot to go.

It's a canon compliant founders era fic set a few decades into Hogwarts existence. William the Conqueror has just invaded England and the political fall out ripples through Hogwarts in the course of the fic.

** [[https://medium.com/@Frameworkisdigimon/to-the-ordinary-world-everybodys-got-to-write-an-azkaban-fic-sometime-2785009bffe8][I have a single chapter published]] in what probably won't be a very long (assuming I finish it) fic (three/four chapters altogether, I think). Basic premise... Harry's been in Azkaban for ten years. Ginny's in the cell next door. Oh and Voldemort's already deader than dead so if they want out, they'll have to escape.
