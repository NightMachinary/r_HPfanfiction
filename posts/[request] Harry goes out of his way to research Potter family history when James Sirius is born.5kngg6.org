Hi, all. I'm looking for any stories in which Harry finally goes out of his way to research his family legacy once he starts having children. (And if not during that specific time frame, at least post-Hogwarts.) I'd like for the family history to be a prominent part of the story. I guess I'm almost looking for a frame-story type format, even. Maybe he discovers there's a Potter branch somewhere, maybe he doesn't. But I want to read about his search for answers and about the relatives he learns about.

Also, REALLY don't want Harry to be a super-trillionaire, half-owner of Hogwarts here, having 90 Wizengamot votes... Just a Potter who is comfortably wealthy, as in cannon, but not billionaire wealthy

Thanks!
