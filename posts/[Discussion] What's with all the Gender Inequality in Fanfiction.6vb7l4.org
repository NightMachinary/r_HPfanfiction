I see in so many fics where the female lead thinks, "omg! All I'm going to be is a brood mare"

From what we know about the wizaeding world, it's one benefit is that it's a gender equal society. Sports at the highest level involve both genders, women in power far before their muggle counterparts.

For a series with a solid number of female leads, on both sides, where's the inspiration for inequality coming from.

Real life. Its safe to say that /a lot/ of fanfiction is wish-fulfillment, coping outlets and self-reflection (, probably because a lot of fanfiction is written and read by teenagers). So a lot of authors simply ignore stated canon in order to form the HP world more towards what they need in order to portray the world they want to fit into/ rule/ destroy/...

Also we have a few instances of gender roles in this society. For example, Narcissa Malfoy is for the most part Lucius Malfoy's wife and Draco's mum. She's defined by nothing but the two men in her life. So the "purebloods are super-patriarchal" thing is a short step further to take for a lot of authors.

As so much in fanon, general societal standards are often connected to a few examples of single individuals. So, I'm personally not too judgmental when authors go ahead and shift the gender roles in certain subcultures of the magical world.

I don't think this is true. The high quality fan-fiction that we read, recommend, and discuss here is almost entirely written by adults. Many state or insinuate their ages on their profiles.

Honestly, I think teenagers like myself are actually a large minority in the fan-fiction community, this one especially.

** Usually, from what I've read it's Hermione and sometimes Ginny who thinks this because they don't want to end up like Molly. The Hermione ones go with some fabulous Ron/Weasley bashing because Ron doesn't want her to work and wants a bunch of children etc and Hermione doesn't want to be a "brood mare" like his mum. I've seen it done a couple of times with Ginny where she doesn't want to end up with so many children like her mother, or she doesn't want to have children early like Harry's mother.

It's kind of insulting in my opinion to reduce Molly Weasley to a brood mare. I don't exactly subscribe to the "Big Happy Weasley Family" epilogue and it's a bit baffling to me that she didn't work when they were so poor and all their children were at school but Molly Weasley being a house-wife and having 7 children didn't stop her from fighting in the war. It didn't stop her from killing Bellatrix Lestrange. Hermione and Ginny choosing to marry and have kids didn't stop them from having fulfilling careers. Hermione even became Minister of Magic. It is like many fanon tropes, stupid.

Molly frets over him and Arthur gives him advice. Fornthe first time, he has people that actually worry over him. The family in general represents all the things that everyone wants in their life, love, hapiness, and good people. I'm with you on the big Happy Weasley family stuff.

Molly knew that he was starved and locked behind bars and she chose to send some food and threaten her kids with bars. Instead of ensuring that Harry does not have to return to an abusive environment.

That is the biggest shortcoming and failure of Molly Weasley.

With that in mind, she's done everything she can. Sje put herself and her family in considerable risk in HBP to host Harry and the Order. Also, it's well known the Weasleys are really fighting because of how well they know Harry.

Remember, they're all purebloods. Even if they were looked down on, they could have kept their head down throughout the war.

***** Hmm... Is that the common sense of the modern world or the common sense of wizarding world? How does the people over the wizarding world solve problem like harry? Would that kind of common sense fit the setting or not?

I admit it is bad if it is happening in the real world, but in this fictional wizarding world, this may not be so, as people in that world may have their own perspective. This can be expanded in the world building, to be honest. So, not saying that your answer is right or wrong, but consider the society, culture, norms over the world you or the author are writing please.

******* Hmm... Why not? Like I've said, if Molly is being raised to only take care of Harry as a response of the abuse that harry experienced (this may due to several factors, like the availability of the government agency that handled cases like Harry (magical government only), how she is educated and whether this case is normal in wizarding world, again returning to the standard of what is normal, or other factors), this is the most appropriate response for molly. Call it ignorance or what, but the character do have its own sphere of information, culture, norms which had to be considered in how she act.

So, again, depending on the definition of tortured in Molly's perspective, and again, what is appropriate for helping. In perspective, open your law book that relevant to abuse, compare the law definition between now say, 50 to 100 years ago. Easy, right?

*** I have to say I think it would've been a bit difficult for Molly to work full time if they never had the resources to have a babysitter/nanny at any point. From 1970 (Bill was born) until 1992 (Ginny attends Hogwarts), Molly was giving birth and taking care of children at home. It could be argued that perhaps she could have left Ginny and Ron in the care of Fred/George/Percy, and then perhaps Ginny in the care of Ron at some point. But the eldest age her child babysitting would be was 11. And I don't think that's quite old enough to take care of a child... especially considering accidental magic and the twins!

Perhaps if early on Molly and Arthur could have afforded care for Bill alone, they could've started out with a decent dual-income and progressively been able to have more children as the babysitting fee increased and they rose higher up/accumulated more savings. But even then, Molly was having a child about every 2 years (4 year gap between Charlie and Percy... and a one year gap between Ron and Ginny) and presuming magical pregnancy is the same as non-magical, she would be taking off a minimum of 3-6 months every other year. Depending on the magical paternity leave regulations she could be anything from unpaid in that time to full pay checks on leave. Or on the other hand with magic perhaps a woman is fully recovered in a day after pregnancy. Of course, most women in the muggle world at that time who were having children and working were barely able to take off a week to have a child (my mother in the 90's had two weeks vacation leave as her maternity leave). But with magical Britain being relatively equal perhaps there were no stigma to having multiple children and working. But for the most part, magical family seem to have very few children as the norm so perhaps Molly would've been looked down upon in the workforce.

This is all speculation. But I don't automatically agree that Molly would've been able to easily bear 7 children and have a full time job to help support Arthur, partially presuming that they weren't that well off to begin with.

Having those kids, especially during a civil war, was simply irresponsible.

***** I don't necessarily agree with that. Perhaps Molly had always wanted lots of kids and wasn't going to let Moldymort stop her. In the first war the Weasleys would not have been a threat as canonically they weren't members of any resistance (i.e. OotP) and were Pureblooded. The were next to nothing to Voldemort, like many Pureblood or Half-Blood families that hid in the background. What would have come from slaughtering them or trying to recruit them? They didn't have any money and they didn't outrightly oppose him. Also remember, Voldemort never took control of the Ministry in the first war. Arthur would not have been in the same level of danger that he faced in the second war.

War does funny things to the markets, perhaps the price of wands went up? Though it's not great to have a second hand wand, they always can afford the basic necessities for schooling and clothing and food. The Weasleys struggle but they are not destitute. The children never starve, they have clothes on their back and a roof over their head. Molly packs her children sandwiches on the train. They are frugal, that doesn't mean that can't afford the basics of life. She is still able to buy Ron dress robes and their books every year (even Lockhart's massive list). We know the Longbottoms were well off, but that doesn't stop Augusta from giving Neville his father's wand. Clearly, not everyone buys a new wand when they might have the financial ability to. People like Draco who have a very nouveau-riche feel would never be seen with a second-hand wand. And for muggle-raised witches and wizards like Harry, Hermione, and Dean they are forced to buy new wands. Seamus who's mum is a witch might not have a spare wand lying about. I think it's also canon that those who have died are buried with their wands, so I'd imagine it's rare for second-hand wands to be on the market -- leading it to be unlikely that someone not Pureblooded would have access to one. I wouldn't be so quick to say that the Weasleys were unfit to take care of their children. We have no idea if they could've gotten Ron a new wand at the end of second without the Ministry lottery winnings, but it's never said anywhere else that any of the others didn't have new wands. Perhaps, Ron's first year was a bad year for Arthur and it would've been the largest amount of kids they'd had at school at once.

******* I just don't think it is canon that just because you have a second hand wand, you're poor. And my other comments still stand, the Weasley children never wanted for everything. They had brooms to fly on for Quidditch, food on the table every night, new clothing when they grew out of their old ones (second-hand new, but Mrs. Weasley never used enlargement charms on the clothing if my memory serves-- so she bought "new" second hand robes when needed), Ron and Ginny are bought dress robes. They are provided with every book on their list. And they don't just get sweaters every Christmas-- they always receive other things so they never wanted. And clearly Mrs. Weasley went out and bought Ron a new watch for his 17th (I presume she did this with all of her children). So I think a second hand wand while not preferable or even remotely as good as a wand that chooses you, is still quite acceptable and it's not like she has him go off to Hogwarts without one.

I'm about 100% positive Rowling admitted at some point she screwed up the numbers on the exchange rate and wands definitely factored in on that miscalculation.

** That's interesting. I haven't read a whole lot of fics where the female lead fears being a broodmare, but I don't read on FF.net at all, so that may be why. I agree in the books the world is presented as reasonably equal (except where are all the lady goblins??), but at the same time a bit more old-fashioned as another commenter mentioned, so maybe these writers are getting their cues from how they perceive an old-fashioned world to be like? The popular view of the Victorian era is ladies in corsets and fainting couches, never mind all of the poor women who had to do whatever they could to keep their families alive. Pretty sure they weren't waiting around for the men to save them.

I have a dislike for weak "rescue me" female characters that lack agency, so that's something I try to avoid in my own writing. In my fics, Ginny is the rescuer as much as she's rescued. Wait, do I even have an instance where she needs to be rescued? Hmm...

This is pretty much how canon HP ends. (I know Rowling later made statements about what Hermione and Ginny got up after book 7 ended, but in the epilogue itself all that's presented is them and their husbands having lots of kids and sending them off to Hogwarts.) Looking outside the epilogue at adult women in canon, most fall into one of two roles: having no children or having their family be a key part of their character. You can be a transfiguration professor/undersecretary to the Minister/Azkaban-crazed Death eater or you can have be devoted to your family (e.g. Narcissa, Molly, Petunia), but you can't be both.

I can see why people would read the wizarding world (why not the /witching/ world?) as a place with deep-seated gender roles, despite Rowling's attempts at portraying a society progressive about gender. She didn't always do a good job with her world-building and often wrote in things that contradicted the moral she was trying to portray. This is just one instance of that.

*** I think both Petunia and Narcissa are invalid examples. Petunia is obsessed with normality and is a muggle and not involved in the scope. According to Rowling, no one in the Malfoy family actually works. Hermione and Ginny have careers and family (isn't Hermione the minister) and there isn't a lot of evidence to suggest they aren't devoted to their family.

But still, let's say what you've said is true, either or. Still they have the choice on their career, which is far more progressive than it is in fics

**** I mean, I can point to more evidence of gender inequality in the wizarding world. For example, most people in positions of power or authority are men. While there are your Amelia Boneses and Minerva McGonagalls, they are outnumbered by your Severus Snapes and Cornelius Fudges and Albus Dumbledores and Pius Thicknesses and Lucius Malfoys and Voldemorts and ... Or I could point to the existence of stay-at-home mums with no corresponding stay-at-home dads being shown.

Some fics exaggerate the amount of inequality from what is shown in canon, but it is there in canon. So it makes sense that some would seize on that as a theme for a fic, similar to how other themes get exaggerated in fanfiction.

Edit:

This is all extratextual info that Rowling said after the fact. My point is that in the published books, their careers never merit a mention. (And it would've been so easy to do otherwise. All it would take is a sentence or two to establish that e.g. Hermione is high-ranking in the Ministry.) Rowling's fanfiction from Pottermore doesn't change that.

***** Per your "edit"-- if we're disregarding Pottermore/Cursed Child/anything outside of the original 7. Then Harry and Ron and none of the Hogwarts crew have jobs. So we can't use that as evidence either.

What I do have to stress is that the books do focus on school kids-- primarily an orphan in the muggle world. So Rowling's examples are just a mere snapshot that fit with the story and what Harry's most likely knowledge would be/any likely conversations he could have that would advance the plot. So with woman: we know that there are five teachers at Hogwarts who are female (Sprout, Trelawney, McGonnagal, Sinistra, Grubbly-Plank), as well as Pomphrey, Pince, and Charity Burbage (who we don't meet until book 7 at her death). Male teachers there are Snape, Flitwick, Binns, and Hagrid. Then there is Dumbledore and Filch. All but one of the DADA teachers are male. None of the above do we have any idea about children, except that Dumbledore, Snape, and Hagrid have none.

So essentially there is a 50/50 split if we give Dumbledore an extra point for being Headmaster. Though McGonnagal is Deputy so she could get an extra point, but I won't. The Heads of Houses are split ½ and ½ as well. Even when Voldemort is in power and Burbage is murdered and Snape becomes headmaster it's still 50/50. And the twin Carrows (a boy and a girl) are still given the same powers and "responsibility" for torturing children. So I say Hogwarts is even ground and can't be looked at for sexism or inequality and there's no proof that any of the teachers do or don't have children, which wouldn't make sense for the professors to share unless they had a child attending Hogwarts in the first place.

Within the Ministry, it can be presumed that none of the higher-ups male or female have children, which I think says more about being in power and not having children than it does about inequality and women in high positions giving up child-bearing. Amelia Bones, Umbridge, Fudge, and Scrimgeour are the only high-high ups I can think of who never are revealed to have children. While Crouch essentially looses his family in his greed for power in the Ministry. To me, it's less about less women in power at a high ranking level and more about high ranking Ministry officials not having children. Children and family are not seen as a way to make it in the Ministry and men and women make the decision to have none to succeed. -- I would not include Pius Thicknesse as a man in authority simply because he was in power through Voldemort's orders and a strong Imperius curse.

There is only one confirmed stay-at-home mom in canon and that's Molly. Nobody else is revealed to be a stay-at-home mom. Technically as some people have brought up so is Xenophilius though he works from home. Lovegood unlike Molly however only has one child and is a widower so his need to work is quite different from hers. It's never known whether he started the Quibbler after his wife died (and we know she was a Potions-master) to have an income or what.

Lucius and Narcissa are never confirmed to do anything so I'd put them at the same level.

Among other characters there's no conclusive evidence to suggest that there's any inequality in the wizarding world. I'm not including members of the Order as that being their "occupation" because for Arthur and other Ministry workers it was supplemental, for others it was the only "work" they did (Sirius, Remus, and Molly for instance). Tonks and Kingsley (and Dawlish) are the only current aurors we are introduced to. Both Alice and Frank made it as aurors and presumably when Neville was born and they went into hiding, both of them did.

Tonk's father is never revealed to have a job and neither is Andromeda. Technically, Tonks had a job and Remus didn't. Though he's not stay-at-home dad, his wife is the bread winner. Don't know what that counts in your definitions of working, etc.

I would call any of these characters "background characters." Our canon takes place in a school and so anyone outside the Weasley, teachers, and Hogwarts students are background characters, even then most of the teachers are background and so is the Weasley family. It's hard to pull the "women in this story who work are never met and don't have any story themselves" when our main three are children. Heck, even in Rowling's muggle world, both of Hermione's parents are dentists and Petunia doesn't work because she is so concerned with appearance and normalcy in a muggle world where most women didn't work. I'd say Rowling does a fairly decent job at promoting equality and virtually no signs of sexism (when Hermione and Lily are praised for their intelligence it has less to do with them being girls and much more to do with being muggle-born). Ginny is carte-blanc seen as a powerful witch, and that's about the end of it. I don't agree there's inequality in the gender sense or even racially. It seems to be by blood and creature. Even in terms of historical figures, ½ the Hogwarts founders are female (the smartest one being a witch) and Merlin and Morgan Le Fay are canonically the ancients of magic as well -- Morgan being dark and Merlin light and great adversaries during their time.

****** I agree that the gender ratio for Hogwarts staff is pretty close to 1:1. But that wasn't my point.

My point was that from what we are shown of Wizarding Britain, men dominate positions of power or authority. Most positions at Hogwarts can't really be considered positions of authority in society. Sure, they have authority over children, but that's not the same thing. I would say Deputy Headmistress is a position with authority and could see a case for the heads of houses. But astronomy professor or groundskeeper or librarian are not positions of authority.

Outside of Hogwarts, power in Wizarding Britain is shown to be concentrated in the hands of men. That takes the form of most heads of Ministry departments we meet being men. It takes the form of Lucius Malfoy throwing money and influence around. It takes the form of Voldemort being really powerful in magic. It takes the form of Dumbledore being Dumbledore.

I think that part of why Rowling's world ends up being so skewed is that she shows us such a limited slice of it. This is understandable. The first few books are squarely magical-British-boarding-school stories. Of course most of what we see will be the magical boarding school. Of course most the adults we meet will be teachers or janitors or whatever.

(On a side note, it's kinda weird how starting from book 1, Dumbledore is portrayed as a really important person in Wizarding Britain. I get that to an eleven year old's mind their headmaster seems like one of the most powerful people in the world, but it's weird to take that child's perception and write it into the setting.)

I do think that Rowling set out to portray a gender egalitarian society. My understanding is that she's explicitly said such in interviews. But some of the decisions she made about how to tell that story, like the hyperfocus on magical boarding school, undermine that goal. (As all the Pottermore trivia mentioned in this thread attests, Rowling is able to avoid some of these issues when not confined by the needs of the story.) Also, while Rowling is writing about a fictional society, it's heavily based upon the real world, where things aren't so gender egalitarian. So things bleed through and some detail of real world sexism or gender roles gets incorporated into her world.

The end result is a world that has made some strides towards gender equality but still has noticeable strands of sexism. This gets exaggerated by some fanfic writers for whatever reason, but they are exaggerating from something that is present in the text.

******* I guess I just don't fundamentally agree with you. The book is about a schoolboy who is orphaned and his only view of the wizarding world initially comes from Hogwarts. Her "decision" to "hyperfocus" on Hogwarts come from the fact that that's what the story is about.

I think the teachers at Hogwarts are pretty fundamental to wizarding Britain if you think about it, most of the population will go there and teachers seem to work there almost up until they die for decades... affecting hundreds and hundreds of wizards and witches. All of the teachers are extraordinary at their subject. Snape is a revered potions master. Sprout is an incredible herbologist. Flitwick was a professional dueler and a master at charms. McGonagall and Dumbledore were /incredible/ at Transfiguration and Dumbledore is repeatedly one of the most accomplished wizards of the era. I honestly believe it's a major honour to be a teacher at Hogwarts -- except DADA. The only other teaching position that changes is Hagrid's promotion to Care of Magical Creatures professor. Many of the staff taught Mrs. Weasley and her brothers... I'm pretty positive Dumbledore taught McGonagall (iirc). Heck we know Dumbledore has been teaching for /at least/ 50 years because he taught Voldemort. I wouldn't discount Hogwarts professors just because they're teachers.

And I disagree. Lucius Malfoy is not in a position of power because he is a man... it's because he has a lot of money. And he uses that money for bribery, a woman is just as capable at that. That's not sexism or "inequality" that's just corruption and anyone is capable of that. I also wouldn't say that Voldemort is in a position of power. I wouldn't call male dictators getting where they are because of sexism and inequality. Though frequently they are rampant in sexist and unequal environments. I would look to the Ministry and actual heads of departments of which we are given four: Amelia Bones who is head of the DMLE and is technically the Head Aurors boss (Scrimgeour) -- this job is then given to Thicknesse for a year after Voldemort kills her and then Yaxley after Voldemort promotes Thicknesse to minister (so I really wouldn't even include either of them as heads because it was due to Voldemort's tactics), Ludo Bagman (head of Magical Games), and Barty Crouch (head of International Magical Cooperation) -- which was a demotion from his previous position as head of the DMLE. And then we have Fudge and Umbridge in the Minister's office. So essentially other than Fudge Amelia Bones is perhaps the highest up in the Ministry and is one of only three confirmed heads of department that we're aware of. The Auror department is under the DMLE. So I wouldn't consider that "all the people in power" are male, because they're not. And the second highest person in the Ministry is Amelia Bones. And Fudge's "right hand" man is Umbridge.

I personally think you're just trying to see the wizarding as unequal when it's put together incredibly well, as well as quite equal from the viewpoint of an 11-17 year old muggle raised wizard. And you can't come up with excuses that this is Rowling's downfall. You're missing the point of the books if we're going to start arguing about what Rowling's plot should've been in order to show the world. It's the Harry Potter fandom for a reason, we should be thankful Rowling gave us such a fleshed out beautiful world to explore and dig our hands into. It's not perfect-- the treatment of house elves and other magical creatures as well as the blood purity issues are rampant but at the end of the day in every way possible Rowling showed us a lot of gender equality. Umbridge is as big as a bitch as Voldemort. Bellatrix is a high up DE. Lily Potter sacrificed her life. Narcissa helped save HP for her son. Molly was a stay-at-home mom, while Tonks and Alice were aurors. Amelia Bones was one of the highest members of the Ministry. There's nothing wrong with a woman not working, that's showing equality too. Just as there are women of all different backgrounds with different strengths and weaknesses and equally as awful and some of the male characters.

Let me put it this way. If, as you allege, Wizarding Britain is a gender egalitarian place, then why do we see so many more men than women in positions of power? There are some women, but they are outnumbered by men. Are we to believe that women in general just don't want those positions?

Wizards don't seem to bother with gender division in Quidditch and females are very well represented in areas like academia (Hogwarts professor seems to be one of the more prestigious jobs in canon) and reach high up in the ministry (Bones, Umbridge, Bagnold).

** That's why harems or a strong patriarchal Magical Britain made no sense under Canon setting. Many readers equate Magical Britain with Victorian England or even Feudal Europe, and thought it was too dominated by males.

If polygamy was ever a thing in Magical Britain, it would be applied to both genders, where powerful and/or rich wizards and witches could both have their own harems.

** The more extreme ones that have whatever character go on about how they're property and then fawn over how amazing the insert character is for behavior that amounts to 'bare minimum decency' in RL? To me, those seem to stem less from canon and more from a similar wish fulfillment/power fantasy as Lord Potter fics (and those interactions are frequently in those fics).

Those are usually a cheap way to try and make a character more amazing by handing them a bunch of shiny trophies (a Lordship! A vault full of gold! Saying how much better a man they are then all the other men around!) which completely fails to make that character more amazing to a reader who's hoping to see more than just a constant string of shiny trophies getting handed to the character. Authors can give a character a lordship and ten times the gold of all other wizards combined pretty easily, but to make them so much more attractive then all the men around them the author either make all the women they care about super attracted to power/status/money, make Harry (the self insert in 90% of these fics) way more suave† then he is in canon, or make the lives of the women way worse than it was shown in canon. Frequently you get all three.

Of course, besides the Lord Potteresque type fics you have the straight up ship fics where it's all about how the two characters are meant to be together, and if a ship war is involved how awful the third character is. To me, both of these things are more to blame for extreme cases then authors trying to do an honest extrapolation of how women are treated in canon.

As for less extreme, there is enough sketchiness in canon to as to make gender inequality reasonable enough to include in a story. The prominent men are more noticeable and tend to be in more important positions than the prominent women in canon. We have a couple of groups (the Ministry, the Death Eaters) where the men we know about significantly outnumber the women. For it to be a more egalitarian society I'd expect the ratio to be closer, otherwise I have to assume /some/ gender bias exists. It's not something I prefer reading about, but I can't blame someone for including what's hinted at in canon.

†Albeit, a lot of author's 'suave' Harry comes across less charming and more bizarre and vaguely creepy. It's one of those things where I'm actually less put off if Harry is /more/ OOC because the juxtaposition between a vaguely IC!Harry and some of the things they try to pass him off as saying is just laughable.

  From what we know about the wizaeding world, it's one benefit is that it's a gender equal society.
#+end_quote

Thats not exactly right. Yes there is surprising gender equality considering the Wizarding world is a bit stuck in the past, but its clear that its still got some aspects where its not. The whole male heir aspect or head of house aspect for example. While some families (light more then dark) are more balanced, there is a clear lean towards male focused society in some of the older families in HP.

I think the gender inequality in fan fiction stems from two things. First the idea that the Wizarding world is stuck in the past (implying gender inequality), an idea that somewhat explains the above comment. That older houses are still carrying traditions of male dominance from the past somewhat.

And second that, apart from Hermione, HP is a heavily male dominated story. A significant number of the focused on characters are males.

#+begin_quote
  For a series with a solid number of female leads, on both sides, where's the inspiration for inequality coming from.
#+end_quote

As I stated above, while there are a number of solid female characters, the story itself is CLEARLY more male dominated. The 3 main characters (Harry/Tom/Dumbledore) are male. 2 of the 3 golden trio are male. A large number of the supporting cast are male (Weasleys mostly male, Snape, Sirius, Quirrel, Remus, Peter, Barty, Fudge and so on). There are women for sure (Bones, Ginny, Tonks, Minerva, Molly), but its definitely more male. Even the major side creatures are heavily male (Dobby and Gringots goblins for example).

And again, apart from Hermione, its almost exclusively Male when it comes to the important moments in the books.

** We need to fix this with action hero Hermione.

Harry Potter / Crank

Time travel to the very second she grabbed her wand from Olivander. She died, she's pissed, and she needs to kill someone every 30 minutes for 3 days to stabilize the magic holding her in the past or she stays dead in the future. Fortunately she happens to know 72 people who need killing RIGHT NOW.
