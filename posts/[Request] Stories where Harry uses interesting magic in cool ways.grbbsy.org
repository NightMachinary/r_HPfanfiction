I was reading Hello Journal, and Harry was writing about what it would be like to walk on the roof. Now I can't stop thinking about a story where Harry uses magic to do weird and kinda cool stuff, like alter gravity to walk on walls and roofs, pocket dimensions, phasing through walls, portals, etc.

Not those things exactly, but just anything where magic is used in an interesting or niche way.


** linkffn(2452681) - Hellraiser crossover, you don't need to know the fandom. Great one-shot.

Harry messes with interdimensional spaces via a puzzle box, continues in a sequel which I didn't enjoy AS much, but it was still pretty good.

  Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.

** The Black Queen series by Silently Watches explores magic in a lot of different ways, involving a pantheon of deities known as The Powers, each providing different magicks, along with the main character having a magic sense she uses instead of her sight. It contains quite a few rituals and rather in-depth explainations for both new and canon magics, in addition to the Fem!Harry generally being way above Hogwarts level by the time she starts there at 14.

Do be warned though that it's a pretty... Heavy read. The first book has a pretty fucking heavy trigger warning, which /is/ a little overkill but just a little. Nothing's explicit, it deals with the effects of bad shit happening to people and surprisingly isn't a mopey/angst fic, but it definitely has moments where you need to take a step back to process /what the fuck did I just read?!/

Although less so then most dark!Harry fics I've read. Imo at least.
