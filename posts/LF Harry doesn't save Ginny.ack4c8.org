Are there any fics that explore the idea of Harry not saving Ginny in the CoS? He just never goes into the Chamber / isn't able to save her life / Riddle takes over her body permanently?


** Here's a good thread with the same request a month ago: linksub([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9x723h/good_fics_where_ginny_died_in_the_chamber/]])

  Tom thought that perhaps fifty years of utter isolation and stagnation in a diary was a small price to pay to gain the advantages of being a living Horcrux, even if he was probably a bit mad from the experience. After all, being mad was no impediment to a Dark Lord.

  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark... Warning: Deals with Stockholm Syndrome and dark themes.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  Second in the Purgatorio series. There are voices in the walls, and stalkers in the hallways. At least not everything is dire; plans are made, minds are broken and things are finally getting interesting.

  Things go differently, down in the Chamber. Instead of pouring herself into the diary, Ginny opened her heart to it, her heart and her mind, and that means a different path for Tom Riddle to take. No message saying Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever; instead Tom takes Ginny down to the Chamber one empty afternoon and waits for the last of her to die. When it is all over Tom flicks long red hair over her shoulders, picks up Ginny's wand (not a perfect match, but better than nothing, better than fifty years without a wand) and leaves the Chamber. Saunters out of Myrtle's bathroom looking like nothing more than a little eleven year old girl.

** [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/6849022][An Old and New World]] uses this as a point of divergence. Malfoy manages to get Harry sent to Azkaban, since Ginny disappears, and Harry comes back holding the diary, reeking of Dark Magic.

It gets a little insane.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
