I have a soft spot for the 'Harry Potter characters read the books' fics, but it's a real struggle to find a series where they actually read all of the books. Anyone got a series like this that's finished?


** Nope, reading an wip one that is currently on 4th year though. Got part 1 here if you are interrested linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24609685/chapters/59450125]])

*** Hah! This is the one that inspired this post! I'm in the middle of third year right now, but my problem is I know I'll catch up and still want to binge it.

**** And sadly the author is busy and wont update untill the 18 of september. But he/she at least promised 3 chapters then. Though i am pretty sure this is the only author to go through more than 2 books.

  The Light Side are returning, Lily, James and others who died by Voldemort in the first or second wizarding war are returning. It's wonderful and magical but Teddy's not adjusting well.
