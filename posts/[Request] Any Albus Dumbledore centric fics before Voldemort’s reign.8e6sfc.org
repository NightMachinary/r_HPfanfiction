Something that shows how Dumbledore became who he is. It does not necessarily have to be during his time with Grindelwald. It could be his time as a Professor or when he taught Newt. Just something that contributes to his character as close to cannon as possible.


** I think As Human as to Breathe ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/76683]]) delves nicely into Dumbledore's thoughts and life. It's kind of a “what-if” story if Arianna lived, during Grindelwald's time, but also about what shaped Dumbledore as a person. It's only a one-shot, but it's really well-written.

** Not what you're looking for, but there's an interesting AU where Albus adopts Tom Riddle and tries to steer him in the right direction while having to manage the war with Grindelwald. While it's not cannon it does capture the spirit of Albus pretty well linkffn(4457149)

  AU. In 1938, Albus Dumbledore heads to a London orphanage to deliver a letter to a muggleborn student, and decides to be reasonable when encountering Tommy Riddle.
