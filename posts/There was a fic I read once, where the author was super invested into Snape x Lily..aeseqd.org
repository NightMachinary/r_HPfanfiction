As the title says, they were a heavy Snape x Lily shipper. The premises worked off the idea that James couldn't give up his bachelor life, and winded up cheating on Lily. Snape and Lily winds up getting together, and there's tons of chapters where even the Malfoys have their relationships better because of this whole thing. I never really got far enough to really get to actual Hogwarts, but it seemed like the author knew where they wanted to go with the story.

  JK said that, given a second chance, Severus would pick Lily. I'm giving Lily a second chance to pick Severus, instead. AU, of course. Some deaths, too.

*** That's the one, yeah. Can't remember where I left off on, but the first couple chapters are shorter than I remember. I guess as the story progressed, the author started writing more and more:
