I picket some of that i already know, so the Fic in the title and "Harry Potter Smutty One-Shots & Mini-Series" by Arctis_Shox that there already is. Any similar Fics out there? Would be good if Harry and Fleur are in a kind of Relationship (so Married or engaged or simply dating) and mostly of the sex is initiated by Fleur (but not necessary)...and a Harry is a little less "show his deeds off" would be good.


** [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/10191925/1]] is my favorite Harry/Fleur smut.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
