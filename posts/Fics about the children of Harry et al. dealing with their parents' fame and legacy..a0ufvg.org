It does not have to be a central theme, but preferably at least a major one.

It can be epilogue-compliant (which means Albus Severus!!), EWE, or canon divergent. I don't care whether Harry's alive or dead or whether it's Hinny or Haphne or some other pairing. If it doesn't concern Harry at all, as long as the parent(s) is/are famous post-war, that's great too.

So, any good recommendation? Thank you.

Edit: By the way, slash's fine with me.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7737991][Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time]] linkao3(7737991) - /Cursed Child/-compliant, focused on Albus Severus but pretty much the whole Potter-Weasley clan shows up; the sequel [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7882474][Put Your Curse in Reverse]] more directly deals with the theme of parental legacy

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

** Harry Potter and the Thief of Knockturn Alley.

[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/155396590-harry-potter-and-the-thief-of-knockturn-alley][WattPad]]

â€‹

Eleven years after the fall of Lord Voldemort, the children of the second wizarding war are starting their first year at Hogwarts. Kuro is an orphaned street urchin, raised as a servant by a death-eater and abandoned on the streets in Knockturn Alley. After an unfortunate run-in with a famous auror with a lightning scar, he is sent to join the collection of misfits headed to Hogwarts to start their magical education. ************************************************************************************************* This story follows several new students, including Teddy Lupin, through their first year at Hogwarts. It is meant to satisfy anyone looking for another Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in a canon compliant sequel to the original series, particularly those of a Hufflepuff persuasion.

** The first little while of linkffn(3954448) deal with this, and it was the original premise of the fic. It extends beyond that, though, and ends up becoming a general "the life and times of the Weasleys and Potters." There are also prior fics that are part of the same universe if you want more background about some characters; everything written by the author is an epilogue-compliant universe that all ties together.

** Fernwithy's /Teddy/-verse has quite a bit of this.

He's not Harry's biological kid, but he does have quite a lot of baggage to unpack with being the son of two war heroes he's never met.

  It's been eleven years since Harry Potter brought an end to Voldemort; eleven years of peace, eleven years of recovery.But not every wound can be healed. Teddy Lupin is loved and wanted by his family, adored by his grandfather, welcomed in the extended Weasley clan, and happy that he's about to start at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but he still feels the loss of his parents and the last lingering traces of the war.As he begins his Hogwarts life, he finds connections to his past that he never suspected... and manages a bit of mischief as well!
