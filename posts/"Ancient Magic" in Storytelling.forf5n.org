*/[I initially wanted to leave this as a comment on the post about characters trying Ancient Magic and it not working, but I couldn't find it]/*

Ancient magic: some arcane spells, techniques and/or rituals from time long past. A common trope in ANYTHING magic related to give a character or two a quick and easy way to gain power.

I love this trope, because I like the idea of a character using something that their foe doesn't expect (in this case because it, likely, fell out of common knowledge). Blindsiding their enemy with something they have no idea on how to counter.

However, the trope itself is wrought with Mary Sue's who get away with curbstomping the enemy for that exact reason. Instead of an enemy putting up a fight and truly testing their opponents skill and resolve (showing they're actually an enemy worthy of fearing) this "ancient magic" is used to suck all tension out of stories and give the character/s an excuse to mow through their opposition without worry.

Another idea that I love is the idea of Harry or someone practicing arcane magic and finds it lacking in someway (or gets it wrong). It is a great subversion of the trope and I like it, but I also think that the idea of arcane/ancient magic being more powerful than modern magics isn't inherently a bad thing.

I think in stories where that is the case, there should /ALWAYS/ be a part of the plot dedicated to the exploration of WHY it has fallen into disuse and HOW that came to be.

*《EXAMPLE》* A series I think tackles this idea very well (even though it isn't the best series overall) is the anime: Aldnoah.Zero.

To those who don't know, it is a mecha anime that involves a faction of humanity who left Earth for Mars when they discovered an ancient, alien technology there far more advanced and powerful than anything seen on Earth.

The things they could accomplish (which of course included powerful mechs with abilities far beyond anything Earth tech could achieve) were ludicrous and amazing. HOWEVER, the series focusses on a war between Mars and Earth. Stemming from socio-political issues within the faction of humanity that chose to live on Mars and denounce the rest of humanity as inferior.

/[Slight Spoilers]/ Despite how advanced their technology is, Mars is still a barren wasteland of a planet with the vast majority of the humans there living in abject poverty (teetering on starvation) as they cannot produce the same resources or quality of life that can be produced on the "primative" Earth. Leading to the Martian humans invading Earth for resources, believing the human race to be unworthy of it as the 'weaker species'.

During this war, the show truly shines when it shows off the differences between the human and the Martian's technology and way of combat. Where the Martians have clear advantages in every battle they enter, 9/10 they lose because of an intricate/creative strategy that the humans use AND/OR they lose to a weakness or deficiency they either: didn't notice, thought they could hide or arrogantly believed the humans either wouldn't discover in time and/or couldn't take advantage of.

A great example is when the human forces faced a mech that fired lasers. The lasers travelled in a straight line and could not hit the humans when they moved far enough away as they would not curve with gravity like the humans bullets did. Meaning that although their opponent WAS more powerful and deadly to them on paper, the Martian couldn't hit them but the humans were able to hit and kill him. The humans won by sniping him from far away and allowing the bullet to curve around the curvature of the Earth to do so.

A similar concept was used by a Martian in the second season, showing the benefit of one sides tactics in the hands of the other.

The series's saving grace is that it (though leaving much to be desired) explored the idea that superior technology/power does not inherently mean victory. And also the social and political issues that came with the clash of both forms of power/tech and the problems that effected the individual factions.

*/To Bring It Back To Harry Potter/*

A very, on paper, interesting idea I have always loved is that the Ministry regulates magic use and by making certain spells/rituals/practices illegal they push people away from them and allow them to either fall into obscurity. OR they actively ensure the public does not have access to said information. It is often, in stories regarding the use of Dark magic, used as a footnote and waved aside as a sort of explanation to palm off readers. But it very much deserves proper exploration in a fic or two.

One of my favourite little subplots in a fic (that I cannot remember the name of) involved a character going into the Ministry Archives for information and inadvertently setting off a trap set by people wishing for that info to stay hidden. She was later tortured, interrogated and murdered but managed to hide what she'd found somewhere that her allies could find it. Exposing a secret plot (and a secret order) dedicated to keeping the information a secret with members willing and able to do anything for that cause.

This is a stance I can 100% see the Ministry, Purebloods, Dumbledore (or ANYONE that the author decides on) taking to ensure some ancient power remains hidden from modern eyes.

Additionally, the idea that older forms of magic have some inherent downside that modern magic doesn't should (in my opinion) always be the case.

E.g: I've seen in several fics that wizards and witches transitioned to wands from the use of weapons and/or staffs because the former were easier to wield BUT lacked something in terms of power or finesse. An approach that should be taken is instead of making one inherently better than the other, an author should organically showcase the benefits and weakness of one and the other and have characters showcase the benefits and find work arounds (or ways to compensate for) and deficiencies.

If you want a fic where Harry learns "the ancient way of the sword", highlight how devastatingly powerful spells become AND any possible benefits it does for his physique or power. HOWEVER, highlight how unwieldy it is to both wield and carry a blade around, showcase uneasiness from characters who see him using or carrying a sword wherever he goes (perhaps have Professors and Aurors intervene when they see him blatantly carrying a weapon) and possibly have people either know off hand or discover what it is he's doing and find easy counters or work to hinder his learning.

The idea of some "ancient power" being introduced to a story for the MC to use does often lead to Mary/Gary Sue's; a critique of the trope is warranted and appreciated. But completely dismissing the idea out of hand because of poor writings involved with it is a bit unfair.

It can VERY EASILY be turned into a way to explore the world, showcase character developments and motivations (as well as expand out into new territories) whilst also delving into a new magic system as well as the existing magic system.

** */《CONTINUATION》/*

An idea to use is to have another character either know/figure out/learn or have learned the power the character is going to use.

E.g: perhaps Harry learns this "ancient way of the sword" and he decimates Voldemort in the graveyard. But he himself is blindsided when Lucius Malfoy whips a sword out of his cane and counters him with far swifter skill and experience. Having delved into it as a boy, believing it to be a technique only the Malfoy's still practiced.

Thus, Harry then has a reasonable adversary AND no longer has the element of surprise. Of course Voldemort would then fleece any knowledge/expertise he could from Lucius and be (at the very least) more prepared for a confrontation with this ancient magic in the future. Maybe even deigning that his followers MUST learn at least the basics, as the Light side would be just as ignorant to the techniques as they had been.

Immediately you've got even more intrigue. The Dark Side is more powerful and prepared BECAUSE Harry used this ancient magic (giving a tangible consequence to him whilst also ensuring he can't just mow down any opposition on his own) and you've also put the good guys on the back foot as this uber-powerful magic that was their trump card has fallen into the hands of the enemy. And they are woefully unprepared to deal with it, a dilemma that Harry could feel personally responsible for and lead to further character development.

An idea I ALWAYS subscribe to is that there is nothing wrong with tropes. The only thing right or wrong is how they are written. Subverting established tropes and ideas does not inherently make something good, following through with established ideas does not inherently make a piece of work bad.
