I have read no body told me the rules and the one with harry as an ice elemental (edit: the elemental's power (thanks [[/u/Triliro]]) but he seems to be missing from most of fanfom.


** Flamel pokes around a bit in this one, and it's rather well-written to boot: linkffn(10758358)

*** The only major flaw with this fic is the fact that currently, there are only 11 chapters.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

*** That's probably my favorite fic out of all the ones i've read. It may not be the best out there but I love it and its whole take on 'evil' and the training to actually be good at their powers and still need to work on beating 'evil'

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
