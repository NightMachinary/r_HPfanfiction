** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Irish Choice) uses that as its starting point, but it's not the focus of the story, if that's what you're looking for.

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

  The War is Over, Harry has won. But at what cost? At odds with Dumbledore, estranged from the Weasleys, betrayed by Lupin, Harry tries to carry on for his 7th year. Harry/Daphne. There will be Humor, there will be Romance, also Drama and Angst.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_fairy/pseuds/mad_fairy][mad_fairy]] I think the second book has a chapter of Harry receiving all his old mail and having to decide what to do with it. But it's more bittersweet rather than annoying.

** I remember a longer fic where he forced Dumbledore to give him access to all the mail that was diverted. I believe he set up some system where he paid students to sort all the letters and reply appropriately. Can't remember the fic from the top of my head though.

*** I know Three to Backstep by Sinyk had something like that, but it may have just been house elves sorting it.
