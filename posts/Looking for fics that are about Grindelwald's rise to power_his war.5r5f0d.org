Looking for fics that are about Grindelwald's rise to power and the war he started. Bonus if it's one of the following:

1. Is long (longer than 50k words)
2. Is set in America (basically Fantastic Beasts)
3. Details how he waged his war in Europe
4. Explores how he got on his feet as a Dark Lord

*** It's great, but it's also a bit dated. Some of the dialogue is clunky (lots of spelling errors too) and Grindelwald's first name being Albert and not Gellert kinda irks me. Still, it's a decent fic.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

*** They are even more difficult of a find than fics about Voldemort's school days/rise to power. Granted, they are far from the rarest and most difficult finds.
