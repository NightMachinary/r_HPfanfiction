I'm looking for a fic where the conversion rates for muggle money and galleons were so low, Harry withdraw galleons from Gringotts and took it to a gold exchange, then back to Gringotts to turn into galleons and rinsed and repeated a few times.

Edit: Found the time travel fic, it was Tipsy Time Travel Tale.

And I am now looking for a fic where a younger Harry was sent to juvie after breaking Dudley's arm or something, he decided he preferred juvie so much that he kept doing stuff to go back until his hogwarts letter came.
