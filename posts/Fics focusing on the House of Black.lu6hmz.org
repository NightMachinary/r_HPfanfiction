I've recently reread that fic, I think it was black resurgence, by phineasnigilous (I know that's wrong but I can't remember how to spell it) and was wondering if there are any other good fics out there that focus on rebuilding the house of black into something big? Preferably complete ones


** The Heir of the House of Black

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922]]

Harry dies and gets the option of going back to stop a new (post voldemort) threat. He goes back, but is born as an older brother to Sirius and Regulus. Marauders' era.

Tropes I normally don't like, but that are fine for me here:

OP Harry, Super political slytherin kids, specific pure blood social conventions
