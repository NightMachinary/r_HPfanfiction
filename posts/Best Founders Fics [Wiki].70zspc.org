Hey all! I'm trying anew segment of the wiki where we look at the specific different time periods in the Wizarding World. PM me if you think of a time period you want to see featured.

Recommend your favorite fanfics that take place in the Founders-era, and give a couple thoughts about the fic as well. Don't forget to use the FanfictionBot (see sidebar for usage)!

** linkffn(4610832) IMO, this is the best one of that era. It's good, maybe great, but more importantly it tells the story that you want to see, and that's the actual founding of Hogwarts, and it's complete. Could be improved, sure, but it is a nearly 10 year old story now.

Can you elaborate on this point? Frankly, just reading this makes me flinch away from this fic. Is Dumbledore as smart as in canon, or just a bumbling fool for Harry to beat up, who mutters "For the greater good" to himself?

#+begin_quote
  There is legend. And then there is truth. In 9th century England, three wizards band together, not to found a school, but to concoct one of the greatest lies ever told.

  And thus began the history of Hogwarts.

  AU. The Founders of Hogwarts were brave, witty, loyal and cunning. They were also drunk, besotted, sarcastic, proud, lustful, jealous, conceited, baffled, cursed -- and on speaking terms with an inebriated Glaswegian hat. Read the bits history missed out.

  The Founders have spent the last fifty years separated and drifting, but with Voldemort rising, they're headed back to Hogwarts once more. Between a wary Golden Trio, Umbridge, and Voldemort's shadowy plans, there's little time to deal with their own problems, even though Godric knows it's tearing the four of them apart---maybe even irreparably.
