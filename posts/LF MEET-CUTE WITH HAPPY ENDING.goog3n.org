Hi! I just watched this [[https://youtu.be/h7R5cnvtWAo]] And I'm so unsatisfied with the ending so I need a meet-cute fic with happy ending pleaseðŸ™ˆ I'm fine with anything really as long as it isn't awfully long

[[/u/Boris_The_Unbeliever][u/Boris_The_Unbeliever]] wrote a pretty awesome short in response to this prompt (the story is the top comment): [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bqjaxn/prompt_romantic_comedy_a_witch_and_a_wizard_meet/]]

If you yourself know of any good ones that you'd like to recommend, I'd be interested in reading them too :)
