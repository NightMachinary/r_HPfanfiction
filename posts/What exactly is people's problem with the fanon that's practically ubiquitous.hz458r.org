Harry is basically an anti-social face blind asshole who interacts with almost no one at school until his fifth year and even then knows practically nothing about any of these people he trains in defense. he met hermione's parents once in his second year but never talked to them or learned their names. He has almost no on page interaction with dean or seamus, two characters he should just based on logistics talk to nearly every day. he knows almost no one even in gryffindor outside of the quidditch team in higher or lower years. the first hufflepuff he deliberately talks to is like mcmillian and that's only so he can be a face to the distrust the student body has for harry in book 2. cho and luna the only ravenclaws

what is the problem with ice-queen Daphne? the official line is nothing. she basically doesn't exist. she may simply be name dropped once maybe?

Zabini/tracey/theodore/ millicent are at best name drops outside of millicents having a cat. fanon theo has an evil douche of a father, fanon zabini is a suave asshole with deeper connections on the continent, fanon tracey is a hanger on and occasionally a half blood, and fanon millicent is still largely a background character

wards aren't canon, congratulations? instead we will have unnamed and unexplored "protection spells". same with "notice me not" spells theyre not called that and we dont know what they are called but something in that vein exists.

ancient runes is reading old languages for no conceivable value as spells are still in faux latin. and they never bring any old cultures up anyway so its even further worthless. instead fanon made up an actual interesting idea by basically making it precursor to enchanting.

arithmancy is numerology based divination? so a fancy statistics course? but hermione thought divination was useless wishywashy nonsense but liked arithmancy? fanon made it into essentially magical theory and how to create spells. giving context to how snape might have come up with his own spells as opposed to just nothing.

sirius or snape or draco having no canon middle name just means we know less about them? like i guess you can fill in what you want but their fanon middle names are easily the most appropriate

being aggravated because you'd rather have less characters is crazy to me. being dismissive that people gave actual value to completely bland filler course work is silly. these characters not being an archetype does not make the setting richer or more nuanced by being closer to the original iteration.

it just makes it emptier.


** I like to pick and chose what is fanon-popular, my own HCs, and what I like of canon for my fics. But I've found gate-keeping (or whatever it's called) of canon to be really annoying. Especially the /really small stuff/ that doesn't affect the story or character at all.

I never really understood why people would get so annoyed about giving characters middle names or naming Snape Draco's Godfather. Like, it's not that big of a problem.

Also people hating on others making up magical things or using fanon-popular spells. I've seen some people create /whole school curriculum and lesson plans/ for 7 years of education on a topic that doesn't exist for a school that doesn't exist. That's some real dedication and love of the subject. Shouldn't be ridiculed because it's "not canon." It's a fantasy world where anything can happen. Let anything happen. Someone wants to have a spell that tells you the time? Let them. There is a spell for basically lighting your wand up like a flashlight (or torch if you're British). Why can't there be a clock/sundial spell.

Also on the protection spells vs wards? I prefer the word /wards./ Such a shorter word and it literally means the same thing. If I said /wards/, 99% of people would know immediately what that is. And if I needed to describe it "protection spells." Simple as that. Same thing, really.

But as far as the widespread hate of some fanon personalities:

For the characters that have little to no actual canon content, I think the issue people have is that the fanon versions of them (mainly speaking of the Ice Queen Daphne Greengrass) have been accepted so much as a replacement for canon that any other interpretation of them has been criticised negatively. So if someone maybe portrayed Daphne more like, let's say for extremes, a Luna-like personality or someone who's more excitable like Colin, then they might get hate for making her "out of character." Even though she has no real character. Also as a character who is basically a blank slate, there isn't a lot of variations seen in fics. It's all just slightly different temperatures of Ice Queen. Same can be applied to the other blank-slate characters.

Basically, let people enjoy what they enjoy. Don't sweat the small stuff. And if you really don't like it, just leave it alone.

*** like any good play there are stock characters the audience can identify. if the fanon mindset is that the blank slate daphne greengrass is an ice queen then that's what she is and therefore no longer is a blank slate. i hate this phrase so before im badgered for this but if enough people repeat a fantasy it becomes true. what therefore is the problem with her being that character?

isnt taking the name of this stock character now just supplanting that idea? if she is not this ice queen and is in fact a blank slate, why use her name at all? why not just make an oc? daphne greengrass is only familiar to anyone because of the fanon portrayals of her.

if Daphne is just a named female slytherin in the eyes of the author why even use her name if not to inhabit some of the fanon she embodies. pretty blue eyed blonde girl. except that's fanon too. and based on a non-speaking unnamed pretty slytherin actress in the movies. [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Unidentified_blonde_Slytherin_girl]]

[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_Me]] she used to be called queenie

she has a little sister and shes a pureblood slytherin in harry's year that's it.

she is literally from a list of names. going into a test. why choose her over tracey davis, lisa turpin, megan jones, Isobel MacDougal,Sophie Roper, Sally Smith, sally anne perkins or lily moon? all girls from that year with no dialogue

**** To keep consist, I'll keep talking about Daphne. It's probably /because/ her name is known. She is already established in canon as a existing and with a general appearance and stance in the Wizarding World. Even if it is the bare bones of a character. She has a general know appearance, is a pureblood, in Harry's year, and has a younger sister names Astoria who is also in Slytherin. Said sister who /also/ happens to marry Draco Malfoy later in life. One of the big names in the series, esp in Hogwarts years focused fics. So some people might chose to write about her more because of this somewhat more direct connection to a main-ish character (as far as fics go). Example: marriage contract fics where Daphne and Draco have to be nice because Astoria is marrying him.

For the others girls, excluding Pansy because she's the one Slytherin girl we know the most about, I've seen plenty of fics that use the other Slytherin girls, known and unknown, to write "different" Slytherin girls. But a decent portion of those are still only slight variations of the "cold, snooty, proper, pureblood girl." There isn't a lot of variation in Slytherin unless you're reading very deep pro-Slytherin-centric works. And as a Slytherin writer myself, it still can be hard to find those. (in my experience at least)

The idea of making a whole new character/OC is /possible/, but then for some writers that brings in the fact that they're adding OCs to the stories which can turn away some readers. Some writers might not want to do because even if we write for ourselves, we do want others to see the works. So losing a chuck of possible readers can be unappealing. Also with making OCs you need to create histories or backstory for their family that makes sense in the story. With how well the Slytherin families seem know who everyone it, it's a bit easier to just take a character that is already there, doesn't do much, and make them do stuff.

Basically, I think people are annoyed that the Slyhterin girls don't get more variations in personalities. And some writers might not want to upset the "canon" of the characters by writing them as different. I personally, don't think a lot of people who write HP fics are actually on reddit and don't know that Ice Queen Daphne/Slytherin Girls isn't as popular as it once was.

*** I genuinely don't understand the fairly recent obsession with canon on this sub.

Almost every prompt/request thread has people popping up with "you can't do that, it's nOt CaNoN".

I don't care! This is a fanfiction sub, I'm not interested in canon rehashes. If I want to read a fic where, for example, Draco Malfoy is a decent person (for some reason), don't lecture me about his canon character. I'm looking for a fic that changes the worldstate enough for this to make sense. If I want a fic where the author wants to create a proper magic system, and it happens to have runes as part of warding, don't lecture me that there aren't wards in canon. I know that, but since I'm on a fanfiction sub, /I don't want to read canon right now/.

I don't want to be that old fart who complains about the kids today, but I absolutely loved the creativity of the fandom back before all the books came out, especially before OotP.

Wanna read a fic where Harry is a vampire and there's an entire vampire culture with their own cross-continental government, of which Grindelwald is the head? Enjoy, here's a rec! Are you interested in an Order that actually does something instead of sitting around with their thumb up their ass? There you go, here's a fic where the Order is looking for international allies and has training facilities spread all over Eastern Europe! Voldemort wins AU? Body swaps? 8 different versions of Slytherin!Harry? Good Malfoys? More than the 5 spells that were used in canon? We had it all, and the more popular concepts made their way to other fics, eventually forming the fanon. Couldn't have that with the canon criers.

**** Generally speaking, the "that's not canon" response is generated by one of two things:

1. If someone makes a post where it appears that they have got canon wrong, then it seems justified for someone to correct them. E.g. if you make a prompt thread like "What if Lord Potter only had a trust vault?" then it sounds like you don't know that Lord Potter is a fanon invention and that in canon Harry only had a single vault. In this situation, correcting OP just makes sure that everyone is on the same page.

2. The poster is saying "that's not canon" but what they /mean/ is "that's worse than canon".

The issue is that fanon now acts as a constraint on creativity, not an impetus to originality - almost all fanfic is just an identical knock-off of other fanfic which has already been written 1,000 times. These days, the most original fics are those that go back to basics and root their story in canon, because there are so many parts of canon which the fandom has completely ignored and therefore feel fresh when a fanfic uses them.

There are thousands of fics which use the non-canon idea of magical cores, but only very few fics which depict magic in line with how it works in canon. So reading fics where magic is canonical feels more fresh and original than yet another magical core fic.

There are thousands of fics where Hermione is super!Hermione or traitor!Hermione or harpy!Hermione, but only very few which depict her character faithfully to canon. So reading fics where Hermione reflects her canonical self feel more fresh and original than another super!Hermione Harmony fic.

Etc.

That's a very good point and I wholeheartedly agree that going back to canon adherence can be a breath of fresh air, I just feel like the pendulum may have swung too far the other way.

We went from an abundance of original fics, the most popular of which launched fanon, to being tired of those tropes being overused and pushing hard the other way. Strict canon adherence can make for an excellent fic, but it can also make for a mind-numbing canon rehash, only typically with worse characterisation.

Both of those extremes are constraints on creativity, but I think letting fanfic writers (especially new writers) explore fanon concepts and potentially create something new and exciting is better than exasperatedly pointing at the books and saying "but it's not /there/".

In terms of canon divergence or AU (depending on how you look at it) the problem can be that people disagree about fundamental parts of canon.

eg: If Harry doesn't attend Hogwarts, do Ron and Hermione become friends? or What is Hermione's character?

** My problem is when, as a newcomer to the fandom writing my first fic, I'm told that I'm 'describing magic wrong' because I didn't use the fanon 'core' concept which I'd never heard of. Or if I already have my own head-canon for Daphne and Tracey's personalities, why should I have to change that because other people did it consistently a different way?

There is nothing wrong with developing off fanon concepts. But they shouldn't be required reading for everyone and they certainly shouldn't be used to attack anyone trying to make their own way.

Everything that's established now was risky and new once. Saying that risky and new shouldn't happen any longer doesn't make the fandom any richer or more nuanced, it makes it more rigid and lifeless.

Wards are a really interesting idea and a lot of magic like that has blurred with canon for me as I've read so much fanfiction and haven't read the actual series in so long.

** Warning: Long ramble incoming. I'll start off with the simple ones.

Ice Queen is simply all used up. It's been done to death and the corpse has been violated repeatedly. While there's nothing inherently wrong with the trope, it doesn't bring anything new anymore. I don't particularly mind it as long as it's not yet another Lord ManyNames Potter with his global economy crashing vault, shopping trip of power, meddling old coot rehashes. It nearly always is.

Theodore's father is canonically a Death Eater. This automatically makes Nott Sr. an evil douche (he was even arrested after the battle of the DoM). That said, I have no objection to the character of Theo getting some attention in fics, and I personally headcanon him as the Slytherin bookworm. Zabini is seen slightly more in canon (he actually got some lines!) and is clearly the typical junior Death Eater with a /Probably-Evil-Parent/(tm). I've seen him written well on several occasions, and have no objection. Tracey is canonically half-blood and that is literally all we know about her. I can take her or leave her. Millicent is canonically a half-blood, has a cat, and is described by Harry as looking rather like a hag. I would love to see a story where she actually /is/ half-hag, with a pureblood wizard father and a hag mother. That would be fascinating.

Now, onto the meat of the matter. The main ramble.

I've said it before, and I will say it again. I don't object to calling protection spells "wards". I object to the dull, unimaginative, /invisible walls that keep things out/ that every fic with "wards" seems to have. Contrarily, in canon we have the example of the muggle repelling charm. This causes muggles to suddenly "remember" something important they have to do, and thus, not go past it. What's more, these do not act as a radial "wall", but have to be cast all over a structure, as seen in GoF: "/Muggle-Repelling Charms on every inch of it. Every time Muggles have got anywhere near here all year, they've suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away again./" -Arthur Weasley. This charm (and /every/ canon protective enchantment /is/ a charm, but more on that later) shows a great deal of flexibility in design, since it doesn't prevent a non-magical from walking through physically, but instead suggests to them that they have somewhere else to be.

This follows along with the abstract nature of most of the HP magic system. A lot of it is silly, or strange, or illogical. Magic doesn't seem to have many rules, besides a passing mention of /Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration/ by Hermione. The reason for this of course, is that the series has soft magic. It's a plot device, not a true example of worldbuilding, hence the many plotholes in the books. This is one of the reasons the books were so successful, and it also offers an enormous amount of creativity for fanfiction. I would like to see more -sigh- "wards" that feature strange and unusual mechanics.

Want to protect your property from burglars? Place a curse that makes them think they're trapped in a maze that keeps leading them back out, no matter which way they choose. Or jinx your hedge to attack anyone that tries to climb over it. Enchant your dustbins to make a racket when anyone gets too close (hello Mad-Eye Barty), or enchant the front door to only open out the back door when anyone not allowed in tries to open it. They try to climb in the windows? They fall out of the upper floor. Climb down the chimney? The fire lights itself.

My problem with fanon wards is they're uninteresting and dull, and usually a sign of lazy writing. Invisible walls that keep things out are not creative and don't fit in with the illogical and crazy setting, and I personally find them boring. Other people may like them, and they are more than welcome to, but this thread was asking for why some people don't like common fanon tropes soooo...

Anyway, on to runes. Runes are the equivalent of us muggles studying Latin. Wizards study it so they can read old books, scrolls, etc. In Deathly Hallows, /The Tales of Beedle the Bard/ is written in runes. The reason they don't play a bigger role? They are mostly for scholars of old and esoteric knowledge. Not much of a common interest, especially for Harry and Ron, but I suspect most of the Ravenclaws took that class. Luna likely did, as well as her father, since some of the /Quibbler/ puzzles were written in runes. The fanon idea of runes as written magic /can/ be interesting, but I've rarely seen it done well. It's usually used for the purposes of enchantment, which already has an explicit canon method. Charms.

Yes, charms /are/ the canon enchantments. /The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1/ describes charms thusly: "/Charms differ from Transfiguring Spells in the following manner: a charm/ */adds certain properties to an object or creature/*/, whereas a transfiguring spell will change it into something utterly different./" This is why protective enchantments fall into the category of charms. Because enchantments and charms are the same branch of magic. Charms is in fact the largest branch of magic in canon, as all curses, hexes, and jinxes fall into the category of /dark charms/. Charms can be either permanent or non-permanent in canon, with permanent enchantments being called bewitchments. This is significantly under-explored in fanfiction. Authors try to create a new form of enchanting with Professor Babbling, when Professor Flitwick is already present, underutilised, and waiting patiently for his time to shine. How can so many people be ignoring the sad look he's been giving us all this time?

As far as arithmancy goes, it is considered a separate branch from divination because despite featuring numerology, it's not actually used to divine the future. The reason Hermione likes arithmancy despite considering divination to be -as you say- /"wishywashy nonsense"/ is that unlike tea leaves and crystal balls, arithmancy is used to calculate probabilities based on the magical properties of numbers. It is to divination what empiricism is to rationalism. It also seems to include a strong study of mathematics and accounting as well, which would certainly appeal to someone who prizes logic and reason over superstition and mysticism. However, due to it being the study of the magical properties of numbers, I actually approve of how it's been used as the prerequisite to spell-crafting in fanon.

I won't ramble too much on middle names, as I have no real opinion for or against them. I will say that Sirius is all but guaranteed to have a middle name, even though we don't know for sure what it is. A family like the Blacks wouldn't ignore a middle name for their firstborn only to bestow one on the second. The Malfoys could go either way, since we don't know if Lucius has a middle name or not. For Snape, I doubt if he has a middle name, simply based on his social class as a child. Middle names are more common among middle to upper class families, and the Snape family was definitely not middle or upper class. However, I also don't /care/ if Snape has a middle name in stories.

​

TLDR: Ice Queen is overused, the Slytherins are both over /and/ underused, wards are boring because they don't bring enough to the table, runes are for reading, Flitwick the Enchanter needs some love, canonical arithmancy is fine as it is, and middle names are a thing some people have.

As far as I can tell from my brief research, middle names were pretty common in Britain in the real/muggle world by the time Snape was born in 1960. You could argue that since the magical world seems stuck so far in the past, they might not have been common there. But since Snape's father was a muggle, I'd guess there's still a good chance he had one.

But it honestly makes no difference to me. I would much rather die on the "runes are useless" hill than the "Snape's middle name" hill.

** I feel like you're making two points but using the same word, so I've really got to give two answers.

​

1. Fanon as filler. There are gaps in canon and filling those gaps ain't bad. That's the short of it. I think people who object to extrapolating, inventing or even wholesale changing things where the arbitrary changes are signalled are odd. If you want to write Hogwarts as a castle in the sky rather than a castle on a mountain or anything like that then more power to you.
2. Fanon as orthodox - this is where I disagree with you. Daphne is the most famous and egregious example. She's a nothing character, you're right. Where fanon becomes pernicious is where it becomes obligatory. Lots of people like the idea of an ice queen daphne and so write that, as per point 1, that's fine. What becomes horrid is when the community definition of the blank slate becomes so ubiquitous that you can no longer deviate. You have to write an ice queen blonde Daphne. Stretch this to things at large, arithmancy, the wizengamot, school clubs. It constrains the writer in a way that isn't productive, and frankly limits pretty wonderful ideas. There are definitely people who will attack those who don't obey fanon, and even if it's not conscious then you get people when you're workshopping who advise do x, y, or z, as blind pattern repetition, even when it doesn't suit the story.

2 is bad. Fanon as rules is bad. 1 is good. 1 should be what fanon is, but 2 is what fanon looks like to me, increasingly, as we carry on. In the early noughties when the series was still coming out, you could five massively different (although often kinda rubbish) takes on the same magic system, characters, and plot. Nowadays, everything seems to be being more and more locked down into a particular flavour, and that's a shame.

** Fundamentally, I oppose all fanon in the sense of it being a "fan canon" - the idea that certain non-canon ideas should be considered a "default" - that Hermione's parents are Dan and Emma, or that Daphne is blonde, etc.

The /only/ default is canon, and even then it is only a default in the sense that it exists to be deviated from. No one wants a stations of canon fic (though the content of FF.Net would contradict that statement). To be clear, my opposition to fanon is independent of the content of an idea. Something can be a genius addition to the Potter universe but I would still oppose people treating it as if it has to be followed or its widespread unthinking adoption.

Establishing "fan defaults" is, I think, inherently harmful to the fandom. It is precisely that tendency which means we have 50,000 cookie-cutter identical independent Harry fics, all of them unreadably bad. We are surrounded by oceans of fics and the vast majority of them are unreadable, and a big cause of that is the fact that people just copy tropes. You could run a few Robst fics into a markov script and it would do a fair job of churning out much of the content of FF.Net.

The tendency of certain ideas to become "in fashion" within the fandom and then just be copied ad infinitum is the biggest barrier between the HP fandom actually creating worthwhile content. The reason why it's frustrating - the reason why it's not just a matter of shrugging and saying "c'est la vie" - is that you can easily see how great this fandom /could/ be.

Even now, years after the last HP book, the HP fandom is pretty large and active. There's a huge amount of manhours of labour going into HP fanfic every week. It's enormously frustrating to see those thousands of manhours being spent on churning out derivative copies of fics that have already been written 1,000+ times. Those same manhours, if directed towards producing more original content, could have easily resulted in a fandom so rich with ideas and innovation and content that you'd have great HP fics to read until the cows come home. Instead you have to sift through thousands of fics to find a single story worth reading.

On top of that issue, you also have the problem that most of these ideas being propagated are *not* genius but rather quite bad. Taking just the tropes you mention in turn:

- "Ice Queen Daphne" - bad because it's an unrealistic characterisation of a teenage girl.

- Theodore Nott coming from a Death Eater family is canon, as is Blaise being a ladykiller. So those aren't fanon tropes.

- Ancient Runes/Arithmancy: the problem with making them so useful or a core part of understanding magic is that they are electives. If you needed arithmancy to understand how magic works then it would be a core class; the whole purpose of Hogwarts is to teach students how magic works - learning the magical theory behind how their spells work is the primary activity students engage in during Charms, Transfiguration, etc. So it's a piece of worldbuilding which does not make sense with Hogwarts as established.

*Wards*

In canon, magic is categorised by magical discipline: Charms, Transfiguration, Dark Arts, Potions, Alchemy, etc. These are magically real categories, not just human categorisations of knowledge: for example, the limitation of the exceptions to Gamp's law apply specifically to Transfiguration magic, and Dark magic is said to share a quality of being difficult to reverse/undo.

The idea of a magical discipline of "wards" therefore creates the misleading impression that there is a distinct branch of magic which is concerned with erecting permanent protections over an area (and most fics which feature "wards" go on to detail such a discipline).

The reason I dislike this is because the magical discipline of "wards" is pretty uniformly worse than the canonical thing it replaces. In canon, when a wizard protects a place they have a diverse stable of methods open to them. Replacing all of these interesting and varied effects with "invisible magic walls with filters programmed into them" is, in my opinion, a terrible downgrade from canon.

The Shield Charm is basically the equivalent to the fanon "wards" (including its ability to block different things depending on the caster), which kinda says it all: what in canon is a single spell among a variety of choices, fanon turns into the only choice. In the canonical system, wizards might also:

- Prevent you from finding the location in the first place.

- Prevent you from entering the location by creating magically-enhanced physical barriers, such as an unbreakable wall which is enchanted to prevent you from flying over.

- Allow you to enter the location, but curse you for doing so.

- Allow you to enter the location, but have spells within the location to frustrate your objective.

- Place magical traps to harm you within the location.

- Have dangerous creatures/plants either at the entrance or inside the location to harm you.

- Allow you to enter the location, but require certain acts of you to permit you to reach your objective.

A rich variety of protections is, I think, objectively superior as a piece of worldbuilding to uniform deployment of invisible walls.

It's one of the reasons HP fanfiction was so inaccessible to me at first, even after reading all the books, there was over a decade of fandom discussions and establishing new tropes and concepts that I hadn't been a part of, so plenty of popular stories were nearly unintelligible until I got used to it.

The authors, as far as I can remember, don't contradict her characterization and I think that's my biggest problem. Take canon Fleur. Love her. She shits on both Hogwarts and the Burrow and isn't necessarily nice to Ginny and Molly despite being engaged to Bill. She continues to be snooty and opinionated.

Traditionalist Daphne is a huge fan of Hermione. Ice Queen Daphne? Super emotional and very friendly with Harry's people. If I thought I could pull it off I'd write an HP/DG where she remains standoffish with his friends and Hermione is validly against the pairing without being bashed for it.

Ah, in that case we agree. I simply had't considered to call an emotional "Ice Queen"!Daphne an "Ice Queen" or a traditionalist!Daphne who's BFF with Hermione a "traditionalist" in the first place. Show > Tell. Regardless of how many times you say it, if you're not really writing it, it's not what you say it is. And that really limits the available stories drastically when searching for this trope.

The funny thing is that "Ice Queen" has become the new blank slate, after people with mindsets like OP started writing Daphne: She's the "Ice Queen", so they call her that, and then write whatever character to fill the moniker. I've seen supposed "Ice Queens" that were everything from Sporty!Girl to Hermione Mk.2. FF is weird.

Also, I've so far skipped out on Contractual Invalidation because marriage contracts make me just roll my eyes regardless of how subverted that particular nonsense is, but maybe it's time to take a peek. Rise of Wizards I've read, does she feature prominently in the other two?

Well, if only :P (Toss me a few links containing either, if you have them -- OTTOMH, I know my own story for the "bitch" category, and the Malachite series for an insane Daphne, and that's it.)

My experience is that the typical execution consists of (1) name dropping "Ice Queen" a lot in the first chapter, (2) making a token effort to portray someone stand-offish by repeating the words "mask" and "said coldly" a lot in the second chapter, and (3) throwing all that away and writing a generic girl-next-door as soon as Harry starts interacting with her in the third chapter.

ginny says Zabini is “Talented... at posing” so his views might not mean anything. zabini then scoffs at draco believing he'd be useful to voldemort and when harry is mentioned as special.

Many people still consider the interviews canon, but only if they do not contradict the books, if there's a contradiction then books take the priority and that phrase is simply brushed aside as irrelevant. So, since there isn't anything to contradict anything she says about Theodore Nott, most people will take it as canon at face value. There are of course people who do not consider them canon, and they have every right to, books are the most solid.

But I do agree with you that it can get quite annoying, however, I think most people on this sub spring up with the 'not canon' arguement when it's presented as fact during a discussion about the events of the books themselves, or the actions of characters. Then, I think it's right to call out misconceptions. The not canon arguement on prompt posts have been heavily downvoted, from what I've seen on here, but maybe I'm just not around much.

** I dislike the whole idea of 'fanon' at a pretty basic level.

Now, if it was really just laziness, I don't think I'd care as much. Lazy is, often, fine. Lazy, when applied to aspects of a story that are generally unimportant is not really lazy at all, it's simply efficiency. I really don't care what Sirius', James', or Snape's middle-names are; they are wholly irrelevant. They could all have no middle name at all, or James' could be James Reginald Spatchcock Robert Scrofwaffle de Humbert Potter and it would still be irrelevant to pretty much every story. So I guess if you absolutely /must/ give him a middle-name it may as well be Charlus (or whatever the 'correct' fanon is), but the thing is you probably don't actually need to.

If you really don't care about the magic in your story, if it is pretty much just set-dressing, then by all means, throw runic wards, and spell-creation arithmancy around as much as you like. Of course, both of these are 'technical' topics, and so I would ask why you are addressing the technical aspects of those things in a story where they don't matter.

But the old 'fanon' ideas are just a useful crutch for a writer looking to avoid going into needless detail on a largely irrelevant topic. Far more often than I'd like they're used as a stick to beat over writers' heads.

So, fanfiction has this slightly unusual thing where the willing suspension of disbelief of readers is somewhat less reliable than in original fiction. In original fiction, the story can state that a thing is this way, and not bother to explain the 'whys' and 'hows' of it unless they are somehow important to the plot, or seem to contradict some previously established story element. In fanfiction, this can still be done, but it /cannot/ be done with established canon elements. This is fair, they are, essentially, previously established story elements, and if you want to include something that seems to contradict such an element, then you either need to explain why the contradiction is not a problem, or explain that it is an intentional departure from canon. This is fine. It often leads to sections of bloated exposition that, in an original story, would not need to be present, but it's the price of doing business in someone else's creation.

The problem comes when you have to do that same amount of work to explain or back up any changes you make from not only canon, but 'fanon' too. Especially as there are many different versions of some 'fanon'. Some people will take issue with transfiguration being permanent, while others will take issue with it being temporary. If you include either of these explicitly, you can expect to get some shirty reviews, unless you add a pointless paragraph of exposition where the character reflects on exactly why transfiguration works that way, so that readers are signalled to understand that 'this is an intended departure from established norms'.

Therein lies the problem. Either writers have to bloat their stories explaining away minor elements that in all likelihood are pretty much irrelevant (lest they draw the ire of the Keepers of the Fanon), or they stay quietly and obediently within the lines.

I don't know about you, but at this point I want to see something original from the stuff I read. If you're going to make some aspect of magic important to your story, please, please, /please/ don't just make it an off-the-shelf 'runic magic' system. I've read it before. A hundred times. At least.

"Ha! Runes is just language no magic in it! No Enchanting"

Well, fuck you then, because that's the most useless boring crap ever to learn in a magical school, what are you going to use it for? It's not even futhark, is it written somewhere? Who used it? Why learn it?

"Lol! Arithmancy is divination through numbers, not Magical Theory!"

And here we have Hermione studying it for 4 /years/ while saying Divination is bollocks, fuck that, numerology is just a part of divination, Magical Theory and applying calculus to it is much more interesting.

"You can't make spells in other, old languages."

And how does one make a spell then? Do the Japanese Wizards speak faux Latin, what about the Chinese Wizards whose language /predates/ Latin. How did Harry cast a perfect Sectumsempra by only saying the words and not knowing what it would do, did Snape list it in the "Master List of Spells?" Is it like Eragon, is faux Latin the absolute language of magic?

Let's be real here, JKR didn't give two fucks about what these things(Ancient Rune and Arithmancy) entailed, they never come up as important, they are only there to fill the blanks and so Hermione can use the Time-Turner. She never used it other than 'Hey, 7 is a significant number.' Well, newsflash anyone who looks in the direction of any occult, magical or cabbalistic book learns that. And I /think/ the book Dumbledore gives Hermione is written in runes, that's it. Boring.

Runes being used to enchant or anchor magic is /much/ more interesting, engaging and opens a whole lot of opportunities to expand the magical system. You can even keep it's use as a language and it allows you to introduce real runes like Elder and Younger Futhark, and even other pictographic languages.

Arithmancy being magical theory with applied mathematics is an awesome idea, and fits well with the victorian feel of some of the magic we see in the series.

And how people completely misunderstand wards is beyond me. It's not a dome shield every time, it's any spell that's anchored to a place, people anchor it with wardstones and stuff in some fics, but it's not needed it. It can be an anti-apparition jinx, it can be a muggle repelling charm, it can be a spell that makes people unable to make noise if the person who's in control of the spell commands it. The whole apart about creating a system for it makes it interesting.

I know some people want fanfiction that's extremely canon-compliant and little else, but honestly, this becomes /boring/ fast. Canon magic system is very unclear and plot devicey, JKR already said time and again she did not paid attention to all details, just those important to the plot and some fluff.

She's not Tolkien, nor Martin and there's nothing wrong with that.

** Why does it matter what is canon in the first place??? It's fan fiction. Yeah there's gonna be some that follows canon and is based on canon... but unless it's written by jk herself it has no effect on the whole whether or not it follows canon... It's people's interpretations or playing with the setting and/or characters...

I'm just very confused to be honest. Idk

** Because god forbid people on this subreddit like something that isn't written by JKR. No one else complains like this. Seriously, this past week I've seen ten different posts whining that fannon isn't shoving cannon down the reader's throat.

People get so mad when you call something a ward, and it makes no sense. It's just a fucking name, and it's shorter than having to type out "herp-derp protection jynx/charm/spell" twenty times.

Let em bitch, this sub will never be satisfied. It used to be so much different here.

Isn't that wacky, I don't care about them either. If your belief that he has not made any effort to get to know them is based on it not being shown, please ask yourself who has been shown to make an effort to get to know Harry? I'm pretty fucking bamboozled as to how it's a dick move to let people remain strangers when that's what they want.

This got me thinking...most of the children who /do/ introduce themselves aren't exactly people I'd want to hang around. Starting with Hermione and Draco. Book 2 is Justin and Colin, who was a fan boy, you have Romilda later on.

** I read somewhere this and now it's my headcanon -

Arithmancy is numerology based divination and is necessary for spellcasting because it predicts the chances of a spell modification to work. It's superb because it means you can't just do a bunch of math to make spells but you need creativity and math just predicts if it will work outb or not.
