** The Life and Times, linkffn(5200789) is pretty popular. I liked the writing style, chapter length, and that each chapter has a mini story going on. The characters are well done, and the OCs are really good too. Personally I don't usually like when every once-mentioned adult from the series is lumped into the same year or two (Alice and Frank were probably much older than the Marauders tbh; plus I don't think they knew Marlene McKinnon outside the Order), but I loved this fic anyways.

*** I love this fic, it's one of my favorites but I really wish it was updated more frequently. What was the last time, 2013?

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

** Timely Errors by Worfe is one of my favourite stories that fit this category. Harry goes back in time, and goes to school with his parents. (It's way better than I make it sound in that short description ;) ) linkffn(4198643)

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

  Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters. AU Sequel posted: The Moment It Ended.

  "What we need," Dumbledore said slowly, "is more time." He looked at his watch, "three turns should do it, Miss Granger. Good luck." Only Lady Luck wasn't on time. Time went back, but not to when it should have. "Well, we came from the future, but apparently it wasn't two hours ago as we first thought and if that really is Remus Lupin, I'd wager we went back twenty years..." AU
