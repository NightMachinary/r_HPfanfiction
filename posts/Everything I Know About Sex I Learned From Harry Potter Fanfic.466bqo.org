** I really like sex in fanfics because while it's a bunch of unrealistic fantasies, so is porn, but fanfic sex is usually catered towards women's fantasies and porn towards male fantasies.

It's interesting to think about women's fantasies and sexualities being devalued in mainstream, "profitable" culture and fanfiction and the oft-derided romance novel genre addressing that need. I find it almost as interesting as always!a!girl fanfics addressing the lack of interesting female protagonists in profitable popular franchises. See: genderswapped Avengers, etc.

** It looks like Buzzfeed is embracing fanfic, even though their best of list was shit.

Also, a bit of a tangent: didn't we all take smut with a grain of salt back in the day? I'm genuinely curious as to whether people seriously thought fics were fairly accurate in terms of sex. I can be pretty awkward, so I assumed it would be more awkward than depicted...

*** Actually, since it's been brought up...this was a hot topic about six months ago or so in the Star Trek Yahoo group I frequent. There was a minor rant session about the annoyance of young authors writing slash with no idea how sex works, let alone gay sex, followed by a discussion about the responsibility of writing sex somewhat accurately, because as it turns out, a lot of us had got our sex education from fanfic, as horrifying as that sounds. Whether it's because of family choices or shyness or poor education on the topic at school, a lot of people were confessing that Kirk and Spock doin' it in a crappy fic was their first introduction to how sex actually works. With no experience or frame of reference, many of us (when we were young and naïve) took smut completely at face value.

It was simultaneously one of the most awful and one of the most fascinating discussions I've ever been a part of, and at the end we all agreed that sex ed in the US needs a serious overhaul....

**** I wouldn't say I got my sex-ed from fanfic, but it sort of normalized sex and relationships for me. I didn't seek out smut but I would read fics regardless of rating.

So if sex ed classes taught me the mechanics, fanfic taught me that sex was a normal healthy thing that people did.

***** I second this. I come from a surface-conservative, Catholic country so I'm actually grateful to fanfiction for somewhat shaping my views on relationships.

And CardCaptor Sakura, who taught me that love is love, haha.

**** Yeah it does. I was just curious. Like I said, I always assumed I wouldn't be as suave as the characters in fics were, so I didn't think it was realistic for me at least. Wondered if the cool kids thought it might be accurate.

But I can really understand your point when it comes to gay sex, especially for kids that aren't in LGBT friendly environments, as the author somewhat mentioned.

*** I sure didn't. My intro to sex was at 11 or 12yo with a BDSM fanfic of Hermione and Draco..

Also my introduction to fetishes and fanfic, oddly enough.

**** Mine was similar. I was actually put off fanfiction and even the internet for a while because my first exposure to Harry Potter fanfiction was some of the really messed up stuff on restrictedsection.org. I was only about 13.

** That was a much more interesting read than I was expecting when I clicked a buzzfeed link.

*** They've been doing a series, apparently. They had a another list of recommended fanfics that was a bit better than the first one.

  Except the secret world of the internet is a lot more fucked up than the Wizarding World, not least because Harry/Hermione ‘shippers live there.
