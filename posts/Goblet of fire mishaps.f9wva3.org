Barty Crouch jr. screws up the confundus charm on the goblet badly, causing everybody who entered their names to be selected as champions


** Alternatively, the confounded goblet forgets the difference between a /student/ and a /school/, and now the entire student population of Hogwarts has to compete for the honor of Cedric Diggory.

** The goblet burned steadily as the three schools wrapped up their dinner. For a short time immediately following dessert there had been a hush over the crowd, but people were quietly chatting again. They still glanced over at the goblet and at the staff table ever few seconds, but nothing seemed to be happening, so they would keep waiting.

After several more minutes of waiting, Dumbledore stood and walked over to the goblet and gave it a few exploratory taps with his wand. The chatting stopped as they watched him fiddle with the cup. His face grew concerned and he cast something that sent a cold glow across the great hall. The glow collected and sank into the goblet before Dumbledore gave it a few more taps. He straightened and collected his features then said, "Ah, yes. It seems we were a bit premature. The Triwizard Tournament will not be conducted this year. The goblet has postponed it for two years." Then he excused himself and the diners, directing them back to their regular schedules and apologizing to Beauxbaton and Durmstrang.

Harry Potter had a perfectly normal year 4 at Hogwarts.

*** Crouch's confundus absorbed intent from the age line and convinced the cup that it couldn't choose anyone below year 6, but also that it had to choose Harry, so the goblet is waiting.

** A blast of fire shot from the cup. Dumbledore snatched the paper from the air, looked at it and smiled. "Tom Riddle must compete or lose all magical powers. The first task is submitting oneself for arrest."

*** There are zillion of these. Just randomly linkffn(13182437), which contains my beloved dialogue (after Ron storms off for Hermione not making him champion when she admitted of putting Peter Pettigrew and Tom Riddle through it):

#+begin_quote
  'Ron,' Hermione said in an uncomprehending voice, 'you do realize that I deliberately entered Wormtail and Riddle in the hopes it would turn out to be a deathtrap, and whoever entered Harry was undoubtedly thinking the same thing?'

  'What the bloody Hell does that matter?' Ron demanded. 'Why did you go to all that trouble for that pair of Dark wizards, but not me? And you really expect me to believe you entered the two of them and someone else just so happened to enter Harry - the one of us you like better? That would be a bloody great coincidence, wouldn't it?!'

  After a confusing but heated argument, Ron stormed off. The two of them stared after him, then turned to each other.

  Hermione was the first to speak. 'I'll tell you mine if you tell me yours,' she said to Harry. 'Ravenclaw.'

  After a moment, he understood. 'Slytherin.'

  Silent understanding passed between them as they held eye contact. 'I don't understand Gryffindors,' Harry said eventually.

  'Neither do I.'

  Hermione realizes that some nonsense will inevitably befall Harry on Halloween 1994 and decides to soften the blow by inviting two more unwilling Champions to the Tournament: Peter Pettigrew and Tom Riddle. [Parody. Crack. Oneshot. Ron, Dumbledore, and Fudge bashing.]
