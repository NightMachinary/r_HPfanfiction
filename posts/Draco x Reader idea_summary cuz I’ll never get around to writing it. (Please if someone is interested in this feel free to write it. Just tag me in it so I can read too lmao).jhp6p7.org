Reader is a muggle born Slytherin and is constantly bullied for this, especially by Draco who is constantly trying to convince her she doesn't belong in Slytherin. Because of this she become close friends with students from other houses (maybe hermione and/or Luna) as well as a couple Slytherin students who aren't pure blood elitists. Eventually (preferably in between years 1 and 4), Draco comes across the reader alone and crying in one of the many barren classrooms (he was planning a mean trick against a Gryffindor student and was looking for supplies). He watches her for a moment in confusion and slight pity before the reader notices him and quickly tries to act like everything is fine. In his typical apathetic attitude, Draco insists she pulls herself together and gets a move on to their next class so the house doesn't lose points, but in a brief moment his face flashes of genuine concern. Later on during HBP, Draco and the reader haven't had too many interactions besides either teasing her in or between classes, or standing aside nonparticipatingly as others bully her. One day as he heads to the girls lavatory to talk to myrtle as he is having a panic attack like in the books, he comes across the reader who is having a full on break down and is crying and panicking over both the constant bullying, the fact that Voldemort is back and she fears for her life as a muggle born, and so on. Draco again stops and watches for a moment, remembering back when he first came across her crying. He tries to back away but accidentally bumps into something and alerts the reader of his presence. The reader tries to confront Draco and convince him it was nothing but then myrtle makes mention of dracos frequent visits to her and hints at his breakdowns prompting the reader to question Draco about his visits which causes Draco to get angry and upset. This causes the reader to get scared for a moment as Draco clutches his wand, but he quickly drops it before collapsing to the ground, crying himself at not wanting to be feared by everyone and not wanting to go through with Voldemort's order. The story from here on out can progress on in whatever way you want, I just wanted to write this as I've seen so many Draco x reader fanfics where the reader and Draco are already dating and/or Draco is incredibly out of character so I thought “eh why not just braindump this idea onto reddit so they can deal with it?”
