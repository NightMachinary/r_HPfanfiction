I have been thinking about writing a fic for awhile now and would like to do my version of what happens after the end of DH. I have noticed that mostly canonical Post-DH fics don't get a lot of lave around here. I don't see them being unfairly hated on here either though. I am curious though to all of you what would you like to see in a fic filling in those lost years?


** The problem with these fics is that they tend to be hurt/comfort and don't really go anywhere. Reading about the slow process of grief doesn't make for an exciting story, though there are several of these fics I enjoy as guilty pleasures. I'd like to see one of these fics that had a complex, overarching plot beyond "everyone feels sad that Fred died". Sometimes people throw in a death eater out for revenge or something, but it's just not enough to hold most people's interests.

*** You are right that this is how most of these stories end up, that and a boatload of wish fulfillment. I would like to focus more on action and harry as an auror. Finding a good antagonist is hard though. But there would be ALOT of aftermath to deal with from the war.

****** There so many "immediately after DH" fics though. They all go like this:

-Harry gets his sandwich

-Harry sleeps for ages

-When he wakes, other characters remark on how long he's been sleeping and how exhausted he must be (the fact that they all fought in the battle is ignored)

-Everyone cries about Fred

-Harry and Ginny reunite OR Ginny won't take Harry back for contrived plot reasons

-Fred has his funeral and everyone is sad

-Harry meets Teddy and is sad

-They all go to the Burrow and everyone is sad

-Harry and Ron become Aurors.

-Everyone is sad.

-A Death Eater wants revenge.

-Everyone is sad.

When it came to this point in my fic, I just gave a one chapter summary of all this because I was boring myself trying to write it. I feel like it's better to start a few months/years later and skip all that stuff entirely.

I've read *Grave Days* by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]], linkffn(5486257), and that's good enough for me.

On the other hand, I tremendously enjoy fics like *Children's Crusade* and *Failsafe*, linkffn(6989327;11281891), where things were still canon compliant, but the heroes went into some real adventures.

** Here's what I look for in a canon compliant post DH fic:

- grief, potential panic/anxiety disorders, ptsd. Something that acknowledges the mental effects of war and death
- rebuilding the school, the difficulties regarding length of time, money, people
- laundry list of funerals- they don't have to be shown on the page, but there's going to be a lot of them and if the fic centers on one of the Trio, they're going to be aware of them
- ministry upheaval- they've gotta essentially rebuild the government after the death eater coup.
- recruiting the fighters from the Order and the school into the auror academy ASAP, and other departments being more lenient on their entry requirements because their workers are either dead or were death eaters, or the potential applicants they had fell victim to the war.
- the series of events that turned Ron from Auror to working in WWW.
- public reaction to the proposals or laws passed thanks to Hermione
- trials, and public outcry due to the results of some of them (Lucius for example)
- possibly some of the auror training itself, /if/ it's focused around Harry. Otherwise just background mentions of the training; I don't like reading Harry automagically being an auror just because if his /experience/. That's how people get killed.
- stick around long enough for the first kid from that generation to be popped out, /or/ things to hit a happy stable point where they decide it's time.

(A lot of this can be background goings-on, like rebuilding the school if the protagonist isn't directly involved, as long as it's mentioned as being done.)

** I would enjoy seeing post-DH Harry as a trainee Auror if it was done right. Things I would like to see:

Firstly, no "Auror Academy". The Aurors only recruit a new Auror every few years. There's no academy. It's going to be on-the-job training.

Secondly, a suitable antagonist. This is where most stories trip up, because it's very hard to navigate. Firstly, no Voldemort resurrection, heir, or anything like that. It's just cheap. Secondly you can't have a villain who is anything like Voldemort in terms of threat level. We need to be looking at a criminal here, not a evil mastermind threatening to take over the country. Not only would that be repetitive, it also (again) cheapens Voldemort. But you also can't make the villain so trivial as to be boring. They have to be legitimately dangerous.

So this is a hard balancing act - a villain not so strong as to step on Voldemort's toes, not so weak as to be easy. A /clever/ villain as opposed to a powerful one is a good direction to go here. Someone who forces Harry to use those mystery-solving skills he used so much in the earlier HP books. I quite like the idea of a Healer gone rogue, or someone doing cruel magical experiments.

Thirdly, an interesting Auror Office. The fandom has largely made Aurors boring and nerfed them a lot, often making them cannon fodder or little more than police. They're Dark Wizard Hunters, not police. They should be depicted as Ministry-authorised wizard bounty hunters, each with their own preferred style and tactics. Get rid of the standardisation, the ranks. Introduce some real /magic/ into the occupation.

Fourthly, and related to the above, an interesting setting that throws characters together. The reason why the fandom is so reliant on Hogwarts as a setting is because it has so much utility. It's full of unknown areas to explore, it provides characters with plenty of opportunities to interact in different settings and to socialise with new people, and it holds resources that characters can use to help move the plot along. A post-Hogwarts fic needs to flesh out a setting which also allows these things to happen but which doesn't feel like a Hogwarts-copy (see above: no Auror Academy).

Fifthly, it should feature a good character arc for Harry. We know he ends up Head Auror one day, so we should be seeing the development of his leadership instincts as well as his skills as an Auror. He should be gaining confidence and learning to assert himself. Possible points to cover in this area are any effect the loss of the scarcrux has had on Harry, his apparent but ambiguous mastery of Occlumency at the end of DH, maybe a continued interest in wandlore, and indeed any lingering magical effects of having died and come back.

Sixthly, it should have some political element. Some fics overdo this and in doing so rather undermine Harry's victory at the end of DH, which I don't like. We shouldn't be seeing a Ministry dominated by pure-blood groups and ideas. But the fic should deal with the idea that at least some of those people are still around, that there has had to be some kind of post-war compromise/amnesty, that Harry's victory was not completely 100% clean. And of course even without pure-blood prejudice, there's plenty of room for Ministry politics.

Seventh, some romance would be nice. Nothing too dominant, but it should be present. Harry's becoming an adult and his relationships should too. My own preference is for him not to immediately get back with Ginny, or for them to have broken up. Just to have some level of ambiguity, though we know he will eventually marry her. If we're fleshing out him out as a young adult, it should feature more than a high school sweetheart relationship. That's fine when the story ends at age 17, but not so good if you're actually covering those years in detail. If you wanted to go for something dramatic then you could have a Harry/Fleur affair as they get closer via Teddy and Victoire. That would lead to a lot of drama when discovered. Probably too much drama for my liking, but it's an idea.

Eighth, the fic shouldn't ignore Ron and Hermione. They should still be best friends with Harry and ideally even contribute in some sense to the central conflict/mystery. But at the same time we want Harry to be making new friends/interacting with some new people.

Finally, two things that the fic shouldn't involve:

Firstly, anything Master of Deathy. Done to death (!) and generally misses the entire point of the "Master of Death" title.

Secondly, any kind of armchair psychology, emotional breakdowns, overwrought psych issues etc.

canon compliant, you mean? If yes, I personally have absolutely no interest. Its been done ad nauseam (Not to mention that canon epilogue is probably the worst part of all books combined).

My personal favorite would be Harry finally doing all those things he never did and in order to do so, travels the world and finds his place somewhere, where people don't see him as the Man-Who-Conquered (or other stupid nicknames). I've read enough grief stories (or didn't read... I tend to close them pretty quickly).

I still remember that I read the last part of the book in a very salty mood because of the kiss Ron and Hermione shared. I was young and hated Ron's character since he left the tent - it was the last nail into the coffin for him in my books.

I still just close stories with the epilogue intact. Thats probably because I never liked H/G and still heavily dislike Hr/R. Not to mention that any parent who names his child Albus Severus is to be thrown through the Veil. Hermione also knows better than to Hugo a child. Also, it always baffled me that the husband of Hermione Granger would remain her husband after hexing a muggle into giving him a driving license...

** When it comes to post-DH, I prefer EWE fics. I think it's because I never wanted Harry to become an auror, so I like fics where he chooses another career (sometimes the more unusual, the better, lol. Avenger!Harry for example). Before DH, I was hoping he'd end up as the new DADA professor. I'm actually still hoping he signs on in the future after retiring from the aurors.

I do like some fics:

- where the characters are trying to figure out what normal life feels like. These usually work out great as vignettes.
- where people try to get over wrong things they might have done in the name of survival
- Or where the characters from the losing side (like Draco) figure out where to go from now on, when their world has essentially been turned upside down around them

** I'm a slash/het multi-shipper but when it comes to post-DH fic (esp. post-epi) I /only/ read slash (well, for Harry-centric fics, anyway). I can't stand Harry/Ginny in any capacity so I don't bother reading most gen-ish canon-compliant post-DH fics, either.

That being said, it would be pretty cool to read a fic that focuses on Harry's career as an auror. Something that covers his admission to the program and training, how other people act towards him/treat him, how he deals with the attention and expectations, etc. And on a larger scale, the aftermath of the war itself--the "clean-up," (i.e., rounding up fleeing Death Eaters, dealing with sympathizers, etc), the trials, the funerals and celebrations, the rebuilding of hogwarts/the ministry/Azkaban/etc, politics, etc.

I would definitely read something like that if there wasn't too much focus on Harry/Ginny.

*** I am definitely looking to do a fic along these lines with him as an auror because it seems like most people want to see something like that. It will be Harry/Ginny but I am not a romance writer and have no desire to be. So it shouldn't be too heavy on that side of it.

** Basically, anything but the canon "pairings". Something like Harry and Hermione both paired with OCs, and Ron with Luna, but with the trio remaining super-close friends. None of the "Albus Severus" or "Lily Luna" Big Fat Weasley Family bollocks...

Honestly, I'd really love to see Hermione get totally fed up with the Magical world, use a time-turner to study for A-levels, and go to Muggle university - while still keeping contact with Harry and Ron.

I'd read that, :D. I'd even read a Harry version, or one of the other muggleborns. I've been hoping to come across a Justin-centric fic for a while now.

*** Like I said I prefer the canon pairings but something like that wouldn't be too bad. As long as it isn't H/Hr. I can not even fathom that pairing I think it would be much more of a disaster than Ron and Hermione.

***** Yea I can never imagine the two of them together. They both have much to intense and obsessive personalities. That why I actually believe that a Weasley each offsets that and makes them bearable.

** No Albus Severus Potter.

Rounding the Dementors.

Harry is the DADA professor instead of an Auror, and is distrustful of the wizarding world.

**** It just always occurred to me as a natural result, both of Harry's passion for the subject, the DA, and because his two foils - Snape and Voldemort - both desired the position. It would also mean that Harry would get to stay at Hogwarts, which he considers his true home.

Despite his ambition, Harry doesn't seem to me like the Auror type - to me it looked like he wasn't really interested in catching dark wizards as much as bringing down Voldemort and his followers, and it's odd that he would like to work for the Ministry. His last words before the epilogue are "I've had enough trouble for a lifetime", which doesn't quite work with going on chasing dark wizards.

Also, I'm sick of the "tough, grizzled Auror" trope. Cop stories just aren't my thing.

** Canon-compliant up until that epilogue? Yeah, that's doable and there are some awesome post-Hogwarts fics.

It is a very rare fic that can be epilogue-compliant /and/ hold my interest. I can think of two off the top of my head, linkffn(Clash by shezwriter) and linkao3(Sisyphus by esama). And that second one is only compliant by the barest of margins.
