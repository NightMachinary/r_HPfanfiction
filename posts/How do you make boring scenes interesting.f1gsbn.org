This is an opinion poll, not an advice thread. I'm just curious what other people do, what your 'process' looks like, so to speak.

As I'm sure all of us have experienced at one point or another, many stories in this fandom have very long, very boring shopping scenes in which a protagonist (usually Indy!Harry) essentially completes a 'badass shopping list' of tools and things that supposedly sound cool to have. They're rarely interesting, and many items are often never used or seen again. They're often regarded as somewhat obligatory for certain tropes like the aforementioned 'Independent Harry', though.

It got me thinking - how do/would other people (that's you all who will pretty please comment, FYI) make scenes like that interesting? Do you add a confrontation with a future enemy (read: the Malfoy-Weasley fight in canon)? Foreshadow an apocalypse with a town crier yelling Dawn of the Dead/The Last of Us style zombie-warnings? Or hell, do you just ignore them entirely and, to continue the example, handwave them away with a 'He picked up the magic item he'd bought early, grinning as he remembered the hardcore bargaining he'd done to get that half-price discount.' line later on?


** If you have a scene which you don't find sufficiently interesting yourself, why in the world you think your readers will enjoy it? Cut it out, immediately.

*** This. Make boring scenes interesting by getting rid of them!

If a scene doesn't either advance the plot or character development, think realllly hard about whether it should be there or not. Maybe it has good world-building, or you like it for another reason, like being good fluff. But if it serves no purpose, why have it at all?

*** I take the opposite approach. If you're writing a scene and it's boring, then you should keep adding stuff to it until it's interesting.

One big difference between fanfic and JKR's originals is that JKR always has her scenes serve multiple purposes - character, plot, worldbuilding, humour, etc. In contrast, most fanfic scenes focus on doing a single thing.

That is where the problem of boring scenes comes from - because sometimes, the plot requires something to happen but it's a bit boring to write about. Nonetheless the writer feels stuck because the scene is necessary - without it, the plot won't work.

The solution isn't to ditch the scene. The solution is to add more to make the scene more dynamic.

**** I always find myself really enjoying reading your comments, Taure. Even if I disagree, your thoughts on things are always somehow quite interesting to read.

On this one however, I very much agree. To continue my example, Rowling literally has a shopping scene every year and manages to make it really interesting to read each time. Harry always meets the bad-guys for that year in Diagon Alley too, interestingly enough. Quirrel in first year, Malfoy and Lockhart in second, Hearing about Sirius and meeting Fudge in the third (Dementors, listening to Snappy, and the Buckbeak debacle), no Diagon trips in fourth or fifth, and Draco in the sixth. I hadn't noticed that until now. But yes, her scenes are highly multi-purpose in a way most fanfic isn't. Good points!

** You can use it introduce people who will later be relevant or objects that will come up later (ie Chekhov's gun). And you can use it to showcase characterisation and development. And you can combine all of these. So, for example, you have Harry go into a shop because he's attracted by the colourful marketing on the outside (tells us about his character), whilst browsing he meets the owners daughter and badly flirts with her (tells us about his character and sets up a future love interest), then whilst browsing he can causally notice something really cool but which he doesn't need (shows him developing a little maturity by not impulse buying) which you can then bring up in a future chapter, perhaps have him dig it out the wreckage of the shop and use it on death eaters during a raid?

Don't feel like you need to showcase every minute of something mundane however, ideally every scene should have a couple of reasons to be there (like the above example). So you have that shop scene, then another scene where he...runs into a friend in the quidditch shop and has a catch up with them. In that he can mention that he's already got his books and isn't looking forward to the apothecary.

Cut scene, he's back home and desperate to shower and get the stink of the apothecary off him.

Contrasting this is what many tropy writers do, introduce a lot of people and objects that sound like they will be relevant later but never are.

It's so annoying to me, especially when the writers start forgetting they introduced something/someone and re-introduce once again. At that point I tend to drop the fic completely because the lack of logic and consistency is starting to hurt me.

**** I've done this once with a Life is Strange fic. In my first chapter, I had my protagonist pick up a girl at a party and arrange to meet her outside, though the protagonist got distracted foiling an attempted kidnapping of a fellow student, but I forgot that initial girl existed until about four chapters later and I just decided that she was the kidnapper's second (and successful) attempted victim.

I'd quite like to see a fic like that pull that sort of switch off. Have Harry buy a bunch of shit, then store it in his comically-oversized trunk-house and forget about it (like he forgot the mirror-package) and only remember later on. GM's first rule: If you fuck up, either admit to it ASAP, or just make it part of the story. :D

***** Thats brilliant! It makes the story better and you never suspect a thing!

To give an example of really badly forgetting about what a character did: It was one of those powerful/indy shitty Harrys. He had contacted Skeeter in year 2 or smth and struck up some sort of deal with her (dunno how, maybe threats or smth). Then in the wand ceremony in 4rth year they each forgot that they met the other. It was as if they had met for the first time (and they weren't faking it either). I was expecting some sort of follow up from second year, but nope. That really annoyed me. I think they also did the exact same thing with gillyweed. Harry had learned about gillyweed earlier in the fic and then relearned about it in 4rth. That also really irked me.

Rorschach made a fic where Harry and Sirius literally had a box they threw things that they found in. So if anyone asked where they got something, they point at the box.

It was a box for ALL of the Chekov's Guns. A Chekov's Box if you will. Sorry Shrodinger.

** Dialogue.

Or, if it suits the writing style, clever mental dialogue.

No, really. Interesting characters are the driver of a story. It's not so much /what/ they do, but /how/ they do it.

Alternatively: subvert the trope. Have someone try to sell Harry the magical mansion trunk or omniscient pet snake, but have him turn it down because he doesn't need those things.

*** Heh. Hadn't thought about subversions of that stuff. Now I want to see a fic where Harry goes through all the purchasing, then gets home and goes through all of his purchases only to find they're all ridiculous novelty/tourist crap that's ridiculously impractical or overpriced. The Magical Mansion keeps turning into a Starbucks and the Omniscient Pet Snake is only omniscient regarding the position of every mouse in the world.

I do like your point regarding how a character does a thing being the driver, though. So, you'd more often rely on character reaction, building, and interpretation to augment events than adding new events in (eg. Rowling's shopping trips involving Harry meeting the villain, hearing about some drama, finding a bit more out about the world he lives in, etc) to build up the multi-purpose-ness of a scene?

I don't really see it as an either-or situation. If there aren't any events that add to the story, there isn't really a point in writing that trip, yanno? An event should happen, but what makes the story interesting is how the character reacts to said event.

If nothing happens in the shopping trip, exposition will do the trick, and you'll get to the meat of the story faster.

***** Fair point, but not quite what I meant. I was trying to ask if you'd favour one or the other to make a scene interesting. Shopping + Character Building or Shopping + Plot Building. Not that you'd always go for one or another, just which one you might favour most often. Would you be more likely to have Harry quip and comment on things as he shops, or more likely to have him see your antagonist trade a MacGuffin that'd be used in his later plots? That kind of thing.

** Instead of writing boring (but necessary, because plot continuity) scenes, I just allude to them. I don't hand-wave it away, mind you, but add items, or dialogue, or narration to imply that the event happened.

To use your shopping example, I'd write a scene that moves the plot along or resolves a situation. Let's say, that Ron missed a class and needs to borrow Harry's notes. I'd add an item to that scene in order to imply that the shopping trip happened, perhaps a shopping list. In order to make the scene work, I need to have a reason for the shopping list to be with the notes. This is a good opportunity for me to introduce, or exhibit, a character trait that could be important later in the story; for example, Harry being disorganized.

â€‹

"Harry, can I borrow your Divination notes?" Ron asked.

"Yeah, sure." Harry handed them over. They were ripped in places and mottled with mysterious stains. Doodles and scribbles interspersed the writing. One page was titled 'Emeric the Evil,' and in the margins of another was written, 'Shopping: Bread, Eggs, Milk, Squick.'

"Thanks."

** Well, there's a few ways to do so. You hit one way of doing it - by working in plot relevant information, like canon does. However, in that case you do have to ask yourself - what's the benefit of including it /there/ instead of somewhere else that you'd find less boring?

For instance, take the shopping trip. In canon, I would say its primary purpose is to introduce the magical world in all its fantastical glory to Harry - with the secondary benefit of adding in the introduction of Malfoy, Harry's wealth, and so on. But what I always come out of that first Diagon Alley trip is the sense of wonder and possibility and /strangeness/ of the magical world - and yet how close it is to our own.

Now, in fanfiction, what's the point of a shopping trip? Well, it's certainly not to be boring - but it can be made into a boring scene depending on how it's presented, of course. It's a difficult situation, because people have very differing reactions on it. Personally, I find that it's a great way to inject worldbuilding elements, just like canon does - you just want to keep it moving along nicely. Don't use it as a checklist for Harry getting the power up he needs - use it as a way to build up the world, show Harry wandering around some cool new magical shops, possibilities with magic, etc. It's also an excellent way, IMO, to introduce a twist in what he's interested in - show him wandering into an enchanter's store, looking through all the cool items, and becoming fascinated with the idea of becoming an enchanter. That could work for potions, runes, enchanting, etc - and be a way to have him focus on those more than he did in canon in a fairly organic way.

*However*, if it's a scene you find boring - don't include it. Find another way to make it clear - and I wouldn't even use a line like what you put there. Instead, I'd just do a throwaway paragraph that indicates that he went to Diagon Alley, went shopping, and what he bought that'd be /important/ to your story.
