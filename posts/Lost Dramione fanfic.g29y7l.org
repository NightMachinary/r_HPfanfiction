I'm looking for a REALLY specific Dramione fanfiction;

I don't remember a lot, but I remember that Hermione and Draco were both top lawyers who always ended up against each other in court and they were always trying to win. The fanfiction revolves around this one case they were doing where Hermione's client was being accused of forcing his secretary to have sex with him, and Draco's client was the secretary who, it turned out, just wanted the money the Ministry apparently gave to other people who had been forced by their bosses I guess.

But as it turned out the dude's Healer testified for him and it turned out he had some kind of permanent erectile dysfunction so Hermione won, and in the end, it was revealed that only three people knew Hermione and Draco were either dating or married.

I've asked to other places but I keep getting directed to Ministry Antics, and that's not exactly the one I was looking for.
