I posted this in the Harmony subreddit, but the answer wasnt the right one, so i try it here.

​

Im not quite sure if the Fic title was "Meant to be", but im pretty certain that it WAS indeed its name. Unfortunetely it seems that it was deleted on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] as i cant find it via the searchfunction nor is it listed anymore in my Fav list.

​

I dont know, how detailed i should describe its content, as i dont want to spoiler anything but give as much info so someone can help me find it. I will use the Description that i used in the Subreddit:

​

For those who dont know, whats its content was: it was movie-based. Harry and Hermione nearly kissed after their Dance in the Tent, but then did it shortly after it, outside. When Ron returned and the two faced the Locket, Harry was longing the images to be real. After the Malfoy manor Hermione sneaked into Harrys room because she was haunted by her torture and they sleept together (no sex). Next morning they had a Kiss session, Ron catched them and as Harry tried to convince and calm him it result in a Fight between them. Hermione then interrupted them and nursed Harry. The Fic ended (not completed) in a dramatic Point that give Harry a Heart ache. I wont spoil it, unless someone wish me to do so for further information, although i think i gave enough, as i didnt want to spoiler to much.
