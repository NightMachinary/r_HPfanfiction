As said in the title, I'm currently working on a HP/JJBA crossover that's primarily set in Britain, and would like to keep it in the Muggle SIde for the first half. However, I haven't been to the Isles before, so my knowledge of the area is rather lacking. As such, I'd be happy with any suggestions for cities, locations and other areas for the group to go to.


** The thing to understand about the UK is that it is tiny. It is also rather old and has a long history. You can find old buildings or historical sites in every town other than Milton Keynes. Accents and rivalries change very quickly. Someone from Manchester might argue all day with someone from Liverpool but if they meet someone from Surrey then they're both northerners and will get on fine. If the three of them meet someone from Scotland, well they're all English. Some comedian did a great bit about this. We have also been to war with the vast majority of our neighbours at some point or other so we have more history there.

In general the South is considered the richer more civilised area and the north a poorer colder more miserable place. That being said the vast majority of northerners are far and away more friendly than your average southerner. London is home to a lit of people but most people from the south east or London way will tell you how different bits of London are. Never forget most of Britain was built in a time when servants were common. As a result towns often have a nice bit where the rich lived and a nastier bit where the help lived. As such, it is rare for anyone to capture the correct personality and tone of a town unless they have lived there.

I would recommend you stay away from famous places since people know them well, the more general you are the less there is to be pulled up on. In fact a map will give you place names better than I can and Google will provide you will plenty of information about your selected place. Instead what I would do is look at common shops, as a brit nothing stands put more to me than the wrong shops or common brands.
