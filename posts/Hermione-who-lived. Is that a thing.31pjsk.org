A story where she's not just the hero, but also the protagonist. A story where she's not just the solution, but also the cause of most problems. A story that, idealy, doesn't pair her up with Malfoy.

Is there something like that? Seriously, though, no Malfoy.


** I don't remember any fics where Hermione is Girl-Who-Lived that made an impression on me, though my view is that Hermione has always had a "self-made" ethos about her that would clash with her being chosen by a prophecy, as opposed to he choosing to get involved. For the rest of the criteria, here are my recommendations. (As a warning, most of them are in progress, and some of them update very slowly.)

*/Favorites:/*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/][/Reign of the Serpent/ by AlphaEph19]]: AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

*My comments:* In Salazar's Britain, Muggleborns are taken from their families at the first sign of magic and placed into assimilation facilities, before being sent to war with barely any training (boys) and sent to do menial jobs and bear children (girls), with only the most promising of them getting to go to Hogwarts. Needless to day, Hermione is one of them, and she comes with some high and rather destructive ambitions... A Dramione 'ship is highly unlikely but not impossible; if it does occur, it will /not/ be the standard Dramione 'ship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/][/Applied Cultural Anthropology, or/ by jacobk]]: ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

*My comments:* /Not/ an HG/SS fic. Hermione is sorted into Slytherin, where she has to fight for every ounce of respect she gets. She /does not/ get along with Draco, and not in any way that suggests potential for future relationship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9950232/1/][/Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation/ by Robin.Drew]]: In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

*My comments:* Loosely inspired by HPMOR and /Worm/, but without the over-the-top-ness of the former. Hermione /does/ appear to have a destiny of some sort, though we do not know what yet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/][/The Arithmancer/ by White Squirrel]]: Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort.

*My comments:* Starts out very canon-rehashy, but eventually diverges significantly. The Trio is still there, but the dynamic is very different, and Hermione has a lot more interaction with other characters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7781192/1/][/Harry Potter Without Harry Potter/ by Nim-the-Lesser]]: "Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)"

*My comments:* Hermione gets pulled out of Hogwarts after the Troll Incident, but manages to trick her way into Durmstrang, where she manages to thrive nonetheless. However, it's not solely about her, with the others at Hogwarts (primarily Ron and Percy) having their own adventures, maintaining correspondence with her.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6948912/1/][/Reconnaissance/ by Albernheit]]: Or how to find one's way in a new world when secrets contain more secrets and trust is a questionable habit. AU, begins at the end of CoS

*My comments:* Hermione talks to Hogwarts. Kind of surreal.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9045882/1/][/A Pound of Flesh/ by Thomas M Riddle]] and sequel: AU: In her sixth year, Hermione engineers a way to reawaken Tom Riddle's diary. But forbidden magic has its risks, and she finds herself locked in a deadly battle of wits with the most dangerous teenaged Dark Wizard of all time. A game where the only way to win may be to prove the Sorting Hat's decision to put her in Gryffindor wrong. TW: Torture (some sexualized)

*My comments:* This one is relatively short, and has the advantage of being complete. Also, /not/ Tomione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/][/Harry Potter and the Witch Queen/ by TimeLoopedPowerGamer]]: After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

*My comments:* Told mostly from the point of view of shell-shocked veteran Harry (in his younger body), as he tries to guide a powerful!genius!Hermione to prevent her from going Dark this time through, while actually defeating Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127137/1/][/Palimpsest/ by Larry Huss]]: Hermione gets some of the answers early. She has trouble understanding what all the questions are.

*My comments:* Hermione gets a telegram from her future self. The downside is that a big part of her actions are to facilitate Harry doing great things, though she manages plenty of her own.

*/Also worth a look:/*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9821720/1/][/The Stark Effect/ by NexusNebulous]] :In which the girl who might have been Hermione Granger is raised as Tony Stark's daughter, and the world is that much closer to imploding spontaneously. One know-it-all Stark was enough, thank you. *Includes other Marvel characters, i.e. XMen, Spiderman, etc.

*My comments:* Not quite sure what to think of this one, but the world needs more MadScientist!Hermiones.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10462402/1/][/The Snake Pit/ by cupcake0118]]: After she is expelled from her London prep school for setting a science lab on fire, Hermione Granger is visited by Professor McGonagall, deputy headmistress of Hogwarts. Finally feeling as though she has found her place in life, Hermione travels to Hogwarts. But when she gets there, she is sorted into a house which despises the very blood which courses through her veins.

*My comments:* A promising beginning of another Slytherin Hermione fic.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7296047/1/][/Rule of two, dreams come true/ by Darklooshkin]]: Whitetigerwolfs Dark Lady challenge. Hermione watches Star Wars at age six and tries to connect with the force. Now watch how a game of pretend turns into a journey to the dark side filled with -friendship and love? Yes, Harry's responsible somehow...

*My comments:* [[/u/Darklooshkin]] is an acquired taste, and the fic might be abandoned.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8614738/1/][/Darkest Witch of Her Age/ by darkrose0510]]: Hermione was known as the brightest witch of her age, but time and circumstances would soon change that. Who will survive a brilliant mind's descent into darkness? A dark Hermione fic'.

*My comments:* A bit emo, but she creates plenty of problems, that's for sure. Possibly abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10627176/1/][/Hermione Granger and the Tesseract of Merlin/ by Writingathing]]: (HPMOR spoilers.) HePMORmione Granger wakes up in hell and decides to leave. Somewhere in the mists of Scottish purgatory she meets an unusual society of witches and wizards, each with their own dark secrets and unusual powers, united by only one thing: their mutual desire to pulverize evil. They are the Society to Pulverize Evil Witches and Wizards. And Hermione wants in.

*My comments:* A cracky fanfic with many /Worm/ references (though not a crossover).

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8375078/1/][/Labyrinth/ by Kroontjespen]]: The mind of a prodigy is a scary thing. Hermione Granger's however is downright terrifying. AU. Slytherin!Hermione, Slytherin!Harry

*My comments:* A more Riddle-like, but recognizable, Hermione comes to Hogwarts, with Harry in tow.

*** An acquired taste, am I? Well, you're right about that.

As for it being abandoned, well no. But there are some major problems in it I need to adress soon...

That being said, this is the second time in as many days that my fanfics have been noted as having strong Hermiones as characters. And I confess that, whilst I find myself flattered, I was also quite puzzled about it.

I mean, I am neither the best nor the most prolific of writers out there, though I do try my best.

And surely, there's more than a few fics where Hermione kicks an abundant amount of ass, done by authors who overshadow me at every turn?

Well, seems not. What the hell? Well alright then, since I'm already being cited for it, might as well make something concrete out of it.

You wish for a Hermione that kicks ass? You wish for a Hermione that solves problems more, ah, proactively?

You wish for Hermione Jean Granger, bushy, nerdy, outcast bookworm with an axe to grind, to become the hero, the protagonist, The One, the Saviour, prophecies and prejudices be damned?

Fine, I'll do it.

Maybe that'll remind people of that old axiom about wishes.

***** The changing of appearance (the hair, the teeth, the clothes, etc.) seems very, very self-aggrandising, and I just don't see anywhere in canon where Hermione cares anything for her appearance (before 4th year and the Yule Ball, that is). Mostly it just seems very contrary to the strong sense of personal integrity that Hermione has in canon - it just really, really turned me off around the 55th chapter or so.

EDIT: Also, the ridiculous Quidditch bookie stuff and the thing with Rebecca Gamp too. She's too Mary Sueish by this point.

  The changing of appearance
#+end_quote

Interesting... To me, it felt like a natural consequence of her having more tools at her disposal in particular and being more proactive about getting the things she wants in general. The story gave her a power-up, and she's making [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility][Mundane Utility]] of it. In canon, she needs single-use Potions and a lot of time to manage her hair, whreas in the fic, she can invent a spell to do it, so why wouldn't she? And, if she wants her teeth fixed, why not just get it done, rather than do nothing about until there is an extrinsic opportunity (Draco's hexing her), then lie to a medical professional about their original size (which is what she did in canon)? Where's the integrity in that?

Yeah, these are all fair points. Add to that her being the one to free Dobby rather than Harry. I still like the fic very much, but that bit was cringeworthy.

#+end_quote

I don't know... It's just far, far too much of a departure from canon for my taste. Also, I feel this Hermione is becoming too "generically pretty", in both appearance and character, and the characteristics that made me love the canon Hermione have all slowly leached out - her love of the library, her righteous indignation at things she doesn't think are ethical, her exasperation with Harry and Ron, her desire to follow the rules (and to break them when it means helping her friends), her humility (although some might see her as arrogant, I see her as simply brilliant and badly needing an outlet to express that brilliance), et cetera.

Overall, the term Mary Sue just describes her perfectly at this point. I long for a more nuanced portrayal that's not just the author masturbating.

** Roundabout Destiny is a Hermione centric fic that I really enjoyed with no Malfoy.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8311387/1/]]

Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year.

4 O'clock in the Morning is also Hermione centric with Malfoy but not a pairing of the two. Worth the read though:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5533537/1/]]

Post-DH by about eight months. Hermione gives her unexpected visitor some bad news.
