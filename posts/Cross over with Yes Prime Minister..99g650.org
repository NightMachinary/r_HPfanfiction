I have read the two available on fan fiction net and the few available on archive of your own I was wondering if there are anymore anywhere (I accept it is unlikely).

​

For those who don't know Yes Prime minister is a British political comedy from the 1980's. It is quite famous.

** Were they any good?

Let's be honest, the Ministry for Administrative Affairs would make an excellent cover name for the Ministry of Magic.

*** They were all very short fics. I was hoping for a longer fic. Maybe the interactions between Fudge and the Prime Minister at the time, who I think we all assume is John Major but with Jim Hacker instead of Major. Or a whole fic about Jim Hacker freaking out. You know how in the first episode he realises he can start a nuclear war and then freaks out? Maybe something like that but with him being freaked out by the fact magic is real instead.

Also Bernard would be a wizard. I don't know why but that makes sense to me.

** Shut. Up. There is not a HP/YesMinister crossover. That could only be beyond my wildest dreams.

** Or, alternatively, HP/House Of Cards (UK) would be pretty decent, especially since they're set in the same time period. House Of Cards is a little bit more morally ambiguous than HP, but if you think of Francis Urquhart as a less insane, muggle Lucius Malfoy you're sort of getting the right idea.

*** I enjoyed US house of cards but I admit I feel the UK one worked far better. When is UK house of cards set? I haven't seen it in a while but I have an idea Urquhart takes over from Thatcher? In which case he would indeed be the PM Fudge talks to instead of Major. So late 1980's though the 1990's. Full disclosure I'm in my mid twenties I wasn't born when this show came out.

I am loving your characterisation of Francis Urquhart btw have an upvote.

**** 1990s. Thatcher left office in 1991 iirc and The Final Cut ends in 2001ish on the day he beats her record of being the longest serving PM.

***** An Voldemort is defeated in 1998 so the time line works out. Now i really want a fic where the muggle pm Fudge has to deal with is Francia, who would be so much smarter and manipulative than Fudge (and Francis would so be a Slytherin if he was a wizard).
