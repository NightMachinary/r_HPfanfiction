The title basically ; if you've got any ideas you think have the makings of an epic fic in them you can suggest those too.

Not restricting this to just powers , clever use of it is also appreciated .


** It can be interesting for fanfic, but the idea of the "power he knows not" being anything other than something abstract like love or friendship has never really made much sense to me. An actual magical ability might be a power that Voldemort isn't aware of, but I feel like "knows not" implies more than that -- a power that Voldemort does not understand. Voldemort is capable of appreciating how a brilliant new spell could have the potential to defeat him, but he would never in his life understand the importance of interpersonal relationships.

** On a Pale Horse is almost certainly not what you were looking for, but it's certainly among the most /creative/ applications of "power" I've seen. And it's a macabre sort of hilarious.

**** As far as I know, Voldemort never quite figured out that Harry was a horcrux. Only that there was some kind of connection between the two. Otherwise he would've never killed him in that forest.

***** Irrelevant. "The Power He Knows Not" bit comes after the "mark him as equal" bit, which is the bit that signifies Harry being a Horcrux. "The Power He Knows Not" thus is a power that Voldemort doesn't possess or understands, contrary to all those powers and knowledge that came to Harry through Voldemort's shredded soul - powers and knowledge that Voldemort /knows/. Notice that it's "Power He Knows Not", not "Power He Knows Not /Of/", which will fit better with this example.

It was very "meh", but had some good parts. Voldemort just dying of radiation was actually kind of funny.
