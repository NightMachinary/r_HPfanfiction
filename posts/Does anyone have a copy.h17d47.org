I'm looking for a copy of a crossover fic of Harry Potter and Black butler {it's been taken down} but I also don't know the name of it...

Ciel phantomhive is reborn as Harry and he somehow gets his butler Sebastian again. I mainly remember them being in hogwarts (as a slytherin) and Harry starting to remember more of his life as Ciel. He also preforms his duty as the watchdog (or whatever the title is) of the Queen. I think it was also slash between Harry and Sebastian.

I know it's not a lot to go on but if you do know it then that's fantastic!
