Things about the Fanfic:

- Thief Harry

- Mute Hermione

- Harry doesn't know he is a Potter

- Wrong Boy Who Lived

- The Portrait of Walburga thinks Harry is James and that Hermione is a pureblood relative (Bellatrix, Andromeda, or Narcissa )

- Harry and Hermione date and perhaps Marry

- Harry and Hermione move into either Number 11 or 13 Grimmauld place

- Harry (With his neighboring house) robs Number 12 Grimmauld place since he was added into the wards as a baby (Before Harry robs the place Sirius sees him in the house but doesn't recognize him)

- Harry and Hermione have little Angel / Devil dolls of the other to help them (Hermione has a little Devil Harry while Harry has a little Angel Hermione)

- Harry has a twin and neither know about the other

- Harry robs Dumbledore's office and turns off the wards but when Dumbledore tells the twin about the prophecy he realises the wards are off and thinks that the twin turned them off and believes that the twin did it and tells the twin to turn them back on but Harry does that shortly after making Dumbledore think that it's the power the dark lord knows not

- Harry was planning on stealing Hogwarts from Dumbledore for some reason or another in the last chapter that I remember reading

Thank you for your time and if you can find the fanfiction I will greatly appreciate it but it's been awhile so I kinda think it might have been deleted but I guess it doesn't hurt to see if I can find it with the help of you guys.


** I think it's been deleted, because I found this: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11510569/1/Hidden-in-Plain-Sight-Year-of-Extracurricular-Studies]], which seems to be outtakes from the original story.
