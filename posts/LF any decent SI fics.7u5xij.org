I always like to check out SI fics because while they're usually terrible, it is possible to find a few that shine through the shit.

The only good HP SI fic that I can remember is that Sally-Anne Perks one that died.


** To be honest, I usually stay away from self-inserts. But if I had to pick a good one, I'll say read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10356239/1/Disenchanted][Disenchanted]] by Yuuki no Yuki. It's a surprisingly good self-insert fic that I was invested when I found the story. The author actually made a decent plot with excellent an writing style even though the fic is from a first person POV. The author really did a number on my emotions with this story as well, which says something about the quality of the fic.

*** I /really/ like this story. There is a small warning I'd like to give, though.

It's not /nearly/ 96,000 words. Not even /close/.

The Author's Notes are sometimes a fifth of the chapter. The author is one of those writers who respond to individual reviews in the footer of the story. Which, sure, is fine. But on FFN especially it does bloat the word count quite a bit.

For instance, look at [[https://i.imgur.com/D8T6Rwn.png][this screenshot]].

I'll grant that this AN is slightly larger than the other ones, but it takes up /around a third of the entire chapter/. Look at that scrolllbar.

  When I imagined being a witch I imagined magic and flying. I imagined proving to the world that Slytherin and Evil are not synonymous. I imagined love and adventure. But most of all I imagined waking up-eleven years old-on the Hogwarts Express alongside Harry and Ron. So why, pray-tell, am I in a nursery, in 1970? This is not what I imagined! A realistic SI.

** I know of a good one (I liked it anyway) and the story itself is complete!

linkffn(8586147)

A few comments I have on it: the SI's name is stupid (author is butalerner and he tried to turn that into a main character who briefly goes by "Bud", before shortly realizing it's sort of a stupid Hogwarts character name and changing it). SI character is sort of on a see-saw when it comes to being a Gary Stu; he's intentionally nerfed power-wise, but at the same time socially omnipotent. Which, I get it, authors write self-inserts as cathartic release. The dialogue is especially good, as an especially OOC dialogue from someone like Dumbledore sort of breaks the immersion when the idea behind a SI fic is to focus on the novel character. An example of some DD dialogue (the author has it on his page to advertise the fic):

"It seems odd to worry about the sanity of an ancient, semi-sentient Hat, Mr. Lerner, yet I must confess I was quite concerned there for a few minutes." --- Professor Dumbledore

Where this fic shines however is the humor. I laughed a good number of times. The humor is on the level of A Black Comedy, maybe a step below Seventh Horcrux, and oftentimes meta.

To summarise, not a must-read but a good read.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

** Can't forget linkffn(Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal and Other Morals) --- most notable for being a /realistic/ self-insert. The SI is still a muggle and quite out of his depth from his spotty knowledge of the books, and makes realistic decisions. The story is quite charming and updates often. Its flaws, I would say, are that as a result of the SI's muggleness, there's not that much of the wizarding world featured (yet); there definitely is quite a bit, but in some chapters it feels like an original novel entirely, with barely any HP content. Also: the character is very Christian. It isn't done /obnoxiously/ (it's not a preachy fic by any means), but it can definitely get overbearing if you don't like it.

In an entirely different style, there's a "limited" SI in linkffn(The Evil Overlord List), wherein the self-insert Jerry ends up inside young Tom Riddle's head and proceeds to try and prevent him from turning into /too/ much of a murderous psycho, but still try to take over the world... and, for a change, /succeed/.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  Being reborn as Lily Evans' younger sister definitely has its merits, but that's completely overshadowed by the fact that the First Wizarding War is going to start in nine years. And she'll be damned if she lets her sister die. SI/OC fic.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy
