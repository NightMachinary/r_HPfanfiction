** Congratulations on publishing something.

Given that Ginny named a poor innocent owl Pigwidgeon I think a case can be made that it was her who created that god awful name.

You've picked an incredibly bold title. Considered one of the top ten books of the 20th Century by some and one of the more thought provoking stories, its a legacy that you cannot hope to match. Considering the expectations you've set with the title what I've seen does not inspire confidence.

Luna lived a short distance away from the Weasleys. Luna was their friend and yet they've never had a get together?

The second half of the first chapter is nothing but telling with no showing. There are also several grammar issues.

The second chapter I didn't make it through. An eleven year old punching a seventeen/eighteen year old over a girl, tipping fedora and all.

Wow I thought you were kidding and had to read that one for myself. Hey [[/u/Nerd1a4i]] , what were you thinking?

It's kinda besides the point, considering the ridiculousness of that punch, but why exactly is a 7th year Gryffindor treating the son of Harry Potter like this? Why is he mocking Luna Lovegood or her daughter? These are all war heroes.

** It's a no just from reading the description. Why would next gen kids need to take care of the next dark Lord when the current generation is still alive and well? And unless you are using the shit called Cursed Child as basis, Albus would not really struggle to find his place since Harry would never act like that in canon. And if you use CC as base, it's a no either way.

Also, your description has two counts of "follow" in the same sentence. Rebuild is the wrong tense (rebuilding or remove the of)

*** The description isn't very good then; I apologize. When I say "prevent the rise of another Voldemort" I mean in terms of government and things, not that there's actually another Voldemort to take down. And I said in the author notes in Ch.1. that it isn't going to be using Cursed Child. Anyway, Harry can be kind and understanding but there's plenty of other ways he needs to "find his place".

** Don't take this the wrong way, but next gen fics are a dime a dozen. They are /everywhere/. Most authors also go for the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox][Generation Xerox]] thing and they tend to be very predictable.

The whole premise just sounds... I don't know, bland?

*** I truly am not going to copy the Harry Potter books. There is no dark lord here. None, zilch, nada. No scars, no lightning bolts. Albus is going to be decent at quidditch, but he's not going to be a seeker, and he's not going to magically make it in thanks to McGonagall watching an amazing catch. Etc, etc.

And yeah, I guess it'll be kind of bland in the beginning...half of the enjoyment for me in writing it is just exploring the world more and trying to figure out more about how magic works, or more about creatures and such, things Rowling never truly covered. I also want to sort of set up Albus' character. But later I want to bring in things the adults (and kids) are doing to "fix" the ministry and wizarding law, or how attitudes are changing, things like that.

Apparently nobody seems to be liking it, but ah, well.

I don't see it as "nobody's liking it". By all means, if /you/ like it, keep writing.

But it's been done to hell and back.

** Just one more thing: You really should stop abusing parantheses. They do not deserve this kind of treatment.
