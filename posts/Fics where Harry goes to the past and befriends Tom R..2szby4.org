Preferably ones that are completed and slash-free..


** My favorite one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10272040/1/47-Days-to-Change-a-translation][47 Days to Change]]. Harry goes back in the past to try to adopt Tom Riddle in the hopes that it would change him, it doesn't though. Tom is a twisted psychopath, but he manages to be manipulative enough to hide it from Harry. It's pretty dark and realistic. Harry battles between his need to kill the little boy and his natural protective instinct not to kill the little boy. It's the only story I've ever read that accurately portrays Tom and doesn't romanticize him as only needing "one good friend."

Now, I will say up to the very last chapter there is no slash and it's still awhile off. It's supposed to happen in the future ~sometime~ but in a dark, twisted kind of obsession kind of way, not romantic. The story is actually already completed, but not fully translated yet, so there's not too much of a fear of it being unfinished forever. Despite that, because of it's quality and good characterizations, I think it's worth reading regardless. It's almost like a slice of life type story so there's no real cliffhanger or mystery left at its current ending spot, so I actually think it's fine reading as is.

This story actually ruined other Tom Riddle stories for me because they make him too good or friendly.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2550563/1/Welcome-to-Hogwarts-1949][Welcome to Hogwarts 1949]] is the best one I can think of. Writing gets better as it goes on and Tom Riddle is written /very/ well. I don't know if you count their relationship as 'friendship' though, since they are mostly trying to use and one-up each other behind the facade of friendliness (at least from what I remember).

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies:]] Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald.

I just finished this and thought it was really good. Theres an unfinished sequel but it's not as good in my opinion.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1103246/chapters/2219054][Fate's Favorite]] is the other way around [TMR coming to Harry's time but really it's a continuation of Harry being in his time. Tom's just a clingy bastard] and the author declares it is not slash....though the sequel is...and so is a lot of fan versions but I digress. Very deep characterization of Tom and the horcruxes and what separates him from Voldemort.

**** It took me a long time to get around to it myself. Mostly because it's not my usual chosen genre. I am not a fan of time travel.
