Fanfiction where Draco is not like his father. Like Sirius.


** When I read that, my first thought was the following exchange:

"Narcissa, dear, why does our son have greasy black hair, black eyes, and a hooked nose, all traits that neither of us possesses?"

"Umm... He must get it from my great aunt Grisabella Black. That must be it."

** Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) and sequels have a Draco who's similar to his father until 7 or so, at which point circumstances make him different from his father and the rest of his family. Takes a while for it to become obvious to his family, but there's definite fallout from it

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

*** This is the one that came into mind for me, too. Draco slowly becomes nothing like his father, and the developing tension between them is very interesting.

** Draco's reverence and attempts to imitate his father are a central part of his character. Without this he just simply wouldn't be Draco. You'd be better off trying to find/write a different pureblood Male in Slytherin.

** There's one that's a /total/ AU but I enjoy it. It was written before HBP was released if I remember correctly so it diverges /greatly/ from canon. But it involves Draco changing even though he isn't the main character.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** So, I guess there's a number of dramiones that would fit the bill...kinda, if you don't mind romance as a large aspect. I'm uncertain if you're looking for lengthy fics or not, but here are two where his character is quite different.

1) A short one-shot where Draco is a fan of the Cannons and that causes him to befriend the trio on the train. Linkffn(12503529)

2) A longer story, AU, where he's given Hermione as a muggle 'pet' but grows fond of her, eventually leading to a stand-off against Lucius. Linkffn(9741840)
