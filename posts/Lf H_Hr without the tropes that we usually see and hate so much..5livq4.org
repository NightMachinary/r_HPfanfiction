For some reason that never bothered me. I think early on I didn't even realize that it refers to the actors... not really sure why people think the names are such a big deal. I think many HHr writers just use them because everyone does.

Okay, here's some recs that IMHO avoid most of the tropes (if not all).

Getting the obvious out of the way, Vox Corporis:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis]])

Anything by lorien829,really:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance]])

An old story that I read recently and thought it was quite good:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2644646/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Three-Travelers]])

Pure crackfic, but Ron gets a Harem:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood]])

Another adult crackfic, Ron is a stud:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2841153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor]])

An old portkey story. Ron is dead. No bashing that I can recall:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6479080/10/Soul-Thief]])

This is too cute not to mention, no plot though:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11318985/1/Favorite-Things]])

Since you asked specifically for HHr and if you can stomach really mushy romances anything by Potato19 (Ron is always a friend, no lords and ladies as far as I can recall). She really *gets* their dynamic. Her most plot-heavy story with a really interesting premise (Fair warning though, there's some really evil people in that story some might consider it bashing):

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11722905/1/Powerless]])

Feel free to yell at me if you think any of these don't fit your criteria.

***** That fic has some of the most ridiculously contrived artificial asinine (running out of adjectives here) drama I've ever seen pretty far into the story. I don't want to spoil it for others, but you probably know which scene involving Sirius I'm talking about if you have read it. If it were a real book I'd have thrown it in the corner at that point.

I just couldn't read any further, the setup was completely ridiculous and just for adding angst.

Up to this point it's a decent fic though, no idea how it continues.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
