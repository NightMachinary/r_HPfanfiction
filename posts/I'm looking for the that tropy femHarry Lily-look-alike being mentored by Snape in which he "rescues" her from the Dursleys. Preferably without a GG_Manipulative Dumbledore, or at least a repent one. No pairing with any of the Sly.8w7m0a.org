#+TITLE: I'm looking for the that tropy fem!Harry Lily-look-alike being mentored by Snape in which he "rescues" her from the Dursleys. Preferably without a GG/Manipulative Dumbledore, or at least a repent one. No pairing with any of the Slytherin boys, Cedric nor Snape.

I preffer that there is romance, but never with Draco, Snape or Cedric. And I'm not a huge fan of Theo Nott and Blaise either, as pairing goes, at least. FemSlash would be ideal, specially with Daphne, but beggars can't be choosers.

Oh, and if possible at least 100k+ words, or completed fics if it has less.


** I enjoyed the Severus' Rose series by WrittenWord1 - it has 7 completed fics and 1 in progress following fem!Harry (named Elizabeth Rose) as she's raised by Snape. There's a romance that builds throughout the years with Fred Weasley.

Note: Snape is Elizabeth's biological dad in this series. There are lots of fluffy family moments that are pretty OOC for the canon Snape, but it makes sense with the story!
