** Summary: The Hallows were not an ending. Harry returns to the Forbidden Forest after the Battle and finds the Stone -- the start of his salvation and the path to his damnation.

This is a very well-written oneshot that I thought you guys might enjoy as a quick, fun read. In my opinion, it is the perfect oneshot -- an interesting premise brought by top-notch execution. It's concise, grammatically sound, and refreshingly original. Depending on your fanfiction tastes, some scenes may be a bit questionable but the story is good enough to make you not mind them much.

** Nice! I could see it continuing a chapter or two further, but it's really fine as it is. The way it was going I was bracing myself for a death and destruction ending where Harry gets his. The open ended finish is kind of terrifying.

*** I highly doubt it. The author meant it to be a oneshot, and it'll probably stay that way. Which, in my opinion, is for the best. While the author might be able to pull it off, extending the story may cause it to lose its magic. A well-written oneshot should stay as a oneshot.

** Came across this in DLP's Dark!Harry section. It was five starred there, I think. All in all, I found it pretty enjoyable.
