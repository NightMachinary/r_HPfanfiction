Luna, Hermione, or whatever other character he might be paired with. I see quite a few fics in which Harry is a single dad (things having failed with Ginny) and ends up dating somebody else, but it would be interesting to see the reverse of that scenario.


** [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7460/36][Love Lost, Love Found]]: Ron and Ginny died in an accident a few years after the Epilogue. Harry and Hermione found each other, and the kids were all happy.

** This one's pretty good linkffn(490949). It gets kind of angsty, but it's well-written. Also, it's not complete, but it stops at a pretty satisfying place.

(Edit) the bot linked the wrong fic. Here's the link to the right one:

  I was so deeply touched by the storyline of the GK 2, The Beast Within, and especially Friedrich Von Glowe that this poem simply came out of me..it's from Friedrich's POV, as his spirit watches over Gabriel before leaving this world forever.
