#+begin_quote
  When the Dursleys die in a car crash, Dumbledore is left with a quandary as to where to place the Boy-Who-Lived. That is, until he remembers another relative of Lily's: a cousin in Japan. Rated M just be safe.

*** I watched One Punch man after starting this fic but funnily enough I never came back to finish this. I love One Punch Man and Saitama but just felt the crossover was really hard to digest for some reason. Saitama being a long lost cousin just never really sat well with me.

​

I would love to read a story where Harry similar to Saitama trains and becomes an OP hero without being in OPM universe. That said, its a decent fic.
