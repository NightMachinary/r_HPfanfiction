** Happens all the time. There's generally nothing you can do but wait. It will come back up. It always does.

Edit: I just checked and it seemed to be working fine

** It kind of works right now but it is very glitchy. It does not show the latest chapters of some stories and gives error when you try to open the reviews.

** It still isn't showing a chapter I posted on Saturday and I've heard similar complaints from people over on the regular fanfiction subreddit. Thus far no response from Fiction Press saying that they're going to fix it (they haven't eve pan acknowledged the problem).

** I've found that using the app bypasses the errors for reading new chapters.

The website is b0rk, but the backend seems fine.
