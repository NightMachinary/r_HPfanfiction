  “Give me Harry Potter,” said Voldemort's voice, “and

  none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I

  shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry

  Potter, and you will be rewarded."

  "NO U!" screamed the people of Hogwarts.

  Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane

  finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white

  hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and

  unknowing.
