Harry just plain refuses to stay at the Dursleys. Dumbledore just refuses to give up trying to keep him there. What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?

Another favourite, for more low-key humor over a /lot/ of chapters, is Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340). Take the canon books, turn Harry into a talking dragon and make all the adults more competent. Add a few jokes and Seinfeldian conversations, stir well.

For something a bit in-between, Albus And Harry's World Trip has Albus essentially teach Harry through /constant/ trolling, and expecting Harry to troll him back just as hard. linkffn(13388022)

** !Linkffn(Like a redheaded stepchild) And !Linkffn (Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood) The first contains an adorable family dynamic with on point jokes and comedy, one of the few fics that has made me audibly laugh, it's great.

As for L,L,&LL. This story contains some of the best sideplots in fanfiction, polotics, dark lords, dark lord elections, regular elections, mistaken identitys, it's great, and the main plot only works to aid in the ubserdity. In terms of side plots in all of the fanfiction I've read it takes spots 2, 3, 4, 5. It also works to subvert major pitfalls of the tropes it employs. Despite being an harmony fic, Ron isnt bashed, and is given his own place in the story, when family magic is brought up, it's affects are minified, when the forever uncanon wards is soon subverted in a way that I couldn't of hoped for more.

Think a black comedy, but better in readability, and with no mysogony, as people are consenting, given rights, etc.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25010857/chapters/60562639][Heir Apparent By MonsieurClavier]]

/Summary: When a Voldemort in his thirties encounters a time-travelling, seventeen-year-old Harry Potter, he makes a dangerous---and hilarious---assumption. He assumes that Harry is his son. And his son, of course, deserves the very best./

/A confused Harry plays along for the sake of self-preservation, but living with his “father” is proving to be intolerable in more ways than one./

/“You are mine,” Voldemort said gently, and smiled when Harry flinched. So the boy did know Voldemort, after all. He knew Voldemort was to be feared. “I will look after you, my own.”/

/“I don't belong to you,” Harry spat, despite his fear. Oh, what a delight he was! He was no cowering, simpering sycophant, like Voldemort's other followers; no, this child had a spine of steel. Not many could stand before Voldemort without quailing./

/“You are my son,” Voldemort declared. “Of course you belong to me. Your every cell, your every fibre, your every heartbeat. You are mine in flesh and blood and soul. You are mine in magic. And you will not deny me.”/

....

This fic is absolute torture. Both of the sexual and mental kind. To Harry and to everyone watching this shitshow. It's not particularly dark. At least not to me. But it's really more crack treated seriously, but somehow managed to be delivered in a serious way. The writing is great. The characterization is as well. And also, Harry /is/ 17, so don't get your panties in a twist. There are 15 or so chapters out now, and recently the writer suffered an injury and couldn't update regularly like they wanted. In the next couple of weeks, we should get new chapters.

Also, it /is/ a Harrymort time-travel. But Voldemort is less malevolent and more adoring of Harry. He loves him, but he only thinks it's in a fatherly way because he had no healthy male role models growing up. He hasn't figures out that he wants to bang his "son" yet.

And no, Voldemort isn't "evil" in this fic. His future self is just insane because of the horcruxes. And Harry is still pretty light. But he's now suffering a boner for 30-year-old, oblivious, demisexual Voldie /all the f/*/ing time/. And he's a bisexual disaster. So that doesn't help.

It's a fun read with just enough seriousness to make people with no sense of humour read it. And though I don't think its everyone's cup of tea, it's still great for me.

It's also written completely in Voldemort's pov. Which is sort of refreshing. That isn't often found (or at all) in Harrymort fics.

** I was reading this ao3 where Harry Potter and Tom riddle are reincarnated so many time and go back to their original universe. It is soo hilarious that I laugh out loud so many times when I'm reading through it. It's called Full Circle by tetsurashian! Definately cute yaoi. Definitely dumbledore bashing tho if your interested in that

** I really couldn't stop laughing at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6093972/1/Thinking-in-Little-Green-Boxes][Thinking in Little Green Boxes]]. That said I was about 12 when I read it, and I would be shocked if it's anywhere near as funny as I remember.

​

Edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8484470/27/Potter-Who-and-the-Wossname-s-Thingummy][Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy]] is also pretty funny while simultaneously being a serious story.

** A Harry Potter/Ratatouille crossover. Basically Snape is reincarnated in Anton Ego's body after he dies. Very well written! Contains Slash.
