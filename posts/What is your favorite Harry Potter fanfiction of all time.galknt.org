Just the one, nothing more.

It doesn't matter if the story is a badly-written/harem/powerwank, an epic saga, or a simple one-shot. It doesn't even need to be finished, or make sense. Just jot it down there.

(If your choice is part of a series, do include the others)

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** linkffn(6243892)

linkao3(5171522)

Two haunting, interesting, and sometime borderline scary stories that explore human failings within the series in one form or another. Both very much worth a read.

EDIT: Don't know why it didn't link the second one, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][The Very Secret Diary]]. It's Ginny and the Diary in Chamber Of Secrets, and all that entails. Literally just diary entries. More creepy that you might imagine...

** Fate by TheTrueSpartan

Despite not being finished, it's by far the best fanfiction I've read. The characters are so well written with depth. 11 year olds aren't some mastermind genius but kids who make mistakes. And it doesn't have any unnecessary bashing, instead it's just calling out the flaws in characters and improving on them. It really shows both sides of the coin and that things aren't as simple as black and white.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** Despite it's *many* problems, I think I'll always love Harry Potter and the prince of Slytherin. It's long, well written (by some metrics, not all), and I always find it really enjoyable to read. Sure it takes /forever/ to get anywhere, it's characters don't talk like real people in the slightest, and it largely hasn't accomplished what it set out to do (subvert lots of tropes well), but by god is it fun to read.

**** Romances... These are the ones that caught my eye while I was scrolling through my bookmarks. I really should get around to organizing those some day.

linkffn(contractual invalidation; stages of hope; contemplating clouds; marriage in mind; the sea king; favorite things; best mates; you meet in paris; what everyone missed; definitions of romance; browncoat, green eyes; a boy and his cloak; sticky situations at shell cottage;)

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This Means War]]

A Boy and His Cloak, and Sticky Situations are both very lemony.

Browncoat, Green Eyes is a crossover with Firefly and has a funny background relationship between HP and River Tam. No focus on the relationship at all, but there are a few moments where you get hints about it. Mostly recommended because it's a good pairing, not really for the romance in the story.

You Meet in Paris will probably have you crying. So read that one and then when you're looking for something more wholesome, Contemplating Clouds. CC is, unfortunately, abandoned, but what's there is worth it.

** [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18LfF7F3kBx7FpHUIa_FMGTDvnChrEaN9][Faith and Understanding]] by Lethe Laguz

This is the chronicle of Ginny's friendship with Luna, with Ginny's musings therein.

It's funny, it's heartfelt, it's goofy, it's sweet. Ginny and Luna argue and tease and confide in one another.

This is my favorite one-shot Harry Potter fanfic ever. The closings lines are absolutely beautiful:

#+begin_quote
  Ginny often got her guessing games wrong. Who could really predict someone like Luna? She seemed above earthly things as much as she seemed to understand them better than anyone.

  It didn't matter, though. When Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party, Luna's smiles were brighter than ever as she bounced around wondering whether she should wear her butter beer cork necklace while Ginny assured her that there wouldn't be any Nargles at the party. Ginny couldn't have been happier for Luna, and so it was all right if she didn't understand the Quibbler's latest theory about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

** Lady of the Lake by Colubrina is my go to comfort read. Hermione decides to take over the government and in a much more sane and manipulative manner than voldemort. Draco helps her with her plot, and they eventually get married. The inner circle consists of Draco, Theo, Blaise, Luna, Pansy and Daphne, for the most part. More are added later, but I don't want to spoil it too much. They all end up with some hefty consequences from their lust for power, and the balance of the fic is amazing.. She put a ton of research and effort into it, and the narrative is incredibly satisfying. Really heavy on the anti order, but such is the premise of the fic.

** Linkffn(The Serpentine Subterfugue) - The first book is "The Pureblood Pretense".

It was actually recommended to me a while ago, and I never got around to reading it because I was put off by the concept of a girl-Harry, but once I got past the initial weirdness, I couldn't pull myself away. The lies that slowly grow more elaborate, Riddle as a blackmailing politician, Snape as a Potions Master who takes Harry under his wing while thinking he's someone else, wonderful on so many levels. James, Lily and Sirius are alive, and just like I imagined them. Immersing myself in the world of Potions has never been more wonderful.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** The Lie I've Lived by Jbern linkffn(3384712)

At the time one of the more original premises for a fic, superior expansion on the Tri-Wizard Tourney, some of the best characterization I've read (especially the foul mouthed Sorting Hat), and I'd argue THE best pacing of a multi-chapter fic in the fandom.

** linkffn(10649604)

This story is by far not only my favourite Harry / Daphne story but my favourite HP fanfic.

I think the idea behind it is superb and the overall story line is well planned and comes to an eventual satisfactory conclusion.

It gets off to a slow start which I appreciate and doesnt rush Harry and Daphne into snogging 3 chapters in.

It really takes it's time to develop their relationship and not alot goes well until roughly halfway into the book which only serves to enhance the realism.

Another strong point of this story is the personality of its characters. Harry isnt portrayed as a depressed, incompetent child who is unable to solve the simplest of issues without aid from his friends however also isn't seen and an over powered god, with a pompous and detestable attitude. He is simply written how you'd expect a teenage boy to act given hes been forced into marriage.

As for Daphne, the seemingly omnipresent Ice Queen persona is nowhere near as potent and somewhat irritating as it is in other fics. She is ambitious and determined like a slytherin should be and at first is willing to resort to manipulation to achieve her goals however as the book begins to progress she learns that such lengths arent necessary or appropriate. Eventually she becomes what I think to be Harry's perfect partner: intelligent, strong willed and highly passionate towards her ambitions.

Now as for Ron, he at first is written as a slytherin hating dunce who is unable to see past the the green robes however as the story progresses he begins to see the error in his ways.

Hermione cares for Harry as a sister and is at first threatened his relationship with Daphne which personally I see to be somewhat un-Hermione-like however it's written so well to the point that I actually quite enjoy it.

Lastly Tracey Davis and Neville Longbottom. Both characters are written really well and I think they both make great companions to the main protagonists. Their relationship isnt heavily explored however does have a presence in every chapter which I enjoy. Neville becomes more confident and is seen as a replacement of Ron and over the course of the story builds a strong brotherly relationship with Harry.

Overall this story is simply fantastic and a pleasure to read over and over again.

** Just the one alright. This is hard. One of my favourite hp fanfiction authors is scumblackentropy. I would have sworn they where an actual writer in disguise, if it weren't for their mentioning they are an engineering student in their bio. Most of their fics aren't finished but they're still very well worth a read!

Self Slain Gods on Strange Altars is a dark ss/hg war story. Even if that pairing isn't your cup of tea holy hell the writing is so good it's worth it. They also wrote some amazing one-shots I recommend. Honestly, I would read anything they'd write and still hope they'll be back one day.

It's got drama, romance, coming-of-age, war, and is still full of lighthearded friendship. It's got it all, folks, and there's an alternate ending! Two for the price of one!

** I have a folder titled 'Favorites' with I estimate 16-ish fics out of hundreds, here's a list:

LinkAo3(Harry Potter and the lack of lamb sauce) It has some of the best Ron characterization ive ever read and I cried so much through it. It was absolutely amazing

linkffn(Tattoo by sick-atxxheart) made me cry uncontrollable tears omg it was so good

linkffn(Deeper Scarring by thesecondshelf) I love Percy and this was just amazing

LinkAo3(Harry Potter and the Really Round-About Way of Finding a Horcrux) Again Percy!!!!

LinkAo3(the family evans) One of the most memorable oneshots i've read. Amazingly written good!petunia and dudley.

LinkAo3(a life of smoke and silvered glass) One of the best snape stories that makes him good but still keeps him in character and an ass at times

LinkAo3(Vera Verto by jamiewritesfanfic) Best charcterization of McGonagall and her self-discovery after the war. The ony post-war fic ive enjoyed. Made me cry.

linkffn(A Flame In a World of Snowflakes) A simple, touching 1 1/2 thousand word fic about Colin Creevy after his death. Tears all around, bittersweet.

LinkAo3(The Smell of Hairspray Smells Like Home) A short oneshot of the Evans sisters patching up and Petunia raising Harry after Lily's death

linkffn(Holding Hands With The Enemy) a simplistic drarry oneshot during POA short, sweet and my favorite Drarry of all time because to its sweet simplicity and comfort

LinkAo3(Raised by Giants) A cute 5 chapter look at Harry never going to the dursley's and Harry being raised by hagrid with the help of house elves, goblins and the creatures of the forest (they are trying their best). Very heartwarming

LinkAo3(you'll go the same way) Draco goes back in time, staying an adult, and hunts horcruxes with Narcissa as they keep it from Lucius and hi younger self. Super well written and i'm always a sucker for time traveling draco.

LinkAo3(A Lion and Two Snakes walk into a bar and save the bloody World) Amazing series on Ao3 with 5 works. My favorite one 'Here There Be Dragons, I Suppose' is my favorite and an avengers xover. The show 'The Sentinel' plays a role only in part 2 and 3 but its only really impostant in part three. I havent seen the show and understood it perfectly with a read over of the wikipidea page. Amazing series!!!! (some smut)

linkffn(TheCode by Aduro) Amazing story, part of a series though i've only read the first. In depth look at a friendship between Bill Weasley and Draco Malfoy. Can be read alone. Not slash sadly but amazing all the same.

There are many more amazing ones but here are some of the best of the best (imo) some others that I wont link are: Severus Snape and the art of war, Struggle to Salvation (a 'reading the books' fic way into Deathly Hallows and till going, with super slow updates. lots of harry whump), It Falls to the young, Petrification Proliferation

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

  Albus Dumbledore rose to his feet, smiling at them in that way of his, like he knew something you didn't and he was proud of you for it. "Friends," he began.The door thudded open and the Marauders burst in, late and pink-cheeked with cold. The headmaster smiled at them, too, and Sirius gave a cheery little salute back.Severus sunk lower in his chair, staring witheringly over his butterbeer. "You told Potter about it, too?""He might as well put all that energy to good use," said Lily. "And, to be accurate, I told Remus.""But Potter, really?" said Severus."He and Black cooked up a jinx that gives you a boil every time you say a slur to a Muggleborn," said Lily. "It was either invite them to Alice's war club or bake them cookies, and I know where my skills lie."Severus sniffed. "Don't come crying to me if he tugs your pigtails.""Come crying to me if he pulls yours, and I'll deck him," said Lily.(Slight AU in which Severus apologizes, tries harder, and stays friends with Lily)

  When Hadrian James Potter felled the Dark Lord Voldemort, it wasn't only wixenkind who celebrated their newfound freedoms. When the Chief Warlock then moves to leave their apparently beloved little Harry Potter on a doorstep on a blustery November night it is the creatures that step up to care for and raise the Boy-Who-Lived. In the process the Boy-Who-Was-Left-Alone becomes something that no one quite expected. Not Voldemort, certainly not Dumbledore, nor any other wizard either.
