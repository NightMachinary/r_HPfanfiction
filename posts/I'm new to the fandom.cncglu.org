I recently decided to buy the entire lot of Harry Potter books to properly read. I watched all the movies when I was younger and I enjoyed them but it wasn't until the books that I started to adore the series. I've read up to the Prisoner of Azkaban and rewatched the movies up to Crimes of Grindlewald and the Cursed Child play both of the former putting somewhat of a bitter taste in my mouth for the series. I really wanted to see stuff dug into, the smaller facets of wizarding life that burden my curiosity. So I started on a fanfiction, but one I wanted to fit as smoothly into cannon as possible, and to do my best at mimicking the style and tone of the books. I also have an artist who both pre-reads my work and has done some sketches of the characters so far. (But as far as I can tell images arent allowed on the subreddit. I'll make sure to keep them somewhere that people can see!)

It takes place in 2021 Hogwarts during the events of Cursed Child but completely disconnected from the plot of the play (No time turners for me, thank you). I wanted to meet the new teachers, explore some of the locations I always wanted to see more of, and play around with magical artifacts and general wizarding life. I don't know if this has been done before and I haven't read any of the fiction surrounding Harry Potter yet though I hope to once I finish the books. Has this been done better before? Is there any interest in the lore expansion genre of fanfiction? I'd love to know. And if you have any requests for things you've always wanted to see expanded upon, let me know as well.\\
TL;DR: How much interest is there in a close-to-cannon story of students in Hogwarts after 2020


** It'll be a challenge to create a completely new interesting plot, but I'd sure read your story!

*** So far it hasn't been too much of a challenge, but I'm also not attempting to take Rowling's literacy skills full by the reins. I'm making a fanfiction in her world and just trying my best to mimic her stylings hopefully I've done well.

**** Just wondering, who's the antagonist going to be in a 2020 setting with no Voldemort or Death Eaters?

***** Twenty years without a single dark wizard seems a little off to me. And I doubt the Death Eaters wholly gave up their ambitions for power. If someone showed the promise of power and skill they'd gain followers all the same. I think the books and movies did the "Single dark wizard enemy" thing far better than what would want for a do over. I've not pinned down who I want to be the big bad. I'll be posting in chapters so hopefully I'll be able to hear from readers to help shape the way the story will go. One of the benefits of this form of content creation. What would you have wanted most for a new enemy if you got first pick?

****** There were only two big dark wizards in the entire 20th century relevant to Britain, Grindelwald and Voldemort, and Grindelwald mostly stayed in Europe, so he was only a danger to British wizards fighting on the continent, not for families at home. Only Voldemort was actually a danger to the general British magical population. So no Dark Lord in 20 years is quite possible.

If I was writing a story set in the 2020s, I'd choose technology as the main opponent. With cameras everywhere and AI instead of humans looking at the data, hiding the magical world becomes more and more difficult, so magical politicians would have to cooperate with limited in-the-know muggle politicians, but political disagreements (should we tell the Google CEO about magic?) would make things difficult, so my story would be mainly a political drama where everyone tries to further their own agenda while everyone's fighting against the unstoppable force of progress. Some radical muggleborns getting their hands on enriched uranium, trying to duplicate it with magic, making nukes and almost causing WW3 while everyone's scrambling to stop the muggle public from noticing that blast in Antarctica might be a subplot, as might be the adventures of various purebloods in the muggle world where they have no clue of their surroundings.

******* You've set a wider scope than my story is set in but you nailed one of my main pillars of thought. But so far I've started with Fith years and blood tension. And some small things like ballpoint pens being an unsavory thing to have in Hogwarts.

For now, my main focus was going to be the Wizards and Witches of modern times and the teachers that have taken up the roles of those left empty by the series finale. I've never written Harry Potter fanfiction nor have I finished the books yet. So I thought it'd be nice to start small then expand out as I felt comfortable. Namely, Wizard/Muggle relations.

** Next-gen? Yes please, but just don't make it be like some half-arsed simplistic romance where everyone is brain dead. I read enough Scorose to have my fair share of that shite.

*** Romance is pretty far from my cup of tea when it comes to genre typing. If you're a big fan of the series lore then I think you'll really enjoy my story! And thanks for the warning.

**** Have you read linkffn(ignite from slide)? It's one of the best next-gen stories in terms of romance as a subplot.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

** Write what you want not what people may find interesting. But generally, people dont realy like OCs MCs and cursed child but if it is good, people will read it regardless.

*** I appreciate the advice! And please, don't mistake me, I very much */dislike/* Cursed Child! I Just wanted to write in the timeframe. Why sulk about it being subpar when I could write a plot I found worthwhile instead.

I've not adjusted to the atmosphere here just yet, a lot of the terms I've read in requests don't make sense to me yet nor do I really understand what people really want from writers. But thank you for the support to write what I want, I'll puzzle this place out eventually!

**** to be honest, HPfandom is big enough for everything, you can write almost everything and you will get a following.

Slash is super popular but it's not really popular here because it is mostly guys.
