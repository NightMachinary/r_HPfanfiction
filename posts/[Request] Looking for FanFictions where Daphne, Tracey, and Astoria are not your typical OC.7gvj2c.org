Hey there! I'm looking for fanfictions where Daphne, Tracey, and Astoria are not your typical OC. What I mean is that the girls in the story are close to what little we know of them in canon and not the perfect OC the authors make so thsy couls pair them with Harry. A Cold Daphne who is a part of Pansy's girl gang and probably took part in ridiculing the Golden Trio and also probably a Death Eater, Astoria who is enamoured with Malfoy from young age and do not detest him, and a Tracey that compliment those characteristics of the other two or being the opposite of them to balance them out. I prefer a story where they have those characteristics and are also a main part of the story like being the pairing and such but also a minor part in the story is not something I'll mind. Thanks!


** linkffn(A Fine Spot of Trouble) Astoria loves Draco, Daphne's bitchy, and Tracy is a stripper.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

****** Harry misread her expression.

It's a closed time loop. Astoria is always the daughter, mother, and wife. It never changes. The baby at the end will grow up, see her parents die, go back in time, try to get Harry with Daphne, fall in love with Harry, have his child, and then that child will repeat the process.

******* Actually I am not completely sure with the closed loop yet.

Because when Astoria describes her parents, she clearly states that Daphne(her mother) had two blue eyes. But as per ending, both Astoria(mother) and Lily(daughter) have heterochromic eyes. So I guess it'll Be a closed loop only if Astoria somehow charmed Lily to believe that Lily is Astoria and Astoria herself was Daphne.

PS : if you read its spiritual sequel, it's even more complicated. Lily goes back in time, and charms the time travelled Astoria to believe that Lily was her sister, implying that there are 3 Greengrass sisters in the next time loop.

**** Here is my take on "Emperor":

- It's extreme AU, even in Muggle world. For example, nuclear weapons were never developed.
- Not all parts are enjoyable for me, but some parts are very enjoyable.
- The amount of politics, strategies, and tactics involved is amazing. The author obviously knows his stuffs.
- This Harry would be considered OP in most other HP fics, but not so much in this story because one person's power mattered far less in wars involving thousands of wizards and millions of Muggle soldiers. He was quite bloodthirsty and loved leading his troops personally. His presence often gave them decisive advantages, but also caused severe complications a few times.
- The pace varies. Except for the early war in France, I think the pacing is generally good. The story has mostly covered years between 2008 and 2024.
- Character developments are heavily tied to the overall political and military environments. Harry, Neville, Ginny, Astoria, Gabrielle, and Xenophilius Lovegood are the 6 Canon characters undergoing the most changes because of new circumstances. OCs are very important, especially Harry's wife Ellie, senior advisor Albert Hughes, and SIS spy Josefina.
- A very interesting theme in this story is the constant and hostile factionalism in Harry's court, and how he balances and plays the factions to his benefits.
- Astoria heads Harry's personal guard, while Daphne is a key aide to the leader of the Order of the Phoenix.

** My all-time favorite Daphne story is an OotP AU in which Daphne is the opposite of the trope. linkffn(5864749)

"Harry Potter and the chance meeting" is an incomplete postwar story in which Harry, Tracy and Daphne run from the expectations of magical Britain and do their own thing. linkffn(4508835)

"The kiss of a maiden" is an AU oneshot with one of the better implementations of "pureblood culture". linkffn(11575977)

"Calling" is an abandoned opening chapter that had great potential for a good story. A unique take on magic working to bring two people together. linkffn(10327563)

There's also "A feral snake" which is a smutfic with Harry, Hermione, and Tracy. It has not that much plot but Tracy is not just Daphne's sidekick. linkffn(12042580)
