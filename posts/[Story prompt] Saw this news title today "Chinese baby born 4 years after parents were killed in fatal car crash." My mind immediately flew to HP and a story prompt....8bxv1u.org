It doesn't have to be entirely compliant to the original HP timeline. It is fan fiction after all. What if a sibling of Harry is born 4 years after James and Lily die?

Any other story ideas?


** What if there was a glitch in the Protections, so Harry's first child is a reincarnated Lily Potter with complete memories? and then /her/ first (again) child after Harry dies is Harry reincarnated with memories, and then there's just an unending cycle of birth and really confused family trees.

*** Or, instead of Lily being reincarnated with Harry's firstborn, she is immediately merged with baby Harry... becoming Holly Evans and the Spiral Path.

** I could see Lily having two different ideas for protection against getting AK'd but being unsure which of them world work and what exactly they would actually do so she applied one to each son. Harry's caused the curse to reflect. Before hitting Harry though the other son was in the way and his protection caused him to teleport 4 years into the future.

So basically any time Voldemort might touch him or cast a spell at him he appears to wink out of existence for a moment while being unaware that any time has passed at all.

Also this technically means that Voldemort aimed for the other baby first and ended up hitting harry due to disappearing baby syndrome.

*** or maybe she did both to Harry but they interfered with each other and cloned him?

** For some reason whenever the 'hp sibling' thing comes up all I can think is 'why oh no not again'

Why not have Lily die before Harry is born and Dumbles using magic to ensure he is born?

Or forget Harry entirely.

Dumbles: Chosen one approaching, but only two mothers who have defied him thrice are close to term. What a burden this will be on them. Dumbles: I know! /Dumbles goes and gets genetic material from dead order members who defied him thrice, magically impregnates the giant squid, and uses magic to ensure baby is born at end of July/

Hell, if you want to make him super manipulative, he could magically (or even using muggle drugs) delay Harry and Nevelle birth for full control

If you really wanted to be dark about it, The potters go off like Cannon since no one told Voldemort that he can't be the choosen one. Dumbles knows Voldemorte is still alive because by the phrophacy it can't be Harry, but let's him go to the dudsleys anyway to protect his secret.

Wham, instant OC main character with the others backstory staying the same all the way into book 1
