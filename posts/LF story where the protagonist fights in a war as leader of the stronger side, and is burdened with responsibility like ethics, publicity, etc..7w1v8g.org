In most of the stories I've read so far, the protagonist is either an underdog trying to survive (e.g. canon!Harry against Voldemort) or a rebel/resistance force trying to win against the established power structure. I wonder if there are any stories that focus on the challenges of being in a position of power instead.

In a setup like this, the protagonist's challenge won't be merely to win the war. They now have to be responsible for things like ethics, balancing the interests of all their followers, keeping innocents safe, etc. The weak side can be forgiven for accidentally hurting a bunch of bystanders in the pursuit of their goals, but the leniency doesn't apply as much for the strong side.

For example, someone like Harry can be forgiven for starting dangerous riots in populated areas (e.g. the ministry) and destroying the entirety of wizardkind's time travel technology just to save themselves. Someone like Dumbledore is considered to have failed if they so much as sacrifice the well-being of one boy.

Do you know if it's possible for a story to feature a Dumbledore-esq leader, whose main challenge is not to win the war but to minimize casualties?

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
