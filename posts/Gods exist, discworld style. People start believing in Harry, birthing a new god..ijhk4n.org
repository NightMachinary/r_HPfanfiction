On Discworld, *gods* are created and thrive on belief. Small gods only have a little bit of belief, either being new or having lost all worshippers and being little more than echoes of voices in the desert wind.


** Harry Potter: God of Luck by Lady Hallen

It's a short one-shot that's effectively this concept. I would love to see it or something similar expanded further.

#+begin_quote
  If someone believed enough, it would come true. Magic needed belief to come true, and what was prayer, what was faith but belief? Of course Harry Woke Up.

** That sounds fine, until you realize that Voldemort probably got just as much worship as Harry.

*** I don't think Voldemort would get prayers or a shrine. Most of his followers seemed to fear him more than really worship him (cept maybe Bellatrix).

**** I wouldn't expect Harry to get prayers or shrines either. But as I recall, in Discworld and the like, it's usually just the belief that's important, not actual worship. So if enough purebloods believe that Voldemort is their savior, come to free them from the taint of the mudbloods, or something like that, I think he could be deified just as easily as Harry.

Besides, I don't think that fear and worship are mutually exclusive, even in real religions.

*** Harry beat Voldemort as a baby. If someone defeats another person, the victor is assumed to be stronger. As Harry beat Tom as a baby, people assume Harry to be some kind of god, because who else could defeat that monster as a baby, than a god?

** In â€˜As Good As Death' by astala7 on ff.net, Harry is raised by Death, is Destiny/Fate's apprentice and is the god of Divination. It's quite a good read.

He has to start his religion from scratch, and gain his believers, of course...
