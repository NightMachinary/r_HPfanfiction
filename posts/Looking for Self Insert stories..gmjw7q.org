I want to read some stories where either the self insert is Harry, or some new character with a special skill or something.


** I read a fair amount of SIs in other fandoms but haven't found many HP ones I've liked.

What's Her Name in Hufflepuff is the best one imo. To The Next is decent too. Scourgify was good, but has been abandoned for years.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  "To the well organised mind, death is but the next great adventure" --- Albus Dumbledore. Pretty words, yeah, but she didn't expect them to be so damn literal. Sorta-SI/OC.

  When someone dies, they lose their memory and are reborn as someone else. That's how it should be."Should" is the key word.No one wants to be reborn as Harry Potter. No one wants to keep their memories while being reborn as Harry Potter. I repeat: NO ONE WANTS TO BE HARRY- Oh forget it, I'm going into Slytherin.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter.

  Being a Chosen One is hard work. The Dark Lord of your universe is out to get you, people you love definitely die, and you have to suffer a lot. In fiction, it makes for a compelling story. In real life not so much. She isn't sure how she boarded this particular train but she wants off. Self-Insert. SI-OC.

  What would you do if suddenly you found yourself in Dumbledore's body? Crying is definitely in the plan. Changing into a four year old? Not so much. Pretending to be the son of Severus Snape? Never!When you've nothing better to do, you write crack. Enjoy!

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  Out of desperation, Dumbledore uses strange magic to summon someone who has the knowledge on how to defeat Voldemort, only what what he got wasn't expected. Self-insert.
