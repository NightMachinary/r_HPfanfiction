Are there any official numbers beside the 50-ish of the Battle of Hogwarts? Especially for the first part (until '81). Or any solid guesstimation?

And if not what is your headcanon?

Edit: To summarise my issue with numbers around 1000, those leave Voldemort's personal headcount too low to be feared a decade after his death. If he couldn't even beat a dozen of WWII Snipers or Aces, why would he be feared that much if even a Finnish Farmer or a Soviet Clerk outdid him at killing others?

#+end_quote

The British Wizarding World has been entirely beaten into submission by countless senseless murders. It explains why they behave like sheep and prefer to stick their head in the sand: Don't draw any attention to yourself. It's difficult to give an estimate in terms of numbers, but I'd put it around ~1000-ish maybe.

It's also a much better explanation for why the Potters are all extinct, instead of Dragon Pox. It's also a good reason why the world feels so small and why there's no sprawling family clans (considering the longevity and improved medicine of wizardry).

It can also be used as an explanation for why the Ministry functions so poorly. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor][The Bus Factor]] plays an important role here and I think even in real governments there's surprisingly few experts in specialized fields who are incredibly difficult to replace. Suddenly you've got bootlickers like Percy having a chance, because they need anyone they can get. It's a neat way to excuse time travel fics where everyone is suddenly competent.

My other headcanon for this stuff is inbreeding, which works just as neatly (yeah, they died because of "dragon pox" /cough/), but that's neither here nor there.

*** *Bus factor*

The bus factor is a measurement of the risk resulting from information and capabilities not being shared among team members, from the phrase "in case they get hit by a bus". It is also known as the lottery factor, truck factor, bus/truck number, or lorry factor.

The concept is similar to the much older idea of key person risk, but considers the consequences of losing key technical experts, versus financial or managerial executives (who are theoretically replaceable at an insurable cost). Personnel must be both key and irreplaceable to contribute to the bus factor; losing a replaceable or non-key person would not result in a bus-factor effect.

*** A thousand (500 in the first war) deaths over years does not really seem enough to justify Voldemort's myth, especially since it was not Voldemort's headcount but includes the Death Eaters (both victims and casualties) and the Nazi-like extermination of the Muggleborns. For comparison, Simo Häyhä got 700 Russians within three months and while the Soviets certainly feared him, they didn't "hype" him up to mystical levels. Hell, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Ulrich_Rudel#Summary_of_military_career][Hans-Ulrich Rudel]] has a headcount in the thousands and no one knows him.

A thousand seems really low all things considered. Even if you use the lowest population estimate (5k - 6k before the war), that is only a Death Toll of 16.67% over almost a decade of civil war. That rate is comparable to Serbia and the Ottomans in WWI or Poland in WWII. While certainly far from insignificant, that is still not close enough to threaten the function of the state or collapse society.

And the more common estimates of 10-20k give you a rate between 5 and 10 percent, which would make such effects more unlikely.

Well, the problem is that most spells we see used in conflict are very targeted and we don't even know about any militia style open conflicts except for the Order of the Phoenix, right? So most of those 1000 deaths have to be individual murders and assassinations, which is quite ambitious, especially if you only pick out the most competent and significant political opponents (I imagine something similar to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives][Night of the Long Knives]] just stretched out over a prolonged period of time.

A significant part falls to the concentration camps and death squads in DH as well, other than that I concur. But that number still seems a little low to build Voldemort's infamy. Let's say that 3/4 were targeted kills (spellfire, muggle hunting). A quarter of those (1/12) total were the losses of Voldemort's side. So we are left with roughly 660 deaths during both wars.

Even if we assume that most died in the first go-around and Voldemort killed half of those, that's still just around 200 over a time of several years. That is not a high number of kills compared to quite a few soldiers during the world wars. A Finnish farmer has him beaten three times over and did that in just 100 days, all close and personal, either a rifle with iron sights or various (sub)machine guns.

** There aren't any official numbers any more than there are official numbers for the overall wizarding population. And we know Rowling isn't good with numbers so anything she's said on the matter outside the books is suspect. Additionally comparing directly to real-world kill counts doesn't really work due to the differing scales and circumstances involved.

The best we can really do is judge a relative amount based on the impact Voldemort's campaign had on their society. We know he did assassinations, mind control, covert influence, and general guerilla terror tactics, and we know he was a smart manipulative bastard. He had people scared to the point they were afraid to speak his name and felt sticking their head in the sand was a better option than speaking out or taking action. This tells us he was extremely effective at spreading the sort of oppressive fear that has people wondering 'what if I'm next?'

This is leagues more successful than any real-life terror organization. While they do inspire fear, their direct actions are far enough removed from most people that they don't fear direct retribution for opposing them. Voldemort on the other hand had the entire wizarding community bar a small minority cowering. He was basically one step away from total victory before he got blown up and that didn't really change at all in the intervening years before his reemergence and almost immediate takeover of the ministry.

I think the thing we can take away from this is that his terror campaign touched most of the British wizarding community personally in some way. Most people in that community probably lost a family member, close friend, or neighbor or at least knew someone who did. As for Voldemort's personal kill count? It may not necessarily be any higher than any of his minions, but due the the fact that his minions could be considered extensions of his will their kills would likely be attributed to him by association, though he probably saved the more high-profile kills and difficult targets for himself to boost his reputation.

** For my stories, I say the population is ~10,000 (I think there's a source for that somewhere). I tried to look at how many British people died in WW2, but those statistics are so skewed and unreliable that I decided to make up a random number and say that ~11% of the population died from 1971 -- 1998. That's from people actively participating in the war, innocent civilians, and Muggleborns and their families.

This means that ~1,100 people died from the war in total. It looks like a small number, but when the population is this small and insulated... Well, they're gonna need that app Iceland has to check for incest.

Again, all of these numbers were very flimsy, not-at-all solid guesstimations.

That would be significantly higher than the UK (~2% in WWI and <1% in WWII).

The impact on society would certainly be there, but that would put Voldemort's headcount somewhere around 200 in the first war. That would leave him with, for example, less than a third of Simo Häyhä, a Finnish Farmer and behind more than a dozen Ace Pilots.

Therefore I feel it needs to be higher, otherwise his infamy and reputation would be a little baseless.

**** I know it's higher than the UK estimate, but I was also going for a bigger impact because you're right, there should've been more casualties for Voldemort to be so feared. Also recall, the first war was based more in political battles and less actual battles until its later years. I'd estimate that the war wasn't declared an actual /war/ until ~1975, so not quite as many people died in the years leading up to it.

**** Well i think you have to put this into the perspective of mages, who are kinda of invincible. Killing a bunch of people by dropping bombs on them or shooting them with a sniper gun is realtivly easy.

But when they are at the home behind magical wards it gets kind of hard to just off them. I think that it might be really frightening for the magic population to have people like Mrs Bones die at home, where they thought they were save. So that a number of 100 has a relativly hugh impact for a war. And each of them having dark mark placed afterwards to identify it was one of Voldemorts people it doesnt really matter who did it since Voldi gets the credit.

** I've been watching this thread off and on today, and I think it's a great question. I'm really interested in the relative percentages of wizards killed versus muggles killed (OP suggests something like 3/4).

Moreover, I wonder how many muggleborn or muggleborn families were killed relative to those magical individuals and families who had more secure and long-term footholds in general wizarding society. It's likely inadvertent that there is a dearth of adult muggleborns in the books, but I've always wondered if that's because a disproportionately high number of muggleborns were killed or ran (either in fear or because their families had been targeted).

*** I'm not suggesting 3/4s dead, I'm thinking something akin to 10000 out of a population of somewhere between 100-200k. That would give Voldemort a total between 2 and 4 thousand, which is enough to build his legend while at the same time not wiping out the society.
