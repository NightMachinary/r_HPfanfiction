I feel really lost when it comes to that area of romance and I don't even know what the most popular pairings would be. I tried looking on my own a few times, but wouldn't say that I found a single quality fic. I know there's probably very little femslash compared to all the HP/DM and the like, but surely there are some good works that could introduce me?

I prefer long, angsty fiction. I don't care much about specific characters - maybe with the exception of Luna, because that whole /dreamy innocence/ deal is most definitely not my thing. But I'm ok with her if the author makes her more interesting!

Thank you for anything you might come up with


** Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] (W^{T} : ~400, 000; WiP; Luna pairing warning) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][HE & the Spiral Path]] (W: 462,303; on hiatus).

Both have femslash, and both have grey-blackish protagonists. The latter has a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5073471/1/Spiral-Tangents][tangential splinter story]] (W: 163,409) for sexual scenes alone.

I'm not including Firebird series in the list because it was more portraying a forced harem arrangement between characters than a femslash between fully consenting partners.

  Steamy vignettes from Harry Potter story 'Holly Evans and the Spiral Path'; Rated M for sex, violence and/or weirdness. Spiral references at the top of each chapter, so you know where it fits in the story.

******** The IRL commitments that caused me to pause development were completely unexpected. Optimally, I would have fixed this all within a day of knowing about the bug. Since I'm still learning RegEx, it's a bit difficult to find a simple and concise way to fix it (hardcoding a solution right now).

** Also try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]], a fantastic Hermione/Bellatrix fic. It does have a ton of dark stuff vividly described, and it's definitely "long and angsty", but it's really well-written. You should give it a try.
