So we all know about "marriage law" fics... But I'm interested in stories that have explored other ways of growing the wizard society.

Like... what if they infiltrated sperm banks and replaced the muggle donations with a whole bunch of wizard sperm? (ditto egg banks?)

Like... why not just offer financial/tax incentives to people to have large families?

Things like that? It just seems that the whole Marriage Law thing is more than a little silly and just not the most efficient way to make more wizards and witches.


** Marriage laws are something neither the Third Reich nor the USSR had never dared to implement. That should give you some idea how atrocious such a law would be and I find it more than a little disturbing that the concept is so popular in the HP fandom. Sure, there's a bunch of fucked up smut, but usually, that deals with singular cases, not with an entire nation crossing lines that neither Hitler, Stalin nor Mao ever crossed.

If you want to have a population boom just build a mother cult. Hell, that's one of the few things the Third Reich is a good model for.

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

** Big tax incentives and/or government bounties for children born or getting married. Offer a stipend for mothers to incentivize staying at home with kids. Start propaganda campaigns showing happy mother's with multiple children glorifying the role of the mother. Get multiple celebrity personalities to endorse your efforts. Have efforts directed at men to showcase the honor and responsibility fatherhood brings and show what prestige and respect it earns. Make abortion illegal and give massive subsidies to adoption and fostering.

At Hogwarts give out weekend passes to special cottages in Hogsmeade where groups of teens can stay, especially mixed group couples. Designate special private areas on campus where professors cannot go. Instruct the staff to encourage students to hook up and not break up PDA. When girls do get pregnant, reward them and let them either go home to give birth or provide a special residence for pregnant teens where they are treated well.

And now for the really morally questionable stuff: spike food and water supplies with fertility agents. Use pheromones to increase sex drive. Hire large numbers of prostitutes and subsidize there pregnancies. Reduce taxes on alcohol and drugs. Legalize certain drugs proven to lower inhibitions. Approve medical drugs that have side effects that lead to increased fertility and sex drive.

There is even more vile stuff you could try but this is reprehensible enough.

That said, a plot bunny I've considered, given the disproportionate number of one-child families in canon, is a Ministry requirement that magicals take a potion that dramatically enhances the probability of multiple births (twins, triplets, etc.) If entire generations were identical twins, triplets, etc., it'd change the social dynamic in a profound way.
