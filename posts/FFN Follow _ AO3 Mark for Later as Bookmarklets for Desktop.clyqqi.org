Create a new bookmark with the following location:

=javascript:(function() {$.post('/api/ajax_subs.php',{storyid: storyid,storyalert: 1},function(data) {if(data.error) xtoast("Error");else xtoast("Success:" + data.payload_data,3500);},'json')})()=

Clicking this while on the FFN site will add the current fic to your followed fics. It does the same as clicking "Follow/Fav", then checkmarking "Follow Story" and "Save", but in a single button. So you can follow a ffnbot link, follow the story and return to satisfy your Reddit addiction with 2 less clicks.

It should work on all Desktop browsers, altough I've only tested it on Firefox.

Here's a similar piece of code to mark the current AO3 story for later:

=javascript:window.location+="/mark_for_later"=

This one isn't too useful since it's just the "Mark for later" button but you can have it in the bookmark bar if you like it there.
