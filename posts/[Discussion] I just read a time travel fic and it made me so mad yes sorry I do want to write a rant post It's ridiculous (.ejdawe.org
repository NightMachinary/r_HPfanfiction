Okay so yes, I just read a time travel fic about Harry being sent back in time to the Marauder era, and it's so long and slow and STUPID because Harry is so fucking OOC thinking "HERR DUR THE TIMELINE I HAVE TO NOT CHANGE THE TIMELINE!!! SHOULD I STOP VOLDEMORT, COULD I GO TO DUMBLEDORE AND TELL HIM EVERYTHING I KNOW...NO, NO I CANT!!! I CANT CHANGE THE TIMELINE!!!!"

AND IT IS SO FUCKING STUPID AND OOC BECAUSE THIS IS THE BOY WHO IN PRISONER OF AZKABAN, IN CANON WITH THE TIME TURNER, WANTED TO RUN UP AND STOP WORMTAIL AND RESCUE SIRIUS AND HERMIONE HAD TO HOLD HIM BACK FROM IT BECAUSE HE DIDNT GIVE A CRAP ABOUT CHANGING TIME IF IT MEANT SAVING HIS FAMILY AND GETTING JUSTICE!!!

THAT SAME BOY FROM CANON. FROM CANON TO FANFIC, ACTUALLY GOES BACK IN TIME IN A MASSIVE MEANINGFUL WAY AND GETS TO HANG OUT WITH HIS PARENTS AS KIDS, AND HE LITERALLY DECIDES OUT OF THE BLUE: "I HAVE TO LET THE TIMELINE STAY THE SAME, I HAVE TO LET MY PARENTS DIE!!! I CAN'T SAVE THEM THEY HAVE TO DIE!!!!"

#+begin_quote
  ‘If he'd only grabbed the Cloak,' said Harry. ‘It's just lying there ...'

  He turned to Hermione.

  'If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape'd never be able to get it and --'

  ‘Harry, we mustn't be seen!'

  ‘How can you stand this?' he asked Hermione fiercely. ‘Just standing here and watching it happen?' He hesitated. ‘I'm going to grab the Cloak!'

  ‘Harry,no !' Hermione seized the back of Harry's robes not a moment too soon.

  ‘Harry,' Hermione muttered, as though she knew exactly what he was thinking, ‘we've got to stay put. We mustn't be seen. There's nothing we can do ...'

  ‘So we're just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again ...' said Harry quietly
#+end_quote

THIS IS CANON HARRY.

AND THE FIC BELOW IS YOUR BULLSHIT 180 OOCNESS!!!!

JESUS CHRIST IT'S SO FUCKING STUPID AND OOC SERIOUSLY IT'S AN ENTIRE STUPID 180 FROM CANON HARRY WHO IN CANON LITERALLY TRIED TO CHANGE TIME FOR SIRIUS AND WORMTAIL, IS JUST SUDDENLY RANDOMLY IN THIS FANFIC THROWN BACK IN TIME AND NOW IS ALL ABOUT "I HAVE TO LITERALLY SIT BACK AND LET MY PARENTS BE MURDERED BECAUSE HERR DURR TIMELINE!!!!"

BULLSHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK YOU FANFIC AUTHORS YOU UNDERSTAND NOTHING!!!

I AM FUCKING FURIOUS BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS THAT A 180 DEGREE TURN FROM CANON HARRYS TIME TRAVEL BELIEFS, BUT ALSO BECAUSE ITS NOT EVEN HUMAN!!! WHAT KID WITH DEAD FUCKING PARENTS WOULD LITERALLY JUST SIT ON THEIR HANDS AND SAY: THEY NEED TO DIE. I AM GOING TO LET THEM DIE BECAUSE THE TIMELINE!!!

NOT UNLESS THEY WERE ASSHOLES OR HE WAS A FUCKING ROBOT!!! OR A VICTIM OF PLOT STEERING!!!

NONSENSICAL OOC PLOT STEERING STUPIDITY!

IT WASTED LIKE TWO HOURS OF MY TIME TRYING TO CONTINUE THAT FIC UNTIL I FINALLY GAVE UP AND REALIZED IT WAS NOT GOING TO CHANGE A DAMN THING BECAUSE HARRY IS AN OOC MORON!!!! HE LITERALLY GET HIMSELF MARKED BY VOLDEMORT AND GOES ON MISSIONS FOR HIM BECAUSE APPARENTLY ITS TOO HARD TO JUST SNIPE HIM IN THE BACK WITH A FATAL CURSE, OR OPEN HIS MOUTH AND TELL DUMBLEDORE WHATS GOING ON, OR ORGANIZE THE MINISTRY!!! OR TELL REGULUS OR SNAPE TO STAY AWAY FROM THEM!!!

HE JUST SITS ON HIS ASS AND LETS IT ALL HAPPEN BECAUSE THE TIMELINE IS MORE IMPORTANT TO OOC IDIOT HARRY THAN THE LIVING BREATHING PEOPLE IN FRONT OF HIM WHO DESERVE BETTER FROM A MORAL AND ETHICAL STANDPOINT!!!!!!!!!!!!

FUCK TIME TRAVEL NOT CHANGING THE TIMELINE SLOGGING BULLSHIT!!!!!!!!!

GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

WHY EVEN WRITE 400000 THOUSAND WORDS OF NOTHING?!??!!??!?!

SERIOUSLY WHAT IS THE FUCKING POINT IF THERE'S NO POINT BECAUSE HE NEVER DOES ANYTHING OR GOES ANYWHERE WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!! THAT'S PROBABLY WHY YOU PEOPLE KEEP ABANDONING YOUR FICS BECAUSE YOU GET SO BORED OF THEM YOURSELVES WHEN YOU REALIZE YOU ACCOMPLISHED LITERALLY NOTHING IN TERMS OF PLOT PROGRESSION OR CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!!!!!!

PS: It was this fic. linkao3(archiveofourown.org/works/10413771) and yes thank you for listening I did have to get this off my chest it's fucking dumb and ridiculous.


** While I agree that the idea of Harry choosing not to alter the timeline is ridiculously OOC, that story did warn you what it was about right in the summary, so you have only yourself to blame for reading it.

** Okay, everyone keep in mind that Alma talks about things in a different way than most of us. Best not feel offended or anything.

Also for noaacat, if by some chance you're here, remember à lot of people did enjoy your work and hopefully you enjoyed writing it too so don't let anything get to you.

For Alma, as I tell every ranter ever, it's best to rant about your own feelings and not dump on someone else's work. That's not to say you can't dump on people's work but it shouldn't be motivated so much by feelings.

Thanks for listening to my TED Talk

** This might be a radical idea, completely insane. Mental, really. But if you hated it so much (And before you start saying you didn't hate it, read your post from an objective standpoint) did it not occur to you to... I dunno... Stop reading?

** It was really frustrating. Not only was the pacing insanely slow (seriously you don't need thousands of words detailing research that goes nowhere), the character decisions made literally no sense. Why on earth would harry ever go to a meeting for death eaters if his goal was to avoid detection? These in story justification is just so weak. And the stories insistence on "preserving the timeline" after major changes have been made was beyond annoying.

*** It is highly debatable that "smarter" is to literally sit back and let real, breathing people be murdered because of hypothetical worries over time, compared to the realistic and ethical response of literally stopping those people from being murdered when you KNOW they will be!

And anyway, for that to happen spontaneously out of the blue between third year's end and middle of fifth year? In a year and a half time span? What experiences with time did he even have in fourth or fifth year to bring about this spontaneous growth of his? This total change of view? Nothing canon, that is for sure.

No. Don't even try to explain away spontaneous fanfic author OOC bullcrap. You can't. Because that's all it is. They don't understand the character and they just wanted their nonsense plot to happen so they literally made Harry do a 180 from canon. Not that there was much of a plot to that fic anyways, since Harry just sits on his hands and lets everything happen because THE TIMELINE!!!

** Wow, that's a lot of hate and you really shouldn't post a link to a story that you insult with such hatred. Harry does grow up though after PoA and in Cursed Child he does have the chance to save his parents and decides against it. Think of CC what you want, but I think that decision wasn't ooc for Harry. And the time travel we saw in PoA doesn't actually change the past (more like Novikov's self consistency principle), so maybe Harry internalized that.

  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.
