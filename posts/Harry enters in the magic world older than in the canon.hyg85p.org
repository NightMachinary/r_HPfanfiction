I want fics were Harry enters in the magic world when he is older than 11 years old, I don't care the age, even if he is an adult!

If one of those fanfic are wbwl or lily and James are alive that would be awesome


** WTB a sequel for Grey Space linkao3(12424344)

That fic is about the years between 11 and 14 when he attends Stonewall, and ends when he gets his letter. It's fantastic, though I'm guessing you want what comes next :(

(So do I.)

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
