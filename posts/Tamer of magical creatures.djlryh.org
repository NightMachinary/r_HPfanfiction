Doesn't really matter what else he has going on for him but i'd like to see a fic that explores a Harry that just has something about him that makes magical creatures gravitate towards him.

No matter how light (Phoenix) or dark (dementor) he just has a way with all creatures.

In fact he starts collecting some of them as pets... kind of like Hagrid does. Doesn't matter how dangerous or deadly they are he still finds them fascinating and adorable. Giant Cerberus? He has him rolling over on his back and getting his tummy rubbed in a matter of seconds. Basilisk? No issue at all! Umbridge sends dementors after Harry? They're too amused by him to bother attempting to take his soul. Luna's invisible creatures make themselves visible to him!

Or at least those are just some general ideas.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

  Harry didn't have the authority of the Ministry. He didn't have the reputation of the Dark Lord. He didn't have the influence of Lucius Malfoy. At heart, he was a simple tailor. "But anyone who had heard of Harry Potter knew that he was more than just a simple tailor. He was a good master." Abused, wise-beyond-years Harry.

**** Just a warning, it's not "abused" but "uber abused to the point of idiocy". Could not get past the first couple of paragraphs.
