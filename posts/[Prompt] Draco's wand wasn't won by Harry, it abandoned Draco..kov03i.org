Hawthorn wood is suited for both healing spells and curses, and hawthorn wands prefer conflicted and complex wielders. Unicorn wands are difficult to turn towards Dark Magic, and are incredibly loyal wands, prone to melancholy if mishandled.

Draco's wand took a chance on him as a child, sensing a conflicted child and hoping for a good future. Over the course of fifth and sixth year the wand became more temperamental as Draco repeatedly pushed it towards Dark Magic. Many of his difficulties in repairing the Vanishing Cabinet came down to his wand not working properly. By the time he faced against Dumbledore he most likely couldn't have cast the killing curse even if he tried.

When Harry escaped from Malfoy Manor, the wand was already done with Draco. A unicorn wand, the most loyal of all wands, would not switch allegiance through combat, but by giving up on the hope it had for its wielder and committing to a new individual.

After the war is over, Harry attempts to return Draco's wand to him and is turned away, because Draco understands after having discussed it with Ollivander while he was prisoner, that the wand isn't loyal to him anymore.

Harry ends up talking with Draco unexpectedly and together they work to make Draco into the kind of person his wand would want back. Draco finds redemption and accepts his wand in the end.


** I was interested until it turned into a Draco redemption prompt. Much more interesting would be a lovers triangle between Draco's wand, Harry's wand, and the elder wand.

Harry casts with one wand, and the two others respond. All three wands appearing at his side for attention. Harry having to deal with two decent wands absolutely miffed whenever any of the Hallows come out to play. The wands trying to sabotage one another.

Harry, out of desperation going into the duelling circuit and casting with two hands, and still one wand wanting attention.

** I like this. Please, not Drarry, but otherwise it feels like a good symbol for the good Draco redemption story, which is very rare animal indeed.

*** Agreed.

A romance subplot would feel like an additional, unneeded reward for Draco and cheapen the main plot of redemption. Additionally, a non-rushed, non-romance driven redemption story is something this fandom still lacks... Something I keep hoping for.

*** Thank you! Regardless of if Draco's wand was working for him or not in canon I am convinced that canon supports my reasoning for why the wand was willing to work for Harry and that its shift in allegiance has nothing to do with Harry taking it from Draco. The Elder Wand might like power and force and change allegiance accordingly, but not a unicorn wand.
