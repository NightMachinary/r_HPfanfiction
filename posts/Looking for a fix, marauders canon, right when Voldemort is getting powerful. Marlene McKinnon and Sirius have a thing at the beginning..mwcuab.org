:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I saw a rec for this fic here and starting reading it awhile ago but didn't save the name (like a dummy) and have now completely lost it. It has over a hundred chapters and I'm dying to keep reading it! If anyone could help I would SUPER appreciate it! Other details I can remember: - Alice and Frank are other big characters and are prefects. Alice experiences assault. - I think the first chapter is at a bonfire? - Gideon and Fabian are characters
