Everyone knows you can't see doubles of yourself when using a time turner or you'll blow up the space time continuum or whatever (thanks Hermione) but as with all laws there are exceptions: Fred & George are so identical that they can see doubles of themselves with a time turner as long as their other twin isn't there; they easily create and abusing this loophole in order to get away with all their pranks. Everyone know's its them, but no one can prove it -

#+begin_example
    "but professor we were in the library when those poor Slytherins accidentally managed to trip down three flights of slime covered stairs while       
     simultaneously professing their love of all things Gryffindor and muggle in pig-Latin to the tune of an Irish jig! why would you even think we 
     would do such a thing!"
    "...maybe because you WOULD do such a thing?" 
    "such scandalous accusations! and with no proof!"
#+end_example


** McGonagall was going over the rules of using the Time Turner to Hermione when one of the rules stood out enough she had to ask.

"Professor McGonagall I know the Weasley twins are pranksters and I would never let them use the time turner."

Sighing Minerva had hoped she could avoid this discussion with Hermione. The girl was intelligent and driven for sure. She was also entirely to logical for her to truly understand the weft and weave of magic.

"The Weasely twins are Trueborn Twins. Much like muggle identical twins only magic has made things more complicated. Trueborn Twins share one soul between two bodies. If one or both of them use a time turner then complications happen rather fast."

Hermione was trying to comprehend that witches knew for a fact souls existed and could measure them enough to tell if one was being shared enough or not. Hundreds of questions started forming as she opened her mouth to start asking them.

"Miss Granger I am sure you have many questions, they are not the point of this discussion. Be aware soul magics are classified as highly dangerous and are restricted by the ministry. So let's stay on topic."

She let slip a small smirk at the huff Hermione let out at being denied knowledge.

"When Trueborn Twins use a Time Turner whomever went back finds their soul latching on to their past shared soul. This creates a bubble effect in time. The original traveller is changed so much they almost never travel back in the first place. This means they become Trueborn Triplets instead of Twins. Needless to say it's a mess. So keep them away."

"That doesn't make any sense! If they don't travel back how can they travel back to stop themselves!? It violates everything!"

Minerva could see the girl working up to a good head and decided to poke the girl just a bit more. Her reply was perfect due to explaining the answer in full while tweaking the girl just a bit more.

"Ms. Granger, the answer is of course Magic."

Hermione's frustrated yell echoed throughout the castle in reply.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Fred and George knew ickle Hermione had a Time Turner and they also knew what fun they could have with it. They had always wanted more brothers who were fun!

They cast a sleeping charm on her in the Library and borrowed the time turner for a quick trip through time.

They found themselves right quick as all four found their soul connecting.

"Fred"\\
"Fred"\\

"Gred?"\\
"Gred!"\\
"Gred"\\
"Gred"\\
"Gred"\\
"Gred"\\
"Forge?"\\
"Forge!"\\
"Forge"\\

"Forge"

After much hand shaking and name deciding Fred, George, Gred and Forge all smiled in thought of the mischief they would get into.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Molly was knitting the Weasely family sweaters for Christmas when she heard a sound she knew about but had never heard.

It was the sound of wood growing and splitting apart followed by a deep ringing sound. Only it happened twice instead of once and it shouldn't have happened at all far as she knew.

Two new names had been added to the Weasely Family Clock. Looking up she narrowed her eyes at the cause. Of course those boys had done something foolhardy. The Names Gred and Forge made it clear what had happened.

The Prewitt family was gifted with at least one set of Trueborn Twins every generation. She was well aware of what had likely happened. Those fool boys had gotten hold of a Time Turner somehow.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

An pair of Unspeakables arrived at Hogwarts the next day. Splitting off at the main door one made their way to the great hall where breakfast was being served.

Handing over a brilliant red letter the unspeakable felt Molly's Howler was more than enough to impress on the boys how much they had erred.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

The castle shook as two Molly Weasely Howlers of truly epic volume went off. No one was sure what they were about fure sure but half the school had to be treated for ruptured ear drums so surely the boys had really stepped in it this time.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Based on a fan theory of mine, Identical Twins share one soul as they are split from one egg and sperm. The Patil twins are not identical twins so they each have their own souls.

**** Yep, in book and movie they are not identical, in fact the actresses are not even related. Look at them again and they having a passing resemblance only. Most just assume they are identical because 1) they are twins and 2) the only other twins are identical (Fred and George).

***** No, they're identical twins in the books. Here's the source - /The Goblet of Fire/, Chapter 12.

  “Er --- yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to Hermi­one, Ron, and Nearly Headless Nick. “Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don't they?” he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had been put into Gryffindor.

  “Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione. “Parvati Patil's twin's in Ravenclaw, and they're identical. You'd think they'd be together, wouldn't you?”
