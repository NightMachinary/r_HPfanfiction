*Edit - March 17, 2018 7:20 PM MST:* *IT'S BACK ONLINE!!!*

It's been like this since earlier today for me.

*Edit: I know that I could simply use Archive of Our Own, but it is seriously exhausting navigating through that site. *

*Why do someone need so many tags for every single thing they write about? Even a simple mention does not warrant a tag if they are not the main focus of the fic. *

/It doesn't even hurt to have some sort of filter to the side to limit if we want to read crossovers or not. Sometimes I would like to read a fic limited to one fandom. As for crossovers themselves. One or two are find. I can deal with three. But why the heck do someone need to write 20 different crossovers?/

/I prefer FF.net because I can look for fics knowing at least who are the main characters. It does not need to be that complicated./


** AO3 should have a tag limit. Some stories have hundreds of tags.

*** As much as I love AO3 when I'm on it I find myself longing for ff.net's organised crossover categories and inability to post multi-fandom drabble/ficlet collections.

Because it's /fucking annoying/ to be in a tiny fandom and have all the fics with the most hits/kudos/reviews being crossovers, fusions or drabble/ficlet collections.

Plus if a character is tagged in a ff.net story then I can be fairly certain they play a major role. On AO3 their being tagged can mean anything from primary love interest through major antagonist through 'this character shows up once and has no lines'.

**** they also have different tags for the same thing like for example: Harry Potter / Daphne Greengrass Harry Potter & Daphne Greengrass Since anyone can create a tag, at least I think every author can.

***** I mainly consider /‘s as pairings and &'s as interactions or relationships that is not considered romantic. However, it is sometimes difficult to tell since, as you said, every author can create a tag.

***** Yeah, anyone can create a tag, and there /are/ multiple tags for the same thing. But, two points. AO3 almost always recognizes different tags that mean the same thing as being the same. So for example if you looked for the Harry Potter tag, or the Harry James Potter tag, they'd both turn up the same stories because AO3 knows they're the same thing. Same with PersonA/PersonB vs PersonB/PersonA. But yeah, if someone creates their own tag for something that already has tags referring to it, AO3 won't know that the new tag should be synonymous with the other tags unless a lot of people start using the new tag. And the other point, those two tags you used as an example aren't the same thing anyways. One is a romantic pairing, the other is a tag for friendship/some other significant relationship.

But yeah, obviously the AO3 tagging system is YMMV. I've seen people love it because you can find literally anything incredibly easily, and I've seen people hate it because they don't want to see stories listed where the tags barely apply. Both perspectives are valid, I just wanted to make sure you weren't discounting the AO3 system because of a misconception!

** This is me too. I like the look of AO3 but all those tags and the inability to choose a central tag is just so annoying. In fact, that second part is what bothers me most. I don't think you need a ton of tag but it does, at least, warn you of ever trope you'll find in it. Every. Single. One. But no way to specify a main character or pairing? Yeesh.

****** It's not something you do, it's something your ISP does. The Domain Name Server of whoever hosts FF.net will send out info that it's back up. Different ISPs have different update schedules. There's nothing you can do but wait and maybe purge your cookies and history so your device is forced to get fresh info.

******* I thought DNS was Domain Name System. Also, I am only vaguely familiar with cookies. If I recall correctly from the top of my head, they are like digital foot prints, right? Sorry, I only recently took a class in web design so I am not overly familiar with these kind of things yet.

****** Settings>WiFi>Configure DNS>Manual and enter custom IP addresses. But it's generally better to do it on your router so it affects the entire home network.

I don't know that it's possible to use custom DNS when using cellular data.
