Hey guys, im looking for some fanfic where harry has the animagus hability.

-Must have great focus in the animagus harry (Most of the ones i've read just forget the hability later)

-No Dumbledore bashing.

-If there's some pairing, i would preffer something different (Not Harry/Hr or Harry/G)

-I would like very much if Harry's friends also develop the hability, crating some sort of Marauders 2.0

​

I've Already read:

Accidental Animagus and it's sequel.

I also read Marauder's plan.


** I'd suggest linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay) - while its not been revealed yet why or how Harry is a dragon, the story basically hits all of your requests fairly squarely on the nose. It's incomplete, but it was last updated a couple of weeks ago. I will warn you though, it's a VERY SLOW burn without a whole lot of action.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequenes of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

***** It is pretty humor-focused, but the wit tends to be pretty dry. I've enjoyed it, but sometimes it does feel like a bit much.
