Fics where Fem!Harry has a child and cares for it for the majority of the fic.


** Linkffn(The Aftermath by umecchi) is a PJO crossover where she takes care of demigod children. Quite good.

  'He followed the noise, and came to what he was looking for. A red door. A bright red door. A crimson door. Apollo knocked three times. The scuffling froze. The door opened surprisingly quickly. The girl standing in the doorway had dark red hair, emerald green eyes, and pale skin. The girl looked to be about seventeen and was very very pregnant.'

** My female Harry in my story, Fight For Rights, is going to be a parent later on! But it'll take a while to get there, since the story covers decades of her life, and she's only 18 right now. :) But she will go through a few marriages, and she'll have a couple kids as time goes on. :)

** I'm just going to mention it here since this jogged my memory and I'm curious if anyone even knows the name, but does anyone know they fem!Harry story where Harry starts off as a boy, Voldemort has captured Harry (and may have won the war), and turns him into a girl, before either raping or forcing Draco to rape Harry? Harry ends up pregnant, and Draco ends up falling in love (and I think helping Harry escape). I didn't really like it, but the sheer morbid curiosity I have for it has been jogged by this post.
