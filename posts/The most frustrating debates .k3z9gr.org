What was the most frustrating harry potter related debates you have ever seen or participated in?

and/or

What are common reoccurring Harry Potter related debates /arguments/opinions that you find really frustrating.

For me personally I once got into a debate with someone about how I disliked how the framing of Tom Riddle Sr's rape made the rapist more sympathetic than him. While they argued that wasn't the case because rape victims are by default sympathetic in all narratives and anything making Merope sympathetic was adding moral complexity. It was the most tiresome debate.

Alot of arguments that kinda diminish the negative impact of Snapes actions in general also irk me.

So what are your guy's most frustrating arguments/debates/opinions?

***** ohhh ok

My frustration with the Snape vs Marauders debate is honestly its really hard to have it because you know so little about the Marauders relationship with Snape. The only real context you get about it is super limited and provided by the three most biased individuals the Sirius Remus and Snape.

Like for example Remus and Sirius say that sorta thing was a back and forth between them. You know Snape had friends who did similar things from his memories with Lilly. So was it ....more a back and forth between the two groups? Or were Remus and Sirius saving face by hastily making up excuses?

You could interpret it either way and it would be a credible take imo. But depending on how you interpret it its going to give you very different reads of the Marauders. And that's going to give you a very different perspective of the marauders.

I think many assume you only have 1 interpretation or can only have 1 valid interpretation. Imo when these debates happen the two sides aren't seeing eye to eye all time on how to interpret the Marauders and thats not always addressed. Snape I think differences in interpretations are noted more but there's less vagueness about him so more of a agreement than with the Marauders.

****** I like Albus explanation, that the rivalry was akin to Harry vs Draco, it was returned from both sides.

Now we can say that the Marauders crossed the line with the underwear thing, but the conflict didnt exist in a vacum, Riddle was already murdering and gathering followers, sprewed his ideology around and Snape absorbed. He defended his friend going around using dark magic on random students, calls other students except for Lily a mudblood, untill he does and thats the straw that breaks their relationship.

Snape even framed James saving his life in a negative light, even though we have zero indication that he wanted something in return for said act, and Snape himself were stupid enough to listen to a throwaway comment that Sirius said.

It was so far that Snape didnt care if Sirius were innocent or not, he were going to witness Sirius get kissed, he constantly insults a orphan that his heroic father was a dick and constantly draws out the negative attributes James grew out on and places them all on the son, who is an orphan due to his own actions.

I guess what I see more is more stuff like this

Making your fav ship more popular getting it more attention. Because that means more content from the fandom about your ship.

** It bothers me when people are all "Snape didn't care if Voldemort killed James and Harry, so long as he had Lily to himself." There's basically no evidence of that. It was an /accusation/ that Dumbledore made, and Snape's only response was "Save them all, then." He would rather see Lily happy with her family and isolated from him than risk her life to Voldemort's capricious mercies. That's not a greedy attitude on his part.

Now, /maybe/ he really didn't care much about the wellbeing of James Potter, with whom he has many years of violent antagonism, or Harry, whom he had never met nor seen. Maybe. But I don't think it's fair to condemn him for the fact that he only asked Voldemort to spare Lily. He couldn't possibly have asked to spare Harry, the one prophesied to have the power to defeat the Dark Lord; that would just be absurd and bring him a painful interrogation and death. And he wouldn't have spent his rather limited influence (because Death Eaters' influence on Voldemort is /always/ very limited) in an attempt to spare James, of all people - and Voldemort would have been suspicious of his motives if he had. He could justify his request for Lily's life on selfish grounds, whether or not it really was selfish (remember Voldemort's claim to Harry that Snape lusted after Lily but agreed there were more fish in the sea), but asking for her husband to be spared would have revealed that he really cared about her wellbeing, which would have given too much away about his loyalties.

And if his actions had really arisen from a selfish desire to have Lily to himself, then it would have made absolutely no sense to protect Harry, whom he thoroughly disliked, when Lily herself was dead and gone beyond his reach.

*** The ones I've seen I don't think he wanted Lilly to himself. But he wanted her alive as long as she survived nothing else mattered. If the husband and kid died it didn't matter even if she cared deeply for them and would be devastated by their loss. That didn't matter he didn't care. Once it looked like she might die anyway he went to Dumbledore to save her .

So the point is more that I see is if he truly cared about Lilly as a person then he'd go to Dumbledore as soon as he realized Harry was targeted. His first instinct wouldn't be to trade her life for her son's. When you love someone you respect and give value to what that person values. To not even try to save Harry before he tries to trade his life for Lilly's is a example of him not caring not truly loving her.

Rather than him trying to save her and not the kid and James is like the worst thing ever.

#+end_quote

I'm not so sure about that. Consider that he initially didn't think of the prophecy as involving Lily at all. (Yes, telling it to Voldemort was a terrible act no matter who was the subject, and if anyone wants to condemn him for that part, I won't object.) He went to Dumbledore when he learned that Voldemort had identified Lily as the target.

Now, we don't know for sure, but it's very possible that he learned that fact directly from Voldemort, who would not have wanted to widely disseminate information related to how he could be defeated. It would then have been entirely natural for Snape to react (in controlled panic) along the lines of, "But perhaps when you go after the child, you could spare the mother? I always found her attractive." At that point he hasn't had the chance to go to Dumbledore yet, he's just responding to the bombshell of Lily's life being in danger. Whatever answer Voldemort gave, he then proceeded to contact Dumbledore and try to arrange real protection for her.

Appealing to Voldemort first is just logical, when Voldemort was most likely right there with him when he found out the news, and Snape is a trusted servant who has just done Voldemort a significant service. That doesn't, I think, detract from his later appeal to Dumbledore.

Now, if he actually found out in a more roundabout way from another Death Eater, took the time to make careful plans, and asking Voldemort for Lily's life at the expense of her family was his preferred option, with only an unsatisfactory answer sending him to Dumbledore, then that would be a different matter. But we don't have evidence of the actual sequence of events, leaving plenty of room for reasonable doubt.

***** I suppose it was kinda interpreted as cashing in a favor. Severus was loyal Voldemorts target wasn't Lilly but Harry. If Voldemort could spare her when he killed the kid that would be great. But when he does try to make the bet Voldemort can't guarantee or perhaps says something like only if she doesn't interfere hence the stand aside line. But Snape knows she will interfere because she loves her kid. So thats why he then goes to Dumbledore.

I mean of course it's all speculation. The only thing you can say is Snape for sure bargained to trade Lilly's life for Harry's . Dumbledore was for sure disgusted that he did and despite his discomfort at Dumbledore's reaction did not defend himself because he couldn't. In his last message to Harry explaining his feelings for Lilly and his motivations he lays it out that he did not care to at that time value what she valued. His fixation was only her life the rest wasn't considered.

However you can make the argument that in the end it was. He did value what she valued. Her fight. Her child( though he was still a petty petulant abusive bully to children and he didn't value what she valued enough to not be a complete dick to her kid).

His feelings for her perhaps pushed him into action but it wasn't enough to change him. It was not enough for him to be more considerate of her feelings.

After years with Dumbledore he did change some. Enough that there is indication that he didn't believe in the same bigoted ideology that he did before. And then he was a bit more considerate enough to die for Harry and the cause but it took a long time. It didn't happen in his 20s. It didn't happen when he was bargaining with Voldy to trade Harry's life for Lilly's imo.

******* Ya that was the thing he was pleading for her life in exchange for Harry's before even attempting to try to save both.

Basically if he truly loved her his first instinct would be to not bother pleading and go to Dumbledore directly is the interpretation in this case.

/"You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?"/

/Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore./

/"Hide them all, then," he croaked. "Keep her-- them-- safe. Please."/

Snape does not deny Dumbledore's accusation or defend himself because Dumbledore is right. Even when requesting again the slip of tongue is added in. To emphasize that Dumbledore is right here. What Snape truly wants is not them all alive even if thats what makes her happy his deepest motivation is have her live. They don't matter to him even tho they matter to her.

And its a contrast to the ending. That Harry living mattered in the end even though she was already dead.

But again he was driven by his feelings for her when goes to Dumbledore not because he loved her. If it was because he loved her he would care that Harry died because she would care and he cared about her.

Which again isn't usually used as proof that Snape is awful for not wanting to save the family.

But it is proof that he wasn't requesting this due to genuinely loving her. imo.

It reminds me of how Harry accused Sirius of killing James and Lily, while ranting about how he wanted to kill Sirius, and Sirius' first reaction was to admit to it - rather misleadingly - out of a feeling of guilt, instead of clarifying.

No he didn't care and its important to do that to make his actions in the end feel meaningful. Show despite all his faults all the awful things he did he has at least still grown in this aspect some. And that growth even if it didn't make him a great person still allowed him to do alot of good. Its kind of uplifting the its never too late to good.

I don't think that parallel really works Snape doesn't feel guilt or responsibility about not caring and I don't think he feels he deserves punishment for not giving a shit about James Potter.

But Sirius does feel guilt and responsible and feels he deserves punishment even though it wasn't his fault. So its not really a similar situation.

When it came to Harry I just figured it would be a better idea if they'd just left it open ended who he was with since romance was never a big part of his story. Of any of their stories really though you could make a argument that Hermione and Ron's friendship always had this mix with romance whether you like that relationship or not so it made more sense to definitively canonize that.

Movies though I definitely see why people ship Harry Hermione. And I do like their dynamic in the movies. But I do like book Hermione more so I'm pretty meh Harmony now its about equal to Hinny in my eyes but I've seen more Harmony in general in fic so I've gotten a bit burnt out on it üòÖ

*** The thing with race is that there are basically two definitions. The one based on social Darwinism (which is all about ancestry, used in Europe until after WWII), and then there's whatever the US is using right now (which would piss off most European racists by considering them "Caucasian").

And given how many Thrid Reich parallels Voldemort and his minions have (Umbridge is literally running a carbon copy of the Third Reich apparatus which determined someone's race based on whether or not they have magic in their bloodline), I think it's safe to disregard the American definition and use the Social Darwinism one. Which makes Mudblood racist (really, what else would it be?)

**** The straight representation was really the dumbest one lmao. I don't even think his sexuality was ever confirmed or mentioned and I don't understand why anybody would want to be represented by Voldemort/Tom Riddle. Then again it's the internet so they could have faked the whole argument.

****** Yeah true I don't think he'd want to be in a relationship unless of course he could get something from it like power and even then I doubt it would be real.
