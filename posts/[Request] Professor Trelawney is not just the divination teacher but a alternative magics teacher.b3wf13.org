** Trelawney is actual a regular muggle who is so doped up on shrooms that they see nothing wrong with living in a magical castle.

Alternatively, she went on a trip and woke up with vague memories of being hired for a position at a magical school. She now has to manage to fool everyone into thinking she is magical.
