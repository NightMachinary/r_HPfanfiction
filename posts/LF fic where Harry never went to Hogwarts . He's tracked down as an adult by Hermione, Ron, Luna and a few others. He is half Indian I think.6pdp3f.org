** Opening line:

"Draco Malfoy's shiny dragon-leather oxford sunk four inches into the largest, most excessive dog dropping he had ever seen"

I am definitely reading this fic! I love dogs, shoes and Draco....in that order.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
