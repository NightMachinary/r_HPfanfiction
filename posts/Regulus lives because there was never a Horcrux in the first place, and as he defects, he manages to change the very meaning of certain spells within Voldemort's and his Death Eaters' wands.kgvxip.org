Voldemort never successfully manages to make a Horcrux, although he does manage to put a powerful compulsion on his diary to open the Chamber of Secrets, as well as leaving Parseltongue audio (spell-activated) in it just because he /knows/ the unfortunate victim won't have Slytherin's gift.

Regulus, because he has defected but does not trust anyone (including Dumbledore), he has no idea how to help the Light win- until he finds an old book explaining wandlore and the idea that in order for a spell to work, the wand itself has to understand the meaning of the words said.

He slowly comes to the realisation that he could, quite possibly, trick a wand if he had a powerful enough Confundus Charm.

Which is how /Avada Kedavra/ and /Crucio/ repectively become, meaning-wise, /Enervus Sustento/ and /Strideo/ within the wands of Regulus Black, Walburga Black, Voldemort, Bellatrix Lestrange, Rabastan Lestrange, Lucius Malfoy, Severus Snape, Walden Macnair, Barty Crouch Junior and others.

/Enervus Sustento/ makes the victim limp, making the caster believe the victim is dead, while protecting the victim from malnourishment and deterioration until the enchantment is lifted. /Sustento/ serves two purposes here: To sustain the 'limp' enchantment, and to sustain the current status of health within the body. /Strideo/ makes the victim scream, to give the impression of unbearable torture, which would be hard on the throat muscles but ultimately would be much better than actually going through /Crucio/.

Imagine the surprise on people's faces as they realise that more and more of the victims of Death Eaters turn out to not, in fact, be dead, but rather unable to move. And imagine the surprise when, upon entering Potter Cottage, those who had previously steeling themselves for death and destruction instead find that Lily and James Potter's limp forms are alive, and more importantly, that Harry Potter is not at all affected and that Voldemort is suffering the same fate?

The Healers at St. Mungo's have already been working on a cure for the past year and a half (before Halloween 1981) with no luck. It takes them five years to restore everybody due to the long process of figuring out what spell they were subjected to, and then unravelling it (bc this is complex magic).

Remus Lupin raises Harry for the first three-and-a-half years of his life, Severus Snape shaken up enough by the fact that he almost lost Lily that he (scowlingly) agrees to brew Wolfsbane for him and look after Harry on the full moon.

When James and Lily are discharged, they are appalled at the news that their best friend is in Azkaban and immediately get him a trial where he is proven innocent and the Ministry starts to search for Wormtail the rat.

Harry is brought up jointly by the Marauders and Regulus, who had gone to visit Sirius in Azkaban and told him everything he had to do with the war, adding that he can't believe he would betray James, but apparently "an assessment of Sirius's character is not enough to get him pushed up the waiting list for all the trials that have to be had", especially as they are made more complex by the confusion of people having /wanted/ to kill and torture, but not having been /able/ to due to their wands not cooperating.

Regulus also has a hand in raising Draco Malfoy. He tries to teach him out of his parents' prejudice whenever he can, and firmly informs him that the world does /not/ revolve around him, with the result that a very confused Draco Malfoy boards the Hogwarts express not knowing what to believe, and only sure that he does, in fact, want to befriend Harry Potter. (He is still famous, if not as much as he would have been had people believed he singlehandedly /killed/ Voldemort). He still fails, because while he isn't a pureblood elitist, he is still classist. He rapidly devolves to the metaphorical pigtail-pulling we are so familiar with from canon (securing Harry's spot on the house Quidditch team) while trying to work out what it was he said wrong. Maybe he shouldn't have insulted Weasley's financial status? Should he apologise?

When Harry first meets Ron, he is immediately suspicious of Scabbers. He is even mire suspicious when he sees he is missing a toe. But he doesn't know how to write home about his suspicions without Sirius bursting into Hogwarts with murder on his mind. He tells his dad, though, and both James and Lily appeal to the Headmaster to have Scabbers investigated. He is found guilty.

Second year brings the opening of the Chamber of Secrets (again). Draco Malfoy is still their prime suspect, because of Lucius Malfoy's previous role in the war, and Ron's prejudice towards Malfoys in general because of it. They still brew Polyjuice Potion, although it's a little harder to trick Remus Lupin than it would've been Gilderoy Lockhart, but he eventually acquiesces when they finally magage to sell "we just want to see what Professor _____ (Snape's positioning at Hogwarts the first time around was purely because Voldemort would be coming back) was going on about". This time, when Harry picks the diary off the bathroom floor, he finds stuff written in it. He has strong willpower and with Ron's help, mansges to close the book and fight the frighteningly strong urge to march over to /that particular sink/ and tap his wand /just there/ on the page. They take the diary to Dumbledore, who realises the monster is a snake almost immediately. The whole thing ends before Hagrid can be carted off to Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit. Harry frees Dobby only halfway through the year. And that is the and of the life-threatening tendencies of Hogwarts. (At least while Harry is at school).

After the trial of Lucius Malfoy, during which Dobby was questioned and after which the miserable man was sentenced to a good number of years in Azkaban, Draco Malfoy is mortified and resolves not to be like his father anymore. He resolves to apologise to Weasley and not to disrupt Hagrid's class, as well as teaching his best friend, Pansy, that bloodlines don't matter. It proves harder than he thinks, but he is ultimately successful.

The fiasco at the Quidditch World Cup still happens. A few weeks afterwards, Barty Crouch Junior manages to Imperius his own father. However, he is unsuccsessful in his endeavors to rid the government of the "undeserving filth" that works for it. However, he keeps trying until Alastor Moody, after seven-and-a-half months under the Imperius Curse, breaks free and apprehends him. He is thrown back into Azkaban.

You are now free to do what you like with the rest of Harry's school years, but I think I've set up the concept for a Drarry pretty well. -Bows- -mops forehead-

** It's a good idea, but there's a fundamental flaw (to my understanding at-least) in that nonverbal spells now just become completely non existent. I mean obviously in fan fiction it's a change you can make, but personally I don't think it really makes sense

*** I didn't mean that nonverbal spells wouldn't exist, just that for a spell to work you have to communicate it adequately to your wand. (See: /levicorpus/)
