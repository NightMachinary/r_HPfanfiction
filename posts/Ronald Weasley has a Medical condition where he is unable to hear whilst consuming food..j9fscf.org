Naturally, this causes misunderstandings when Fred and George call him a "Deaf Eater" and the Hogwarts Rumour Mill being idiots assume "Ron the Death Eater" rather than "Ron can't hear whilst he's eating.


** Was discussing this with my wife and we did a brief skit where Ron is trying to explain this and says that because he cannot hear whilst eating that he never talks during meals (as he can't hear and can't contribute to the conversation in his belief) Hermione says they just thought he was being polite. Ron said “no” because at one point he was talking while eating with his parents even though he couldn't hear. He said he used to talk a lot at meals before he lost his hearing. Harry asked if Ron thinks someone cursed him to teach him not to be rude. Ron says “I do now”.

** So, basically, like my dad. He's almost deaf, so my dad stops listening to people when they talk. Instead, he just interrupts people mid-conversation and starts randomly talking about something completely off-topic. And we don't say a thing because we know he won't hear us.
