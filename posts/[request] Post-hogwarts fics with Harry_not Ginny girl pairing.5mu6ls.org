There was a post that I found here from 2 years ago with a similar request, so I'm primarily looking for newer fics that explore this area. I've recently read Days to Come and Contractual Invalidation, and I think I'm looking for fics that are similar to those.

Thanks!


** Saw someone already recommended it but Grow Young with Me is great. I wish it was updated more frequently but every update is worth the wait. Abigail Waters is my favorite OC in fanfic.

** Assuming you still want DH to happen, then:

"The Sum of Their Parts", linkffn(11858167): by far my favorite post DH story

"Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution", linkffn(10595005): the real war began after Voldemort's fall

"Grow Young With Me", linkffn(11111990): a great romance

**** It sort of alludes to Harry/Hermione/Ron. What with all three of them [[/spoiler][connected by soul magic]]

***** No it doesn't. Ron and Hermione even admit there's no way a romantic relationship would work out between the two of them.

***** It's really not but anyways op asked for Harry/other girl not Ginny. Not sure how The Sum of their Parts fits that criteria; even if they have a messed up 3 way happening in that fic.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  A/U after DH, EWE. Luna Lovegood is the Ministry's newest Unspeakable, and Harry's work as an Auror brings them into close quarters. What will happen when The Boy Who Lived Twice can't stop thinking about The Girl Who Lives In Her Own Universe? HP/LL
