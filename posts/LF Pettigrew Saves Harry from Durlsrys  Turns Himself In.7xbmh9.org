I'm looking for a fanfiction where Pettigrew saw the neglect Harry was going through as a child, then out of guilt, turns himself in and admits his crimes so that Sirius could adopt Harry.

I think it was a one-shot.


** Wow, you mean fics that don't bash Peter Pettigrew actually exist? I know the Dangerverse series ultimately has Peter reform, and there was a one-shot in Rorschach's Blot's collection that had him arranging a time travel thingy...but not the specific fic you're looking for, sorry.
