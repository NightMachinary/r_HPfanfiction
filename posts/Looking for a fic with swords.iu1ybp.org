Was just wondering if any existed. I was thinking the sort of thing where swords are much more prevalent, rather than just more extensive use of the sword of gryffindor.

** Like where instead of the old trope where Harry finds portraits of the Founders, it's a portrait of Fiore dei Liberi?

Unfortunately I've never found one

** Given that there are several prominent and dangerous creatures that are resistant or even immune to most spells, you'd think enchanted weapons would get at least some secondary attention.

** Because in a world of magic, what we want isn't magic but a sword fight. Tom Riddle's snake rapier versus Harry Potter's Massive Claymore, featuring Ronald "Look at my fucking axe" Weasley and Hermione "for my neutral special, I wield a gun" Granger.

*** I didn't mean for it to be completely focused on swords. It was just a passing thought that it could potentially be done quite well, if magic could be entwined with sword combat

**** To be honest, all the memories I have of swords in HP are ... not so good, to be polite. Generally it's an edgy mess, full of bad cliches done bad. That's why I decided to reply like I did.

Also, Hermione Granger will either have a gun, be a prodigy with a sword, or she'll fight tooth and nails the tradition because "ish barbarik !1!!1!11!". That's just how these things work.

***** Fair enough, I was just asking out of curiosity. Always looking for something new!
