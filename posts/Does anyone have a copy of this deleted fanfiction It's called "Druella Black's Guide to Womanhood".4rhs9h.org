It's one of my absolute favorite stories because of the characterizations of the Black sisters. It hadn't been updated in a while, but I'd read it again from time to time, only to discover that it had been deleted. Here is the summary: "Previously Ancient and Most Noble. Change was coming, fast and strong, and it swept the Black sisters along with it: Bellatrix to freedom and to madness, Andromeda to independence and to love, and Narcissa to womanhood and to the bitter taste of loss." I'd really love to see if someone has saved a copy of it somewhere, I've tried to look for the author to ask them about it, but they don't have messaging enabled on their ff.net account.

** This was great, I'm so sad it's abandoned! Do you know of any other stories like it? Marauder Era or focused on Andromeda/Ted's story?
