  “It's not for long,” Hermione said. “By the time we get back to Hogwarts, the Unfettering Brew will be ready.”“Listen to you!” Ron said. “He's got to get through a month with the Dursleys and a month at Malfoy Manor. With Draco Malfoy.”“Yeah, thanks,” Harry said, because he hadn't just spent the last week contemplating just how much more horrible his summer holidays were about to be than they'd ever been before.

  Draco snorted. “I'm not reduced to penury. I want something considerably beyond money, and I rather think you're the only one can give it to me.” “You want the Invisibility Cloak,” Harry said, flatly. He'd half expected as much; it was the only thing he had that Draco could want---“Don't be stupid, Potter,” Draco said. “I want my reputation back.”

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

  She almost smiles, and true alarm starts to build in his chest. “I'm afraid I'm not here for something so small. Professor Roberts has resigned.”“Good,” Draco says honestly, “Would you like a list of suitable alternatives? I know a number of competent potions masters abroad, but then of course you'd have to hire another teacher to act as the Slytherin head. I'm afraid you've dried up all the half decent Slytherin Potions masters.”“Not all of them,” she says quietly.He blinks. She can't be serious. “You can't be serious.”“Gravely,” she says, “Mr. Malfoy, I am not above begging.”What the bloody fuck. “I don't even like potions!”~Draco returns to Hogwarts. He has a duty to his blood and his name and his house, and he will fulfill it.
