I'd love to see some stories where Peter doesn't flip to Voldemorts side when stuff starts looking grim..

â€‹

Bonus points for decently lengthy and complete..


** Here's a recently completed Hermione in the Marauders era story where she ends up as a Pettigrew and decides to save her brother, along with everyone else.

There was one where it turns out he wasn't a bad guy at all, and he was a spy for light side. He didn't expected Sirius would not get a trial, and was in hiding to protect Harry.

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.

** linkffn(Just A Smile by Enn Arr)

I love how in this one Peter is truly treated as one of them, instead of how most of writers portray him. Peter does die in the war, but he died as a hero.

  She was plain. Boring. Unremarkable. Uninteresting. But then she smiled and James was hooked. Everyone knew that James was undeniably, completely, madly, truly, irrevocably, in all honesty, head-over-boots in love with Hermione Granger... aside from her. So, what does he do about it? Multiple POVs. Fluff with a dash of drama and a splice of angst. [Hermione Granger x James Potter]
