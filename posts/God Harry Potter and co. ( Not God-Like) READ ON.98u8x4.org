My ideas is:

In the HP world magic has limits that a Wizard has to break to get stronger. A wizards has a number of limits depending on their magic. If you naturally have weak magic you'll never break your limits. Only strong people can break limits and each one makes the person stronger if broken. Most people don't know about this. Most don't break even one. If a Wizards manages to break all his limits and unlock all his magic he can ascend to godhood.( Dumbs and Voldie broke some but got Voldie removed his emotions making it harder to break limits

1. BREAKING LIMITS

This is not as easy as just finding a ritual or something. To break limits one must become in tune with the world and the magic around them and be able to use it instead of the magic in them. Wandless magic shows that you are capable of breaking limits. You can also just be in a very dangerous, life threatening situation that one can't escape without more power. The more one breaks their limits the more powerful spells they can cast and more magic without fainting. You have to wear down your limit with magic beyond you but it takes looooong that way

1. *PLOT*

Harry and 2 others have very strong base powers ( This is a wizards power without breaking even a single limit) and Binns feels it as they enter the wards. You can pick the other 2. Binns is prompted to actually teach History and is a good teacher. After a few weeks he teaches the class about the ancient pantheons and how their all real (Hermione gets detention for being sassy and saying its all lies and shit! She speaks without asking and acts snobby)* and were just wizards who broke their limits. He gives Harry a false detention and explains to him about how Harry has the power to become a god but is wasting it, as he has watched him just play in class most times. Harry is reluctant so Binns tells him that he can sense that LV is just MIA and will be back and tells Harry he can train him to fight.( He can sense LV because in life Binns broke some of his limits which means he is no longer a regular ghost. He can still use magic) In return he wants to be released from his bindings when Harry, eventually becomes a *GOD -* He lies to HP that he can choose to be one but you can't, not really after feeling that power of being a** G-O-D!**. The other 2 people are smart and realise to hide their auras so Binns and other strong people - Dumbs and LV and some others- cant find them. Binns teaches Harry to do so. The other 2 can be enemies, Allies or neutral, IDC! The story can span however long but I hope it includes at least a bit of a Realm of Gods Arc!

*This is not a Hermione Bash story, in the beginning of canon she */was/* annoying and rude.

-Ron and Hermione can't be the others and the others are Firsties and from different houses. Any blood type */if you know what I mean/*/./

Harry can't be breaking limits any day of the week. it should take time. 1st limit breakone should be end of Quirell though, cuz its pretty traumatizing. He can break the others any other time but space it.

TBH this is just me trying to get rid of an idea from my head and hoping somebody likes it enough to write it for me. Please good Lords and Ladies, your my last hope!

** Hermione was rude in the beginning, but /to a teacher?/ She'd never assume she knew better than an authority figure

*** */Well/* if this teacher was telling you all the gods of ancient mythology that were debunked centuries ago you would be a bit sceptical. She was mainly rude by just speaking without asking and loudly asking questions about it and saying things like:

' But all these Gods were debunked ages ago, surely it's not true?'

She thinks shes just asking a question but her tone is aggressive and rude.

**** Magic was also debunked. Pretty sure she'd have an open mind about that at that point

****** Yes, but if magic is real, other things could be, and if a wizard said it's true then it's probably true. I don't think she had to see evidence of every piece of magic in order to believe each one was real, did she?

** Ahh. A fan of One-Punch man I see.

Also linkffn(Sixteen Years) already has superpower wizarding world. Not great, but your description is oddly reminiscent.

** I would read it. Not sure why this broad plot line has one very specific scene where you Hermione bash and everything else is open ended, but other than that I'm in.
