** I had a thought along these lines a few days ago. I've read fics where Alice and Lily were good friends back in the day, and where Alice is Harry's godmother and Lily is Neville's.

My thought was, say Alice is in fact Harry's godmother. What if Bellatrix et al were caught before getting to the Longbottoms? Or, perhaps, they were under the Fidelius and decided to play it safe until all the Death Eaters were rounded up. Any number of different plot devices could work, but point is, they are not tortured. If Alice were Harry's godmother, and Sirius was in Azkaban and therefore out of the picture, wouldn't the Longbottoms get custody?

I feel like this could be a really interesting story, but I've never seen anything like it. Maybe I'll write it some day.

Sorry for the wordy reply and no recs -- feel free to skip over. Just musing out loud (or the online equivalent).

** There are quite a few where Neville's parents are healed. For instance, this happens in nonjon's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the World is Harry Potter?]] trilogy (~300k words for the three stories, complete).

  PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

Also, it's a minor plot point, but one of Neville's parents is healed in jbern's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]]; 230k words, complete.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** Usually when you have a fic where Harry's parents are alive, one or both of them end up being douches for some reason.
