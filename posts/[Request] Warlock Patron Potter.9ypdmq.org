Are there any stories where Harry, or another HP character, is able to make [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yetnykae58][magical contracts]] or [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gnk8X79HXE][pacts]] with muggles?

I've seen power sharing rituals and the like used as an excuse, or a perk, in harem fics before but that's not really what I'm looking for. Thanks in advance!


** It would be kind of neat for some wizard to figure out how to bind their soul to a muggle like a psuedo horcrux. They can't die until that muggle does.

I could also see such a thing resulting in servant families made of muggles. Wizards use magic to keep them in high society in the muggle world no matter how incompetent they are.
