Last update was March 2019. Here is a link to the most recent chapter.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/61/Basilisk-born]]

If you're looking for a recommendation, think A Long Journey Home but with Harry instead of Fem!Harry and far, far more complete (but not nearly as well written sadly).


** I cant consider it a new chapter myself. It was a copy and paste of past chapters placed together and the author called it a “chapter” 10-20% of it was new material. The rest was copied from other chapters.

*** Yea, it seemed like the author didn't know where to go and just rehashed already stated motifs. There was absolutely no substantive story telling. I also felt that the writing quality went down a bit because this chapter felt a bit cumbersome to read.

*** He seems to do that quite a bit. I went through this story recently and kept thinking I'd accidentally gone back a chapter or two as whole chunks were repeated.

That and the spelling, which is atrocious, mar what is otherwise a great story.

*** Yeah... it's really sad that the author does that. Btw, I'm not the author.

** Oh, he does that again? That's unfortunate. I'll hang around for the next one then I guess.
