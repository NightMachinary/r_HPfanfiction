Dragon Tamer has been my favorite fanfic of all time for years, and apparently fictionalley got taken down, and the fic along with it. About half of it is uploaded on Live Journal, but I can't find the rest. Did anyone happen to save it? I'm desperate ðŸ˜­


** Sorry to hear that. There are a lot of stories with a similar name its possible someone posted it on another site pretending it was their own story, this happens sometimes when a story is good. Could you leave a description of some sort to help people find the correct one if they come across it.

I would also suggest that the fics you are enjoying the most you save yourself. There are many reasons a fic can be taken down, some because of the author others because of the site but it happens all the time. Its happened to me before so I try to download the long stories that might take me a while to read.

I personally use [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/index.php][ff2ebook]], I hope this will be of use to you in the future.
