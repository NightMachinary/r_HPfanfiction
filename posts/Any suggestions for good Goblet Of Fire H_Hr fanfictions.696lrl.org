At the end of third year, an over-exposure to dementors causes the Horcrux inside Harry's head to implode, flooding Harry's mind with Thomas Riddle's memories. It sets Harry down a path. An Angel dies, and a demon is spawned. A fire is born. Harry/Hermione Harry/Multi

** I've written "Patron", which starts in Year 4, but it's an AU and goes on into years 5 and 6. Although it features an alternate Tournament for the first ten chapters or so.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Several of Robst's stories have exactly this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/robst]]

"Banking On Her" and "Can't have it both ways" are probably the best of 'em.

*** Don't forget 'A Different Halloween". I combined it into one long story, printed it out and had it bound. Now it's part of my home library.

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...
