So I know that this story is absolutely /filled/ with cliches, and Harry's character (Rahkesh) is about as Gary Sue as you can get...

But goddamn it if I don't love this series.

Now, this is a Discussion/Promotion mixture, because I'm really looking for people's opinions on this story but I also kind of have to share them in order to do so.

Thoughts?

Personally, I really like her vision of Runes in this story. I don't think I've ever seen such an in-depth characterization of Runes in the Harry Potter fandom before, and most of the first book is entirely dedicated to Rahkesh's use of them.


** I couldn't get past the scene where Harry writes about using Vernon's gun. This is not the goddamn USA.

*** This is one of the best fics that go into detail about many kinds of magic! It is one of my favorites. Are there any others you know that explore magics like ritual and blood magic?

** This is my absolute favorite trilogy in all the hundreds of fics I've read. I am currently writing a one-shot about Namach/Ferraidar as well. I'll probably publish it in ff.net in a few months as well. Runes are touched upon in "Bloody Skies" heavily. It's rather influenced by Miranda as well.

** I have to admit that I really enjoyed this story and read it several times (notwithstanding all the cliches). I love the different kinds of magical systems (thread magic, the runes they carve on themselves) as well as the different races of people like the Chapoyo (or whatever they were called). I also liked how she wrote the elves--menacing and at times indifferent to human survival.

I wish that the author had taken it out of the Harry Potter universe altogether and just made it its own fiction.
