Hello all,

I've been on a huge Hermione triad kick lately, with a variety of extra players joining her. I figured you lovely folks might have recs for me! I particularly love Dramionaise (Draco/Hermione/Blaise) and Dramionott (Draco/Hermione/Theo), but I've also read some killer Harry/Hermione/Draco and Hermione/Sirius/Remus stories, even Hermione/Snape/Lucius ones. I'm really up to check out any triad fic recs you'd like to send my way. I am open to poly fics, too, (huge Quartet fan) so feel free to share those too, but triads are my fave. I typically use FFN, but I've read some on AO3 as well.

Thank you all in advance!! üíõ


** The Sum Of Their Parts kinda hints at a triad.

linkffn(11858167)

HP and the Girl who Walked on Water (by our own [[/u/Starfox5]] ) features a more open triad, but that isn't a central focus of the plot.

  Harry has only ever loved Ron and Hermione, Ron only loved Harry and Hermione, and Hermione only loved Harry and Ron. so why should there ever be more than just the three of them?

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

******* You write so many stories, I wouldn't know how to keep up! I may be wrong, but I also vaguely remember that story was originally meant to be short and sweet anyway. Any extra was a pure treat. As a terrible FF writer who is actually working on her first original novel, I find the former much more difficult to write. I sympathize completely. Thank you for sharing your gift, it makes me sad when readers rip apart writers who literally do this just for the joy of it. Takes some of that joy out of it when unappreciative readers do that. üíõüíõ

  When Hermione's magic pulls her away from her friends and Hogsmeade village to the top of a hill, the decision she makes will open her eyes, shining a new light on the world around her - a very hot light. With a lot of learning and some extra homework, she will learn that some people are FAR more than they seem. She may even find love in an unexpected place. **Slow-ish Updates** Set in Hermione's 6th year, beginning the weekend after her birthday. She is 18 at the commencement of this story. Just as you should be if you're reading it
