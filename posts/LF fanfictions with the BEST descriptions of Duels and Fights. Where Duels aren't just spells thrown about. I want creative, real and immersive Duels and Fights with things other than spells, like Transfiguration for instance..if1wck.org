  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** What You Leave Behind - Dumbledore, Snape and Sirius training scene is one of the best I've ever read. It is probably the only fic which shows the difference between extremely good wizards and Dumbledore effectively. Work-In-Progress /sobs/

Hallowed - Badass Dumbledore-Voldemort duels in the first few chapters, and interesting applications of Transfiguration after a brief time-skip. Abandoned.

On the Way to Greatness - Amazing duels in DoM and Longbottom house. Interesting take on Dark Magic. WIP.

The One He Feared - The entire fic is just amazeballs. Abandoned.

The Lesser Sadness - See above.

The Merging - Pretty interesting DoM battle, felt a bit rushed towards the end. Almost complete/WIP.

Magicks of the Arcane - Pretty good Transfiguration duels, also has a lot of arcane, elemental magic thing-y. Bonus points for alcoholic mentor!Dumbledore. Complete.

Wand and Shield - MCU crossover. Harry uses Transfiguration against the Hulk and Iron Monger, with a healthy mix of other stuff thrown in. Last few chapters were amazing, but sadly... Abandoned.

Renegade Cause - Half a million words long and a little convoluted at times but the constant action and final battle makes up for it. Extremely badass Dumbledore, but Harry is a bit of a cunt. Complete. Sequel Abandoned.

The Skitterleap - One long action sequence kinda fic, pretty awesome stuff. Complete.

The Unforgiving Minute - See above + cool Transfiguration.

A Beautiful Lie - mentor!Dumbledore, badass Harry, cool Transfiguration and elemental magic stuff. WIP.

A Cadmean Victory - Harry's speciality is Transfiguration, and it has pretty awesome duels. Lots of bashing and asshole Harry. Complete.

Defiance - Slightly over the top and a bit too trope-y, but pretty awesome action. Not really likeable until chapter 23~24, but it isn't unreadable either. Abandoned. Rewrite in progress.

The Dark Lord's Equal - Epic duels, interesting concept, badass Harry, lots of bashing. Probably the only H/Hr fic I actually like. Complete.

A Clock on the Face of Hell - Amazing Harry-Flitwick interaction, really cool duel in the last chapter, and badass Harry.

Wastelands of Time/ Heartlands of Time - Epic fucking duels, really badass Harry and no bashing. Complete.

The Hero Trilogy - See above.

Wind Shear - Transfiguration/Animation is pretty much the only magic that Harry uses. Incredible duels, although the rest of the fic isn't exactly amazing. Complete.

  On the Way to Greatness - Abandoned.
#+end_quote

From their bio-

2019: No, seriously, when I said "whenever you read this profile, just assume the fic is not abandoned," I meant it. I realize it's hard to assume the story is still ongoing if it's been like a geological age between updates, but that's just the way things work if you've accidentally found yourself writing an epic. I love this 'verse, though, obviously, sometimes other things take priority over me working on it. Like RL. And other fictional interests, which happen also. But the bottom line is, this story is dear to my heart and I'm not likely to declare it abandoned any time in the foreseeable future.

**** It actually is pedophilia in this case, she's 16/17 It is a terrible situation, one of which none of the involved wanted to take part in. Quite rapey too. It is still a great fic tho, very well written. Really like the characterization of Snape in it, not canon at all.

Pedophilia is a crime and I do not support it in any way, shape or form; but it's written fiction, no teen was involved in it and you can still like a fic/book/movie and not support what they depict. Lolita is an acclaimed book, but quite problematic. Murder, kidnapping, torture... are all crimes and we still have it in HP books. What matters is the light in which they are depicted, positive or negative and the circumstances for it. There are terrible SSHG fics out there that are super gross, that is completely true. But two of my favorite romantic fics are SSHG and one is a time travel fic and the other is ten years after the battle of Hogwarts. So, SSHG is not inherently wrong when talking about fanfiction(when talking about canon, definitely)

Damn, I did not mean to write such a long thing. But no hard feelings were meant :D

** I've never understood the whole prospect of like awesome cinematic duels. Like even with nonverbal spells the best dueler in any situation is only going to have no more 12-20 spells in their head during a fight. And it's hightly likely to be even less than that, I mean how many phone numbers do you know by heart? Even if a person can successfully cast and retain like 100+ spells in a non-combat situation. The other day I came across an accident and it took me like 3 minutes fumbling with my phone to call 911.
