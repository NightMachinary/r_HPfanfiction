I'm on mobile, so giving a link is rather difficult, but it's on FFN and I am very much in the mood for more actually believable and wellwritten Dark Lord!Harry, where he does it for a just cause, in this instance Teddy.


** Seriously, the author needs to write a sequel. I /really/ want to explore the Britain-as-ruled-by-Potter world that he set up. Either pit Potter&Co against another country or inside rebellion, or write it from the POV of a new trio rebelling against the Dark Lord. SEQUEL PLEASE.

*** I remember I PM'ed the author after I finished reading The Sum of Their Parts. He said he's slowly plotting another idea but that it'll take a while to finish. And it wasn't a sequel unfortunately. However, he did say that if, in the future, he wanted to write more Dark Lord Harry, the story was there to pick up from.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** Aww and here I thought this was another "Kill It With Fire" thread. Try Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Dying Embers;Oblivion by ChaosEmperorNex).

YMMV on the second one. S/He writes an insane character by making them caricatures of themselves/their archetype

  He's not the Boy-Who-Lived. He's not the Chosen One. He's not even a hero. Quite the opposite in fact. He's a being of such terrible greatness that at one point, those who were hated as devils and worshiped as deities, saw fit to seal him away. Now he's back and he wants his throne. Let Order reign...
