I've read a lot of fix it stories where Sirius is saved and then barely appears after that. What could he be useful for?


** If you ask like that, he is a black and probably knows at least something about dark artifacts and who would deal with them.

He was in Askaban for years with all those Death Eaters that kept the Horcuxes save for Voldemort and apparently they screamed in their nightmarish sleep. He could have picked up something important without knowing it.

He was already on the run and the best candidate for a grown up to travel with the group in DH

**** Just depends. If he says "HORCRUXES? Yeah it was in my Being a Black 101"... but if he says it sounds familiar and tracks down a way to find out more information for them then that's helpful. The lazy way? I dunno, the BLACK FAMILY LIBRARY which always seems to have the info needed when called upon in a fanfic. Slightly more creative? He talks to a relative in a portrait who helps. Way more creative? He tracks down info using some old Auror contacts he had established in his younger days. Perhaps someone he had busted early in his career and turned informant- likely some sort of Knockturn Alley scum who holds a grudge against Voldemort and was compliant with Sirius during the last war.

The difficult thing is how much Sirius is included by Harry. Dumbledore told him to trust in Ron and Hermione because he would need them. Would he have said the same thing about Sirius if he was still alive? If he didn't, would that have stopped Harry from confiding in him? It's enough to not share details with Remus, although he had other circumstances (Teddy) that motivated Harry to keep him uninvolved.

The one thing he could really help in the Horcrux hunt is what destroys a horcrux. Had they known Fiendfyre destroys it that may have progressed things.

Say what you will about it, but I find it hard to believe a family as sadistic as the Blacks doesn't have some pretty bad shit in their library. It's probably locked up behind all kinds of nasty spells, but it's there.

**** Not Horcuxes necessary, but having heard about some dark artifacts in general, what to expect from them... stuff like that, who deals with them and knows more about things like that back before he was in prison or even Hogwarts. Wizards live long, he could know a name and they track some old dude down to tell them stuff. He could even be the one to threaten to torture said dude for information or even do it (to save Harry and the other kids from doing something so dark) and then they oblivate the dude.

******* Same here. Here's something that could be a starting point for a fic like OP is looking for.

Dudley becomes braindead from getting kissed by the dementor. At the end of the fifth year, when Sirius falls through the veil, his body vanishes while his spirit roams London for a little while until it reaches Dudley's body, where he takes control of Dudley's body.

The plot bunny never really progressed beyond that, but Sirius inhabiting Dudley's body could be a fun jumping off point for a fic. What does Sirius-Dudley do? Go back to school, help hunt horcruxes, etc.

** Linkao3(The Debt of Time)

I recommend this one all the time, but if you haven't read it, it's a must read. Slightly different from what you described, but Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil after Dumbledore's death and then he helps them with the horcrux hunt.

It's a time travel fic, part one is the Horcrux hunt, part two someone goes back to Marauders time. Part three does highlights of the two decades between and part four goes back to the present. 154 chapters total and it is complete.

This one is different from typical time travel fics for several reasons, but I won't spoil them.

**** This is a Hermione centered fic. I don't want to give away too much, but the way she brings Sirius back is very specific, can't be done on just anyone and she isn't the only one who knows how to do it. She figures it out like anyone would expect her to, she reads a book.

That being said, over the course of the entire fic she develops into a character very different from canon, but it is gradual enough to be believable.

A Marauder's Plan is alright. Sirius stays in England and adopts Harry. He's extremely relevant to the story and cares for and raises Harry and also tries to minimise Voldemort's political and economical influence. It's quite long though at 800,000+ words.
