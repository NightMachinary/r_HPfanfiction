** If this is a request, you'll probably get more response if you flair it as such. Should be a little line of tiny words below your description (comment, share, save, etc) and flair should be one of them.

If you're looking for a specific fic, the flair is 'Whats that fic'; if you're looking for people to write fics, the flair is 'prompt'; if you're looking for lots of fics that might be what you want, the flair is 'request'.
