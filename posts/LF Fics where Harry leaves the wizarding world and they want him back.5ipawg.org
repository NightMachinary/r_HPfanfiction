Either cause he's fed up with wizards, he goes into hiding, whatever. If there is character bashing because of betrayal, I'd really prefer if he doesn't end up forgiving them just cause they wear him down by insisting he should.

Please no genderbending, m-preg, romance driven plots or pottercest. OP Harry and bashing are totally fine. Thank you.


** This is a pretty good one: linkffn(without a trace by sbmcneil)

This one is more about the events leading up to Harry leaving, but It's an enjoyable read: linkffn(Weary Wizard)

  Just a little plot bunny that wouldn't let go. There are a lot of twists and turns along with several surprises thrown in. Basically a story of two people who have lost too much and need something new and fun in their lives. Harry/Andi/?

Hermione offers him a chance to escape from it all. Harry takes it and his life takes a turn for the better. Slightly A/U right from the start and of course, Harmony.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** linkffn(The Unbreakable Vow by Ash Darklighter), though it is /in/complete. sbmcneil has one that is complete at 5 chapters, though I don't recall the name.

Both are slightly romance driven, but that's the case with fics like this.

Edit: Thanks [[/u/Uanaka]] for pointing out my stupidity!
