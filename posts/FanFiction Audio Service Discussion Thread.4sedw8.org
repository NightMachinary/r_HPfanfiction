Hello, All,

As many of you know, I will be audioreading linkffn(Not From Others) and other stories (Link to google doc below). I have finally gotten around to making the discussion thread. In this thread, you can give feedback, request fan fiction that you want to see audio read, or tell me what you think of this project. There will also be a link to this thread posted in the Sidebar.

Thanks,

ThePianoProdigy

** To be honest, I think it's a great idea. My friend is blind and we can't afford a lot of fancy software or readers that don't sound robotic, so I read fanfics to her a lot but I have a bit of an impediment that gets annoying. It'd be nice to just enjoy time with her while she listens to somebody else. haha

*** So this isn't specific to reading HP fanfiction, but your friend should hopefully know that there are many free or cheap screen reading tools that aren't awful these days.

- I suggest downloading your books using a fanfiction downloader as opposed to reading from FFN in your browser. The formatting from ff2ebook is way better to read in most situations because you can wrap it in the accessible ebook reader of your choice and not deal with their site. AO3 is fine in browser or with their included downloading links.

Without resorting to piracy, which is a thing you shouldn't do, here are some great options for actually reading the text:

- On Windows, [[http://www.nvaccess.org/][NVDA]] (a complete screenreader that competes with or exceeds the very expensive commercial products in features) is 100% free. The default speech engine included isn't great sounding, but better than nothing. You can [[http://codefactoryglobal.com/app-store/voices-for-nvda/][buy]] Eloquence (the same voice for JAWS screenreader) and Vocalizer TTS engine as an addon for about $65. This will give you much better speech.

- Window Eyes, a commercial Windows screenreader, is [[http://www.windoweyesforoffice.com/][free]] to users who have a licensed copy of Microsoft Office 2010 or newer. It includes the good voices already.

- On Apple computers and I-devices, voiceover screenreader is included on every device for free and excellent. The included voices are good. You can readily use either of these to read ebooks. The [[http://www.voicedream.com/]["voicedream"]] app on ios seems to be a well-reviewed ebook reader for voiceover users and is $15.

- On Android phones, Talkback screen reader is alright and included free. It isn't as well designed as the iphone's (iphones are just more accessible in general) but it will work just fine for reading books. You can buy high-quality voices anywhere from a few dollars to $20. I personally splurged $20 for the Eloquence TTS engine from code factory, but a lot of people like the cheaper voices (like the ivona voices) or the free Google voices better anyways. The included "google play books" app is accessible and free, and you can upload books you didn't buy from google (like downloaded fanfics) to it. I like the "moon+ reader pro" app for ebooks a little better. It's $5. The buttons are unlabeled (so you manually need to label them in Talkback before using the app the first time) but aside from that I really like it.

None of this means that she won't also enjoy human-read stories of course, but being able to access literally any story you'd like is a whole different thing. Hopefully you already know about these options, but just in case you didn't I thought I'd share.

***** The VoiceDream app is also available for Android devices. In my experience, the British Ivona voices (it comes with default voices, but you can buy dozens more from third-party vendors inside the app - different languages, different accents, etc.) are the least robotic. They are so good, it's easy to forget they aren't real!

VD also has tools to grab web pages and have them read back, which you might find useful.

Nice email address! I'm super busy today, but I'll shoot you a message sometime this week. Ideally I'd like to voice Hermione, but any female voice will do...unfortunately my British accent is a little rusty, so I can either try it out or just give them my flat American dialect.

** There are also audio/podfics available at [[http://www.audiofic.jinjurly.com/harry-potter][Jinjurly]]. They're still revamping the site, though, so their collection isn't what it was. Still, 815 podfics ain't bad. There's also [[https://amplificathon.dreamwidth.org/tag/fandom:harry+potter][amplificathon]], a podfic archive on dreamwidth. Tumblr is also a great place to search for rec lists, etc.

** I'd love to listen to some of these, if not all! I'm not blind or with any sort of disability than prevents me from reading, (other than my eyes hurting...), but I think there's some unique experiance to be had from listening to your favourite stories. I'm also thinking that I really dont mind having the chapters just 'read', as in with no variation for characters' voices. But you're doing this which is all hte more amazing. Though if this does drain your energy and resources then please think about my idea; you potentially get a lot more fics done this way. But please update me on how everythings going for you all.
