Basically the title, longer if possible. I just feel like Harry (or the character) having all his memories and skills right away, in his usually much younger body, is a little op. Bonus points if there are false memories.

If he's just straight up reborn in a different body and time that'd be cool too.

Thanks for any recommendations, sorry if I could have just searched this.


** You're my Density linkffn(11033616)

I'm reading this now, I actually don't know if Harry ever does get his memories back. At his trial in OotP, Harry tells the Ministry to go fuck themselves. So they wipe his memory and exile him from the wizarding world. Everything promptly goes to shit.

Hermione tracks him down and instigates the redo to first year. Hermione has all her memories, but Harry is an 18-year old veterinary student who believes he has a good relationship with the Dursleys and suddenly finds himself in a magic castle where everyone is an insane wizard.

  Just Suppose Harry hadn't heeded his godfather's advice, and actually lost his temper at his trial? Time travel fic and title is 'Back to the Future' joke.

** That's similar to what I'm working on. Harry falls through the Veil, gets sent back, but with a memory wipe. He begins to have vague feelings from his past life, but carries no special skills forward.

Later in life, acting on one of those intuitions, he goes back through the Veil again. Ron and Hermione try to stop him and get pulled through as well (this time around they all get genderswapped). They avoid a full mind wipe, but because everything is in an alternate timeline, it's all a bit fuzzy.

A snippet of Harry (Harriot) getting her wand from the as yet unpublished second time through:

#+begin_quote
  As soon as she took the wand, red sparks sprang from it illuminating the room, but Harry was scarcely aware of them. She doubled over as the memories that had been trickling out over the past week broke free. For perhaps the first time, Harry knew who he was. He had been a wizard. He had stood in this same shop and taken this same wand. She felt ill, as if she were over full of two foods that did not pair well. Harry James Potter's identity flowed through the wand into Harriet Evans Potter's body, mixing confused childhoods and memories into the diminutive witch.

  “Curious,” came the calm slow voice of Ollivander, “The wand remembers its master. Now how can that be? It would be that wand though, wouldn't it? Very curious.”

  Harry threw up.

  ...

  Back in the Leaky Cauldron after lunch, Harry finally had a chance to sit and think about her situation. He, the Harry before, had lived a life before. The same life, it felt, as she was living now. The events of that life were opaque. She could feel the outline of things, but couldn't recall any details. Her reactions to people though were getting stronger. She could remember names, if someone was a friend or foe, but that was about all. She could almost feel her old body though. It had been strong, molded by years of training at... something. So different than this small, soft body she had now.

  There were wisps of disconnected memories arising. Sensations that must have once been important to her, to him. There was the feeling of wind on his face as he reached for some glint of gold, soft lips pressed against his, cold emptiness as some hooded figure approached. Fear and pain, love and laughter, but the when, where, and what were lost to her.

** Honest question, what would be the point of going back in time if he can't remember anything? Just re-read canon and pretend he went back in time, if you don't want him to remember anything. Because if he can't, he'd just do everything the same way again.

*** Over time he would remember, or he would have false memories, or he would be in a different timeline where the butterfly effect has taken hold. Idk, there are different ways to do it. I was just wondering if anyone had done it differently than just Harry goes back and takes over the universe with his superior knowledge.

*** There are plenty of times where acting briefly on instinct, or feeling a vague instinctive unease or similar would be sufficient to derail canon - it would allow for the author to derail canon as desired without having to deal with issues or plot holes arising from future-Harry in young-Harry's body (creepy shipping, overpoweredness, etc.)

It would have to be done carefully, lest the times when it works feel too arbitrary.

** *Not Normal* - linkffn(7144149)

Bunch of people start experiencing deja vu follows canon, spontaneously decides to do something "different", and the deja vu stops. Continues to do more things different. The plot thickens.

harem/soul bond/kids actually have hormones

Too bad the sequel is abandoned.

  His life was never normal, then it becomes truly abnormal. He must save a world he never cared for, but with others ... he can care. H/Hr and maybe others. Rated M to be safe.
