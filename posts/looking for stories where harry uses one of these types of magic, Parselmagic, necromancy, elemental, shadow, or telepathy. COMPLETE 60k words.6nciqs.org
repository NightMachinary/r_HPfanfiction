  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

**** It's decent as far as Snape mentor fics go. I haven't read it recently though, and I read it before certain tropes started really annoying me so I can't remember if it had them or not.

**** The writing honestly hasn't held up very well over the years. It's full of cheesy out of character Snape, and while the writer provides reasons for his actions, I found them difficult to believe most of the time.

That said, it is a classic and worth reading at least once if you can get through it.

**** I read a lot of mentor!Snape and this honestly didn't really rate very highly for me. The premise is cool, but Harry is so OP that it's not believable as a "completely canon until Snape time travels" kind of fic.

Edit: I just read the description and it says specifically that Snape is NOT from the canon timeline, whoops. Anyway, I still think Harry is too OP in this fic, but I'm going to give this another read-through.

  Ginny is setting everything on fire, and Harry is calling down storms and throwing lightning out of his hands. How things would change if Harry's power was something different and he had to learn how to use it along with understanding a mysterious bond.

  The blood wards hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.
