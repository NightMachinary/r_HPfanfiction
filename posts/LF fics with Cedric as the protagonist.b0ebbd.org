I prefer T rating and under, but if there is a good M rated fic, I would give it a shot. I'm not fond of slash fics. I really enjoy AU's. Thanks in advance.

  POA AU: A tumblr prompt: Cedric Diggory + "rules" The thing about Cedric Diggory was that, if he was comfortable telling that sort of joke, he'd say that really, truly, and honestly... he was really just several anxious rabbits in a robe. Always had been.
