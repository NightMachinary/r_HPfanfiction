Any story where Harry can undesrtand other animals, not just Snakes or the occasional Dragon using parseltongue.

Owls, wolves, cast, toads, whatever. Hell, maybe he could talk to a blast ended skrewt. Ok so maybe that last one is kind of a stretch, but how about a Hippogriff.


** Dang I know of one where he can speak to owls. It was a time-travel into his younger body fic. I know he ends up owner of train lines and making 3 new mixed magic cities by buying ghost towns from muggles. (He is still before hogwarts age) He works during the summer at an owl breeding place. i know after Sirius gets cleared he decides to go to Durmstrang due to there being /way/ more classes to learn from. He does a lot of research which Sirius then presents to the Hogwarts board of governors to show why Harry didn't go to Hogwarts. Hope all the detail makes it easier to find. ðŸ˜‚

*** I've been trying to remember the title of this story for ages. All I could remember was the bit about him buying the ghost towns and making mixed cities. His employees get reduced rent, as I recall. One of the towns has a professional quidditch stadium that's fallen into disrepair, and he has it fixed up and hires a quidditch team. It also has a restaurant that the house elves run, that is a dance club by night.

**** I do not remember the stadium or the house elf club. ðŸ¤” I do remember a variety shop that he goes into with Remus. Remus looks at the book exchange while Harry looks at owl toys.

***** I think when he and Remus go shopping it's in his first city, that is on his rail line and has discounted housing for the railroad employees. The quidditch stadium and house elf club come much later, at a town that's intended to be more of a resort, and by then he's inviting investors rather than trying to do it all himself.

** It's been 3 months, but I finally found the story that [[/u/Leafyeyes417][u/Leafyeyes417]] mentioned. Apparently I combined two stories in my head, and the house elf club and restaurant were in a DIFFERENT fic where he buys up ghost towns. I'm still looking for that one.

The one where he can talk to owls is *Non-compliant, or Just How Angry Was He?* by Lil Nezumi. linkffn(12794980)

The owl language is named "Strigizoot"---a combination of strigiformes (latin for owls) and hoot---and a person who can speak it is a "Striparole."

  Just how angry was he that his life was not his own, that his future had been irrevocably mapped out and that he was being forced into an unloved machination of a marriage. Well he was angry enough to do the ritual, cast the spell and let his body die... See chapter one for more.

** YMMV because there's a lot of other stuff going on, but Harry in my Firebird Trilogy is a magical omniglot. Though he finds that hippogriffs aren't actually very conversationalists. No link since it is a fairly dark M-rated dystopian AU.

** In /Petunia's Boys/ linkffn(7832676) one of the earlier plot points is that Harry talks to the horses at the race track and passes on the information from them to Vernon, who then places bets and wins money. It's a minor point though and I can't remember if it comes up with any other creatures or after he starts Hogwarts. Also a warning for major bashing of Dumbledore and McGonagall.

  A very AU Severus/Harry mentor fic with Lucius as a friend as well. Petunia dies and the Dursley's flee Privet Drive along with Harry. They end up hiding in an unexpected place when the Hogwarts letter arrives.
