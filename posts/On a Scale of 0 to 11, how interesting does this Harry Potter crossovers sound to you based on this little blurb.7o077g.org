** Eh, there is some loose potential, but placing an OC from a video game universe into the Harry Potter universe is significantly less awesome than placing Harry Potter in a video game universe, where he meets an OC. My immediate reaction is, "meh, tell me more. 4/11"

To make this work, you'd need to have very likeable OCs with great character development. Even then, OCs are a hard sell.

Is the premise than Alan would become a teacher of some sort?

Where do Harry & Co. come into play?

Ehhh, I don't hate the idea. It's probably fine, but I'd assuming Dumbledore (Or the Hogwarts school board) wouldn't be okay with the students learning DADA from a guy who doesn't use the same type of magic. Makes more sense for his class to be an elective. That said, you could probably make it work either way if you can think of a good justification.

***** Lmao they would be fine with it... 1st year they had a muggle studies professor who could hardly talk about his subject, 2nd year they had lockhart, who I think Dumbledore knew was useless, 3rd they had a werewolf(this isn't bad because he was a bad teacher, but because I'm 99% sure the school board would have some reservations about a werewolf), 4th they had a crazy auror, 5th they had /literally no one/ so the ministry had to appoint someone Dumbledore /knew/ would interfere...If he popped up in the summer before 5th year he would almost definitely be hired if he wanted to.

** Eh, I'd be more interested in a male Nord Dovahkiin OC. A straight mage from Winterhold just isn't differentiated enough from a normal HP wizard.

With a Dovahkiin you would be able to bring in shouts, interesting interactions with Charlie Weasley, character drama when TLD kills a dragon and devours its soul, etc...

I'd go with the TLD being fairly late game (but not post Alduin, or after the Civil War), post Dawnguard (have a still vampire and happy about it Serana make a cameo if not outright follow TLD into HP world when she notices he's missing and goes looking for him), who had recently got started on learning magic before having his eventual world hopping accident, you can then have him still be getting over the Nord anti-magic suspicions, growing power into a new discipline, etc...

Just for fun, I'd make Ron be made Dovahkiin by Akatosh some how. It would be glorious to have Ron being able to learn shouts by natural talent, while Hermione spending weeks/months/years gaining the skill LOL.

** I don't really care for your blurb(no offense meant) but i couldn't get the idea out of my head all night, so I wrote out a little outline/plot synopsis that I think works out well. I don't want to step on your ideas so if you want to hear it i'll post it(or pm it to you) but if not i'd say just write what you want to read. :)

** I have to preface this with saying that I like Skyrim, I really do, but I cannot bring myself to care about the lore at all, so it´s a 0/11 for me, I´m not saying it couldn´t be good or even great, but it would really be a hard sell for me. But don´t let yourself be discouraged, write what makes you happy.

** Skyrim crossover - You've gotten me at a great time. 7/11 (Not sold, but would read)

I've been playing Skyrim the last few nights and always end up looking on FFN to see if there is anything interesting.

I would give it a try. Honestly, so long as the summary grips me...i would stick to it. I give a fic 5 chapters before i decide to put it in the 'Read some, don't want to continue' folder.

To be honest, i am more likely to read a story where a young mage finds themselves in 'modern' (1990's) Britain. ~somehow~ is sent to Hogwarts. Though, it'd be very easy to fall into a mary-sue, being that they would essentially be doing wandless & non-verbal magic.

What is difficult with your idea, is that if they fall into the MOM, most if not all central characters will be OC. Nothing wrong with this (in fact the idea is interesting), just very VERY difficult. At least, i would find it difficult :)

** Difficult to say - would I click on it to check out? Yes! From there it depends on various factors:

- is grammar and writing okay?
- are characters recognisable?
- pairings used.
- originality of the story (lots of copy paste from books?)
- writing style (I dislike: switching POV, present tense, flashbacks, blocks of italic text)

Could be 11/11 can be 0/11. I think question you should ask would people click on the link or not ;)

** What I have learned from writing is that you need to write the story you want to read. I used to have a lot more bad reviews when I was trying to not only write the story I thought of, but appeal to others. I adore Skyrim, and I think the differing uses of magic would be a fun topic to explore within the confines of the Harry Potter universe. For instance, Alan would not use a wand, and would probably be confused by the dependance that wizards in Harry Potter have with them. Inversely, Harry Potter does not have Daedra or really any form of formalized religion, so it would be interesting to see how the characters from Harry Potter deal with a hell-bent Daedric Prince. The beautiful thing about writing is the lack of confines. It does not always have to be one character falling into another world and losing all of their previous world. Maybe the Harry Potter universe could find a Daedric Prince running rampant trying to find Alan. You have a world of possibility. There are always betas that will be willing to provide input, but ultimately, it is your story. So long as you would read it and enjoy it, go for it.

** 2 - The transporting character from one world to another is generally a lazy way to do crossovers and the OCs would be damn useless because TES magic is much weaker than HP magic. Assuming they will be even able to regain magicka in HP-verse.

*** Thats not a summary, its an introduction. He /could/ append his current blurb with something useless like "and Harry Potter is going back to Hogwarts for his /n/th year, where strange and mysterious things are afoot" The connection to HP would come later on, not in the first minute of the story (although I agree this wasn't very good for showing what the story is about, its more like what you'd have for a writing prompt.)

If he was going for more of a summary(which he should have) he would just say something like: Alan was a mage at the College of Winterhold until he cast a spell (or ritual, whatever, I don't know anything about TES magic) to attempt to break free of a deal with a Daedric Prince, but instead it transported him and his sister to the middle of the Ministry of Magic, where he met Albus Dumbledore and became the next year's Defence Against the Dark Arts professor while he tries to get home.

That was probably a terrible summary, given all I know is that he lands in the ministry and becomes DADA prof. but whatever. And what I wrote still wasn't much of a summary, just a more detailed introduction.

Edit: I'm not sure where I was going in the first paragraph lol. whatever, I'll leave it.
