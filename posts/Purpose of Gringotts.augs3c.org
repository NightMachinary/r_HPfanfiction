As someone who haven't read the books I am confused to the true purpose of Gringotts because in a lot of fanfics it serves as more purpose than a simple bank. So my question is to those who have read the books: Does Gringotts serve as more than a bank?

â€‹

Also what do you guys think of Gringotts serving as more than a bank?


** In Book 1, it's a magical bank, but it's also where the Philosopher's Stone is kept in a vault (hence the idea of keeping other magical artifacts there). In Book 7, the protagonists break in to steal Hufflepuff's cup from the Lestrange Vault and encounter other magical defenses and a dragon.

The stuff about wills and bloodline tests are all fanon. Some of these ideas are drawn from real bank functions and some have been immortalized through certain popular fanfics.

Yes and no. Part of why that developed was due to the canon ideas behind how Gringotts secured their vaults, AND determined lineage and other aspects, which does seem to imply they had the possibility of dealing with wills more heavily, and bloodline tests of some sort.

Throw in the fact that we KNOW they were more than just a bank or artifact storage because of Bill Weasley's job in canon, and because of the history of Goblins vs Wizards, and it's no great stretch to assume they do MUCH more than simple banking and guarding of artifacts and likely are a multi-pronged entity with their fingers in much more than that.

You can store gold and other jewelry in lockers in banks IRL. That's a regular practice.

If you use that, you can store other stuff, although I cannot imagine why. Obviously the Stone is definitely valuable enough to be stored in a bank.

** People in this thread are simplifying Gringotts far too heavily.

One simply has to look at a combination of how the goblins secure their vaults, Bill Weasleys job as a curse-breaker for them dealing with Tombs in Egypt (and elsewhere), Goblin vs Wizarding implied history (via Binns), and the Sword of Gryffindor.

While it certainly operates as a Bank, its fingers reach beyond simple banking. How far is certainly up for interpretation but canon lore certainly implies more. Do people overdo it in fanfiction at times? Sure. But is there anything wrong with that? Canon clues seem to imply it is much more than "just a bank". And it is fan fiction after all.

** Gringotts serves only as a mercantile endeavor. They work as a bank/offsite storage company, and presumably do work as a turnover/resale company.

** Gringotts, London, is essentially a bank/secure storage area with money transfer and exchange services on top. That particular location, while used as one in fanon, likely doesn't have any major ritual, medical or other services available.

Gringotts as a whole is another kettle of fish, since it's know that they at least have treasure hunting on their portfolio as evidenced by Bill Weasley working for them as a curse breaker.

It's possible that there are certain desks or offices in Gringotts that allow a magical to hire people involved in other branches of the business, but there's no canon evidence I can recall that states that the London branch has anything to do with medical treatment, wills, bloodline tests, heritage, rituals or meeting rooms for hire. I don't think there's anything mentioned about warding or mercenary work either.

Personally, I'd actually like to see a few more fics making use of St Mungos for what it's built for, which is a hospital. It'd honestly make more sense for Harry to be directed to them for medical issues than Gringotts, particularly by magicals. Not sure on the wills/heritage since we only see two things and that's the aftermath of Sirius' will, which is given by Dumbledore, and Dumbledore himself, which is delivered by the Ministry and the Minster of the time.

** Gringotts is a financial institution, and therefore should provide finance-related services. Currency exchange for all Muggle currencies to galleons, or converting galleons into other magical currencies. A private Swiss-style bank that keeps customer information out of Ministry hands, and allows various parties to use their services to sell or exchange goods, illegal or otherwise. Allows people or institutions to "remote transfer" galleons from one vault to another, instead of someone from the Ministry having to go through the cart ride every time they want to pay out Ministry employees' monthly salaries.

Gringotts should /not/ be running health exams and "diagnosis spells" on its clients. It's not a clinic. Why should Goblins know or care that Harry has been under Dumbledore's compulsion charms, Ginny's love potions, and had his magical core blocked 80%?

This is what made me ask my question. I see this in so many fanfics that it's ridiculous but that doesn't mean I won't read them cause the fanfics happen to have pairings that I enjoy.

**** When Gringotts is used as a plot device, it's often synonymous with bad or lazy writing. By this, I mean the Gringotts inheritance test that tells Harry he's descended from Morgan Le Fey, has a creature inheritance of a Naga, and has direct blood relation to all four Founders, so he gets the "Key to Hogwarts" or something like that.

Why can't Harry /earn/ his own achievements, instead of inheriting them in the form of a plot power up? Why can't Harry struggle with his beliefs and morality, instead of being told straight up that Dumbledore's been tricking him since he was a baby? All of this would make him a better, more well-rounded character compared to having stuff handed to him.

That would be true if it were only a financial institution. Many fanfics use it as an embassy for the goblin nation, financial dealings being the most prominent service. In those cases you could secure any service that their nation is willing to provide for money.

** Canonically, it doesn't serve as much more than a bank. It hires curse-breakers to do stuff, but I don't think that was ever really expanded upon.

I think you could justify Gringotts doing more by saying that it serves as the contact point for the goblins. If you want to interact with the goblins, to pay them to do something for you or whatever, you have to go to Gringotts. Given that this is a magical race that's powerful enough to go to war against wizards and not just lose, I think it's reasonable to assume that they have their own useful magic. Just don't make goblins the deux ex machina solution to everything, they don't have all the answers.

** It's more than just a bank. They employ curse breakers and go tomb-raiding in Egypt - which is what one might assume Bill Weasley did for a living - so it's safe to say that they also provide these curse-breaking services of their employees to their clients as well.

Since these curse breakers specialise in breaking and deconstructing protective enchantments and offensive protections, it isn't a large leap to assume that they're skilled in creating those enchantments as well, and that Gringotts also provides warding services as well - even if it is overdone to death in fanon.
