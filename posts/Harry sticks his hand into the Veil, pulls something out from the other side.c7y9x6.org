** Ah, yes! Someone linked it a few months/weeks back ! Remus didn't catch Harry soon enough and he ran after Sirius, brought him back, get him alive again, and everyone, even Voldemort, was super creeped out and everything. That one?

I'm going to look back for it (even if it's not this one haha).

  Remus was so shocked at seeing Sirius fall through the veil that Harry had raced past him before the boy's intentions even registered with the werewolf. Screaming "Sirius!" Harry followed his godfather into the veil before anyone could stop him. H/Hr

***** No, I came across that during my search too. Harry specifically just stuck his arm in in the fic I remember and pulled something out, it made for an interesting visial so I think that's why it stuck with me so clearly. Thank you anyways, I appreciate it!

  When Sirius falls through the Veil in the Department of Mysteries Harry attempts to nose-dive after him. A strange encounter for Harry radically changes his world view;why worry about a Dark Lord when there's a good book to explore?
