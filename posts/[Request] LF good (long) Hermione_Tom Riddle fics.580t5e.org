Preferably with Dark(ish)!Hermione or at least a reasonable progression of their relationship. Time travel is definitely acceptable. I've been looking, but all the ones I can find are very badly written, clich√©-ridden, and/or super short. Thanks!


** Some of them are more (or totally) Voldemort/Hermione, but check the authors LadyMiya, Avalon_Sunset, Nerys, SerpentInRed, uchiha.s, markovgirl, Speechwriter, Sharkdiver1980, PenelopeGrace, Ergott. Some can be found on ffnet, others on ao3, and some have more "detailed" versions of their stories on aff.

These are the one I remember/have in my favorites, but there are others, I'll link them if you want, but that's probably enough for a good start :)

LadyMiya is my favorite, she's a great writer and her stories are amazing. They're more Voldemort/Hermione, but I love that too, and you might be interested into that too. Especially "Share Flame", I think it's my favorite fic of all the ones I read.

Most of those authors don't write a dark Hermione, but she definitely changes because of her relationship with TR or LV.

The Tomione/Volmione fandom is small but active, if you want more stories you can search the profiles of those authors, they're most likely part of groups that publish stories with that pairing, or follow ongoing stories.

** Probably the best Tomione fic I've read is Linkffn(8618289). SO many damn twists and turns and you don't know who to trust or who's trying to kill you. Definitely recommend giving it a shot.

  COMPLETE: A broken time turner shouldn't have sent me back so far. It was unprecedented. Stepping on it-smashing it-nothing should have happened. At most, I should have lost a week. At worst, I should have disappeared altogether. I shouldn't have traveled back fifty-two years; half a bloody century. This should not have happened. HG/TR.

** I'll (also) recommend /provacative envy/'s works -- War Paint, linkffn(10402749), is really good and hasn't been mentioned yet.

Take a look at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/615763/Flaignhan][Flaignhan]]'s Harry Potter works as well. Tempora Abducto, linkffn(5500156), and A Safe Place To Hide, linkffn(6451934), are also very good. (None of them are on the extremely long side, though, unfortunately).

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.

Linkffn(Ultima Ratio) definitely fits in with your long requirement, clocking in at almost 800k words. I'm not much of a romance reader (though time travel is my thing) and I enjoyed it quite thoroughly.
