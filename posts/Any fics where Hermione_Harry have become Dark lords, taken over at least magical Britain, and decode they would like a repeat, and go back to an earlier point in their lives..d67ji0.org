** You might like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer), assuming that's not the fic that sent you on this request.

Length is decent, though it's not complete. Seems to be back after a long break.

#+begin_quote
  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

*** In this one, Hermione is so grossly overpowered that Harry just feels like is along for the ride and to try to steer things from going wrong by providing foreknowledge and moral support, is rather underwhelming in my opinion, also the whole Fairy!Luna is just weird

**** It's a different feeling than Harry being overpowered himself, you must admit. And Harry remains (mostly) the one with narrative peered power because of the foreknowledge. Which, admittedly, time travel is my jam.

I've seen several spins on fairy!Luna, mostly not done very well, but again it's a step away from her usual fanon characterisation as Manic Pixie Dream Witch.

Overall, it's just the only fic I could think of that mostly fits OP's pretty narrow search, and it's at least technically competent and reasonably well-written to boot.

***** you are right of course, is just that I don't like it, my biggest complaint in this fic is that Hermione is just too much of an overloaded character, super smart, super-powerful, parallel thinking, snake familiars, possible fae contractor, potential Dark Lady, and whatever else surely got added after I stopped reading, and Harry is just like... there, the only thing he has is foreknowledge, take that away from him and he has no reason to exist, he doesn't even feel like a sidekick, just a handler.

â€‹

As far as luna goes... yeah, the whole "I only can have myself as a daughter" is beyond creepy, and I really like the usual Manic Pixie Dream Witch characterization, especially when done by eloquent authors, this one for me was just jarring

Fits some of your criteria. The only differences I think are draco added and that all 3 go back in time with memories intact.
