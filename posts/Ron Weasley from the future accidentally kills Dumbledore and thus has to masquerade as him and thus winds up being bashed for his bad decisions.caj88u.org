Just a Random idea of justified Dumbledore bashing and what if the cause is just an inept Ronald Weasley from the future forced to be Dumbledore to make sure he doesn't fuck things up too badly.


** Bashing is generally by definition unjustified.

I like the idea tbh. A take on the old fandom idea plus the hilarity of Ron trying to pretend to be Dumbeldore. Turns out all Dumbledore's long pauses and dramatic flair (such as lighting a pipe or whatever) is actually just Ron flapping about.

Never forget that perspective is everything. The only difference between the action of Goyle grunting as he tries to find the answer and Dumbledore humming is that we already believe Dumbledore is smart.

*** there was a fan theory that dumbledore was old ron

I love the idea of old Ron time traveling and realising he is Dumbledore and then spends the next few decades winging it as he gains more and more powers and awards

bloody hell, I was just Joking about dragon blood being a good oven cleaner they gave me an award for that.

Dumbledore gives a speech every is wowed due to its profundness and meaning and internally, ron is screaming I hope I pulled it off, I hope I didnt fuck it up

and the message of the story is, if you fake something long enough then you end becoming that thing

its like the old adage act like your confident and soon you will feel more confident

**** You should checkout Overlord if you haven't. Either the Manga, Anime or the Lightnovel. Lightnovel is better though.

It's basically the same thing. An ordinary salary man becomes a powerful man in another world with powerful subordinates under him, and they think he is this all powerful and smart dude who plans everything he does. He is powerful and smart, but he basically just wings it most of the time. So basically what you said here.

The light novel is fairly well written with great world building.
