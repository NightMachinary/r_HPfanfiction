Lots of fanfics are good, but what about consistently good authors?

** I don't have any big name favorite authors. Most of them write one or two stories that I like and then they stop or start writing stuff I don't feel like reading.

My favorite authors are the new people with 5 reviews. They spent the time and had the courage to put something online for others to judge. Occasionally there is a gem hidden in that pile of average and it makes my genuinely sad when lesser known good stories vanish.

** KwanLi... Love that guy's stuff, mostly because of writing quality but also because of the (I can't think of the word, sorry :/) way his plots tend to draw you in. Probably doesn't help that my all time favourite ship is H/Hr either.

Ruskbyte was really good back when they used to write stories. Rorschach's Blot is good too.

But they're the main ones I can think of off the top of my head.

*** I just tried his other main fic besides Battle School and it didn't quite do it for me. The writing was a lot more awkward and rundundant and in the first few chapters you get things like Hermoine mentioning something about Neville being stubburn and then Harry looking at her and thinking that she's "no doubt thinking of a time when Neville was stubborn"

In Battle School, I really like their rivalry and everything in general is quite interesting.

**** I sometimes think of taking down OBWL. I hate reading it. The errors and inconsistency make me want to dig a hole of shame and stick my head into it, yelling LALALA as I fight through the cringe worthy dialogue.

But when I'm feeling down about my writing or I think something I'm currently writing is shit, I can look back at OBWL and use it as a measure of my growth. Whatever I write now can't be as bad as some passages in OBWL. Also, some people still like it, so I must have done some things right with it.

***** I'm sure it probably turns into something fine and I doubt I could do much better, but the parts I read just aren't all together. I never saw a point in taking down fics, especially popular ones. There was this one Naruto fic, it was pretty good, but abandoned, then the author came back and instead of updating it, they changed the entire thing into some weird prologue thing of some sorts and there was only that remaining (the favorites and stuff were still there so it was the same story) and none of the previous story and then never updated it after that.

How is the new chapter of Battle School coming along? It was pretty cool how you updated right as I got towards the end of what's currently out last time, but it's been over that whole estimated release time (I'm not rushing you or anything, it's just that you bother to put that).

****** I had hoped to update the story before I moved but I vastly underestimated the moving process.

Currently, I'm hoping to update before the end of the month now.

******* Moving is always a pain in the ass one way or another. As for the chapter, I'll look forward to it, whenever it comes.

** Inverarity /(Alexandra Quick; Hogwarts Houses Divided)/ is a truly fantastic author. His writing is always incredibly consistent and well-plotted.

The Mad Mad Reviewer /(Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen; Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch)/ is a fantastic author and his stuff always has a fair amount of clever humour in it. Sadly, I think his account's gone dormant, as he says he's currently focussing on his original fiction.

Picasribit is consistently fantastic as well. He focusses mostly on R/S fics, though, if you're not into that sort of thing.

** My issue is that authors who are prolific (enough work to assess their consistency) really just end up recycling the same general plot over and over. I'm looking at you, H/Hr writers.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1229909/Darth-Marrs][Darth Marrs]].

Simply because his writing is consistent and funny, and he knows his stuff, all his crossovers follow the lore of their respective universes well, highly recommended!

** These people are on ffn.

I really like *Shayalonnie*. First thing of theirs I read was The Debt of Time. She recently finished Presque Toujours Pur, which I also loved. Debt was extremely long, and I felt like for its length, it stayed steady instead of suddenly becoming rough or lower quality, which I've run into plenty. I follow her on Tumblr, and I believe that's how I found the next author.

*Provocative Envy*. I was told to read her story Nightmare (Riddle/Hermione time travel, it was the first time I had read that pairing). She's got a thing for rare pairs, I know some of her stuff goes up on Tumblr, I don't know how much of it goes onto FFN (but I do recommend following her on Tumblr for short rare pair fics/situations, she's hilarious).

*Resa Aureus*. Author of 'The Last Marauder' and 'The Trick of Time.' I didn't actually realize both of those were the same author until I was partway through Trick and something about the style felt familiar. (I put fics on my kindle so the author usually isn't showing). I think her quality stays pretty consistent between stories.

*Whydoyouneedtoknow*. Author of the 'Dangerverse.' Some people don't like her style or some things she used when writing her series, but I felt like she was consistent throughout with both style, quality, and enjoyability. I binge read the series just as the last one was finishing up.
