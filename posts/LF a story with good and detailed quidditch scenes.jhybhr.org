I don't care for the era or the ship. Slash is fine as well.

Thank you!!


** Linkffn(letters) is my favorite, but [[/u/endless7]] has several great quidditch fics

**** Iron and Gold has the most focus on quidditch and what I would consider to be my best actual written quidditch. The fact that it's a sequel to another fic shouldn't be that alarming, all you really need to know is that Harry and Gabrielle got married and the story focuses on their eldest daughter.

The Prequel, Twelve Days, has a very small amount of quidditch. No actual in match scenes just quidditch is Harry's vocation so it's referenced often.

Letters has a few matches as part of the Tournament and it's a fairly decent subplot for the story itself.

The Quidditch World Cup is quidditch framed around quidditch. Probably the most actual on pitch action but Iron and Gold might be close. I think it's probably the least interesting quidditch of all of them, though.

Vitam Paramus is more about life around quidditch than the quidditch itsself. There's some in there but it's not written in a way where the on-pitch action really matters compared to the rest of the plot so it's brief for the most part.
