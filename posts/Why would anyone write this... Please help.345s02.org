Ok, so I just finished reading my first "real" Harry Potter fanfic, called Dumbledores Army and the Year of Darkness. It was awesome, but the ending... It feels like I have been gutted or something. Have anyone else read this? Is there anything I can read to get out of my misery? I think I will need to see a therapist.

** DAYOD was the first fanfic I ever read too. I think the author did a few sequels/ prequels if you need more of a fix in that universe. And it's been a while, but I think there are other decent fanfictions out there that use that same universe that Thanfiction created. Happy reading!

*** If you're gutted by the way DAYOD ended, stay away from the sequels. He gets progressively darker as the timeline goes on. Especially poor Seamus

The worst think about it for me is that the author has clearly wikipediad Irish history and decided that Seamus needs to track down and brutally murder fictional members of terrorist organisations from the 70's. Who are all totally historically inaccurate and as an Irishman it was really annoying to see someone shit all over the countries history like that (moreso than Seamus' drunken speeches about dodging pipe bombs in DAYD despite being set 20 years after the conflict was really happening). Like imagine if Harry had decided to go and track down Nazi war criminals by spending 4 hours cutting them up with knives for their crimes.

That's a link to the relevant chapter, it's disgusting. I can't stress that enough.

Also ignore every single bullshit word about Ireland. The author gets so many things wrong including the name of the language used and just...just everything...

*** I just finished this! Loved this fic! Would recommend reading this one opposed to Year of Darkness. While Year of Darkness is gritty and dark, I feel like the grittiness and darkness is more like a gimmick, a sort of 'look at the difficult times these characters are having'. In *A Call To Arms!* the darkness is really working for the story instead of the other way 'round. Also: amazing fleshing out of characters and the changing POV throughout really adds dimensions to the Battle.
