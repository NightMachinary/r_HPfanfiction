I'm interested in seeing if anyone can think of a way to make the Death Eaters /more/ than just 'lol fuck Mudbloods lmao'. Give them some depth, some actual motivation behind some of their actions.

I am NOT saying to justify their canon actions. Last time I checked attempted genocide is a pretty bad thing to do. Just try to turn them from a straight morally black faction to something...closer to very very dark grey.

Maybe something like the world's magic is slowly weakening. Tom Riddle (wrongly) assumes it's a result of Muggleborns, because they need to get their magic from /somewhere/. Voldemort and the Purebloods want to kill all the muggleborns to protect magic, realize that no way in hell would anyone support that so close to the end of WWII, and decide that they need to take over the country as well.

To clarify, I am NOT looking for people to whitewash Voldemort and the Death Eaters. The vast majority of them are complete monsters, and the few that aren't definitely aren't that far behind. They murdered probably hundreds of innocents, magical and muggle alike, and terrorized thousands. Just give them a motivation for it besides 'for the lulz also fuck mudbloods lmao'


** I have this theory: the Books were a test and PR campaign undertaken by the British Ministry of Magic. Its original goal was to identify Muggles' response to the concept of Magic. Needless to say, the results vastly exceeded its most optimistic expectation. Not only were the great majority of Muggles happy with Magic, but those involved in this campaign made billions in profit off those gullible Muggles.

While key outcomes in the Books were not altered, actual details of that conflict greatly differed. As often the case in history, winners were highly praised, and losers mercilessly bashed.

--------------

Following this theory, the 'real' Voldemort was nothing like described in the Books. He neither looked like a snake nor did he mutilate his own soul (although he did perform several dark rituals to increase his magical power).

Although he fought for a cause that might appear archaic to the modern Muggle world, it nevertheless made some sense in the Magical World (one major point of the conflict was the governing structure of Magical Britain. Voldemort favored the traditional oligarchy in which 'Old Families' called the shots, while Dumbledore wanted to turn MoM into a centralized modern government. The boiling point was reached when Dumbledore tried to pass a law that slapped 100% inheritance tax on assets more than 100000 Galleons.)

Tom Riddle had been teaching DADA from 1957 to 1968 when he resigned the post in protest. The war began in earnest when MoM tried to arrest him for his almost militant opposition to the Inheritance Tax in 1971. From then on, he adopted the mantle 'Lord Voldemort' as he completed a very important power boosting ritual.

Voldemort inspired loyalty not through wantonly torturing his followers, as the Books fondly depicted, but through persuasion, protection, and true leadership. He was also very protective of his loyal members, and went to great length to extract retributions for their sufferings.

His tactics were brutal and ruthless, but so were his enemies that were supposed to be on the 'right side on history'. Both sides did commit their shares of atrocities, as was generally the case in a civil war.

But in the end, despite defeating his arch rival Albus Dumbledore, Voldemort underestimated the cunning and ruthlessness of the young Trio, walked into their traps, and was killed.

After his death, the winners instituted systematic purges in Magical Britain, and silenced most critics. The Trio, almost or exceeding the political skills of Octavian (the most famous case of a trio of teenagers seizing power), eventually earned legitimacy by improving the lives of most wizards and witches in Britain.

** Most populations often feel threatened by differences, and the Death Eaters are an extremist group in response to a world that is consistently introducing culture and behaviors that veer from tradition.

Death Eaters, some at the very least, want to preserve their way of life. It can easily be said that, in the beginning of these sentiments, they wanted to get Muggle borns into society well before age 11 so Muggle life did not interfere with their wizarding one. It can be argued that they genuinely didn't like Muggle borns because they had interests in both wizarding and Muggle world's so they wouldn't necessarily act in the best interest of magical people. Hence why the majority of the upper echelons of society and Ministry were Pureblood.

However, like any group, it gets permeated by crazies. People who believe Muggle magically are able to steal magic from real wizards, or people who think blood is a testament to power in a society where you could (according to fanon) Literally adopt someone into your bloodline using forbidden magics.

** I really like how linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) portrays Voldemort and death eaters as more grey than just straight up evil and reverses a lot of the tropes on Voldemort winning creating a completely horrible place to be in. There are some morally questionable things going on, but over all people are just fine and life is fairly normal. Quite a lot of characters like Sirius, Lupin and Harry actually end up in better conditions and are happier than in canon.

Voldemort is still a psychopath and not a good person, but you can also see him as visionary, a leader, someone who can be reasonable when needed. Its understandable why others follow him, and why Harry while understanding that he is not a good person is on good terms with him while being almost as light and good as in canon.

They're formed at /least/ to establish an explicit caste system that will grind Muggleborns into the ground, and likely to enslave halfbloods and exterminate Muggleborns. That's evil.

They also have motivations. (Probably. I mean, I see people around engaging in behavior that will kill them and many other people along with them.) And they likely have virtues.

** The killing curse is also a 'potency' amplifier. If a child is concieved during the moon phase in which you have killed someone with the killing curse the child is guaranteed to be a wizard (a.k.a. no squibs). Voldemort discovers this. He also discovers that every wizard killed with the killing curse means that two new muggleborns are born in that part of the world. He doesn't tell anyone that part but he does exploit it by using the increase muggleborn birthrate as evidence for his cause.

** Just make them a death metal band.

But for real, I've seen Death Eaters whose primary motivation may be that they hate muggles and muggleborn, but are intelligent about it, enough that they fall into Voldemort's grand plan of ruling Britain so that he has a nation as a base of operations to prevent muggles from destroying magic. Can't really remember the fics though.

** The stories I've read where there's a motivation it's usually about how Muggleborns don't respect Wizzarding culture. But to be honest the plot usually falls apart at some point because the justification is just kind of bad.

In those stories they usually try to distance the Pure Bloods from Death Eaters, even though they usually are the same people.

The story that, in my opinion, managed to walk the line the longest is the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/346100][Perfectly Normal]] series. It's complete through 4 years, although I stopped reading mid year 3.
