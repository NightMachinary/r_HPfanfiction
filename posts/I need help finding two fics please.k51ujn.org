:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Both of these I'm 99.8% sure were on fanfiction.net They're both pretty long (90+k words). The first one I believe is complete; the second one is not, as far as I remember.

I'm really sorry, but I don't remember much about either fic üò≠ it's been driving me crazy, and I really want to read them again.

1st story: At one point in the story, Fred and George find out that Percy is dating a muggle. It's all very serious and secret. Later in the story, Mr. and Mrs. Granger - plus Percy and his muggle girlfriend (and a bunch of unlikely characters) - help out in the final battle. I believe Snape is good and even Draco turns around by the end of it.

2nd story: Petunia divorces Vernon (I'm pretty sure it was a divorce but he also might be dead...he's not in the picture) and raises Harry as Harry Evans. Dudley and Harry become brothers. Dudley is diagnosed with cancer (which may have been the catalyst for the possible divorce?). Harry goes to Hogwarts and kind of befriends Snape. I remember Harry asking Snape if there were magical cures for cancer. When Snape said no, Harry was all like ‚Äúok I may be eleven, but I'm going to fix this.‚Äù There's also a scene with Dudley going to get ice cream with a required visit with Aunt Marge and it does not go well. She picks on Harry and Dudley loses it and tells her off. I believe Sirius is also there for that interaction.

It's been at least a year or two since I've read these. I'm really sorry for sparse details. I will add more if I can think of it.

** I'm pretty sure the first one is "Escape" by SingularOddities; linkffn(11916243). There's an unfinished sequel, "Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley," as well linkffn(12373273).

*** Oooo thank you! I read through the first few chapters of Escape and it sounds incredibly familiar. I think that is the first story I was looking for!
