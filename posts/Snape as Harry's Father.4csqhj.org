Any fics with Snape as Harry's father? Harry can be young or older when they find out. Thanks.


** "By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept"

Snape is Harry's father, but that doesn't mean that all's forgiven and they are happy together once it comes out.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

** [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=2199][Malfoy Flavor]] by Vorabiza. Warning: Harry/Draco slash. But excellently written. Summary: Harry's ready to banish the Golden Boy image and take charge of his life. Unfortunately, or fortunately, for him there are still more surprises in store for him. Somewhat of a sixth year, Severitus and Slytherin!Harry fic.

** linkffn(1963825) is my favourite in this category. Pretty old, so you might have already read it, but I've re-read it a couple times, and it was pretty great each time. Brings out all the feels.

  Against his better judgement Severus Snape let a part of himself be used in a spell six years earlier. Now the consequences of his actions cannot be avoided any longer and Snape finds himself the father of a five year old boy-Harry Potter! Complete.
