Closing Walls and Ticking Clocks ( linkffn(13619730) ) is a fanfiction that is remarkably similar to Wind Shear. It is a crossover with the video game Destiny, and I would suggest reading it with knowledge of at least some of the lore from the game. I have no doubt that the author based it on Wind Shear, except Harry is infinitely more OP in CWTC. It is a good read and I'm recommending it on this sub because it is rather hard to find.

  "Master of Death" is more than just a title, but not in the way you think. Time travel. But also not in the way you think. We're not in Hogwarts anymore...but we're headed there once again. After the war...and somehow also before it. And it is now that Harry Potter must make his own Fate.
