I've been very into the video game plot lately. I've read a few good ones but the rest I've found are very short and discontinued. Does anyone have any fics they can recommend? Thank you!


** I don't know whether you are aware of this or not, but It's come to my attention that a lot of people aren't aware that there is an entire literary genre around gamers being trapped inside games or alternate realities with game-like elements.

- [[/r/LitRPG]] - Short for Literary Role Playing Game, is a literary genre combining the conventions of RPGs with science-fiction and fantasy novels. 

- [[/r/ProgressionFantasy]] - Progression Fantasy is a fantasy subgenre term for the purpose of describing a category of fiction that focuses on characters increasing in power and skill over time.

If you are familiar with these subreddits, then carry on. If you aren't familiar than I recommend you check them out because minus the HP elements this is exactly what you're looking for.

My favorites are:

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32455483-ascend-online][Ascend Online]] by Luke Chmilenko (LitRPG)

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31211994-catharsis][Awaken Online]] by Travis Bagwell (LitRPG)

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38739408-ritualist][Ritualist]] by Dakota Krout (LitRPG)

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/39892705-temple-of-sorrow][Temple of Sorrow: Stonehaven League]] by Carrie Summers (LitRPG)

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34403860-sufficiently-advanced-magic][Sufficiently Advanced Magic]] by Andrew Rowe (Progression Fantasy)

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30558257-unsouled][Unsouled]] by Will Wight (Progression Fantasy/Cultivation/Xianxia) also check out the subreddit at [[/r/Iteration110Cradle]].

Sufficiently Advanced Magic in particular is about a teenage boy attending magical school, but with strong RPG- like elements including class selection, dungeon crawling and progression (though since it's Progression Fantasy he's not actually in a game).

*** I'll definitely check this out! Thank you! I had seen the Video Game Plot on Fanfiction.net with a whole bunch of VG fic's but unfortunately over half of them are short and/or discontinued.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13563881/1/Harry-Potter-the-Mutant-Obscurus-Gamer][The Mutant Obscurus]] by Gnomebob caught my attention mostly because it was posted entirely this year and had over 100k words. It has pretty minimalistic gamer elements, but uses all of them as storytelling devices. It also has a nice fast pace, compared to most gamer fics that stutter out after playing with stats and numbers and perks and levels for fifty chapters.

I would not recommend it if you have a dislike for crossovers, there's two so far. This story had me amazed by the only doctor who cameo I've honestly enjoyed in fanfiction.

*** I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm not really looking for crossovers at the moment though. I want to stay focused on the wizarding world.
