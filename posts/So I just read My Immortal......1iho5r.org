....and I cannot believe that Tara is real.

I don't read much fanfiction nowadays. I went through a phase in middle school, but I gave up trying to sift through the crap to find the decent stuff, so I've seen what sort of drivel is out there, and Tara is about a thousand times worse than all of it combined. No one can be that completely, perfectly stereotypical. /My Immortal/ embodies every bad fanfiction stereotype, and she embodies every stupid drama-addict teenager stereotype. Combine all that with the fact that [[http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110824175923/myimmortal/images/b/b1/49870_100000216786233_215_n.jpg][this]] is the only picture of her on the internet, and she has to be the best troll I've ever seen.

On the other hand, I don't know how anyone can intentionally write that badly. I know for me, it would take physical effort to write something that completely awful. And based on the reviews of the different copies of the story of fanfiction.net, it seems that most people think she's real.

So, thoughts? Is Tara Gilesbie/Gilespie/Gillesbie truly a "goffik gurl" with an insanely low IQ, or is she one of the best trolls to inhabit the internet?

*** And I don't know what gave you the idea that I have "unhealthy 'I am so smarter than average person.'" The average person seems to be significantly smarter than Tara...

*** I'm inclined to believe she's a troll, too. I was just wondering what other people thought.

**** I think people want her to be a troll because otherwise we'd be admitting that there really is someone who genuinely wrote that thinking it was good...

***** I'm not gonna lie, it would take a pretty dedicated troll to pull this off. But apparently Tara and Raven [[http://www.youtube.com/xxblo0dyxkissxx][actually exist]]. Whether or not they actually had anything to do with /My Immortal/, however, is questionable.

** I really think it was written by a group of trolls. The name Tom Bombadil just crops in so casually... And that mediocre dunces line!

Accidental genius or purposely written crap? Well, I tend to go with the latter.

** As a Goth, (Victorian-Romantic, thank you very much) this ENTIRE fic just pisses me off. Either she is insanely dumb, or insanely brilliant (as a troll). Either way TROLL IN THE DUNGEONS.

**** I read through the first 20-some in a commentary ([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8326807/1/My-Immortal-and-the-Philosopher-s-Commentary][/My Immortal and the Philosopher's Commentary/]]), so it made it a little easier. By the time I got through that, morbid curiosity for what the rest had in store pushed me through to the end. If anything, though, you should read the last line of the last chapter. It's priceless.
