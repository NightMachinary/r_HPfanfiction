** With teenagers you always have to remember that they are hormonal and don't have enough life experience to fall back on when they are in unfamiliar situations. There needs to be trial and error even by the more intelligent characters, because that's how they learn and mature. It's not unusual for a teen to be extreme in some cases since that is, essentially, how they test their limits.

To get into that mindset, embrace your childhood memories. Base interactions on the silly, stupid, or smart things you or your friends might have done, then twist it to fit the personality you are writing. If you are ever confused on how to proceed with a scene, just remember, your character can reflect that confusion. Worrying about what to do, say, wear, etc. is normal for everyone!

** Picture the people around you. Now picture them on vacation. Now picture them as bit characters in a drama series on TV where they're stuck on a remote island. Now picture them making life-changing decisions whilst being either extremely high or very, very drunk.

Congratulations, you are now picturing teenagers.

** Interesting question. Here's some other disjointed thoughts from someone else who's 21. Everything is just relying on what I remember about myself, and is mostly applicable for ages 15-18, because that's what I remember best.

- The main thing that separates a teenager from an adult is a lack of context for their emotions. When you fall in love for the first time as a teenager, its one of the strongest things you've ever felt; heartbreak feels like the world collapsing; when someone you love dies, it's the first time you've ever felt that sort of absence. Everything is brighter and harsher because there's nothing to compare it with. In short, teenagers /feel/ a lot more than adults do.
- Similarly, teens tend to think that their mistakes are the blackest sins known to man. I used to have the habit of not turning work in on time, and I became pretty self-destructive about it. I would promise my teachers (who I loved and respected) that I'd get them work the next day, and when I didn't, the hatred and disappointment I felt in myself was beyond any reasonable response.
- Another characterizing struggle of being a teenager is that's when you first start thinking independently from your parents, and start to codify your ideals and figure out who you want to be. There's a lot of uncertainty and self-reflection that goes into this process.
- Your teen years are when you first start grappling with the idea of mortality, that you and your parents and your friends and everything you love are some day going to vanish. I know I spent an inordinate amount of time thinking about this as a teen.
- It's important to remember that teenagers /are/ articulate (I probably had most of my adult vocabulary by the time I was 15), and /are/ thoughtful (to the point of doing almost nothing else), but that there's often an incredible disconnect between what goes on in their minds and what they actually do. The way I used to think of it was that I could either be thinking or talking, but never both at the same time. I would mull over a problem or relationship for forever, finally come to a conclusion, and when I went to act on it there was no guarantee that what I did would follow through with my plan of action.
- Teenagers are often uncertain as to where they lie in relation to their friends and in relation to society, and can be very insecure and tentative because of this.

Here are a few stories I feel like do a good job of showing how I, at least, acted as a teenager:

- Having a perfect first kiss was really important to me (I hadn't even had like a middle-school fling), so I kept a list in my head of people who I would be OK with being my first kiss, and the most probable reason they would kiss me, and whether or not I thought that was a good reason to have a kiss. All the people were good friends, and the reasons varied from pity to making sure my first kiss was someone who loved me to actually being interested in me.
- Relationships terrified me, as I'd only really see them tear people apart, and so I would only really start becoming friends with girls if they were in a relationship or I otherwise had no shot with them.
- I vividly remember walking outside with my friend Allie and the sun hit her hair and I wanted to tell her she was beautiful, but ended up not doing so because I didn't want her to think it was a romantic gesture (as above). I got really frustrated with people assuming actions were something they were not, or measuring me by the actions of other people. I was in love with pretty much everyone, but really not that into the idea of sex and really really not into the idea of relationships. But because everyone (even other teenagers) assumes teens have sex as a first priority, I had to guard and monitor my actions.
- I had two fantasies, and those were 1) to sleep with someone in the most innocent sense of the word and 2) to really fuck up and have someone forgive me.
- I spent maybe half an hour writing in my best friends yearbook after graduation, because I wanted her to know how much she meant to me and wanted to make sure every word was perfect. I ended up writing maybe two incomprehensible sentences.
- During the latter half of senior year, I decided that maybe relationships weren't such a bad thing after all, and I had a huge crush on one of my friends. I was too afraid to tell her, though, and so I started sleep-depriving myself (like 2-3 hours a night for weeks) so my inhibitions would be low enough that I'd just blurt it out. I'd get to school and have to lay on the floor because everything would seem like it was moving. I never told her I liked her :p
- As with a point waaay above, I spent an unbelievable amount of time considering death and free will and other philosophical things. I remember watching my friend in a school production of Fiddler on the Roof and having an existential crisis halfway through because I realized that if I believed in physics and in causality, I couldn't also believe in free will. Then my friend who was watching with me saw that I looked glum and tickled me until I fell out of my chair.
- I would read a book every day or two, more than any other time in my life. Empathy could be really frustrating sometimes, trying to figure out why people acted the way they did and how they felt and how my actions affected them, and so it was a relief to be able to see the way someone else's mind worked, and to sit behind their eyes for a while.

Other than trying to remember how you acted when you were a teen, I think the best advice I can give is to read some books by *John Green* (Looking for Alaska, Paper Towns, and The Fault in Our Stars are the must-reads. Read LFA before Paper Towns). There's a reason his books are beloved of teenage readers, and that's because he does the best job of any author I've read at capturing how teenagers think and what they're preoccupied with.

If you're looking to write younger teens, my reading list would be the Sammy Keyes series by *Wendelin van Draanen* (or at least some of them as there's 18 in all), the Circle of Magic by *Tamora Pierce*, and, of course, Harry Potter.

I just remembered something one of my teachers used to say, which is that adolescence is when we start to learn that our actions affect other people. I think there's a good amount of truth with that, and a large part of being a teen for me was indeed becoming more empathetic and realizing that I had a lot more power and responsibility than I had thought.

OK. I know I wrote a lot here, but I hope at least a bit of that was helpful to you!

*** Thank you for that incredibly detailed response. That was both insightful and frightening. This bit here:

Actually gave me pause. It makes me wonder if the depressive and self-destructive tendencies I had when I was 18-19 were an indirect consequence of feeling things much less deeply. Going from everything affecting me strongly to feeling normally might have mislead me into thinking "I'm numb and dead inside" just because stepping into emotional normalcy was such a sharp change.

As for using your advice in any of writing, I think I'll probably have to practice, practice, practice. I've always found dialogue the most difficult thing to write because my own speech is vastly different to how I talk in writing.

Thanks again for your response. I don't think I've read anything relating to adolescence that struck me quite as strongly as this did.

** You're right that most authors tend to make them far more mature than their canon counterparts.

I think it would be a mistake, though, to have a 'teenager' archetype and base every character design off of this. If your protagonists/antagonists are truly unique, then they're going to react to the same stimuli in different ways. Hermione in canon is infinitely more cautious than most teenagers her age. Harry seemed to be a rather happy, snarky kid until he contracted a case of the sullens in OOtP.

  How do you get in the right mindset?
#+end_quote

I tend to think of the individual facets to their characters first and their biographical details (such as age) as a secondary quality.

** Does anyone else have the problem where you write a teenager, but the reviewers get frustrated that they don't act like an adult? I guess the same people that get frustrated with harry in OotP. How do you strike the balance between realism and an annoying character? Because, come on, most teens are annoying.

**** I guess, it's just so demoralizing to have negative reviews that essentially say "why didn't this character shrug this terrible thing off like it was nothing?" :(

You have a point that nobody wants to read about teenagers. I worked with teenagers once, and they were the worst part of my job.

** Since this tactic has not been mentioned I would like to add that writing characters for yourself or a target audience of some description might also be an option. There are several examples, notably enembee, that eskew the concept of externally relative believability in favor of internally believable, interesting characters.

There are very few times when reading or watching some media that I think to myself THAT is just too cool. Nothing is that cool. No-one is that cool. Indeed when I say that to myself it is usually a product of enjoyment rather than a criticism.

Obviously there are authors in various genres who fail the internally believable test, but usually it's not because the characters are just too awesome to be twelve. It's usually because a given piece or portion therein sucks a bit and should have been improved.

Part of the reason we like fiction is that one doesn't have trouble finding the bathroom in a public building or the detergent aisle in the grocery store (deep epic voice) In a world where magic is might.

Tldr - Perhaps conceiving and writing an effective story is the greater burden rather than capturing the inexperience, ignorance, and silliness of teens the world over.

** Take every insecurity you've ever had, multiply that by ten, subtract tact, and voila!

I kid but regardless, teens feel very vulnerable and self-conscious because they're going through bodily changes that they don't fully understand. Also, depending on the teens, there is a lack of understanding consequences and the thinking they're immortal type thing.

** Imagining the mindset isn't the hardest part, for me---I usually just think back on how heightened every emotion I felt seemed to be, and how little continuity my moods and beliefs seemed to have from day to day.

What you can do as a writer that a lot of people miss is /keep your distance/---make sure your narrative is older than your characters. Lots of writers find themselves with an overly annoying narrative because their characters are annoying, or overly mature characters because their narrative (and their own perspective) is mature. Both problems---annoying teens and 40-year-old preteens---come from the same inability to separate the mind of the author from the mind of the character.

At her best JKR uses humor and irony to write interesting, young characters without aging her characters up to match. She stays in Harry's consciousness and behind his perspective, but because she separates her sensibilities from Harry's you have distance when he's at his teen-est. It's not a matter of disrespecting or satirizing your character's perspective, just recognizing that you aren't 100% bound by it.

Obviously there are other times where she doesn't do this so well, and you get really annoyed with Harry anyway. I've always thought Jane Austen was the master of this, if you want other examples to try. Don't watch her on the "villains" so much, because then the satire gets heavier than you might want with your protagonist---look at the subtle ways she makes you understand that her lovely, kind, thoughtful heroines are in spite of all that just /younger/ than you and she are, and less experienced.

** Make them cruel but in an innocent way. They're cruel not because they're sadistic but because their empathy is not yet fully developed. So they'll do something cruel because it's in their self-interest, or because it's fun, or because it's what everyone else is doing and seems normal, without considering its true impact.
