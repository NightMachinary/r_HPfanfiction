:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Here are some things I remember happening.

Harry tricks Ginny into thinking Draco is Harry Potter. Harry disguises himself as an old woman, scolds Lucius for his manners, and whacks him with a cane. There's a scene where he's fooling around in class and accidentally changes Hannah's hair color - only it turned out that it was changed to her original hair color. Her hair had been the wrong color for years because of an accident that happened when she was younger.

Anybody recognise this?


** In Oh God Not Again he convinces the twins that he's draco and then starts a rumor that Narcissa had a love affair with Severus that resulted in draco. Not the same but still hilarious if you're interested.

** I don't know how to use the bot.

I think it's Tipsy Time Travel Tale by Yunaine on fanfiction.net

*** Ahhh, /tipsy/... I kept looking for "twisted" and "twisty" and "twirly".

Thanks!

To use the bot for fanfiction.net, you do "linkffn(Name of Fanfic by Author of Fanfic)"

So, for this fic, it would be linkffn(Tipsy Time Travel Tale by Yunaine)

If the fic is on ao3, you just change "linkffn" to "linkao3".

Instructions are also on the sidebar --->
