  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

  Hattie Potter is consummately professional on the job, even if her bastard ex-husband is a co-worker. Nonetheless, circumstances conspire against her and she finds herself put on paid leave against her will. Andromeda thinks this is the perfect time for her grandson's overworked godmother to take a holiday. She sends Hattie off to southern Italy with orders to sunbathe, flirt with cute boys and maybe have a summer fling.

  Rose's godfather comes back to her, but he's not hers. He's Harry's, but she already lost Sirius once and doesn't think she can do it again.Female!Harry/Sirius, post Deathly Hallows AU, with time-travel elements later on.

  The war has ended. By all reasons Harry should be happy but there's an anticipation and constant worry for the next new threat, the place after Voldemort strangely empty.It takes her two former Captains to remind her that there's more to life than fighting monsters.-Or: Harry is their Seeker - that has always been the easy truth of the matter and Angelina and Oliver shows her just what it means inside the empty Gryffindor locker room.

  When Bella Potter meets Death, she takes him up on his offer to be placed in a parallel universe. She wakes up to find herself in Godric's Hollow on October 31st, 1981. Her mission now is to save & protect Harry, and give him the life that she never had. Simple, right? But with a certain doglike man annoying her, universe hopping doesn't seem all that easy anymore. Fem!Harry/Sirius
