examples: disabled ginny who cant play quiditch or reliably bat-bogey people (those are like, her two biggest skills). or hermione with something like memory issues or confusion attacks. or harry who cant "do the saving people thing" in the same way that he does in the books. or, of course, other characters.

i used the request flair, but prompt works too.

*** I was gonna mention this fic. My heart just about shattered when that shit went down.

Also, several characters lose their primary wand arms and have to relearn how to cast spells using their off-hand, which is apparently a 'BIG DEAL' amongst wizards because you're basically seen as permanently impaired (which might technically be accurate but is still par for the course when it comes to wizards being backwards).

** Finding himself linkffn(4594634) is about Cedric surviving the graveyard battle, but seriously injured. It is very well-written.

Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor linkffn(6554218) is about Harry adapting after he's been blinded in a Death Eater attack. It has a sequel.

- (don't remember which story it was) --- Ron was described to have gotten serious lasting effects from the DoM brains.

It also kinda applies to the following stories, but I'm not sure if you'll be interested.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][/Too Young to Die/]] --- applies to this story, but the trio aren't the protagonists.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2109003/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Maw][/Harry Potter and the Maw/]] --- applies to this story, but it's an OC satellite character following the protagonist.
- there is one in which Harry "sustains [repercussions from] a botched ritual that significantly impacts their skill set. They have to come to terms/cope with the changes", but it's the premise of an Indy!OP!Harry smut story.
- +there's one in which the protagonist is gradually turning into a demon, and at one point her eyes get harvested as expensive demonic ingredients. That story's so far into originality zone that it entirely stops being an HP fanfic though.+
