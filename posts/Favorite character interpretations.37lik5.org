[[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/37cdym/help_with_fanon_ideas_for_an_hprpg][As I mentioned before]] I'm running a derpy RPG game set in the HP universe where my players basically take over various characters and then... try not to let Harry die.

I'm looking for fic recommendations with a really good portrayal of one of more characters as inspiration for how to run the various other people in the game. I'm willing to mix and match details too, so feel free to recommend a fic that has an interesting idea about a character with very little screen time.

I'd like to try and avoid having a bunch of caricatures of a complete person running around so I'm forced to have people be... /complicated./ As an example, Petunia and Vernon can't /just/ irrationally hate and abuse Harry, there needs to be a reason for it, such as the blood wards having had some adverse effect on their lives. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6611208/1/Trust-Is-A-Relative-Thing][Trust is a Relative Thing]] they try to move to a larger house so that Vernon can entertain guests and seek a promotion... only to have Dumbledore show up and inform them that they can't move because Harry must stay and be protected by the blood protections on the house. As such, he's already cancelled the movers and unbought their new home via memory charms.


** Trying to think back but fortunately what I am currently reading has an answer.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2655016/24/Comes-Out-of-Darkness-Morn][Rufus Scrimgeour in Sacrifices Arc]]. He is a half-blood raised strict pure-blood, sorted Slytherin but sworn off Dark magic, and is zealous of his paper work and of the ministry doing things by the book (though happy to cause certain parties problems by ensuring they follow every sub article and triplicate form). So while I have read Rufus in other stories he was always forgettable- just a head of department or authority who is fierce or some such but really no character. I quite like this one (so far).

Also Evan Rosier (younger) from the same series. (Look [[http://lightning.ffstories.net/fanfiction.php][here]] for pdf versions so you can skip through with ctrl-f. He is briefly in 3rd book and often in 4th). He sort of takes the spotlight of most dangerous Death Eater (why are they never all formidable or at least somewhat of a challenge?) from the usual Bellatrix, Dolohov, and Lucius. He quotes poetry from great poets who are actually squibs. I enjoy his unstable and dangerous yet well educated/read toying and fighting, and his cryptic letters.

Conversely I hate her Bellatrix and not overly fond of some other characters.

I will see about linking to relevant parts (the word count is far too high), and will edit if I can remember others.

edit-

Reminds me of elder Rosier in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/12/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]]. Can't say I have read many stories with him but I like this one. He is one who has gone through quite a bit of battle and witnessed many things. But remains sane and a devout believer in the Dark Arts. He is a daunting figure (and makes plays and twists those, in this case Harry, in the directions he wishes in a /true/ 'Slytherin' way- which is usually done laughably).

**** Sure, I can't get all the bits but like for Evan Rosier his introduction in 'Come out of Darkness Morn', his albatross letter in 'Freedom and Not Peace', and the goblin fight in the same should give you a solid basis. As mentioned the pdf versions should make searching much easier. For Rufus Scrimgeour the link should take you to his introduction which does a nice job, as does the elder (name Romulus in that fic) Rosier link (not sure it covers all his character angles but should give you an idea).

Of course the two Rosiers in canon are dead or at least believed to be but could always pull a Barty Crouch since you always need bad guys (or questionable), I would think, in an RPG.

***** True, and I'm not above having a younger cousin of Evan Rosier be a 4th year or something and patterning 'Mark' Rosier after his family mold. The Harry Potter series was weirdly devoid of any interactions between the various students outside of their own year... my players presumably wont suffer from this given their love of the twins, Tonks, and etc.

** Snape and Lockhart in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/][Applied Cultural Anthropology]]. (Other characters ain't bad either, but I am assuming that Harry, Hermione, and Neville are PCs. Junior Slytherins are well done.) Portrayal of Snape is coherent and dignified, while still being a jerk and being consistent with canon, while Lockhart is altered to be a competent con artist of the level who could have fooled Dumbledore.

Actually, the same author has a Lockhart-centric fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9269590/1/Note-to-Self][Note to Self]], which is a more canon-consistent characterization of Lockhart.

*** Neville is a PC, but Harry was explicitly off limits to the player.

Hermione was debated, but everyone decided that they'd rather have an NPC with researching skills than have to learn bibliophilia for themselves.

** Here are some good, well thought-out and complicated characters that come to my mind. Note though that some of the stories are rather long, so I am not sure how useful they'll be to you;

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]] --- *N. Flamel* (you can jump to the relevant chapters through Ctrl+F);

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] --- *Tom Riddle*, *Barty Crouch Jr* (though non-canon), *Lily*, *James*, *Peter*;

  /(spoilers)/

  - there are two good and memorable scene in chapter 27. One where James enters the house to hear Harry hiss something in parseltongue. The other when Lily discovers that Peter is a spy.

- brucktoo's mentioned [[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sacrifices_Arc][Sacrifices Arc]] has /many/ good characterizations (e.g. also non-canon *Peter Pettigrew* and *Rufus Scrimgeour*, many of Harry's year-mate Slytherins, etc), but the series is rather long, so I don't know how suitable it will be for you;

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][Firebird Trilogy]] --- *Dumbledore*;

- [[http://ink-splotch.tumblr.com/post/112332424299/have-you-ever-thought-about-writing-a-fic-in-which][this short prompt]] --- insights on *Neville*.

  there was a story, where Lily discovered that Peter was a spy when they were alone in Potters' house. I don't remember the title, but that scene was very memorable for these two characters

Gosh I'd love to read that.

*** Both the notes you mentioned, with Lily discovering Peter as a spy, and James hearing baby-Harry speak parseltongue, occur in "The Well Groomed Mind". I'm not sure if that's the story you're thinking of, or if it's occured elsewhere.

** One of my favourites characterizations is Tom Riddle from HPMoR without the being evil part.

Smart , calculative , a little bit manipulative and playing on multiple levels. HPMoR might take it to strange extremes , but i like genre-savy characters that understand the rules and do their best to exploit them. I mean it's what our brain evolved for , exploit the envoirment for our benefit.

The 3 easy steps to make a nuke with HP magic come to mind :)

I feel like Tom's initial personality design was giving the author problems with finishing the story in such a way that would let Harry win. So latest chapters had Quirellmort almost continuously tranquilized with both [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall][Villain-]] /and/ [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][Idiot Balls]].

Starting from Hermione's assassination attempt, Tom's decisions weren't making much sense from in-universe perspective. From a meta-perspective I'd say that the author was simply trying to hype the story up.

The initial characteristics were good though.

***** He might have been safeguarded against Memory Charms, for all we know. Or there might not be an in-universe way to protect yourself from them passively. Either way, its kind of irrelevant, as he ends up spending the foreseeable future as a rock.

One of the things I love the most about MoR id that the universe itself is deep enough that plotholes like these kind of explain themselves.
