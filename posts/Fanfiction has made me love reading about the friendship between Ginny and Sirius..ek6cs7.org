So a few fanfics I've read recently have really gone into how much Sirius (at least in fanon) enjoyed having Ginny around and how he basically treats her like a daughter/best friend. I don't know why but i enjoy reading these fics, the idea just makes me smile.


** I have to admit the dynamic between Ginny and Sirius is not one I've paid much attention to.

But now, I'm intrigued. Got any good links?

*** Im currently reading this one, its basically about Sirius making a betrothal contract between Harry and Ginny to protect them in case he or Arthur dies. The first chapter so far has really gone into his relationship with Ginny and how he sees her. On a side note it doesn't just do the "lol we should marry them" route alot of betrothal contract stories like to do. Sirius really hammers home how this will protect them from the ministry and voldemort and its pretty believable.

** I love a lot of uncommon or unlikely platonic relationships. There's a good Snape & Luna fic, forgot the name of it. I wish there were more fics with Harry & Fleur (or any of the other champions) being best friends.

*** The Snape-Luna fanfic is probably /I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love./

And by God, it's one of the best.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** I like that dynamic too. It gives Ginny actual dimensions to her character instead of the bullet listing of facts that she is. That, and it expands on Sirius. Really, it adds a foil to Fred and George. Ginny being an apprentice to Padfoot would make her Royalty in their eyes.
