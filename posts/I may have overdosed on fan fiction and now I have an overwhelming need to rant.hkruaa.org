After a long time away from fan fiction quarantine has really opened up the time for me to get stuck back in my favourite medium pre-uni. I've been reading so much fan fiction these past few weeks I almost feel a little bit drunk from it but wow... how I'd missed it. Pre-uni my reading focused primarily on SS/HG and FD/HG (even a bit of BL/HG in that masterpiece that is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]]) so I've always leaned away from the Gryffindors despite my focus on Hermione.

But now, the rabbit hole I've fallen into is !Slytherin rewrites of canon. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/][The Changeling]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847/chapters/18163144][Six Pomegranate Seeds]], the DrizzleWizzle [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2711324/DrizzleWizzle][series]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]], etc etc etc... and I find myself with a similar feeling I used to feel about canon when I was a teenager and I couldn't relate to the heteronormativity in the series the way I could with the endless pairing explorations in fan fiction. A little older now, the lack of representation in canon doesn't really bother me that much, if at all. I've long since forgiven the works for the time, context, and intended audience they are/were/had.

However, submerging myself in the !Slytherin world of rewrites has really brought to the forefront one of my main subconscious disappointments with canon. The portrayal and storyline given to Slytherin just doesn't square with the values and lessons of the series. As a self-confessed Slytherin I've always been aware of the injustices committed against Slytherin in the series which are frequently trotted out in HP discussions. But hey, injustices happen, if the HP world was a just one there would be no story to tell. My real problem is the problem the best !Slytherin fanfics use to their advantage to tell a sharper more morally complex story than canon.

In canon the heroes of HP are never really forced to reevaluate their own prejudices against those they consider inherently evil and deviant. They're never really challenged to problem solve in more creative ways and draw from the strengths of other virtues alien to their house. In short, they never really learn to reach out to the other side to overcome the generational cycles that led to this mess. It's, for the most part, one great glorious Gryffindor gallivant from beginning to end. And I'm sorry, but the quasi "redemption" of Draco and Snape doesn't really cut it in my books. The story kicks off with us being told that Slytherin is where the bad witches and wizards all come from and that message is never meaningfully challenged.

Similarly, the good Slytherin does (e.g. Regulus, Narcissa, Severus) is never understood in its own context, it never gets a chance to speak for itself. Their motivations are always distant, murky, and vague; easy to forget. And curiously, none of that good ever comes from a peer of Harry's. Like, I find it insane that Harry never had a positive interaction with a single Slytherin student his entire time there. They're children! Was there really nooooo way to contrive of a character Harry could have even a small connection to in Slytherin? Say a fellow quidditch enthusiast/player? Maybe someone in all those shared classes? Just aaaaaanyone that could put even a niggle of doubt in Harry's singleminded hatred and distrust for all those who happened to have landed in a house he almost got put in himself? The fact there wasn't a single Slytherin in the D.A. feels like a slap to the message of friendship and love the series tells. There were so many ways to do it.

And I get that our heroes are flawed and that's a good thing, but this seems so fundamental. I'm okay with flawed heroes. I'm okay with the idea of them carrying familial and societal grudges, but I find it unendingly disappointing that none of our main characters are given a real opportunity to either overcome or even grapple with overcoming the toxic culture that created the circumstances for the war they're trying to end. And what really gets on my nerves is that it's not an oversight JK accidentally committed: she herself writes about it via the sorting hat! Like she acknowledges that's a huge problem but then never gives her characters reason to do more than shrug about it and keep doing what they've always done.

A small melodramatic part of me finds this shortcoming in the series appropriate. Like, yes, they defeated Voldemort but did they really win if they never really won against that culture of hatred and grudge? And if it was JK Rowling's intention to have a subversive meta layer of critical commentary on the characters Greek tragedy style, then I can *almost* respect it. It would certainly let me make me make peace with some of the more galling flaws of Cursed Child (of course Harry isn't actually okay with his son being in Slytherin, he never actually became a better person about that). But with such an emphasis on Harry's special power being love... I don't think there was an intentional layer of self criticism, therefore I remain thoroughly disappointed by the portrayal of Slytherin +and will continue to deny the existence of CC.+

Which brings us to all the !Slytherin fan fiction I've been drinking like a tall glass of cold water on a hot day. The potential unlocked in character growth by switching one important character to Slytherin without interfering with a single major plot point is astounding. Chuck Ginny with the snakes and suddenly the Weasley's can't take for granted their moral high ground. Chuck Hermione with the snakes and she gets an opportunity to really push herself outside of the safety of being Harry and Ron's minders. Chuck Harry in and from the get go his understanding of morality cannot afford to be black and white. But most of all: it gives characters the opportunity to become more complex individuals with competing world views they must learn to trust and *value*. And that's really my gripe: for all of the heroics and motifs of love, did Harry really learn to love his enemy? If he did, then he only did so for 5 minutes at the end. I think Hogwarts deserved a bit better.

TLDR: After all this time I'm still a bitter Slytherin.

P.S. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY PEOPLE KEEP USING THE WORD 'BERK' IN STORIES?!?!? Or, at least to my fellow compatriots, have any of you ever heard someone ever say the word 'berk' anywhere in the UK?? In all my life I have never heard anyone of any age or region ever say it and it sounds so glaringly wrong when I read it. Did JK use it in the books or is it something people think British people say? Edit: it has been explained to me that berk is old cockney slang from the London/Essex area and it was used by Sirius to describe himself and James in canon. Very satisfied with this info!!

I mean, they kind of do. The central conflict is the systemic oppression of muggleborns enforced by the pureblood establishment. The reason there's a culture of hatred is because the last Dark Lord explicitly declared war on non-magical blood, that generation of Slytherin went along with it, and then when their kids came up to age they gladly went along for the ride. How are you supposed to negotiate with an ideology that doesn't even believe you deserve to exist?

Also, there is an example of a "good" Slytherin in the books, Slughorn. And I think Rowling was very careful in crafting his character as a "positive" interpretation of Slytherin values. If your values are cunning and ambition, and you intend to succeed, at some point you'll encounter the "old boy's club," so to speak, or elite social networks you're just not a part of. When you read canon as being written by a struggling single mother, the harsh portrayals of the "house of cunning and ambition" make a lot of sense.

** I have a soft spot for Slytherin!Resorting fics, particularly if it's Hermione or Ron, but I think that the canon portrayal of Slytherin is completely justified. In fact, the single biggest factor in runing otherwise decent Slytherin!Protagonist fics is Bizzaro-world-level whitewashing of Slytherin.

TL;DR: Creating a House around Salazar Slytherin's values was a mistake, and the Slytherin that we see in canon is a natural consequence of building a culture around these values. On the other hand, that makes for a more interesting story when someone who doesn't naturally fit in is Sorted there.

--------------

Fundamentally, being /cunning/ is about practising manipulation and deceit to achieve one's aims. Personally /ambitious/ people similarly embrace egoism and placing themselves above others as a goal. Nice, helpful children don't get sorted into Slytherin in the first place, and then the House amplifies their worst traits. (Children who are helpful but not nice---who want to fix the world whether the world wants it or not---go to Gryffindor, as Dumbledore and Hermione did.)

A particularly amoral individual (i.e., Salazar Slytherin) might value cunning and ambition in themselves, and they may value these things in their children or successors, but try to build a culture around these traits---such as by putting all people who embrace them in the same dormitory---and you end up with a culture of brutes, toadies, plutocrats, and con artists. And, even without Salazar's original disdain for the Muggleborn, a blood purity culture would probably emerge on its own: to take a line from President Lyndon B. Johnson, "If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket." The plutocrats and the con artists wouldn't be able to resist using blood prejudice to keep the brutes and the toadies in line.

It's not clear why Harry is obligated to love people like that, or to trust them with his and his friends' lives and freedom by letting them join the DA. There were plenty of situations in his life that were not black-and-white. This isn't one of them.

All the "good" Slytherins you list aren't very good:

- Regulus was a trusted Death Eater---and one doesn't get there without committing his fair share of torture and murder. He was OK with all that, and it's only with what is considered the Darkest of Dark Arts did Voldemort cross the line.
- Narcissa was a high-level collaborator who used what influence she had to further Voldemort's cause---such as getting Snape to make that Unbreakable Vow in HBP---and who only changed her mind to save her own son. Other people's sons and daughters could go pound sand. (All things considered, the Order could have gotten her cooperation far sooner by taking Draco hostage.)
- Snape's fall to darkness is largely thanks to this Slytherin culture: a penniless half-Muggle sorted there during Voldemort's first rise, he had little choice but to practice Dark Arts and be friendly with unsavoury individuals. He switched sides for revenge first and foremost.

We do see Slytherins who are not too bad:

- Andromeda is probably the only Slytherin we see who actually threw off the blood prejudice that was prevalent in the House.
- Slughorn is a coward and a wheeler-and-dealer who uses his position as a Professor for personal gain, but he does fight Voldemort at the end.

Now, being sorted into a House like that for someone who isn't a natural fit---a Weasley, or a Muggleborn---that makes for an interesting story.

And before anyone mentions witch hunts, they were banned by papal decrees, bishops and secular authorities for most of the middle ages. Witch Hunts peaked 500/600 years after Hogwarts was founded. Slytherin was just a bigot.

No, if you are a pureblood supremacist/have taken that belief from your parents, you end up in Slytherin since he was the only one pursuing that agenda while the other founders stood against it. It might be different if you radicalise later in life, but there is no canonical evidence of anyone actually doing that. Although maybe some of the werewolves would fit this, but there is no evidence.

You can still be a dick in other houses, the Smith in Hufflepuff is a good example for this, but not "purge the muggleborn".

** Regarding your last point - my dad uses the word berk all the time. It's very common in old east london and essex way, and comes from the cockney rhyming slang (and mispronounciation) of Berkshire Hunt, as far as I'm aware.

How can genocide and war crimes be considered anything else?

The only good Slytherin was Andromeda, and she was the odd misfit. She is the only Slytherin who voluntarily was on the good side. You can make a case for Slughorn, but he did not mention the Horcruxes, and thereby directly helped Voldemort.

Snape voluntarily joined the magical Nazis and happily sold a family out for murder before becoming a thoroughly abusive teacher. And no, it was in no way necessary as a ruse or whatever else his apologists may claim, if anything, not acting all "good" is an insult to Dumbledore's intelligence or Voldemort's, depending on who is buying it.

Regulus had no issues with the genocide either, he only minded the treatment of his elf (who, by modern standards, was a slave).

And while you can't pin more than housing Voldemort on Narcissa (she could have sold him out after getting her family out), she isn't good either, her one good moment is out of interest for her son, not because opposing Voldemort is the right thing.

You don't love a genocidal movement, you purge it with extreme violence until it is in ruins. The reason Naziism died out in Germany were three years of constant bombardment and some 10 million Russians steamrolling Eastern Europe in 44/45. If you don't finish it decisively, you are setting yourself up for a repeat two decades down the road.

And HP canon was completely unsatisfactory in that regard. Malfoy not in prison for life, Snape considered a hero, no reckoning for Umbridge or the like... Sure, all was well...

I would love a good Slytherin fic, one which depicts it as the racist cesspool it is, the breeding ground for Voldemort and his movement (the only confirmed non-Slytherin Death Eater joined because he was a coward, not out of conviction).

Maybe.

I don't think there would be an actual murder attempt until Voldemort's return (or maybe not even until his public return), for the simple reason that an actual dead student could not be swept under the rug, and Slytherin culture doesn't engender that much trust among the Slytherins themselves, making it too risky. (Once Voldemort returns, Dumbledore no longer has the monopoly on uberwizard violence, and so a student may choose to do the deed and flee Hogwarts to join Voldemort.)

What is more likely is a concerted bullying campaign aimed at making Hermione drop out, involving students of all years. This is something that didn't happen in /Applied Cultural Anthropology/, where Hermione's troubles stemmed entirely form her own year, but I can see it happening. This will test Hermione's dedication to her "killed---or, worse, expelled" mindset. Snape might intervene to some extent, but he can't really stop the verbal abuse and the ostracism; and he probably can't stop all physical attacks, either.

Now, if Hermione manages to hang on and not have her studies too impeded by the bullying, it's not implausible that by the time Voldemort returns, if he returns on canon schedule, she might in fact be able to defend herself from feasible assassination attempts. Heuristically, if she can progress in magic twice as rapidly as the Hogwarts curriculum, then she could be skilled enough to earn Os on the (hypothetical) OWLs in 3 years and NEWTs in 4, and if she can find some way to practice magical combat, she may well be too dangerous a target by the time Voldemort returns.

I think that she has enough talent and discipline to do that, given her canon track record of learning magic quickly and just from books [1], especially if she can get the subject matter teachers to lend her a few minutes once in a while when she is stuck. Actually translating that to fighting skills would probably be more challenging, depending on how often she has to physically defend herself. (Dating Viktor Krum, if that happens, may well help there.)

--------------

[1] People who say that Hermione isn't that talented but just reads a lot refute themselves. There is a reason schools don't just give each student a stack of books at the start of the term and tell them to come back at the end of the term to sit the exam. For most complex subjects, picking one up just from reading about it indicates a rare talent.

***** If it were that easy, it'd happen a bit more often. In the 1970s, there was a literal civil war going on outside Hogwarts; yet inside Hogwarts, schoolyard rivalries stayed schoolyard rivalries rather than escalate into lethal gang warfare.

Magic provides more ways to commit and conceal a crime, but it also provides more ways to investigate one, and in the end, it's a wash: the difficulty of getting away with a murder in Hogwarts is comparable to getting away with it in a Muggle boarding school.

Riddle was a genius who had tools at his disposal that nobody could even imagine at the time, a well as a convenient patsy. He had also been able to charm Dippett, but there is a good chance that Headmaster Dumbledore would have dug deeper and caught him anyway. Ultimately, anyone smart enough to have a good chance of getting away with it would also be smart enough to understand the risks and not bother, unless they expected something huge, like personal kudos from Voldemort---but by the time that's a factor, Hermione might be able to defend herself or have contingencies in place.

I mean, she will have spent enough time in misery and paranoia that her mind would instinctively reject any feeling of contentment, rendering her immune to the Imperius. (I am only half joking.)

** If you would like to read a fic that showcases the rot in Slytherin, but affirms that Slytherin does not have to mean evil; that works within the politics of the House while also gradually reforming its more toxic habits; that demands bravery from its heroes, but ultimately requires them to win through the power of information and careful planning; that acknowledges and embraces coexistence and even collaboration without conforming to the same values - I quite like linkffn(The Peace Not Promised). Severus Snape, after his canon death, is offered a chance to return to the term after his breakup with Lily and do things differently. He accepts in hopes that he can keep her alive this time; to him, that would make anything else worthwhile.

The part that might particularly interest you is that, in addition to his devotion to Lily, he still feels a duty to the students, having been a teacher and Headmaster. So he sets out, starting as a student, to gain influence and respect so he can make Slytherin House safer for the loners and outcasts and those too young to protect themselves.

**** I really like how Severus approaches the political situation in this fic.

He starts by refusing to submit to bullying from someone currently at the top of the pecking order, then using his superior duelling skills (after all, he has a lifetime of memories) to very quickly and easily trounce him in front of witnesses - but then allows his foe to retain some status as his subordinate. When others are uncomfortable with the upset and challenge him, he similarly shows them up.

Then, having established himself, he pivots that influence and demands House unity and mutual protection - thus winning the hearts of most of the younger years, who would otherwise fear for their own safety.

Once that begins to succeed, with several students finding themselves rescued from sticky situations where they would previously have been on their own, he further leverages the goodwill he's gained and publicly declares his intention not to be a Death Eater. He doesn't declare war on them; he merely splits from them. The result is to break up the near-monopoly of influence that the prospective Death Eaters enjoyed; some students stand with Severus, some oppose him, but many remain neutral /and can get away with it/. His close associates include both muggle-borns and blood purists, and he allows them to be; he only insists that while they are at school, everyone is safe and is allowed to focus on being a student.

It's simple, yet so very effective. And when he disavows the Death Eaters, Lily welcomes her friend back with open arms.

**** I think that we need to unpack this complaint a little. There are actually two claims here (embodying two common complaints in the treatment of Slytherin):

1. Slytherins are mistreated (ostracised, bullied, vilified) by other characters (including Harry) in canon, and those characters should have treated the Slytherins better.

2. Slytherins are portrayed as nearly universally evil (or at least not-very-good) by JKR, and she should have been more nuanced in her portrayal.

On Item 1, the worst treatment Slytherins get in canon as Slytherins is losing the House Cup twice---after winning it 7 years in a row due to Snape's cheating. Also, the Weasley Twins might have booed someone during the sorting that one time. Other than that, they don't get ostracised or bullied that we observe, and they are pretty much judged by the content of their individual character and expressed values.

On Item 2, to summarise my top-level post, when you take children who think that being selfish and deceitful are not bad things, put them together with others who had thought the same things, and have them stew for seven years under a mentor who also went through that system, what else would you expect? The number of decent people to emerge from that kind of system would, in fact, be negligible. And, maybe a particularly powerful and charismatic leader (whether as a student, as head of house, or as the headmaster) might be able to reform the culture a bit, would the reforms survive past the reformer's tenure?

In the end, linkffn(Anything but Slytherin by IP82) may have been a bit extreme, but the Slytherin house was a bad idea to create in the first place: it is a badly designed institution that produces bad outcomes. And yet, it's not an unrealistic mistake to make for some wizards living in XI Century: we, as a society, enjoy stories about tricksters, con artists, and ambitious people, and always have. It is easy to forget that traits that make for an interesting fictional character can make for a terrible human being (e.g., Umbridge) and that while one trickster can be fun to read about, a functioning society requires a great deal of trust.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

** Omg this this this!!! I read the Changeling and it like completely changed my view, like it completed the hp series better than what jkr did. And I feel like you hit the nail on the head when you said that the main characters are not forced to confront their own views. Like it's generally accepted that they are right. And that's why having Ginny in slytherin felt so right when I was reading the fic because it brought a heavy counterpoint to the gryffindor goodness.

And also I feel you on the issue where there's no attempt made to combat the prejudices and mindsets that was so detrimental to the wizarding world. The only attempt was just Harry naming his son after Snape and that's it... yeah Harry defeated Voldemort but was there any action taken to make sure no new Voldemorts are created? To make sure no student gets bullied or made fun of no matter what the reason? The really stupid gryffindor vs slytherin rivalry? I really wanted to see that change in the wizarding world honestly but I guess jkr got tired of writing I guess lmaoo it's understandable

*** The Changeling was definitely the final nail in the coffin for me in not feeling like canon was morally complex enough. That ending of the four houses coming together, valuing each others skills, depending on each other - gives me chills just thinking about it! This was the founders dream which they had not managed to fulfil, and at last the students outgrew their teachers. THAT's what I want from canon, not just discarding the Slytherins as the bad house. Like, okay, cool, if you really want to have such a simple world view where all the good people and bad people can be known from their name and their school house, then sure.... but so many fanfics show how you can do so much more in showing that people are not predestined to be horrible, that they can make different choices especially if people believe in them enough to give them that opportunity.

I'm not out to defend all the comically evil characters jkr stuffed in Slytherin, I'm here to congratulate all the fanfics that dare to go beyond the assumptions of canon and provide "the bad house" with a humanity it was never granted. When people do that the original story becomes richer, more human, wiser. The heroes actually have to grow, their world view actually has to expand. Instead... Harry and all his good guy Gryffindor friends (and acceptable company) were just always right all along about absolutely everything, and the baddies were just that - baddies with no personality beyond being bad.

This is of course not to crap on JKR amazing villains, nor to suggest all those villains deserved/needed a redemption ark. Not at all! But Changeling is such a fantastic example of how much canon could have gained from daring to give Slytherin a chance.

  They're children! Was there really nooooo way to contrive of a character Harry could have even a small connection to in Slytherin?
#+end_quote

The answer to that would've been Mafalda Prewett. But JK Rowling cut her due to the fact that there wasn't much that a first-year could do for the plot that Rita Skeeter couldn't.

Basically, Mafalda was supposed to be a distant maternal-cousin of Ron's. Her father was the Squib-accountant Ron mentioned in book one, and Mafalda would've started school and joined Slytherin in Harry's fourth year.

She was described as being an almost insufferable brat who was a match for Hermione in some things. And the fact that this little troublemaker knew all the rules, etc. tended to unsettle Hermione a bit.

Mafalda's purpose would've been to spy on her fellow Slytherins, especially the ones connected to the Dark families, and pass on information to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Mafalda was set to be like that little brat who, despite being arrogant and rude, you can't really hate --- because she's on your side.

But in the end, Rowling opted to make Rita Skeeter the designated source of snooping.

** There's only so much "moral dilemmas" you can toss into a book and still make it a focused narrative. Slytherins are what they are because slytherins for the most part are stereotypical antagonists. JK could dilute this, but that would have likely detracted from the story by unnecessary convolution of relationships.

If you are looking for "complex and ambiguous" - see house elves, treatment of muggleborns, child neglect etc... HP has all of that. there's no need to toss every moral dilemma out there into narrative. slytherin is what it is and I think it servers the narrator's purpose well.

Just as well as slytherin fics serve to tell a different story, but then again, their /purpose/ is explicitly to tell a Slytherin story. HP canon is not that

*** Yeah, I definitely agree with you to a great extent. I know that ultimately a lot of my complaints about canon can't be remedied at all if that's the story you want to tell. Which is why I love FanFiction so much, I love it because you're able to tell stories from perspectives and variables you just can't in canon and that can make for richer stories. Similarly FanFiction can't exist without the background of canon and playing on the foundations it sets. It's very interesting from an aesthetics perspective... but that aside, the ultimate conclusion of my original post which I totally accept got lost in my rant, was that I love FanFiction because it can explore avenues that weren't and/or couldn't be explored in canon.
