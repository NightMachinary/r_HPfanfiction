Assuming I did the math right.

I purchased the Time Special Edition Harry Potter today, and it says that the first known Harry Potter fan-fiction story "Harry Potter and the man of unknown" was posted Sept 4th 1999 on fanfiction.net.

I haven't read it and I am not sure if I can find it.

I am interested in reading some of these old fics. Does anyone have some early era fics to post?

The earlier the better!

I wonder how many of them I have already read and didn't realize were so old.


** I think you'll find the first fanfiction was actually published on 1 Jan 1970. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Power of Time by RossWrock)

***** You should read /Angry Harry and the Seven/ by Sinyk. Pretty much every story he's written is hands down the most cliched writing I've ever read on this fandom.

Amazingly enough, the plot is actually have decent if you remember that the author is buried in cliches from head to toe.

Let's do a checklist with Angry Harry.

Harry hates Dumbledore? Check!

Harry gets pissed off at Dumbledore and gets away with it? Check!

Harry brings the full might of his fame on Dumbledore? Check!

Harry is betrothed to Daphne Greengrass, who initially hates him? Check!

Harry and Daphne eventually make up? Check!

Harry and Daphne fuck by third year? Check!

Harry and his minions fuck over anyone who has wronged Harry? Check!

Harry is a Gary Sue? Check!

Harry kicks Voldemort's ass in the Graveyard? Check!

Voldemort is a retarded idiot? Check!

Are the antagonists incompetent! Check!

Does Harry roflstomp every antagonist? Check!

Does Harry make Grindelwald's happily ever after look tame? Check!

Does Harry become a leader in the wizarding world for decades to come? Check!

Yeah. That's what all of Sinyk's stories are like.

I assume Harry Potter and the Power of Time roughly equates this checklist?

**** I read it fairly early on in my fanfic days and it was passable. It features Harry training himself in a magical trunk (that I think he buys from Diagon Alley) that allows him to train at something like an hour's training for every two minutes in the trunk. He trains the DA as well I think. Then he has a few battles and the fic gets abandoned.

  Now AU, 6th Year, following OoTP. Tired of the way Dumbledore and the Order treat him, and ready to face his destiny, Harry dedicates long hours to muggle and magical training to take the fight to Voldemort for a change. Slight HPGW, not shippy though.

** Interesting. The earliest I've read is 2002 or 2003, I think. Will edit post if I find any good ones.

EDIT

So I spent some time looking around. Found an author who's been writing since 2001. Skimmed over his earlier stories, which I have linked, and they seem decent. Since I've already linked them all, I might as well attempt to read them in full. Hopefully they've aged decently enough to where I won't be closing the tab faster than I can say the light charm.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/789839/1/The-Lost-Generation]]

To those who have read these stories in full - are they any good? How have they aged?

The author stopped writing in 2003, but picked up the series that makes up the above stories again in 2015, and is actively updating.

*** I tried reading the psychic serpent and it isn't very good. I am new to the fandom, therefore have no nostalgia for the old stories and my opinion on the old fics is based solely on the writing. The plot was fine but the writing is poor to middling. It seemed as if an inexperienced juvenile was writing. I didn't read the entire fic, only the first third so I don't know if the writing improved.

** I'd recommend linkffn(Harry Potter and the Existence after Life by cygnus crux) and three sequels for original, expansive worldbuilding in the very early days of fanfiction (the series began being posted on FFN in early 2002).

Most of the original cast of authors from fanficauthors.net (Jeconais, Full Pensieve, Ruskbyte, Crys, Copperbadge, Kokopelli, Abraxan, Draco664, etc.) had their heyday in the 2002-2005 time frame. Much of that work holds up reasonably by today's standards.
