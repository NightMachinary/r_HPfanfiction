So this is a long shot, and apologies if this isn't where this post should go. But does anyone by any chance remember a group of fanfic writers called BAAM? They wrote on the old Warner Bros website back when fanfics were posted as forum threads. I think the B was Becky and A was Amber? They were interested in fanfics about Snape.
