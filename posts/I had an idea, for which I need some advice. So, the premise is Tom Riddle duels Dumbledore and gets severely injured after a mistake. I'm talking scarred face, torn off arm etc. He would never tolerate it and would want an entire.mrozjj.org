#+TITLE: I had an idea, for which I need some advice. So, the premise is Tom Riddle duels Dumbledore and gets severely injured after a mistake. I'm talking scarred face, torn off arm etc. He would never tolerate it and would want an entirely new body. My question is how could he make an entirely new body?

** He's Voldemort, he has an established method for making a new body, using only three simple ingredients.

*** I was thinking rather that he would want to regain his good looks, rather than settle for the snake-like appearance. The limit on words did not allow me to specify, but I was thinking about the scenario happening during the First War where he still needed his charisma.

Plus, here he was not violently ejected from his body and he did not become a wraith. Rather, he is perfectly fine aside from the missing arm and a bunch of scars that nothing can heal short of a new body.

** He's a Dark Lord and he's already experimented with Inferious to guard his Horcrux, right? You could write something exploring Dark Arts/necromancy and creating a new body or altering the body of a dead wizard to become his new vessel. It would be disturbing, but then if it wasn't a skin-crawling, taboo kind of magic we'd probably have seen the Gilderoy Lockharts of the magical world make themselves new bodies whenever they started to show signs of aging.

(I bet the more sycophantic Death Eaters would /volunteer/ to be their Lord's new host body, for extra creep factor)

** It's a difficult question since I think the motives behind it are not quite clear. Why would he want a new body? It isn't for functionality since he could conjure himself silvery appendages. I mean the books make it clear he isn't vain and a glamour could take care off his appearance making him look lile whomever he wanted for public's sake. (At least in established fanfic lore) Perhaps if he saw his injuries as a weakness, a sign of his defeat he might want to erase every trace of it.

I guess you could simply reuse the ritual he used in 4th year, arguing that since - unlike his temporary body kept alive by Naginis venom - his scarred body would keep him his good looks.

Of course there is also the way diary Tom Riddle absorbed Ginny's soul and life force and thus managed to manifest himself physically. Perhaps have him look for someone who willingly gifts him their soul or have him drain away someone's life power.

You could also make him alter the horcrux ritual, trying to rip out his whole remaining soul - perhaos it would include suicide - or suicide by proxy and make him possess someone. Perhaps the body of hiw muggle father whom he dug out of his grave and reinstated through necromancy/dark magic.

Skin transplantation - him cutting out the skin touched by magic with a knife and then replacing it by the samd part of some unfortunate victim, merging it with his own skin through magic, a la Frankenstein

Ohh another creepy idea would be if he did the same thing like Nagini in Deadly Hallows. He would seal himself into the body of a dead person whose looks he appreciates/or has transfigured to his liking. Unfortunately for him to be able to fight or something he has to rip himself out of it and fight in his own body. That would paint a truly gory picture

** I'm a bit late to the discussion but I have seen fics where dark magic rituals can be used to sort of pass on your injuries to someone else. Like Tom kidnaps someone forces them into the ritual that causes them to take the scars in order to heal his own. It's not a new body but it could be used to solve his problems.

** Choose the person/body Voldemort wants to have. Then Voldemort orders dementor to suck out their soul and proceeds to transfer his soul into the Soulless but still alive body.
