Like Kingsley and the Prime minister but on a more permanent basis. I don't know if a prime minster has permanent wizarding protection, I like to think Fudge only told the PM about Kingsley due to the situation they were in. Anything like this? Considering how nonchalant wizarding officials are about memory wiping muggles I can imagine how easy it would be for the average dark wizard to get into a billionaires house and make him hand over everything.


** Anyone watch the British show 'Bodyguard'? Imagine something like that -- a PPO, assigned to a high-profile politician -- except it's not just a PPO, it's an Auror, and then there's this whole growing dramatic subplot of the muggle picking up on subtle things, inconsistencies in behavior, oddities and the like, which eventually culminates in a discovery of the wonders of the magical world.

Gahhhhhh, if I could upvote this thread 2, no, 5 times, I would.

I can think of several possible catalysts for this plot. A magical terrorist/aspiring dark lord, looking to gain access to either nuclear or biological weapons, for example. The biological angle is particularly plausible, I think. There's probably quite a number of governments working on weaponizing biological agents, as well as potential delivery methods. There's no reason why a sorcerer couldn't amplify that to create a potent magical plague, affecting muggles and wizards alike. Then, in this story, the aurors would receive a tip, regarding a potential attack on a facility developing that, and some would be assigned to guard the scientists working on it and/or the politicians/secret services that arranged the whole thing.

Man, I'd try to write this if I had time.

** To be honest, I don't think the wizarding world really cares that much about muggles in general. The only reason the PM has anything to do with them is because of the extreme situation they were in at that moment. Were it not for that, however, they'd casually ignore what goes on in the muggle world.

** You might try 'Name Confused' Its not exactly what you're looking for, but it does feature Harry Potter as the bodyguard for Mycroft Holmes as the premise for the story, so sort of I guess.

Anyway, if anything like what you wanted does come out, imma definitely read it. (so awesome)

On the whole biological agent thing though it is far more likely that the wizards in question would just obliviate the bejeezus out of every muggle involved and destroy the research. Wizards tend to be enormously close minded and self centered like that. I was thinking more along the lines of disillusioned muggleborn ends up as a bodyguard and is trying not to break the statute but their client is an idiot and in so much danger...
