What are some of the best, most hilarious pranks you've seen in a fanfic. It could be by the marauders, the weasley twins, tonks or even Harry himself.


** The ones in The Pureblood Pretense and sequels. Because they are actually funny and not mean spirited. There is a fine line between "pranking" and "bullying". But in third year on St. Valentine's day Fred and George send wholesome messages to literally everyone and sign them with Harry's name saying that Harry will pass any message they give him on. So for the rest of the day people seek Harry out to give messages and cards.

Right as the teachers show up, Harry and Neville show up potioned/glamoured to look like Snape and "heroically" save everybody by killing it with a Snape patented death sneer.
