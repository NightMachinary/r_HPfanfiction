In my time here I have read a fair number of fics in which the Dementors are either quartered away, slaughtered, or ignored. Very few have given the soul sucking beasts a means to communicate with the characters and even less have shown an origin story or, really, any sort of development with them.

In particular, I am interested in a fic which involves the Dementors of Azkaban and how they came to be. (Not a super-powered Patronus death spree fic.) Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated!


** The third book in the nonjon's series linkffn(Where in the World is Harry Potter) which is called something like linkffn(You Did What?) features a good dementor origin story but I would recommend all the books in the series as they all have dementor interaction IIRC.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** There was an old HG/SS fic that showed where dementors came from. I think it was on ashwinder so it might have been lost. But snape was kissed and was given to hermione as a pet or something, and her harry and ron went to try and figure out how to restore him. It was really gross and really creative for the time. I didn't know at that time that there were non romance fanfics lol so I mostly read the lesser romantic ones on that site.

*** Considering how different people - err - magical beings that Hermione has fallen in love with - well, I don't really blame you.

**** Found it. It's very good...and quite different from the usual fanfic.

**** Actually, I second VorpalPlayer's recommendation here, vividly. Weird pairings like that are rarely a good sign, but in this case, this is legitimately one of my favorite short fanfictions.

***** My favorite is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9202556/chapters/20877623][this one]] . It's a Herus AU in which magical creatures can be ones Animagus. Completely unrelated, but I generally feel the need to link it when I get the chance.

** I wrote linkffn(The Innocent Dementor) though it's on hiatus now and I have no idea when I can start updating it again --- my muse fled me on this one unfortunately. I also intend to use Dementors in my next story, /The Parselmouth of Gryffindor/, as-yet unpublished.

  The Dementors of Azkaban are soul-sucking monsters, but only becaused their own parents raised them that way. A young Dementor grows up alone in an abandoned wizarding castle, and when he faces the outside world's Dementors and the wizards' opinion of them, it comes as quite a shock. In progress.
