I mostly read ff. Net and Ao3. Romione has always been my otp and I prefer a more realistic portrayal, with thier flaws and that. No bashing of any sort please, and preferably not any angst or stupid "He kissed me but he defo isn't interested" type bs. Lemme know, Thanks ðŸ˜Š


** Check out the app FanFiction.Net, there's loads on hermione and Ron where she's the MOM and he's an auror and some where it's during their school year, good reads
