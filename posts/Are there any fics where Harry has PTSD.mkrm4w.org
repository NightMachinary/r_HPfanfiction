As in either time travel fics or post war or such where it is clear that the war or events that have happened to him have affected him badly? I'd appreciate it if they were well written and the longer the better!

Thanks very much


** My fic explores this concept (sorry for the shameless self-promo). It is a Fifth Year fic (sorry if that's not exactly what you're looking for...I wasn't sure if you only wanted post-war fics). It's never explicitly stated, but Harry has a lot of symptoms of PTSD, both because of Voldemort's return and his generally terrible childhood.

  Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts ended in tragedy. Now, as he faces a world darkened by Voldemort's return, he must cling to those he loves more than ever. Struggling with his guilt, Harry resolves to work harder so that he can protect others from Cedric's fate. Follow a slightly sadder Harry through a different fifth year at Hogwarts as he deals with an evil pink-clad professor, a mysterious connection to Voldemort, and the very real trauma of his past.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

**** Basically, what is necessary to know (even without spoilers) is that Ginny is almost raped which doesn't improve her mental situation. However, the story is rather brief, so you won't loose much if you read it as well.

Otherwise, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28632333/chapters/70181604]]) is very good! Tagged as Drarry but it's 100% gen so far, also has the benefit of being amazingly well-written and really funny to boot

  Rose Potter spent twenty-one years as the Chosen One. Reborn as Harry Potter's twin, he alone has the scar after that Samhain night. Harry knows there's something odd about his sister - she's too old, too mature, and knows far too many things she shouldn't - but he loves her anyway. He's been there for her ever since they were born, so Rose'll be damned if she lets history repeat itself.(In her past life, Hogwarts didn't unite until the very end and everyone suffered for it) (Lily Potter was willing to do anything and sacrifice everything for the safety of her family. Rose intended to do nothing less)In which not all Slytherins are evil, not all Gryffindors are good, and the Wizarding World is more than just an extension of the Muggle one.Years 1, 2 complete

#+begin_quote
  A month after the Battle of Hogwarts, war-scarred, pre-Auror recruit Harry has a new target: Antonin Dolohov, the man who killed Remus Lupin. When a tip from Malfoy leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione into an ambush, however, Harry's Master of Death power awakens and sends him--- and Malfoy--- to the time of Dolohov's first murder in 1978. As Harry and Draco struggle to find their way home while (re)doing their seventh year at Hogwarts, Voldemort is at the height of his power in the First Wizarding War. And, despite not being born yet, he's still targeting Harry. Harry and Draco fight for their lives and their future, burdened with the knowledge of what will happen to everyone around them. The Marauders, on the other hand, are more concerned with pranks, love, and N.E.W.T.s than the war outside the castle.

** Well, it's an important element of Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past (hence the name). Unfortunately incomplete and FFN took it down, but really well written IMO, with a careful balance of Harry having foreknowledge vs the butterfly of doom keeping things unpredictable, and focused on the characters so it's not a power fantasy. You can get a PDF or eBook from [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][Github]].

** There are mentions of it in "The Purpose of Wings." Post-War, Harry and Fleur are parents but Harry struggles with PTSD pretty believably. Like flashes of green flames from a cauldron causing him to lash out and have a panic attack. It isn't a major theme but woven into the romance, as in, Fleur - his wife - helping calm him.

I'd second the Inner Demon rec too.
