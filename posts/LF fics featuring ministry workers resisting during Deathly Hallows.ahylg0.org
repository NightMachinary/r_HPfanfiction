I'd love to see examples of random people in the ministry outraged by the Death Eater takeover and doing what they can to undermine the regime, help muggleborns etc. This could be either the main plot or a secondary plot for something else.

Some ordinary heroes, basically.


** I would have recommended "The Scarlet Pimpernel" (The Percy Weasley-centric fic), but it seems to have been deleted from FFNet.
