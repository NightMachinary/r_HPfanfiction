** Severus/Lily plus falling below 2k words/chapter are both instant skips for me.

**** I have a serious question that's not relevant to the fic... why in the world do you use the grave accent ` instead of an appostrophe ' ? It messes with the reddit formatting.

I guess it's short enough i'll try it.

*** Hello, first of all, I would just like to thank you for checking out my fanfiction. I would also like to say: MY STORY IS HEAVILY AU. Now to answer some of your questions:

"Harry still killed Voldy". No he did not? I thought I made that clear in the second chapter, with the flashback with Dumbledore and Severus, it was discovered that Voldemort ran from Harry, he didn`t even attempt to kill him. Meaning Harry has no scar.

"Marriage between Snape and Evans" After the death of James Potter (so no, nothing interesting happened with him, hes dead bro) Lily remarried Severus because she still had some feelings for him, which she realized after James died.

"Sirius and Lupin" I havent even started talking about them in the fanfiction yet, they will come in at a later time. Harry doesnt even know they exist yet ffs xD

"Neville parents" I have no idea what Nevilles parents have to do with anything, they are not vital to the plot what so ever, and Harry barely knows Neville, he doesnt care about his parents?

"Snape announce prophecy to Voldemort" This will come in at a later point, be patient my young padawan

"Death Eaters attacking Lily" This might have happened at some point, but Harry wouldnt know, he was obliviated, he doesnt even know that Voldemort exists

I can understand why you would be confused, my story is very heavily AU.
