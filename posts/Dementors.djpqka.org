Anybody know a Hp fanfic where instead of harry getting kissed by a dementor he kisses the dementor. I've been wondering about this.


** There is something akin to this, not exactly similar, but similar enough, I think. linkffn(11245382)

  !COMPLETE! He woke with a scream on his lips. Thrust so violently into wakefulness, it took him a second to realize that it wasn't a cold sweat that had him shivering in his bed; it was the three dementors. Without a wand in hand, his death was a foregone conclusion. (Of course, it was really just the beginning.)

** There is a scene towards the end in this fic where Harry kisses a dementor. Might not be your cup of tea, but figured I'd link it just in case. Linkffn(7985679)
