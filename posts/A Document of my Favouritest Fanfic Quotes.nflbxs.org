Okay, so the thing is that I am a serial fanfic reader and completely crazy after sweet passages and titbits that just come out naturally from the beautifully crafted stories.

So, a month or so ago I decided to just accumulate my favourite quotes and share it with the community, so that we can just have a look at them just so that our day gets better by a simple smile.

Enjoy!

** Your quotes are lovely and deep and meaningful. I also have a quotes list! However, it's quotes which make me giggle, here are my favourites:

#+begin_quote
  “The summary of your whole legacy can be condensed into one sentence. Which, pay attention now, this is the culmination of my entire character summary for you: YOU'RE A PRICK!''

  What do you mean, he's not in the school?" Harry insisted. “Master does not understand simple English, he does not. Kreacher is ashamed to have such a Master, yes--“

**** It's from linkao3(Coven by Naidhe), which is incidentally one of the funniest fics ive read for reasons like this. The dry wit of the author is brilliant. It's one of my favourite fics of all time as it is focused on female friendships, esoteric magic, and there's lesbians.

#+begin_quote
  “The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen.” Hermione looked at him then, and smiled softly, “And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore.”

*** You are absolutely correct, the second one was BRILLIANT!

As for mine being meaningful, I added this one too:

"Then you are very wise. And after all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure." Harry wondered if there was a part of Dumbledore's mind that sat around all day and made up phrases like that just in case there was even an excuse to use them."
