By that I mean the horcrux in his scar. What's the most interesting thing you've seen a story do with it?

** I liked one that both Lily's protection and the Horcrux fused and created a seperate entity inside Harry's soul, called Violet. She was self-aware and had both Tom's and Lily's personality mixed up, so she was headstrong, ruthless, cunning, somewhat evil and had a temperament issue. The fic itself is quite interesting, but the ending not only was bad, but it felt extremely rushed, as if a mangaka died and his assistant finished the story with the name he had left. it was called linkffn(The Soul Within)

  The blood protection inside of Harry blocked His killing curse and burned His host body to ashes, yet failed to stop His soul from entering his body? Oh wait, it didn't! Harry's blood protection fights against Voldemort's soul and something new is created...a new soul and companion. Harry thinks it is unfair that she doesn't have a body of her own...well he is going to change that!

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

I forgot about that fic! It's a funny one.

Edit: .. weird. I got ninja'd by [[/u/diraniola]] on the fix part. The comment didn't show despite being an hour old.

** I think linkffn(Lady Archimedes) had a really cool solution to it. SPOILERS (because I can never get the spoiler tag to work for some reason):

[[/spoiler][The general idea of the fic and its predecessor, /The Arithmancer/, is that Hermione is a generational genius in mathematics, and uses this talent to be a badass spell-crafter. Sometime during 6th year, I believe, Hermione figures out that Harry has a Horcrux in his head and immediately tells Harry/Ginny/Ron, sort of with Dumbledore's blessing. She then decides that she will devise a way to remove the Horcrux from Harry without killing him; no small feat. Fast forward I don't know how many chapters to near the end of year 7: The solution Hermione has come up with is to use a ritual to sever the Horcrux from Harry and place it in the body of a snake, where it can then easily be destroyed without harming Harry. The problem is that the ritual makes Harry's Horcrux "wake up" and try to possess Harry. Harry is able to stave off possession for a short time, but he won't be able to hold out indefinitely. Hermione quickly devises another ritual to remove Harry's soul from Harry's body and place it in Ginny's body (with her permission). She can then use her spell to kill the Horcrux in Harry's body without killing the body itself, without risk of harming Harry. Once the Horcrux is gone, she can put Harry's soul back into Harry's body. /It actually works/. Well, except for one small detail: when she placed Harry's soul back into Harry's body, the "cut" wasn't clean and she ended up putting a small part of Ginny's soul in Harry's body (alongside Harry's soul), while also leaving behind a small part of Harry's soul in Ginny's body (alongside Ginny's soul). Harry and Ginny now have minor telepathy, and a host of other side effects. They don't mind that much since they're in love at this point. Also, I've done a terrible job explaining this. The specific details of how the ritual works were well thought out and very interesting, not to mention the other spells that Hermione developed prior to making the whole thing possible. For example, she made a "Soul Detection Spell", Atma Prakata. She also made a spell specifically for destroying Horcruxes by targeting the soul piece in an object (inanimate or animate) and killing it, without harming the physical container in any way (this is how she was able to kill Harry's Horcrux without destroying Harry's body. I highly recommend reading both fics, best series I've read yet.]].

  Sequel to The Arithmancer. Years 5-7. Armed with a N.E.W.T. in Arithmancy after Voldemort's return, Hermione takes spellcrafting to new heights and must push the bounds of magic itself to help Harry defeat his enemy once and for all.
