Hi, i know how alot of people hate fanfiction where harry or some character instantly become a super powered character or a self righteous ass or a person able to change the world in a few seconds, the most glaring example being harry crow and more to a degree

anyone know fanfiction where this is done realistically like someone tries this and is instantly shot down and put in their place and they see that real life does not work that way, or alternatively there's fanfiction that parodies these cliches and shows what realistically happens if someone tried to do that


** Holy crap. You'll love these.

linkffn(The Denarian Renegade), first book in the most fucking awesome trilogy ever.

linkffn(Wastelands of Time), first book in the most fucking awesome duology ever.

linkffn(Magics of the Arcane), just fucking awesome.

And on the dark side: linkffn(Circular Reasoning swimdraconian) holy crap this was amazing.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, Harry fights to stay ahead of enemy machinations. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

** I am trying to claw my way through [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause][Renegade Cause]] (W: 507,606; Complete), and it seems to be the type you're looking for. I can't decide yet though whether it has a good plot and world-building but annoyingly vast amount of dialogues or if it's just a story about /everybody/ being idiots, so that Idiot Balls will not apply because it's not out of character for them.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] (W: 232,797; not updated in a year), where Harry is put in scenarios that he feels are beyond him and in which he often has to make almost-panicked decisions in the face of zeitnots.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks
