Please just give me something uncommon. Something with depth and originality to it.


** Not exactly an original character, but close enough in a lot of ways, "Goldstein" linkffn(10847788).

Then for actual original characters, here's a couple of next-gens that center around OC children of Neville: "How to Charm a Witch" linkffn(11203193) and "Finding Your Voice" linkffn(12748804).

Another couple of next-gens that I like that heavily feature OCs are "The Lost Children" linkffn(11995244) and "The Escapades of Teddy Lupin" linkffn(10554013)

If you don't mind OC siblings of characters fics, I'd also take a look at "My Brother's Keeper", written by the same author of "How to Charm a Witch" linkffn(10804018). I think it's a pretty good rendition of the "what if Harry had a sister?" AU.

I'll also throw out a couple of my own fairly OC-centric fics on the off-chance they might interest you. "Black Eyes" linkffn(12921782) which is an AU where Severus Snape has a little sister and becomes her guardian during his Death Eater days. And it's sequel, which focuses heavily on the sister, "Summer Skeletons" linkffn(12969907).

  Growing up as the middle child of war heroes is already hard enough as it is. How much harder can it be when everyone seems to think that you're a little girl? That's what the second-born child of Neville and Hannah Longbottom asks all the time, as he's the only one that knows the truth: he's a boy, no matter what everyone else tells him. He is Dean Longbottom. This is his story.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** - I'm assuming you have already read the Alexandra Quick series (totally OC American AU) linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle). I would also throw in linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided), as the story is practically AU, but it depends on your opinion.
- linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent): one of my favorite fics, with more than half the characters being OC's, some of which are the best I have yet encountered in the fandom. Was written before OotP came out, so there is a LOT of original content.
- Not all OC's but linkffn(The Ollivanders): possibly more information on wandlore than I can remember being in any other fic.

  Todd Ollivander can't seem to shake his feelings for the new apprentice at his father's wand shop. It's not a good time to be distracted, as it's becoming clearer and clearer that Ollivander's is a major target of Lord Voldemort's during the First Wizarding War. (For those who like to skip around to get a sense of a fic, in Chapter One I suggest which chapters I think are my best.)

** Well, for instance there is always the Black Princess series written by Silently Watches. Here the link to the first part: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks]]

My own story, inspired by Silently Watches' series, has a similar premise but ultimately is my own. I, of course, gave credit to Silently Watches when it was needed. Here the link to my story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12651436/1/The-Witch-Of-The-Wilds]]

I hope you enjoy both! They have a dark theme and branch out the magic and the general HP universe a lot, widening the general theme of wand waving and simple potions to Voodoo, scrying, shapeshifting, vǫlur, coven magic, ritualism, ya sang, etc. Of course not all of that magic is represented in both mine and Silently Watches' works. Which is where is for you to find out.

But, if you find such things interesting, then give them a shot.

FYI, Silently Watches has two completed fics of her Black Princess trilogy, the last fic is slowly but surely coming to a close. Maybe you want to start there, as my story has only five chapters so far, the sixth being worked on. Up to you, though. Have fun reading!

  All Harry Wiggins ever wanted was to follow in the footsteps of his world-famous namesake and attend Hogwarts School for witches and wizards. But all is not what it seems for young Harry, who must learn the secrets behind his unusual abilities. At least everything will be fine when he gets to Hogwarts... won't it?

  She had electric blue hair and emerald green eyes that twinkled with mirth at their surprise, but what put her even more out of place was her clothing. She had no robe or House emblem, nothing Wizardly about her at all. The halfblood beamed at the Poltergeist of Hogwarts and brightly spoke words that had never once been said: "Hi Peeves, it's nice to meet you!" (A Next-Gen fanfic)

** linkao3(Holly at Hogwarts: Now and Forever)

Found this one on a "Dudley has magical child" kick. There are six finished books and a seventh in the works. The set up is that Dudley calls Harry because his child is dying and no muggle doctors can figure out what is wrong with her.
