Here are a few threads that may have things that you might find interesting, all based around Harry/Fleur.

*** Awesome, I should probably have started with looking for similar threads before creating my own, but thanks anyway!

**** No worries the whole purpose of this subreddit is to recommend and discuss Harry Potter fanfiction. I would have given you specific recommendations, but I don't really read much Fleur.

Although I will say I really think you may enjoy the Lie I've Lived by jbern ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]]) which features Harry/Fleur. This was the second Harry/Fleur (that I ever read) and I enjoyed it for the most part. The character of the Sorting Hat is worth reading it for alone, it is hilarious.

Summary: Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** Story: Knowledge is Power [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/]] This is a repost. There are better ones than this, but it has a lot of tropes that are my guilty pleasure. Harry in this fic is a Dr. House esque asshole but equally as brilliant. Fleur doesn't show up until near the end (though it is unfinished).The main criticism is that you kind of get the feeling that the author is someone you might find on [[/r/NiceGuys][r/NiceGuys]]...

** Best way is to go to Fanfiction.net and select Fleur as one of the characters, and sort by Follows

**** I'm going to disagree. Of the 800k fics on FFN it is hard to find those of quality; most of what you will find will be garbage. Asking around the subreddit or going to quality author's favorite lists are the best ways (in my opinion) to find quality fanfiction.

***** Also there are some authors who simply don't list pairings in the tags because they believe it's a spoiler.
