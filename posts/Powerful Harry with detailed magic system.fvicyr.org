Hi, do anyone know a fic where Harry Potter is powerful but not over the top, like he becomes Tom and Albus equal or slightly superior but it takes him years or training instead of one summer. With some detailed magic too. Thanks


** This is a WIP and Harry is powerful from the get to, but he's not OP by any means. This will eventually go into depth about magic, but you will have to be a bit patient. linkffn(13507192)

Also, I do second A Cadmean Victory.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.

********** Many reasons:

1. 99% of fics with Fem!Voldemort only have her female to serve as shipping for the MC (usually Harry)

2. The summary spends a disproportionate amount of time talking about Voldemort, specifically emphasizing the relationship between Voldemort and Harry

3. The story is M rated

4. Harry and Voldemort are the two main tagged characters, appearing beside two unimportant OCs

I could go own and on, but I think you get the point. It may be one of the rare fics that doesn't ship Fem!Voldemort/Harry, but I highly doubt it

*********** Eh after reading it up to its current place I can't help but doubt that. If I had to guess a pairing I would think it to be either the younger OC whose intrigued by Harry or Daphne who's his first and closest friend. I believe, given Fem!Voldemort's actions so far, that their's will probably be one of mentorship or maybe even a mother/son dynamic if Harry's relationship with the remainder of his family doesn't improve.

edit: I wouldn't say that the whole magic system gets super detailed, but it does expand quite a bit on some subjects.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.

** Saving Connor(and the rest of the series) by Lightning on the Wave, if you haven't read it already. This has one of-if not the most detailed political systems and explanation of pureblood traditions without over doing exposition. It gets even better towards year four and onwards. Tbf tho, Harry might have a little more power than the what you wanted but he does go through a lot of training and I think it's definitely worth a try. It does have some cliches but I think they're written well and I personally don't mind them. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]]

It's on both ffn.net and ao3 so whichever you prefer.
