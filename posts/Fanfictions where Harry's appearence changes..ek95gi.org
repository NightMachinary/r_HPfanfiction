Hey guys, i reccently finished Hell Eyes and in this AU, Harry acctually has Wings.\\
So im searchin for fics where he has some appearance change like that.\\
Everything is OK but i would like changes that make him less human-like, just like uncommon hair and eye colors or wings, ya'know things like this.\\
No Slash or FemHarry.\\
Extra points if you send me something where his hair changes to White and/or his eyes to red.\\
But as i said everything is OK, reptilian eyes, wings, tail, unnatural pale skin, claws and things like these.\\
Must be a little long so that i can distract myself for some time.\\
I really don't like Hinny or H/Hr so if there's pairings for Harry it would be great if is someone that is't those two.

That's it !


** The first ones that pop into my mind are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings]] where Harry has wings like the fanfic you just read.

Another would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11585823/1/The-Art-of-Self-Fashioning][The-Art-of-Self-Fashioning]] where the dehumanizing changes you're looking for actually come from his own self-transfiguration.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] Harry's trademark scar is described as horribly disfiguring and later on there is a change in appearance related to his eyes.

Those fics are some of my favorites and they are all quite long so if you pick them up, it'll last you a bit. However, /With Strength of Steel Wings/ and /Blindness/ are both Harmony fics. I think they are worth the read even if you don't like the pairing. Sorry I have no clue how to use the bot so you'll have to go to each story for the summaries.

ig I got the bot to work but didn't realize it, the links are in the deleted comments? I don't know.

  Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry safe, but his relatives are expendable. Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry looking like his adoptive father, but it's wearing off. Blood is a bond, but so is the memory of hate -- or love.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
