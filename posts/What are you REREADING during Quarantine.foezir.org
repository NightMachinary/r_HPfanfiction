There's tons of threads asking for new stuff to help get through quarantine. Issue: I'm pretty picky. It just can't have a concept, it needs to have good writing for me to enjoy it. So I figure, the ultimate litmus test for recommending something isn't did you read it once and enjoy it enough to remember it. It's did you enjoy it enough remember it and come back to it. What are ya'll rereading right now?

If you can, add a bit about it, why you came back to it, and if it is/isn't finished.


** For me I'm rereading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/8/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force][The Havoc Side of the Force]]. Tl;dr MoD kiiiiinda cynical dark Harry gets sent to the star wars universe. Once you get past 4-5 chapters it gets really good cause you have more than 1 sided dialogue, and while I personally don't know the characters, Jedi talk like Jedi, Harry (even with the cynical dark) still kinda sounds like Harry, etc. Rereading it just because the lore between force/magic (they're VERY NOT the same thing) it expands on is really interesting, and the characterization is fantastic.

** [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/][Perfect Slytherins]] by Jeconais.

This is kind of cheating though because I re-read it every 6 months or so.

I absolutely love this fic, and if anyone hasn't read it then you absolutely should.

** I'm rereading The Marriage Stone by Josephine Darcy. I think the quality of the plot and characterization is amazing.

** I've been rereading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14462256/chapters/33410763][You Get What You Give by Watermellonsfellon]] on ao3. It's a WBWL Fem!Harry Slytherin!Harry with just a bit of weird romance sprinkled in. Very salty with pletly of alive potters and Potter & bashing galore. Another fic I recommend while I'm at it is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11761202/1/The-Forgotten-Potter][The Forgotten Potter]] on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]]. It's a HP/Avengers crossover, and another fem!Harry fic. The Potter's are unfortunately bashed, but assassin Harry more than makes up for it. I absolutely love them both.

** linkffn(Harry is a dragon, and that's okay)\\
Harry Potter the light hearted slice of life with the added twist of Harry being a dragon.

Takes the tone of the original books and runs with it. Currently in the middle of year 4 and updating regularly so far. Hopefully it will get finished.

I'm re-reading it because it is pretty much the only long, well written story in which there are no child politicians, no grim dark edginess and no angst.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Not exactly re-reading, but I had got behind on updates and then went a few chapters back from that to refresh myself.

​

The Wizard's Nephew.

It's a Snape is Harry's father fic which plays on several tropes but does them differently. Snape's parenting mentor is a local muggle. No character bashing.

** Most recently, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2489360/1/A-Keen-Observer][A Keen Observer]] by DeepDownSlytherin. Andromeda isn't a character I usually search out fic for but this one is fantastic. The relationship between the Black sisters is particularly strong.

** linkffn(6174426)

Its a short one, filled with so many cliches but at least for me it's a nice feel good one with the writing pretty decent (I dont notice any mistakes or passages which are ridiculously long or grammatically complicated so its in that great spot)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784918/1/Bound-With-Silver-Threads][Bound with Silver Threads]], Lily Luna Potter/OC romance, so essentially OC/OC but it's done well. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood][Lacerny, Lechery and Luna Lovegood]]. Harry needs access to better magic to stand a chance against Voldemort. Each Pureblood family has it's own specific brand of magic that they hoard the knowledge of. The Potters were, publically, warders, but used their skill to take apart wards and steal. Harry decides to continue the family tradition under the excuse of trying to find something that would help against Voldemort and Hermione comes along for the ride. Meanwhile, Ron accidentally becomes the Dark Lord of perversion/sex and Fred becomes Minister of Magic.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** Sarcasm and Slytherin by sunmoonandstars - Sadly this is an orphaned story, but there's 648,000 words to enjoy in several books.

Really interesting Slytherin!Harry with a BWL twin and a git of a father. I love the magical traditional detail and the Light/Dark politics. Sirius is adorable. I enjoy hating Ethan and James. :D. Barty Jr. is great. Snape is tolerable. Grey Harry FTW!

** World in Pieces by Lomonaaeren - Complete\\
An incredibly interesting trans-universe travel AU - love the Harry/Snape friendship. This is gen, but the dimension travelling Harry has to deal with a Draco who is missing the dead Harry who was his lover. No slash in this, though.
