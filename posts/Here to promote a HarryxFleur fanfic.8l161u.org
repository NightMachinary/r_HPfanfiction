It's in progress and written by myself, If anyone likes that pairing give it a look!


** There are a lot of mistakes in your writing, while I see you're looking for a beta, a beta can't do everything for you. You need to understand basic formatting and spelling, writing isn't as simple as “oh, I have a good idea for a fic, let me just write out a couple of chapters and see how it goes from there!” Spelling and grammar are just as important as the premise of the fic, and even if you get a beta, it won't solve everything. You need to be able to do some of these basic things without the help of a beta.

**** Here's one. Every sentence should start with a capital letter. A quotation mark does not overrule that unless the quote is “for example” in the middle of an existing sentence. It's rather jarring seeing all the lowercase.

**** The reason you don't see misspelled words is because you don't know how to spell them in the first place :/

** Thanks for all of the criticism, I'll make sure to work on capitalization within quotes which I didn't not know was necessarily, truly thanks for those who have helped me in that regard. I will do that from now on and will go back to fix the prior ones on a spare weekend

**** Can't tell if you're serious or not so: a "dad joke" is a shitty pun or awful joke. In this case the joke was rearranging the sentence.

/OP:/ I'm (looking for a thing).

/The bot:/ Hi (looking for a thing), I'm dad.

** Look up some articles on passive voice vs active voice. Just looking at the summary, you use the former often. Imo, active voice generally makes for a better read.

*** u/TheAccursedOnes:
#+begin_quote
  He asked back.
#+end_quote

That wouldn't be capitalized, but it should just be cut in the first place. No need for it.

*** Maybe it's the website? Idk cause I always do quotes and italics for my dialogue. I've never done it any other way. Unless you confuse the italics with when they speak French which is also italics. Let me know, cause I'm trying to fix it. Any interest in being a Beta? Haha I need someone that can help me avoid these mistakes/mentor me on those stupid errors. Thanks!
