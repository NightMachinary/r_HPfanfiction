What're all y'all's thoughts on fanfics adding classes to the Hogwarts Curriculum? Like: fanfic Harry rolls up to the great hall for breakfast on sept 2nd and sees he has Charms, then Magical theory, then Art, lunch, etc etc

It can just turn me off a whole fic to see muggle subjects like maths or literature there, especially when they're just flavour and don't have any plot bearing. It just feels like it'd be out of character for the pureblood run society to embrace muggle subjects.


** I don't like fics that cover classes at all. Unless the information taught in class is directly relevant to the main plot of the story, or adds important characterization that couldn't have come from anything else, then classes and class schedules shouldn't be put into the story. It just feels like filler content otherwise.

In canon, JKR skipped past weeks of school between major events because the classes weren't important, and the few lessons we actually got to see introduced important plot points - Snape's "bottle flame, brew glory" speech showed his instant bias against Harry, Slughorn's love potion demonstration foreshadowed the Merope backstory.

But I have to admit the most egregious examples of adding classes are the various forms of "Muggleborn Orientation Class" and "Study Hall", without adding any explanation of why or how they're part of the school schedule.

** I mostly don't have a problem with it. Though it shouldn't beat you over the head with it unless it's plot relevant. In fact I always have to wonder 'Why doesn't Hogwarts teach basic math and writing skills?' Even Deku at UA has to take the boring classes.

As far as embracing muggle subjects, I'd hardly call art, music or literature a muggle subject. Think a pureblood doesn't appreciate literature? In a society where literally, knowledge is power? Pureblood parents should be cramming tomes down their kid's throats, in English and the original Latin.

Oh really, it feels out of character for a society essentially made up of shopkeepers and bureaucrats to actually train their members in counting and writing beyond elementary school level? Clearly you never had to deal with barely educated adults before.

*** It's disgusting that people try to justify the Goblins having a banking monopoly because wizards don't need math.

- 90% of their homework is "write an essay on this subject" or "read that book". If at the end of 7 years they still can't write, 1 weekly hour of litterature probable won't change anything. Not to mention the few times I read fic with it, they somehow end up studying Shakespear before of course he was either a wizard or wizard don't have "/true authors/".
- They have spell to help with it. In HBP, Ron's quill has its enchantment wearing off, changing everything he writes to something wrong, but before this he had an autocorrect quill.
- "/1 book for 4 Galleons, and these 2 are 3 Galleons each, 10 Galleons in total Mr Potter/", that's the kind of math most shopkeepers do. Just to be safe, you can add multiplication and division for some, but it's mostly simple maths.
- If people "need" math in their fic, can't they use a ready math subject that Harry never took but is somehow linked to it? I don't know like : Arithmancy?

Still, I guess math and litterature is still better than the fics that make they do "Sciences" or "History" as if Wizards would care about that.

**** According Pottermore, Alchemy (and a few unnamed classes) can be a NEWT level class if enough students wish to take it.
