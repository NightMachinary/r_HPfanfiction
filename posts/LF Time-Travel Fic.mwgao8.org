I'm looking for a fic which Harry goes back in time preferably to the marauders era and becomes friends with them and lily. Preferably a longer fic 60K+ words. Also would be nice if Harry keeps his identity hidden for abit of time at least. No SLASH ( Don't mind wolfstar) No femharry


** Would you have any interest in a rec for a WIP fic in which Harry goes back to the First War era if there has been zero romance (including zero pining or anything like that) for 250,000+ words but the author has said there will be a Harry/Regulus kiss at some point near the end? I'm asking because it's my favorite fic of all time and it's really a gen fic with eventual very light slash, but I recognize that you stipulated no slash besides Wolfstar. Totally fine either way, of course - I just love the fic and try to recommend it where I can, and it's the least slash-y slash fic I've ever read so I thought it might be worth a shot. Besides this fic, the author exclusively writes gen. If it matters, Harry and Regulus are the POV characters, and Regulus has already defected from the Death Eaters when the story begins. The other major characters so far are James, Lily, Sirius, and Marlene McKinnon.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  What if the Dementor attack in 5th year had ended with Harry losing? What if someone had stepped in to save him? And what if Harry ended up in the past with a chance to be more than he ever was before? A story about a forcibly time travelled Harry and its consequences... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

  Aunt Petunia gasped her pain out against Holly's clammy neck even as she turned, her head lolling, to glare hatefully at Bellatrix. “You will not take her. My sister---“ “---is dead, little muggle,” said Bellatrix. “As will you if you do not give us Potter.” Holly's heart constricted for the space of half a heartbeat. Aunt Petunia did not want her. She'd gotten Uncle Vernon killed. She'd brought the war to their doorstep. She'd--- “Over my dead body, you stupid witch!” Aunt Petunia gasped, her arms convulsively twitching around Holly's shoulders, her nails digging into her skin. “You've killed my sister, my husband... I---I won't let you kill my niece too!” Bellatrix laughed loudly, a loud maniacal cackle that seemed to fill Holly's world with fire and brimstone. “On your head be it. Avada Kedavra!”
