Harry is remarkably well adjusted, fitting the Wizarding Jesus narrative JKR writes, given that he's an abused child.

Are there any fics where the Dursleys aren't any worse than they are in canon (withholding meals, piss poor dregs of food, locked in a cupboard for days, isolation, having to "duck the occasional swing of a frying pan" being beaten by his Cousin and tormented by Marge's dog to the point he stayed up a tree overnight, and the verbal abuse, but Harry isn't miracle child well adjusted.

Ideally without evil "GRATER GUD" Dumbledore when people just write Evil Dumbledore and write FOR THE GREATER GOOD about 50,000 times.

If you want the Dursley abuse to continue, instead of having Dumbledore manipulating everything behind the scenes and obliviating everything, (and somehow having the knowledge to edit computer records in some fics), have Vernon be the one doing it, paying off a few dodgy child support workers (They were shit tier in the 80s anyway, so you might not even need to pay them off, they might just say "Nope, he's fine" and carry on)

Harry turning out with enough Trauma that Dumbledore thinks "Nope, Blood Protections aren't helping him, fuck it I'll place him somewhere under the Fidelius with me as the Secret Keeper Dursleys can burn"

Ideally no Slash (As 99% of Slashfics are let's pair Harry with insert Death Eater here, and I don't want to read Death Eater revisionism crap) and no Severitus, Snape isn't some cuddly father figure, and most Severitus involves the Author's corporal punishment Fetish.

Nobody:

My brain: "GREATER GIT GUD!"

That is, what if instead of adults being useless, everyone was hyper-competent and Hogwarts just churned out badass after badass, and the war was a continuing series of escalating one-ups on either side, taken to crack/meme levels of insane.

Apologies for going off topic, but my brain did a thing.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

#+end_quote

None of those were normal. Withholding meals and being locked in a cupboard for days were the result of apparently maliciously fucking over Vernon's meeting with his business partner; the frying pan thing was once, not occasional, and probably intended to miss; Harry was given the same food Dudley was, though usually in lesser (but not starvation-tier) amounts; and the verbal abuse only really started after Harry was accepted into Hogwarts (and each year he usually bullshitted a way to get them to leave him alone).

Marge seems to be a bit much for even the Dursleys and rarely comes over. Dudley beating him up is very explicitly exactly what happens, but it's not too much different from your average schoolkid's bully older brother.

The /real/ psychological tolls would come from blatant favoritism and the seemingly deliberate torpedoing of Harry's social life. Mrs. Figg is the closest thing Harry has to a friend after Dudley isolated him at school and he was forced to dress up in Dudley's cast-offs. Of course, we don't know how recent Harry's isolation was, just that it happened. At 11, he connects with Hagrid, then Ron and Hermione, so it might have been relatively recent.
