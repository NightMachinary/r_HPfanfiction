** That he believes the darkness can be used to protect his family, that he can willfully control a darkness that once let in, will slowly corrupt him almost unknowingly until one day, that darkness within has him no longer caring about his family but willing to sacrifice them to gain even more power.

**** Think of the dark arts like a sexual peccadillo.

For years, Dude A is married to Soccer Mom A. Soccer Mom A likes sex in the dark, covers on, Lights off.

Dude A enjoys that but sometimes he wants to wear a diaper, be fed milk from a bottle, then have a large woman burp him before riding him while dressed like a school girl. So he visits a prostitute once a month to feed his fetish.

James is the same. Once a week he spends the day at an office somewhere, reading books on the Dark Arts, working to protect his family while his soul slowly degrades, too slow for anyone to really see it save Riddle who's seen it in his own past and can see that James is going to be his Darth Vader to Riddle's Palpatine if the right lever is applied.

** I love that idea ! He has to feel emotions and he should have a motive to act as he does. This will help the reader to like him, I guess. He also can't be too powerful/talented/perfect. And don't make him an emo.

** He embraces the darkness so no one else he loves has to, and he thinks it's needed to fight against something threatening them. He regrets his actions some but continues out of necessity.

** Make him worry about this development towards the dark via means of internal struggle. Give him a strong set of morals, which directly conflict with the methods he wants to use. Basically make him a character who inherently dislikes the idea of the end justifying the means, who finds himself justifying the means, because the alternatives to the end would be even worse.

You can increase this up to the point of self-loathing.

A reader will now probably sympathize with him, because people who are thrown into a dilemma and still manage to cling onto a sense of right and wrong (even if they end up acting contrarian to this moral code of theirs) are something people like.

** The best way to make an evil character sympathetic is to assign the person some positive characteristics, for example:

- Loyalty, they might be a brutal torturers and murderers, but they would never betray the person they sworn allegiance to.

- Strong sense of honor, never breaking promises once made.

- Intelligent and wise, even though they were doing bad things, their schemes were so clever you have to pay them respect.

**** Then I would write him as someone who was primarily interested in gaining power and glory, with any means necessary, as long as his own code of honor I described in previous post was not violated.

** The need for power is created because of opposition from mostly purebloods that heir of a noble family like the Potters is marrying a mudblood. Voldemort and James meet somewhere during the war and they have a subtle conversation(while dueling) about how Voldemort would change that perception of just Lily in society. Voldemort is very aware of how sick James is of the pressure he's getting from political figures and his parents to not marry Lily. James sees the potential of being able to change peoples thoughts about his wife if he performed somewhat of a coup but doesn't like Voldemort's means of getting there nor him only caring about one muggleborn(he would like equality for more muggleborn) so he does it with his own friends, his own way(He finds Dumbldore's Order to be too passive and weak with its action) It becomes a 3 way battle between 3 sects(Dumbledore,James,Voldemort) . James starts out battling light but in a critical battle where Sirius almost dies he throws out a dark curse he knows off handedly from experience. Sirius notices and tries to talk about it but James swears off of it and says he won't do it again. The power of the curse he slings out however begins to eat at him and consume him. Voldemort sees this and the power behind the curse and offers him an invitation to his corps and James denies the invitation and says hes nothing like him. However he doubts that what he says is true because he enjoys the power behind dark magic.

** Start off by having him use slightly Dark spells in the past to help in hopeless situations, maybe together with Sirius (who through his family knows at least some Darker stuff) or another friend so he feels like it's not that bad. Then, when he realises just how strong it can be, he starts down a slippery slope, always telling himself that he can handle just a little bit more, until he turns around and realises how far he's fallen (a bit like a drug addiction - he thinks he can quit at any time, until he tries to quit).
