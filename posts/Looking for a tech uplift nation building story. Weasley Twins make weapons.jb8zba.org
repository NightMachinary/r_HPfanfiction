All I remember is that the Weasley twins worked for Harry making weapons. I am pretty sure they pull a prank on arthur and nearly kill him by accident. I believe Harry is the leader of a Wizarding empire or nation. I could be wrong but I don't believe it's Harry Potter and the power of revenge or rise of the wizards.


** Is it this one? I'm pretty sure the twins do some weapons creation which is revealed at the end maybe.
