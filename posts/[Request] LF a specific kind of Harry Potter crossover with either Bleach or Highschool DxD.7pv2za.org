Hey there! I am looking for a crossover fics between Harry Potter and Highschool DxD (both of which are anime for those who do not know) where Harry dies during/after the war and goes to Soul Society where he meets his friends and family and gets acquainted with the world. (That's the Bleach crossover).

Another kind of fics I am looking for is that Harry dies during/after the war and gets reincarnated as an Angel / Fallen Angel / Devil and he meets his family and friends who are on his same side or on the opposite side. For example, Harry was reincarnated as an Angel while Sirius and his parents were Fallen, Angels or Devils.


** Are you interested in one where he find's out he is GOD. Not a god, but the GOD from DxD.

**** I'll just link it, don't remember it much. From what it looks like, it's a re-incarnation fic.
