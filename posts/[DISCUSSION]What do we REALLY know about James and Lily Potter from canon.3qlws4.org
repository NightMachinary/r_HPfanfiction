I've just started Too Young to Die, just the prologue, and it got me thinking. Could James and Lily really have been neglecting or even plain bad parents? James I can believe, how he used to be at Hogwarts, even though he supposedly outgrew it all, but really, what do we really know about the type of people, the type of parents that they'd be?

Well, obviously there's their sacrificing themselves for him, and Lily's letter to Sirius, Snape's memories, and what we've heard from others about them, like Hagrid, Sirius and Remus. But still, what about their personalities?


** Canon James and Lily were good people. Bad people don't have so many people saying good things about them. A lot of fics make them out to be saints, which is exaggerated. People look back and only remember the good things. Except Snape who only remembers the bad, about James.

I really like how bad!James/Lily is done in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) Was done in the most believable way I've seen.

Too Young to Die is a special case, and you probably shouldn't read any posts in this thread that mention it if you don't want spoiled, just go read the fic.

*** Seems interesting, I'll give it a try. And anyway, I'll probably be done with Too Young to Die by tomorrow or the day after. It just got me thinking about the people they are. People say good things about them, but consider the people saying it. Their best friends, or Hagrid, who is, after all, saying it to their son. And their views would be colored by the fact that they're gone, and also that in the end, they were so brave, and did good for the world.

I'm not saying it isn't true, they were good, of course they are, just wondering.

Yes, my point was these people wouldn't have been their friends if they weren't nice people. They definitely said the good things and left out the faults. We see some of James faults but never Lily's.

[[/u/NedryOS]] said this once and made me laugh so I dug it up.

  Lily is one hymen short of literally being the Virgin Mary.

Also my headcanon for how James and Lily would be is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi)

So that would make Lily an analogue to Mary.

  What if Harry were a Slytherin? What if everyone thought his twin brother was the BWL? What if someone tried to do something creative and innovative with the two most overused cliches in HP fanfic? AU, currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NOTE: There will be NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year.

** Lily and James were certainly caring people: you don't put yourself between your family and danger otherwise. James was an obnoxious teenager, but by all accounts, he had mostly grown out of that by the time he died at 21. Less is known about Lily, but I think it's reasonable to assume that she was both kind and stubborn.

They fundamentally didn't have time to really grow up in canon though. Like, when I read the books as a kid, Lily and James were /adults/ who sacrificed themselves. I think about that now, and they were really barely out of their teens.

******** Did you miss the idea that Sirius spent most of his adult life inside of a prison, filled with monsters that suck out all of his happiness, leaving him with nothing but depression? That kind of thing may stunt a person's emotional growth.

And, on the subject of maturity, lets talk about Snapes "maturity": bullies Harry because of who is father is, bullies Hermione because...?, bullies Neville because Lily died instead of Neville's parents, bullies Gryffindor house because it is Gryffindor house, allows Slytherin to not only get away with bullying other students but also encourages it. The same bullying that he was a victim of. And lets not forget, he is *a 30 year old man who bullies children.* And, once again, he gives Sirius as much grief as Sirius gives him. He is a shining light of maturity, isn't he?

So, once again, I'll ask you again, for the second time: what is your point?

**** James saved Snape's life while they were still at school. You can argue he did it to keep Remus from getting in trouble but the fact is he still put himself in great personal danger by getting Snape away from Remus who had already transformed. James wasn't a bad person, he was arrogant and standoffish with the man he consider a rival for his crushes affections. But Harry didn't just get his saving people thing from Lily.

*** Plenty of people believe that Dumbledore is a 'manipulative old coot' who used people as part of a grand plan for 'The Greater Good'. An entirely reasonably explanation for the choice of not-Dumbledore is that James and/or Lily had similar concerns, trusting in his desire to vanquish Voldemort but intuiting his willingness to sacrifice himself and others. We see (though they, of course, do not) both Vance and Bones die in the sixth book under mysterious circumstances and easily could argue that Dumbledore sacrificed them.

  but again, how much of their friendship was genuine from both sides, or how much of it was Snape's desperation for a friend...who knows?

Are you implying here that both Severus and Lily could have been disingenuous in their friendship? Or merely that Lily may have been?

******* Well, Snape knows how much Lily (as she should) dislikes Snapes slytherin friends yet he continues to befriend people who hate his best friend because of her blood. If she was so important to him surely he would've stayed away from people she hated like she did with the marauders.

Anyway, it's pretty clear that their relationship was falling apart even if he didn't call her a mudblood since he treated all other muggle borns as the other slytherins did.
