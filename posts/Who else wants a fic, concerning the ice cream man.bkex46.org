** In my headcanon, Fortescue was abducted because he knows an extraordinary lot of what is happening in the wizarding world. He's very observant, has a long memory, and learned almost every piece of information that ever went through his ice cream parlor.

Solstice Muse's completed mystery fic [[https://harry-and-ron.livejournal.com/845501.html][Unity in the Community]] addresses your first question; Florean Fortescue plays a big role in it. It's Harry/Ron slash, so it may not be for everyone.
