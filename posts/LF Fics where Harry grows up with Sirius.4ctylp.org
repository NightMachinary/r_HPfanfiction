Ok, I seriously need material to read but I`m really distrustful of going into a fic without recommendations.

Can any of you fellow potterheads recommend a good fic where Harry grows up with Sirius? I dont mind shipping at all, Im just looking for the father figure neither me nor Harry had.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent]] by MarauderLover7. It has two completed sequels and a third sequel that is still being updated. The writing is pretty good - a few typos here and there but nothing major. The first story (Innocent), was a bit slow in places, but I still enjoyed it overall, particularly how the story manages to be different from canon, but without being super AU. The sequels are set at a better pace though and the characterisation in the whole series is fantastic.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

**** It's well worth it. I promise stick with it and you'll love it. I was so sad when I caught up to the writer and had to start waiting for updates. The updates are a bit spaced out but every new chapter still has the good writing as before, so it's teaching me patience.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

** I'm not sure if that's what your looking for but I'm currently reading "A marauder's plan" by CatsAreCool, Sirius doesn't go abroad after PoA but stays in London and the whole story changes from there (and to fit it into your request, he gets custody of Harry). It's rather long and not yet finished, but it gets updated regularly. Linkffn(8045114)
