  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** Have you tried linkffn(Forging the Sword) or linkffn(Harry Potter and he Forests of Valbone)?

linkffn(Magics of the Arcane) also takes a sharp turn, but it occurs just before the First Task in fourth year.

There's also linkffn(Prophecies, Secrets and Lies), the first of Shinysavage's Second War series, though that's been abandoned, I think.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them.

** Linkffn(the amplitude, frequency and resistance of the soul bond) fits what you want to a t. Pretty much the only soul bond worth reading. I second forest of valbone and forging the sword, although you should be warned, they are among the most lamented abandoned fics out there.

Are you opposed to fics where there are small changes to the starting characters? Linkffn(weasley girl) is cannon except for fem!Ron (great fic) and linkffn(the arithmancer) is cannon except Hermione is a mathematics genius.
