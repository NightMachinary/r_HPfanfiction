Hi I am looking for a fic where its harry/hermione & neville/luna

And sadly the only scene I remember with any clarity is the one where they're trying to rescue alice and frank from their trapped minds using legilimency or occlumency. Frank is fishing (?) on a pier but alice is amongst shriveled shrubs and flowers? Then the youngsters chant a spell alongst the lines of...”by the power invested... life and death” THANK YOU! Would be very grateful to find this fic again

Edit: im so thankful for you guys here!! I think we all read too many of the same tropey fics hahaha HOPE WE FIND IT SOON!


** Oh that sounds so familiar... but I've looked through my fanfic collection and I can't find anything with that in... Sorry dude! I hope you find it!

** Shit I know this one but it's not coming to me. Do Harry and Hermione have some sort of soul bond? I feel like they had a soul bond because that was the tether they used to bring them back.

If I find it, I'll post it.

**** This is driving me insane now.

I know the fic but for the life of me can't remember the name and the details are too vague for google. Or my search terms suck, which is equally likely.

** [[https://whydoyouneedtoknow.fanficauthors.net/Dealing_with_Danger/Chapter_11_In_the_Midst_Year_3/]]

I knew it. It's part of the Dangerverse series. But if you reread it again, could you find the bit where a bunch of students baffle Snape by leaping and tumbling around in completely silence around him?

*** That's similar.... but it's not the same one (I think).

The one I'm thinking of, it's just Harry, and maybe Hermione. Alice is a little girl trapped in her mind and Harry has to lead her out. He helps Alice first (because she's more aware?) and then helps Frank. I also want to say that he does this as a surprise for Neville? The first time Neville sees his parents is when they return home to Longbottom Manor.

Again, could be conflating stories. I'd forgotten about this in Dangerverse though.

**** Im pretty sure its something along the lines of neville wants to go visit his parents and harry and hermione comes with them harry helps alice get out of her mind and hermione does the same for frank. and they can do this because frank and alice have a soul bond and because harry and hermione have a soul bond too they realize this.
