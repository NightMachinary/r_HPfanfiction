I know, I get tired of constant request posts too. But this is something I've been looking for off and on for a while, and thought I'd try you beautiful people. Any help at all would be great.

I would really like to read slash fics where Harry is friends with Ginny. It seems like a lot of slash authors really hate on Ginny, but I've always liked her and get tired of the bashing.

I'll read Harry/pretty much any male character, except for Ron. And to get the ball rolling, I have an offering that is just about the only one I've found like this: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1025930][Growing Pains]] by lary. It's a Harry/Snape mid-length oneshot that's pretty good.


** HP/LV where both Tom and HP are friends with Ginny. REALLY REALLY GOOD. READ IT NOW. NOW I SAID.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4787596/1/Snape-s-Voice]] Short funny from must love quidditch!!!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1462543/6/A-Moment-in-Time]] This is really good. It has Mpreg in it, which usually I don't like. BUT the author did it all very well. I was really surprised.

And in case you have not heard of it Saving Connor from the Sacrifices arc series. This is all the books redone with Harry in Slytherin, AU, a bit slow at first, but possibly the best drarry I have ever read. It is seriously just amazing. Definitely worth the read.

Edit: I asked the question and then decided to just give you a list.

*** Thanks, you've given me a nice long list that should last me a while :)

I didn't realize that Harry is friends with Ginny in Saving Connor. I read part of the first one and didn't get into it, but I got the feeling that he was going to drift away from the Gryffindors as time went on, and he became more and more a part of Slytherin.

**** In later books he try's to unite the houses. They're not close, but no Ginny bashing.

I think in only a few of the ones I listed are him and Ginny friends, but pretty sure none of those have Ginny bashing. Must love quidditch they are friends though. If a Ginny bashing one did slip in, I'm super sorry. I have not read some of these in a while, but I'm pretty sure these don't have it. Oh wait... No the M preg one has Weasley bashing, but Ginny died... I can't believe I forgot that! I just remembered a scene where Harry was thinking fondly of her, so I linked it.

***** Cool, as long as there's no outright bashing they don't need to be BFFs or anything. Thank you!
