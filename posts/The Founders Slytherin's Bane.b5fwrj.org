The fens of Britain, Godric thought, were not an ideal place to hide. The flat fields were open and lush with scattered trees that did not quite provide any sort of cover or shade. Coming to a lonely area near a full stream of water, Godric calmly observed his surroundings as it, silently observed him. He was a tall man with broad shoulders that couldn't quite be hidden by the long, dark cloak he wore. His long pelt of dark, red hair hovered somewhere above his waist.

His intelligent brown eyes were slightly puffy and dark bruising showed at the edges. There was a nasty, long scar that ran from the left side of his face and down to his jaw. This however, did not detract from his good-natured appearance. He hummed lightly as he walked closer to the stream and looked into the water. Long moments passed before he pointed hi wand to the water and cried out: “Accio snake!”

A large sinewy beast flew out of the stream. Furious at being disturbed from its swim, it opened wide its mouth and flashed long fangs. It raised its head and lunged, once, twice toward Godric who stood his ground and uttered one of the few words he knew in the snake language, Parseltongue. “Friend.”

The snake stopped and seemed to regard him for a moment. “What do you want from me?”

Godric tilted his head to the side, cursing under his breath. He could not understand what it had said but could only assume that it had stopped because he had correctly said the word. It would not do to have to kill the snake due to a misunderstanding.

“Salazar.” Godric hissed, hoping that he had recalled the pronunciation correctly. The snake became uncommonly still and then, in very slow degrees, opened its mouth wider and wider. A glowing, pearly blue light erupted around it. As the mouth became wide enough to fit his frame, Godric walked into the cave of a mouth and apparated. The sensation was as unpleasant as always and turned his empty stomach. But, he soon found himself in front of a tidy cottage wrapped by all sorts of plants and flowers. The front door slowly opened, revealing a short, burly man with thinning dark hair and sharp, green eyes.

“Salty!” Godric cried out, rushing forward to embrace the man.

“I see that years of travel and study still haven't improved your speech, Godric.” Salazar said dryly. Godric had been using that nickname from their childhood when he had had a distinct lisp and couldn't say his full name. Salazar smiled as he returned his friend's embrace.

“I am happy to see that years of being coddled at home haven't lessened your skill,” Godric said warmly. “Do all snakes do your bidding in such a way?”

“As I told you before, only the ones in that brook have I trained. They were bred by my father. I still believe that no other creature holds such intelligence and propensity to magic as they do.”

“Yes, yes,” said Godric, waving an airy hand. “Propensity to magic-If you can only communicate with those living ropes.”

Salazar scowled. “Living ropes?”

“Oh come now, Salty. I mean no offense. They've always looked so to me! Now, may I come in? Or are you inclined to keep your old friend cold and unwelcomed at the door?”

Sighing, Salazar stepped back and Godric ducked into the cottage. Almost immediately, Salazar was shoved to the side as a blur of dark hair and fabric came streaking through, shouting: “Godric!”

“Althena!” He boomed back, sweeping the young, dark-haired beauty into his arms. He spun her around until she laughed and bid him to put her down.

“Oh no, no! Not until you agree to run off me!” He teased. “Old Salty never wrote and told me how beautiful you've gotten.”

Althena blushed. “That's because he doesn't flatter. You're preserving well.”

“Preserving?! Oh bother!” Godric laughed, setting her down. “She's got a wit about her, eh?”

Salazar rolled his eyes. “A bit too much of it, yes.”

“Have you made dinner?” Godric asked, looking about hopefully.

“Oh yes, I knew to prepare for your arrival,” Salazar flicked his wand and summoned a table laden with simmering plates of roasted fowl stuffed with fresh herbs, baked potatoes and goblets of honey mead.

Godric clapped his hands appreciatively and as soon as they were seated, began to eat and drink in earnest.

Althena giggled. “You still have the appetite of a lion.”

“For all things in life,” he said, winking as he gulped down mead.

Salazar chewed thoughtfully and very casually said, “So what was so important that you had to come to in person?”

“Well, you see, Rowena sent me an owl the other day and-“

“You still correspond?” Salazar interrupted, an intent look coming to his face.

Godric shrugged. “Not too much recently, she has been completing her own travels, seeking to improve her inventions and such.”

Salazar visibly relaxed and nodded. Godric hid a smile, it would seem his old friend was still carrying a torch for fair Rowena. But, he knew better than to comment. Salazar would rather river dance on his precious snakes than to admit to his old infatuation.

“So yes, where was I?” Godric pretended to lose thought.

“Rowena had written to you!” Salazar said, impatiently.

“Oh right! Yes, she wrote to me about a little community by York that had decided to start a small school of sorts. Unfortunately, it was found out by muggles, putting them all at great risk.”

Salazar snorted. “Well of course it was found out! You cannot put wizard children together and expect them to be hidden in plain sight! Not with young magic being so erratic. Remember what happened when your father staged the “The Tale of the Three Brothers” play?”

“Ancient history!” Godric said, flushing slightly.

“What did happen?” Althena said, her eyes going from her brother to Godric who was conveniently shoveling more food into his mouth.

Salazar smirked. “Well, brave Godric here got so frightened when poor old Mr. Wadbottle appeared as death that he turned the entire cast into-was it mushrooms?”

“Radishes,” grumbled Godric. “Of course, you'd remember such nonsense.”

“What's a friend for?” said Salazar over Althena's laughter.

“Stupid story anyway,” said Godric. “Death and three fools.”

“Actually, two fools if you study the story correctly.” Salazar said thoughtfully.”

Godric groaned loudly. “Salty, you have us off-topic here!”

“By all means, continue,” Salazar said gracefully refilling their cups with his wand. Althena's eyes lingered on the wand and Salazar, catching her eye, gave her a small, sad smile.

Godric pretended not to notice but instead of returning to the topic of Rowena's letter, began a long story about muggles.

“Oh bother, while we're off topic anyway, I was going to tell you about living in the muggle court! An interesting experience! Though I must say, they thought me a bit eccentric. The High Duke knew of my true nature, but he preferred for me not to use magic in front of him. This was fine at first but I could not, for the life of me, abide by the usage of chamber pots. They're supposed to be these fine ceramic things where you are to relieve yourself at night since the privy rooms are rather far. (Poor planning really). I kept vanishing mine- The poor old maid could not understand how I produced no waste. Thought my bowels were locked up too tightly and tried to purge me a few times. Seemed unnatural to me, sleeping in the same room as your-“

“-What else did you learn there?” Interrupted Salazar abruptly as Althena giggled.

Grinning, Godric went on. “You see, not having magic, they focus solely on skills. They have these swords, sharp metal instruments used to kill on occasion.”

He pulled out a sword from his scabbard. It was a handsome design with golden symbols at the hilt. Althena and Salazar nodded appreciatively.

“This was given to me by the duke, but ‘tis quite heavy and unyielding for all its beauty. Wealthier families make them to their specifications and I am thinking of perhaps, having the same done for me in our world.” He slid the sword back in place thoughtfully. “When they battle in wars, it is man to man with only the more skilled soldier surviving. However, in petty disagreements, you duel only to disarm and whoever disarms the other wins! It is almost like a dance and I for one, thoroughly enjoy it!”

“Is that how you got that scar?” Althena asked pointedly. “From ‘dancing'?”

“Why yes, I didn't duck in time and was grazed by the point of a sword.”

“I can fix that for you!” Althena cried out, jumping to her feet.

“Oh no, no, no! I wear this as a badge of honor!” Godric said, thumping his chest.

Salazar shot him a look, raising his brows. “But uh, I would actually appreciate some help with the bruising.” Godric said quickly, catching the look of disappointment on Althena's face. “Those came from a man who chose not to accept his defeat-I turned him into the boar he was.”

Sighing, Salazar refilled his mead. “Godric, transfiguration as punishment? Truly?”

“I'll turn him back!” Godric protested. “He's perfectly safe. It's not the season for hunting boar.”

“Yes it is, Godric,” Althena said. “They are always hunted near the start of fall.”

Salazar snorted into his mead.

“I thought you were getting me a poultice, my dear?” Godric said, flushing slightly.

Althena beamed and scurried off to the back of the cottage where she kept her potions supplies.

“Still...?” Godric asked, lowering his voice.

Salazar's eyes flashed angrily. “Yes, still not much magic.” His shoulders drooped in resignation. “Things were getting terrible for her at home. Father could barely look at her and mother began calling her ‘the muggle' when speaking of her.”

Godric winced. “But surely, she cannot be a...well, I mean, she is talented in potions!”

Salazar took a long drink and nodded. “Yes, she is. I brought her out here to see if maybe, her magic would be better formed aware from the pressures of mother and father and at times, she is able to produce a weak bit of it but never enough to be on her own in our world. As you've said, potions are her gift. She brews almost as well as I and understands the ingredients in a far more complex way than I do.”

Godric placed a hand on his friend's shoulder. “She is lucky to have you.”

“Truly, I am lucky to have her. I have spent better years with her, teaching and learning from her, than I have elsewhere.”

“Dear friend, that is precisely why I came!” Godric's eyes lit up. “Rowena had the idea that we should start a school for wizards and witches! A place where they would be free to learn without fear of persecution and outside threats.”

Salazar looked taken aback. “A school? Of magic?”

“Yes, I just said that.”

“It would never work,” Salazar said but despite this, a look of wonder came over the usually strict face.

“It can and it will! Rowena and Helga have already found a place. It is now only a matter of building and gathering students.”

“Parents would never stand for it. We have always educated our own. Why would they entrust us with their children?”

Godric laughed. “How could they not? Salazar Slytherin, inventor of several household potions and youngest Head of the League of Potioneers! Rowena Ravenclaw, writer of the most revered Charms scroll to date-she and our dear Helga Hufflepuff are esteemed for their magical inventions.”

“And what do you bring to the table?” Salazar asked innocently, his voice light and teasing.

Godric grinned. ”Need I really demean myself with the mouth of a braggart?”

Salazar stood in imitation of Godric and said in a loud, impressive voice: “Godric Gryffindor, unrivaled duelist, protector of the weak and champion of all!” Salazar laughed. “I read you last scroll on Human Transfiguration by the way-wonderful! It seems you truly succeeded in realizing your childhood dreams from what I hear.”

“People exaggerate,” Godric said, smiling.

“But of course!” Salazar shook his head. His light mood vanished as he thought again of the school. “Yes, we can all admit that we have our talents. But still, I just don't know if a school is such a good idea in present times. I would not like to put any of our kind in danger.”

“Yes, times are hard,” Godric said darkly. “But, think of it, Salazar! A place far, far away from muggles with young wizards and witches educated on all the ways to not only survive but thrive in the world!”

“And Althena?”

“Of course, she's welcome to come.”

“Godric, she told me the other day that she intends to try life among the muggles.”

“But she's a witch!” Godric protested.

“No, I'm not,” interjected a soft voice. Salazar and Godric turned to see Althena, grasping a steaming bowl in her hand. “But, that is no issue to me anymore.”

She set the bowl on the table and wet a small cloth with its contents. Gently, she dabbed at Godric's face and almost immediately, he felt the skin loosen and the pain lessen.

“I say you are,” sighed Godric, closing his eyes. “What you are doing now-that is magic! Why, your hands are magically delicious!”

“Easy!” snarled Salazar. “You may be my dearest friend but that does not mean I will allow this blatant flirting with my sister!”

Godric kept his eyes unopened. “Althena, do I flirt with you?”

“Shamelessly,” she giggled.

“I love an honest woman! All right, Salty, I'll take her off your hands and marry her. She's quite the charming young woman, shame about the looks but charming regardless.”

Althena giggled harder as Salazar, outraged, looked round the table for something to hurl at his friend.

“You know I couldn't marry you, Godric.” Althena said. “Your children would be at risk of being like me.”

“All the more reason to marry you then,” Godric said firmly. “There's no finer woman anywhere.”

She shook her head. “I've decided never to marry. I heard you both speaking about the school, I think it is a great idea. We need something like that for our world. I think you two would be great teachers, especially you Sal.”

“I am not going,” Salazar said, scowling. “I enjoy staying here, with you. We work well together.”

“Sal, I love you but it is time that you went back out into the world. You are one of the best wizards there are and I know you'd make the most wonderful teacher! You managed to pull some semblance of magic out of your squib sister, with true wizards and witches, you'll do much more I'm sure!”

“Don't call yourself that,” Godric said gruffly.

Althena shrugged. “Why not? It's the truth. I've made my peace with it, Godric.”

“I do not like this, Althena,” Salazar said quietly. “Magical folk and innocent muggles alike are being murdered in the name of this new religion. Burned or drowned at the pleasure of cruel men. You may not be fully magical, but neither are you a muggle. For the love you hold for me, can you not proceed with this idea? Can you not stay here, where you will be protected?”

“Oh Sal! For the love you hold for me, can you not see that it is only half a life I live here? I rely on you for everything and I am not free to come and go as I please. I would like to meet others, even if they are muggles and perhaps, I can be of help to their communities. I cannot use magic but perhaps I can be a healer to them. They also do potions do they not?”

“They call them medicines,” Godric said absentmindedly.

Salazar and Althena ignored this.

Salazar sighed and rubbed his eyes. He could not look at Althena. He saw in his mind's eyes her first steps and how he had been the one to coax them from the short, baby legs. He remembered her tears when he had gone off on his first wizard's journey and then, the relief on her young face when he had come back home and taken her from their parents for good. She was as a daughter to him. Althena was the rare kind of spirit that tempered his own. Could he truly be so selfish to keep her? She was now of age, was it fair to keep her prisoner when she longed for her freedom? Her independence?

Finally, Salazar nodded and Althena, instead of whooping with joy as he had expected, stepped quietly forward and leaned down to embrace him.

“This is the right choice, Sal.” She whispered. “Trust in me and trust that you have taught me well.”
