I don't like to read fics until they are finished. I feel jaded by a lot of good authors abandoning their stories or not putting up sequels when its essential to the plot.


** I tell myself that I'm only going to read complete stories. Then, I find a fic that's 150k words, 31 chapters and figure that the author just didn't mark it complete, and I go on to find that it's unique with great characterization and all the rest. Then I read it, and in an author's note the author is talking about how their updates will be biweekly and should be consistent but it hasn't been updated since 2012. I'm not bitter or anything, it's not like that happened to me yesterday.

** All the best fanfic is unfinished or abandoned; I'll take a quality abandoned fic over an "okay" completed fic any day.

I don't really think that any of the fanfiction "greats" are complete. There are some okay complete fics, but the really amazing fics--Forging the Sword, Ectomancer, Boy Who Lived, On His Way to Greatness, etc.--are all WIP or abandoned.

*** That's not quite right. There are more great abandoned fics than great completed fics only because the proportions are skewed in the first place. Completed fics tend to be better overall, mostly because a writer than can actually finish his stories is often better at writing in general.

I'll counter your point with A Black Comedy, The Lie I've Lived, Wastelands of Time, Song of the Trees, etc.

**** I wouldn't call Wastelands of Time or TLIL complete, as many plot threads are left hanging. Also I wouldn't call TLIL good either, on the basis of the truly awful HP/FD "romance".

Not a huge fan of Black Comedy (juvenile crack) or Song of the Trees (annoying characters, little magic) either.

***** I'd call TLIL good, but not so much complete. It seems to me like an "I'm tired of writing this, let's wrap it up" type of ending. But I really enjoyed it up to then. But then again the fics with different/more triwizard tasks are my absolute favorite, so I may be biased in its favor.

*** Ok I'll check out these abandoned fics but I dunno I have weird issues. I need to complete things games movies or books. Completionist here.

This is a good point. I'd almost rather an author leave a good story incomplete rather than rushing through writing poor quality final chapters

** Normally I only search for finished stories, the Song of Ice and Fire Series is more than enough to completely fill the waiting game that it is for the next book. Also Half-life 3.

** I do this. A few experiences reading a great story and following updates only for two years to pass without an update messed with me. I also don't want the heartbreak of getting really into a story and reaching where the author left off without any kind of closure. Even if it's a sequel, I'll try and peek at reviews or the author's bio to see if it was at least reaching an ending, so I can decide if it's worth it (that's what I did with Green Gecko's work).

I know I'll probably miss some great things, but honestly, it just isn't worth it to me. Nightmare of Futures Past actually updated a few weeks ago, which means it might actually end up finished eventually. Once it is, I'll gladly read it all. That goes for all WIPs. I don't want to read to where it's currently at, then get strung along. I respect the writers, but I'm not gonna pretend to be a patient person.

** I too only read completed fics. I often don't start watching TV series until they are part way through too, so I don't forget what's happened by the time the next bit comes out.

** I used to do that, and then I realized that there are too many /good/ unfinished fics.

*What matters is the experience.* If you have fun /while/ reading it, that's all that should matter! If it's not finished? Oh well - at least you enjoyed amazing writing and a great plot.

** It's a bittersweet experience to be sure, but very subjective. As [[/u/Taure]] says, a lot of quality fics are abandoned. Their unfinished status doesn't diminish the high quality work that the author put into it. But as I said everyone will feel differently about it.

** My problem is that +many+ some authors forget to mark stories +as completed+ properly. So if I filter +by that+ heavily I cut my potential reading material dramatically when a significant amount of it may be totally acceptable.

**** I take the 'many authors' portion of my statement back now that I have checked a bit. However, I did find one just so I could continue the internet tradition of trying to prove people wrong.

Plus i've already finished reading most of the good finished stories so i gotta take what i can get.
