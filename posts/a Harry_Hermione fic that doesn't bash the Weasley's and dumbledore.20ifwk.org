*** Isn't Vox Corporis Dumbledore bashing? I thought I noticed that when I tried to start it.

And I second the recommendation for Unlike a Sister. The best romance story I have ever read.

*** Have to agree with [[/u/awesomeguyandbob][u/awesomeguyandbob]] and [[/u/flame7926][u/flame7926]]. "Unlike a sister" is a wonderful romance story.

*** /Vox Corporis/ was... okay until Harry went to Hermione's for summer. I just couldn't buy it. I don't think Dumbledore would ever agree to that. It's also obvious in some parts that the writer is unfamiliar with certain aspects of canon. I don't mean the H/Hr relationship -- that's fine, whatever. But certain facts are just wrong. I also find it bizarre that this fic follows the films more than the actual books. I wouldn't mind if they used both as a reference point, but I can't get past that.

This is the best one shotof Harry/Hermione that I have ever read. Really really good and pretty canon. Other stories by this author is also quite good. I am a big fan of H/Hr too so I understand how you feel. :)

*** Good god... "Where's Daddy?"

I can remember every single time that I teared up because of something I read. This was the third.
