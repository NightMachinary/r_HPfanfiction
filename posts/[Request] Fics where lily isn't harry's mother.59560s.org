Stories where James isn't Harry's biological are fairly common, even beyond the stories where Snape is Harry's father. I'm just curious if there are any stories where the inverse is true.

I'm honestly not too concerned with quality, I'm just interested in the concept. Thanks for any help.

  Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts brings with it three friends who might just help him honour his biggest role models, a Slytherin rival in the form of one Evan Snape, and a mystery to be solved involving a small package hidden on the third floor. PS retelling set in the world where Lily Evans made different choices as a young girl, that ended up changing wizarding history.

** I did mention it on another post but I've read one where Harry is in fact Ron's twin brother and the real Harry Potter died at birth, James kidnapping said twin without Lily knowing.

I also will mention that I had written a Oneshot a while ago featuring Bellatrix as Harry's mother, set during a battle in the village near Hogwarts
