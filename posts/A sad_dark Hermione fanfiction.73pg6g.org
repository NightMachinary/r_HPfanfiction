I'm in a bad place right now and need something sad because I just can't read anything happy. I love Hermione with the twins (both or one alone) but I really don't care if it's anybody else or noone at all as long as it's neither Ron nor Harry in any romantic way. I don't care in which era, as long as Hermione is the protagonist. I also don't care if everyone dies, there just can't be any funerals. Happy ending or sad ending doesn't matter to me - but there should be an ending. This is pretty specific, I know, but maybe someone can help me here.

***** Fair point.

It's not much of a defense, but I had to change the ending to comply with the site guidelines (I wrote the story for a contest there).

I agree about the underwhelming ending. Better (and more poetic) would have been for Harry to be prevented from entering the portal at the end. And to have twisted the knife in the last section a bit more.

** Enough with H/TR or H/LV, how about something just as horrible, but in a different way:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455)

I actually think the ending to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971), is bloody depressing too. Or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12503328/1/The-Day-the-Magic-Died][The Day the Magic Died]], linkffn(12503328).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), a HP/SG1/SW crossover by Darth Marrs, is freaking dark with genocides occurring every 5 chapters, and it seems to be heading to an end of Arthurian proportion.

  I was reading a story of the non-magicals deciding they weren't going to take it anymore - just exactly too late to really help. It fit a bunny that I had long considered. This is the start of a crossover - but I didn't write beyond this point. Anyone who wants to write a story based on this is welcome. This is done for my part.

  Hermione's parents were killed by Death Eaters just before the fall of Voldemort and she was adopted by Severus Snape as part of his reparations to the post-war Wizarding World. Hermione grows up with a distant father, a library full of Dark magic, and the knowledge that Voldemort has taken away her one chance for a happy, loving family. With a father who is the Head of Slytherin House, a Muggle-born being sorted into it isn't all that surprising - even if nobody knows she is one.However, her plans to steal the next generation of Voldemort's supporters, usurp him, and take his throne as the Darkest Lady of the century, might be a little surprising. But only a little.The fact that Dumbledore doesn't bother to stop her is possibly the most surprising of all.

  The true time-turner was slammed savagely into Hermione's throat. It shattered against her neck, bits of glass and gold piercing into her skin. The last thing she saw before blackness consumed her was a plume of metallic dust and vitreous fragments, tiny prisms dancing behind her eyelids. (In which Hermione accidentally ends up in 1950, pitted against an ascending Dark Lord in his prime, caught in the entanglement of pureblood politics, dark magic, and Tom Riddle's interest)

  'It's not just Death Eaters that kill Muds. After the Second World War, the Muggle civil rights movements got started. Black rights, and feminism, and gay rights. We -- wizards -- we never had the sixties, because we just kept replaying the war, over and over again: Grindelwald in the forties, then Voldemort in the seventies, then Voldemort again in the nineties. I just hope this time it's really finished, and we can sort out our own fucking house.'Hermione is back at school after a summer in the Muggle world, and everything is changing. But getting closer to Harry doesn't get her any closer to the war - until she's unexpectedly enrolled in the Order of the Phoenix, and meets Hestia Jones, the founder of Mud Pride.

** /Without her letter/ is strangely written, but may fit your mood.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11698239/3/Without-Her-Letter]])

As for /The Anti-Heroin/, it is a very excellent fic, but still in writing. Big enough for a long time of reading though.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

  "Whatever you decide to say, make it believable." Hermione Granger learned to avoid the hard questions years ago. To her, Hogwarts is a relief: a new school with new people who have no knowledge of her past...only, they keep asking the hard questions. And it's getting harder for Hermione to maintain the lies. Featuring: Mentor!Snape and Slytherin!Hermione. Over 90k hits!
