Preferably slash but not necessary. I like the fics the most where Harry ends up adopting Tom, but any fics where he goes back in time through whatever means and tries to be the person Tom needed/change how he develops and reign him in a little are appreciated! I also enjoy fics where Tom is older but not quite full Dark Lord yet and Harry interferes then. Or stories where Harry ends up at Wool's with Tom - /love/ those.

Bonus if Harry goes back to change Tom and Tom changes Harry instead - cause those fics are great. Love a dark!Harry.

Can I get some recs please?

Summary:

When Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary he does not write 'Hello.' He does not write anything at all. He draws. Tom Riddle falls in love with the artwork.

--------------

Sketch by sketch, drawing by drawing, the ink Harry pours into the diary manifests as creations in Tom's monochrome world.

Harry is big uwu energy and Tom learns to face his mortality and faults through Harry's thought provoking art.

3) To the Waters and the Wild by Paimpont Summary: Flying back from Godric's Hollow, Hagrid accidentally drops baby Harry over a wild forest. Harry is raised by rebel fairies until his Hogwarts letter arrives. The Dark Lord is in for a surprise... HP/LV romance.

4) To Kill You With a Kiss by Paimpont Summary: After Dumbledore's death, Harry searches for answers in the Pensieve. But something goes wrong. Trapped inside a memory, Harry finds himself back at Hogwarts in 1945 where he meets an 18 year old Tom Riddle teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts.

Tom changes for the better with Harry's influence

5) Little Prince on B612 Run_of_the_mill Summary: In the back of Knockturn Alley, there is a small Apothecary where Tom meets a mysterious young man who draws him a tiny sheep in a crate with three little holes. Tom takes it home. Does this mean Tom is no longer a dull, drab, adult? A/N: This isn't a retelling of the Little Prince. It's simply the story of two people who read and loved the Little Prince and allowed themselves to be influenced by it. Because of Harry Tom is better to his friends and just generally a better person.

7) Heir Apparent MonsieurClavier Summary: When a Voldemort in his thirties encounters a time-travelling, seventeen-year-old Harry Potter, he makes a dangerous---and hilarious---assumption. He assumes that Harry is his son. And his son, of course, deserves the very best.

The not quite “son” of Voldemort drastically changes for the better very funny and touching story

  “What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said, stalking closer, “is you.” He marched forward, backing Harry up until he was pinned to the cool wall of the common room. “Do you know why?”

  “No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely pleased. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro was a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

  He leaned closer, “You look at me like you want to stab me.” After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.

  Harry gets bored of immortality and feels like he's losing his sanity. Death points him in the direction where he'll find the person who can keep him together. But when he finally finds his anchor, he didn't expect to feel incredibly possessive and protective where he all but constantly glomps poor little Tom (who fails to avoid growing fond of Harry).

  When 11-year-old Tom Riddle finally arrives at Platform 9 and ¾, he meets fifth-year Prefect Harry Evans, a Muggleborn Slytherin at the top of his year. Harry is everything that Tom wants to be---Harry knows exactly what it's like to be special, intelligent, and have no one understand you... Harry Potter, who has de-aged himself and gone back in time in order to guide Tom onto the right path, may find that his efforts to win Tom over have worked a little too well.

  A mysterious object in Bellatrix's vault sends Harry, Ron and Hermione spinning into the past and to a Hogwarts like none they know. Posing as students, Harry catches the eye of the Head Boy, Tom Riddle, who is nothing like the Voldemort of the future. He's charming and sly and manipulative; both brillant and deadly. It isn't long before they're tangled in a game more intricate than anything before. A game of heightened stakes, of tension, and the odds are stacked against Harry. With the threads of the future unravelling, can Harry make it out intact? And what is the cost, of truly getting close to Tom?

  When Hermione is sent back in time with a spell, she decides to use this to her advantage and kill Tom Riddle before he becomes Lord Voldemort. What follows will challenge everything she knew about herself, and everything she thought she knew about him. Eventually dark. Postwar AU.

  Harry is the Master of Death and Lord of Time through his joining of the three Hallows together. During a duel that wasn't going well, he jumps to the 1940's and has a talk with the true Master of Death. Can have prevent the destruction that will occur? Can he change Voldemort prevent him from becoming the darkest wizard of all time? Or will he be caught in Tom's web? Slash TMR/HP?
