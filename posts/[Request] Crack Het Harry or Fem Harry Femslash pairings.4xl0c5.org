I'm looking for Crack Het Harry pairings or Fem Harry Femslash stories, I enjoy Harmony as much as the next guy, but I also have a healthy enjoyment of Harry paired with other students out of left field. Harry/Parvati, Harry/Lavender (I actually quite enjoy this one), Harry/Tonks, Harry/Fleur, and so on.

What are fics you'd recommend with pairings like this? I would prefer longer stories (40k plus), but I wouldn't object to a one shot.


** Another bump for femslash.

** I like Harry/Luna on paper but those fics are usually failures.

This one by Jeconnais was amusing, though the pairing is very minor.

And of course, this one. Minor ship too, but fabulous fic.

**** I was pretty sure there was a Harry/Luna, though very minor. I might be mistaken, then. A very fun read indeed.
