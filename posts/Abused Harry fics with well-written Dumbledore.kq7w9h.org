Linkffn(The Guiltless by kilara25) is one of my favourite abused Harry fics. So much of that is because of its caring, clever and complex Dumbledore, while so many abused fics simply peg him as just a lemon-drop-loving cruel schemer. Any other fics that are similar with Harry abused or hurt in some way, and a more canon-like Albus? Happy for Snape to be part of it or not, either works. Thanks!


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux). Dumbledore doesn't appear often, and when he does, he mostly just engages Harry in philosophical debate, but it's one of my favourite interpretations of him in fanfic. Fair warning, the first story in the series is complete, but its sequel is abandoned.

*** Oh, and linkffn(Negligentia). It's about a Harry who's been neglected, rather than abused, but it hits all the same emotional beats.

  Six years after leaving Hogwarts, Harry Potter shares dinner with someone from his past and remembers some of the more important moments of his life. My take on the "brother of the boy who lived" story.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

  First in a series of canon-based stories, which will follow Harry Potter from the summer before COS through Hogwarts. When Harry returns to the Dursleys after the events of PS, his summer gets off to a terrible start. Albus intervenes, taking Harry back to the castle. Come see how multiple POVs and changing relationships slowly shape Harry's world! Mentorship; Training; Adventure.

  Harry is a Horcrux, isn't he? Hermione reads over what she has of her essay so far, ignoring the way her hands have started to shake. She circles some sentences here and there that she thinks might be stronger in a different part of the paper. Don't be silly. What a strange thought to have. Anyway.  Anyway.  During 6th year, Hermione has a realization that Harry is a Horcrux while doing some homework in the library. Things spiral out from there.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.
