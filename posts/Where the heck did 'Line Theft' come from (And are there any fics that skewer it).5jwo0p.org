You know, that concept that Political!Harry always pulls out of his hat to prosecute the Weasleys and take everything they own, because trying to get the last heir of a Noble House (another fanon invention) to marry your daughter by less-than-equitable means is right up there with the Unforgivable Curses.

Where on earth did this idea start? Who started the trend?

And, are there any fics that subvert the concept as viciously as possible? I just read a fic that had Romilda Vane being blackmailed into slavery using a threat of being accused of Line Theft, and I'm in a vengeful mood.


** line theft is something that dates back to ancient Rome, and probably way before that. It's still relevant these days, but it's under a new name.

If you mean in the Harry Potter fanfic world, I'm not sure who started it...

You'll find it used in a few Slytherin Harry and Political Harry fics. It could be in a few Founders Era fics as well.

** Line Theft has been (and is in some nations) a law against the hijacking of a noble line (and therefore its power, lands and wealth) by whatever means.

The closest offense resembling this I know of is fraud in combination with inheritance. In most of the fics featuring this, however, the offense is much closer to blackmail, deprivation of liberty and if it is close to our laws concerning substances that manipulate the mind, its also aggravated battery. Maybe one could even argue for the offense of enslavement.

To be honest, the use of love potion is one of the most terrifying aspects of the wizarding world.

*** Honestly, Harry could claim he was taking her as a concubine and the Vane family couldn't do anything unless the family was matriarchal and she was the heir.

That's the issue with fics using line theft because in the current age it's unheard of outside royalty and I seriously doubt any wizarding families are 'royalty'.

I mean, if you're talking about enslaving someone else with a Love Potion, then yes, I would consider that just as bad as Imperio'ing someone. That is effectively what you are doing anyway.
