** Now that one good meme post was made, [[/r/HPfanfiction]] has been assaulted by a number of lower quality memes that will truly unveil the personalities of its subscribers.

Seriously though - I don't understand it.

*** Who can truly say what depravity burns in the hearts of lesser men?

Dunno, just downvote and ignore. This one had a bit of photo editing, so points for effort, I guess?

Although, ironically, I have a small plot bunny where the Petunia sends Harry out in a snowstorm to get some food from the market. Naturally he freezes to death, but he gets resurrected by a wandering Yuki-Onna and gets raised by her, in essence becoming a blizzard.

** “Oh. Is this, um, Harry Potter? The, ah, wizard?” Her tone was apologetic, as though she were terribly afraid she would be insulting me. No, I thought. It's Harry Potter the, ah, lizard. Harry the wizard is one door down.

  A story about Harry in Slytherin house wielding the elder wand and the powers of an elemental. Features annoying Weasley's, an OFC, a flawed but good Dumbledore, an indifferent Snape and lots and lots of twists.
