I had made a post about wanting to write Harry being a martial artist but I don't think I was going about it the right way, I think that I want A Harry that becomes very combat heavy I got the idea from mortal Kombat. The idea is for Harry a bit below average in typical magic, thus he turns to an alternative way, I wanted to know, Do the Aurors go through physical training and if they do how would be different from what I'm trying to do with Harry.


** I have a bunch to say on this, but given the tone of response so far, I'd say folks aren't into the concept as presented. Probably because you referenced source material that suggests that Harry will be learning 'gamer-wank crossover style' Kung Fu.

I think the books have very physical fights, and the wizarding population demonstrates a high level of durability (or at least repair-ability) such that transfiguring your enemies into immobile piles of goo is considered vaguely funny and not at all worrisome, long-term.

I guess my short-answer recommendation would be to think of all the ways and times that the books show someone (particularly Hagrid) being kinda superhuman, and riff on that. Keep in mind that Harry isn't a genius reincarnation of anybody, so if he's inventing it himself, it'll be clumsy but surprisingly effective. If he's learning it from some other master, assume that Tom Riddle and Albus Dumbledore have known about it for a while and have a direct tactical counter for it in most situations (disapparating being the most obvious solution).

** *Harry Potter and the Sun Source* linkffn(4532363) Has a Harry that was picked up off the Dursley's doorstep and raised by a society that pretty much started training him as soon as he could walk.

Warning: You may be offended by the attitudes in this story if you haven't read the Destroyer series books or seen the films, and might still be offended if you have. It has some very tongue in cheek satire that may not have stood the tests of time (source material was written in the 70's, I think?) I had no problem with it, but again, that's me. Your mileage may vary.

  This is an extremely AU crossover fic that asks the question what might have happened if Petunia Dursley hadn't found a young Harry Potter sleeping on her doorstep on the morning of the 2nd of November 1981. After all, Dumbledore was a bit careless with

*** Well because not everyone does things the same, its magic what's wrong with experimenting with different things. Beside the point of my story is to show someone who is at a disadvantage rise above that. I understand where you are coming from, it would be a combination of both fighting and magic.

*** Well, swords are sharper than sticks.

That said, considering that the poster cited Mortal Kombat as their inspiration for the whole “martial arts” thing, I think we are supposed to think about something at least somewhat supernatural in regards to the term “martial arts” here, maybe not to the extent of bending in the Avatar universe (which is more magic realised through martial arts than martial arts proper, as far as this comparison goes), but at the very least something you'd expect from a Wuxia movie (where people can jump 20 metres down without risking any injury because they are martial artists).

*** And I have yet to see a well-done one... They are usually a very good indicative of being rather mediocre in both writing and plot.
