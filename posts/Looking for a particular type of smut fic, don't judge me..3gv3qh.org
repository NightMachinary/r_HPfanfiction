Basically, fics that deal with the grooming of Harry at an early age to turn him into an absolute slut.

Throwaway because I'm a terrible human being.

Also, where do you fellow perverts go for your smut needs?

[[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/]]

and

[[http://archiveofourown.org/]]

are pretty good, but are there any others I don't know about?

*** Indeed. As for OPs request, most of the questionable stuff I've stumbled upon was on AO3, including:

- The Marauders never died and are, apparently, a gang of twisted pedos who rape Harry 24/7 while also pimping him out to every wizard alive (including a very graphic encounter with Arthur Weasley who's thing is to pretend that Harry is Bill)

- Rose has a childhood crush on Harry that never goes away, so on her 17th birthday she "seduces" him (Harry is divorced, as if it would be too immoral otherwise). She of course gets pregnant after the first time, but it's TOTALLY NOT INCEST GUIZ BECAUSE THEY DON'T SHARE ANY ACTUAL BLOOD SO IT'S COOL. Hermione is ok with it for some retarded reason and Ron is "an asshole" for having a problem with his daugther banging her own uncle. As a side plot, Teddy Rapes Lily II at some kind of family getogether, this leads nowhere and is just an excuse for Lily to have emotional trauma and for Harry to be all MAN by beating the shit out of Teddy.

- Various Harry/Lily timetravel/ressurection fics that are just plain weird ("My son is such a powerful wizard and magical power is tied to libido now because the plot says so, better let him tittyfuck me so he doesn't grow weak... you know, for the plot.")

In short, this fandom needs to seek help, urgently.

****** You know, I'd hoped this would be at least good on a technical level.

It isn't. Things manifest and disappear according to the needs of the author without a grounding in reality, and it seems like they had a couple of hats stuffed with adjectives for sexual organs and acts, and just plucked them out at random, like that ever works.

It's a poor excuse for the mutilation of the english language, and it's a poor excuse for writing porn that tries to be passionate and reads like a sixth grader who snuck a few quick peeks at the Penthouse Letters section in the supermarket and is now trying to replicate it.

Thanks for linking it though, I haven't had that much fun with a trainwreck in quite a while.

** [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories][hpfanficarchive]] - given their 'no guy-slash' rule, you can compare it to a fraternity porn library at this point

[[http://www.ficwad.com/category/19][Ficwad]] - a messy and ill-supported site, it nonetheless remains active for the ethically unrestrained. I like their voting system for the per-chapter aspect, and there are some great stories I've found there and nowhere else
