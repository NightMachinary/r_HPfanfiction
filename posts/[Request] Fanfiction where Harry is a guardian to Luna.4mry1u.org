As the title says, I've been looking for a story where Harry plays the sort of older brother or even father figure to Luna Lovegood. I've only seen one or two stories do this so far and that whole relationship isn't quite important within the stories themselves.

  Choices. Intent. These things matter, their consequences extend beyond the scope of his magic. These things bring about a change within Hadrian Potter, a third year Slytherin. When vague choices are given, when intent is less than clear, what sort of consequences can that bring about? Which choice and what intent will change him the most? And in turn change those close to him.

  His second year in a world he never knew existed, his second year in Hogwarts, his second year in Slytherin. The Brown Book is not the only secret in Hogwarts he keeps close to his chest.

** linkffn(Deprived) This one's really good but it's totally abandoned. The relationship between Harry and Luna is really pleasant, however it isn't the main focus of the fic.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway, yet miraculously he lives. Even so, the question of how remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
