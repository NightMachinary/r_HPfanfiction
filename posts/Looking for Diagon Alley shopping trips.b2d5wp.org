I know Diagon Alley shopping trips are hated by a lot of people in this sub, but I am hankering for some stupidness right now. Give me your most meandering, useless, crack-y shopping trips :D


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560/chapters/35877282#workskin][Chapter 2]] of my story, In the Bleak Midwinter, has a shopping trip, but it's not completely useless. At least, it's no more useless than the rest of the story.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/4/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Chapters four]] through six of HPMOR are fun, especially Harry getting fitted for robes next to Draco.

*** Wouldn't call them useless, though. Like literally everything in HPMoR except parts of the /Ender's Gale/ pastiches, those chapters are packed stock-full of foreshadowing.

Meandering, kinda.

(Cracky and fun, they definitely are.)
