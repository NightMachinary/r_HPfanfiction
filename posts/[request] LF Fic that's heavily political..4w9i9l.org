I recently finished sum of their parts as well HP and the Darks Rise. And I thoroughly enjoyed the subtlety and especially the political maneuvering involved.

So my request is for fics that lean heavily into wizarding politics or large scale plotting on the protagonist side. Delenda Est(the first half) is another good example.

Your assistance is appreciated should it be offered.

*edited to add a polite thank you.


** linkffn(A Necessary Gift by cosette-aimee) has a political!Voldemort etc.

linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5) has all sides very carefully managing their image with the populace in a bloody guerrilla war; and other works by [[/u/Starfox5]] are pretty political.

In linkï¬€n(Harry Crow by Robst)... there's that very political scene where Harry menaces Dumbledore with a sword on the floor of the Wizengamot, IIRC.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** A Beast's Virtue by Arliene linkao3(2526410)

I know that most people see the hp/lv and run away, however there is no slash content so far (32 chapters in). There is NO flirting, kissing or admiring looks. Running away just because of that tag will cause you to miss out on a major political fic.

Voldemort is not bat shit insane, however he is still a ruthless murderer and manipulative bastard. Harry is a lot more clever than in canon. Hope you read and like it.

  For the Ancient and Noble House of Black, the height of power marked the beginning of its decline. A game of politics, for personal gain, for the good of everyone... but using Voldemort's rise to prevent a war was a gamble.-- Winner of DLPs January Contest.

** *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), is super heavy on politics, intrigues, strategies, and tactics. The author applied the 36 Stratagems multiple time.

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005), gets really complicated after chapter 8.

*The Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(9863146), has lots of politics from year 1 to year 3.
