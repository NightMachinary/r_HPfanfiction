A good example of “Political fic” for me would be “Emperor”, a big chunk of the story is action but it also shows how Harry slowly climbs the ranks in the military and then slowly taking over the government. Also it doesn't just have to be Harry, it could be any other character like: Dumbledore, Voldemort, Hermione or anybody. As long as it's well written I'd be pretty happy. If you kind readers could recommend fics like that I'll be grateful


** If you like "Emperor", chances are you will also like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994). Besides the heavy military aspect, politics occupy tons of screen times too. Dumbledore, Harry, Hermione, and Sirius will all have their moments.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
