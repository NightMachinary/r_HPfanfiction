do you guys know any fics in which Fleur had enough of Ginny and Hemione's behaviour towards her?


** At beginning of HBP, none of them knew Fleur's real character. They and Molly all assumed she was some kind of dizzy airhead. Fleur herself didn't give up an exactly good impression (for us readers too). She put down Hogwarts, treated Ginny like a child, and kept calling Harry "leetle boy" and "silly boy". Harry himself was fuming.

I would say Fleur handled their animosity very gracefully in canon. Then during Astronomy Tower Battle, when she finally showed her true self, their attitude changed immediately. That's IMO the best way she could stand up for herself.

*** To be fair, gracefully understates the animosity dished out towards her. The way the women treated her is very bad. One scene that particularly hit me was the Christmas scene where they felt she didn't even warrant a jumper. I like the Weasleys but that was really disappointing.

** I am sure she is aware of the women's attitude towards her. She knows what effect she has on men and how that might bother women but she sucks it up out of love for Bill. She stands up for herself gracefully when Molly suggests that the wedding might be off and deliberately avoids causing a scene earlier on so as not to put more gas on the fire.
