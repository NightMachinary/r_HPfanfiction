are there any fics where harry suffers consequences for his adventures like he burned a man to death first year and nothing no therapy no nightmares then second year he was bitten by a basilisk and the venom was inside him yes phoenix tears healed him but seriously unless they are a cure all there has to be some lasting damage

third year over exposure to dementors

fourth any of the tasks

fifth year the damn blood quill

like there are plenty that have him suffer ptsd or just have him break but i haven't seen too many about the physical consequences other than mentioning scars


** I'm writing a fic where Harry was blinded by the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets.
