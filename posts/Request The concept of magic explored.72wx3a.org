Are there any stories the explore the concept of magic more? And maybe Potions as well. I've always been curious on the different spells and how they go about to knowing what they can do and stuff like that.

Any rating is fine, am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash.

Any Era is fine, anyone can be the main character.

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

No Weasley or Dumbledore bashing.

No Crossovers.

I don't like Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, but if it's believable enough I'll allow it.

I don't want Harry to be super smart or super powerful here, I just want the story to be about character or characters exploring magic more.

For instance the spells are in Latin, would it be just as strong to say it in French, in Chinese, in Indian language? ect extra. Stuff like that.


** Two off the top of my head are linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8215565/1/Knowledge-is-Useful-But-Power-is-Power]]) and of course linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality]])

** Linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) - The best look into nature of potioneering I've seen so far in a fic.

[[http://tinyurl.com/jkc2qeu][Alexandra Potter]] - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in a more magical Hogwarts. It focuses on school life and author's variation on magic system. Only the first year is complete, but it stands on its own and theoretically, there is a new version planned. With theoretically being the key word here.

Original Description:

#+begin_quote
  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

** If you don't mind complete AU's then you might want to check out the Alexandia Quick series by Inverarity. Since it's exploring the wizarding world in the states it comes complete with a whole separate school, it's own unique creatures, and an interesting approach to magic. The idea of 'doggle-verse' introduced early on was a personal favorite of mine, but the story does have no strong canon connects and is more of a 'inspired by' story than a fanfic.

The pre-hogwarts fic It's Green by Doodled 93 explores magical tattoos and some plant magic if I recall, but Harry has yet to really step into hogwarts so the exploration of magic is somewhat limited even if he's a precocious child.

Harry Potter & the Problem of Potions gives Harry a fascination with potions and eventual apprenticeship with Snape without taking away the man's bitter nature, and the idea of some of the candies and original potions where interesting, though I felt the explanations a bit lacking. First story is complete.

The Art of Self-Fashioning by Lomonaaeren is an AU where Harry has an obsession with transfiguration, especially of the human/animal variety. Well written and complete.

A Lightnight's tale by Riddle_Master_101 I remember being enjoyable but it only covers year one and might not be quite what you're looking for.

The Spellmaker by SonnyGietzel gives Harry an obsession with Latin pre-hogwarts that leads to interesting results. The fanfic is tagged harry/tom but as far as I remember they haven't even met yet, so I have no idea how the author plans to make that happen lol

** I have a pretty fleshed-out idea of HP lore which I intend to use in my /Sorcerer Stones/ story, but it hasn't /really/ come up yet. Point is, it's from Voldemort's perspective, and Voldemort knows a whole lot about how magic works. If you want, I could discuss some of my ideas here outside of narrative.

Also, linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) has a very good system of spellcrafting as the focus.
