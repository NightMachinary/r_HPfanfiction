Basically what it sounds like what would you change about Hermione's story in the books? Harry would still be the MC and the boy who lived the main beats of the story and overall plot would remain the same. Only Hermione specific beats can be changed. Her friendships, her romances, her stand out moments her house etc. For example she doesnt have to set snape on fire in the first book but he still needs to be suspected as jinxing Harry.

Keep in mind that the story is still from Harry's perspective and and she still has the same strengths and flaws at the start.

Aka she's still very interested in the magical world, good at deciephering puzzles and logical things, and good ay noticing small details. She's bad with emotions both handling her own and perceiving how others feel about her ( shes accidentally insensitive she gets frazzled under stress she lashes out etc) this is also true for magic. Emotional tied or interpertive stuff ( divination flying patronus) is not what she best at. Rule based stuff ( Charms potions transfiguration) she is good at . Not innovative ( never made new spells or potions or improved anything) but creative logical application of ideas and problem solving skills etc

She can end up being different from canon but any change you make has to be some sort of new character growth you would have to show over the book timeline and events from Harry's pov

So what would you make her story?


** I think the main flaw in Hermione's arc in the books is that she doesn't ever really have a moment of growth in the way Harry or Ron do. The boys both, over the course of the series, make stupid mistakes and hurt other people, and then either realize their misdeed or get called on it by another character, and then grow. Not so with Hermione, who, even when she is wrong, is right.

As a quick example of this, consider PoA. There are two events in particular I have in mind. The first is when Harry receives the Firebolt and Hermione reports it to McGonagall because she expects it's probably from Sirius Black. The three have a tiff over this and Harry and Ron refuse to talk to Hermione until Hagrid tells them what bad friends they're being and they forgive her. The second is when Scabbers is missing, assumed dead, in that same book, and she and Ron are fighting because she doesn't really care about how it affects him. In both of these circumstances, Hermione was /right/ -- the firebolt *was* sent by Sirius Black, and Crookshanks was *right* to chase Scabbers. However, the ways in which she mishandled these situations, and was wrong in them -- namely, by not understanding or caring about the emotions of others -- are never addressed, she never grows, and her techinical correctness about both events feels like the narrative pardoning her her faults.

So, if I were to change her arc at all, it would be to give her some sort of comeuppance followed by growth into a more empathetic character. Since it doesn't seem likely she would realize this about herself, it would probably have to be in the form of being called out by Harry or Ron, or perhaps her parents. Prime places to insert such a scene would be with regards to her treatment of Luna, who she always disdains (this was an arc Harry underwent in OotP, from thinking Luna was nuts to understanding that she can be odd and awkward and still the only person you want to talk to after your godfather dies), or perhaps her treatment of Lavender and Ron in HBP (violence and verbal cruelty as an expression of jealousy is not a good look, even if Ron and Lavender were not a wonderful match), or her memory-wiping of her parents in DH.

I don't really have a preference of which of these to have it happen about, but obviously doing one earlier would effect later events. I just wish she had had a chance to show character growth in the same way the other main characters did. The fact that by the end of DH she didn't kinda makes her feel less complete, or less central to the books than Harry and Ron, which is a bit of a snub imo, and makes me wish for more.

So that'd be my thought! What about you, OP?

*** Honestly I have the same exact problem. And what really frustrates me is it sounds like a very interesting narrative. For her to struggle with relationships and learn to become better at understanding others, expressing herself and interpersonal relationships would be a great arc thats not the most common. I wish it was in canon or at least more fanfic. I'd love to hear what specific changes you'd make. Personnally id start with Hermione not instantly becoming friends after the troll incident.

Over the years, she would risk her life and liberty again and again in defence of her right to magic. It's not inconsistent that she considers expulsion from Hogwarts a fate worse than death.

******* Yeah, it's nothing magical. It's centuries of conditioning and more or less breeding that's left the house elves with deeply ingrained instincts and culture to serve. Dobby is an oddity in that he doesn't feel beholden to that culture, but rather to heroes (and himself, to a slight extent) instead. Even Dobby still suffers from the ingrained instincts though - once he's free he wants to keep working, he just wants it on his terms. He even haggled for less pay and less time off.

As far as S.P.E.W goes it's something that would take generations itself to achieve true success. If Hermione were to make a true empathic attempt at achieving anything with it, it'd start off with treatment of house elves instead of freeing them. Once house elves actually accept that abuse by their owners isn't acceptable, then the issue of paying them can come around. After that freedom could be considered, but the elves would more or less become contracted servants at that point rather than truly free. It's a good stepping point for slowly making them equal members of society, though.

********** Oh I agree with that. I think we were on different pages here, sorry, my bad (I blame posting late without properly reading). Trying to free the elves like she did was unattainable and counterproductive in canon, which was the point Rowling was trying to make at the time. Her heart was in the right place.

The issue is even with it being only psychological after the elves are freed, having the elves decide to drink themselves to death is not an ideal solution. It's not just the stigma, but something has them bound to obey until they're freed. Then it's just conditioning.

But her trying to give elves she didn't own clothes was detrimental to her entire campaign and frankly was disgustingly naive and short-sighted.

**** Actually, house elves aren't a good example, because they are so thoroughly controlled by their owners that their expressed wishes have little to no moral weight. They have to do and say whatever they are ordered to do and say.

The fact that Hogwarts elves are probably treated better than average only mildly alters that. Winky makes it clear that their enslavement has permeated and infected their entire culture, and Dobby demonstrated that even after a year of freedom from masters he hated, his conditioning was still in effect, causing him to punish himself for criticising them.

"House elves don't want to be free" is a very weak and suspect argument.

  Lists had never failed Hermione before. So when her feelings for Ron get out of hand, it's only natural for her to write a list to clear her mind. She would come up with a list of boys most objectively compatible with her, detail the reasons why, and choose someone from the list to serve as a distraction. Of course, she never dreamed that her notes would all magically get sent out. (Inspired by To All The Boys I've Loved Before)

*** I think part of it is that due to her position (the booksmart of the trio), she has to be right on a lot of things to act as exposition. But I'm not sure I agree with you on her never making stupid mistakes or being wrong.

For example, she's got a much stronger regard for authority than the other two - that's much of what happens with the reports to McGonagall. She tends to believe what's in books - like with Lockhart, and believing him to be an amazing figure. She can't handle being surpassed/being disappointing - it's why she struggles with the Boggart in PoA and part of why she dislikes the Half-Blood Prince's book.

But you're right that she doesn't tend to be too wrong - and that's because she tends to play that role of convincing exposition. To an extent, the more wrong she gets, the less the reader will believe her words moving forward - so Rowling didn't want to make her wrong too often on that sort of exposition, particularly since most everything is supposed to be solved by the trio. Personally I'm not sure that I agree with you on her getting less comeuppance/growth than Ron, but that's just my impression of their characters - and the back half of the series is not always as clear to me in my memory.

I think the way someone could change her arc with the trio is to focus on a few changes. First, her relationship with authority. Yes, she does have some times she goes against it, but I'd like to see more situations where her going to the professors is actually a problem. I'd also want to see SPEW actually examined /reasonably/ and to have it more fleshed out than just played for laughs/annoying/happy slave trope. That could play well with the authority angle - all the authority figures seem happy/content with the enslaved house elves and push back against her efforts for greater representation (her initial goal was /very/ minor with the house elves, as a reminder).

The second change I'd slot in is to change the nature of her knowledge/role as exposition. She can be a bookworm of course, and able to dig up obscure aspects and spells and history and whatnot. But a way to make her /less/ always perfect is to have someone else fill that role for modern wizarding society - eg, if keeping the trio together, having /Ron/ be the one to be a window into the modern wizarding world, its mores, its laws, its celebrities, etc.

Viktor is 18 and Hermione is 15 in GoF, and both were students at the time, which is unusual but not unheard of in the real world between high school students. Based on what little we saw of the relationship, it was fairly innocent stuff, going to the library, a date to the Yule Ball, penpals over the summer.

Krum at the wedding is a full-grown adult man with a career, acting like an arrogant, entitled whinger. No thank you.

Depends on how annoying he is, but I doubt that Hermione wouldn't find a way to get the message across as she has a vicious side (eg everlasting howlers, or worse if he gets physically annoying/threatening).

Also, she does not have the benefit of being able to avoid McLaggen as they sleep a few yards from each other and generally have to spend a lot of time together.

But I also happen to agree with you that Hermione in GoF really couldn't have "snogged" Krum, maybe there was a small peck on the lips at the end of the night but not much more than that.

My theory/headcanon regarding that quote from HBP is that Ginny is simply trying to get on Ron's nerves (and maybe getting him to hurry up and admit he's attracted to Hermione), something that I feel would be totally in character for her. Maybe Hermione told her about the small kiss that I believe could have happened and she exaggerated it for effect or she heard it from a rumour and everyone just took it as a fact that they snogged.

Harry goes from Hogwarts at the end of GoF to Privet Drive, and stays there out of communication with everyone else until he gets his Ministry warning letter, which sets the hearing date at 12 August.

Ron and Hermione couldn't have been at Grimmauld Place for long, since by the time Harry arrives, they're still cleaning the house and making it livable. For all we know, Hermione /could/ have visited Krum during that time, since we never got a definitive confirmation that she had accepted his invitation.

************ We never get to see much Hermione's parents, but I find it very unlikely that the parents of a 14/15 year old girl would let her travel (alone or not) from the UK to Bulgaria to spend time with an 18 year old international sports star, especially when they already only have less than 4 months a year to spend with her. I doubt she even asked her parents about it, I know I wouldn't. Regarding the quote of her telling Harry about the invitation, the way I read it, all the blushing is because she is pretty excited that a hot guy just asked her to visit him abroad during the holidays and basically says that he loves her (even though they seem to have few interactions and at one point which I'm pretty sure was after the Yule Ball and maybe before the 2nd Task Hermione says that most of the time they spend together is just him staring at her in the library, that might be cute for established couples but for two people who barely know each other?). I'm pretty sure that after her hormones started calming down she realized that the trip really wouldn't work, maybe if they started by being pen pals and they still felt the same in a few years they could give it a try, but while she is still in school and highly dependent of her parents? No way.

If by some miracle she did manage to go to Bulgaria Hermione doesn't seem the kind of person to just spend a month snogging someone and then go back to her life like nothing happened. So in that scenario I see one of two things happening, either they decide to give a long distance relationship a try (because Krum "has never felt this way about anyone else", which as an aside is something I would expect to hear from a 14/15 year old definitely not Krum but moving on), this clearly didn't happen, or they decided to stay friends and pen pals... and you get the idea same thing as if she realized this really wouldn't work before even trying to go to Bulgaria. Then again maybe I think that Hermione is more level headed than most other people do.

I understand that some people like this idea of a romance between the two of them and I find no issue with it if developed differently in fanfiction (although my personal opinion of him in canon is that he is really creepy, in case it wasn't obvious, and as such I tend to steer clear of fanfics that pair the two of them).

Bringing it back to the original point of adding to Hermione's arc I always found that maybe if Cedric and Harry had a closer friendship during GoF, he or more likely one of his friends could have filled the role of Hermione's first romantic interest/crush much better. If I remember correctly Cedric was actually a 6th year who had his 17th birthday before the selection of champions and as such Hermione and this imaginary friend of Cedric could take their time with their relationship (because he has one more year at Hogwarts), since he's from the UK they might even be able to meet during the holidays.

Now when it comes to endgame pairings I'll be upfront and say I prefer Harry/Hermione over pretty any other, a small part of it being because if we have to pick from the major characters that interact with Hermione, seeing as really aside from Harry the only others that have a half decent relationship with her are Ron and Krum (and I don't like either of their relationships with her, if others do good for them but I don't) or maybe one of the Weasley twins which could actually be fun, but while they seem free spirited I always got the impression that from GoF forward they were both pretty steady with Angelina and Alicia so why ruin a good thing?

I'm not going to say the endgame pairing should be HHr simply because it is my personal favorite, so if we stick to canon and say it will be Romione we might have some conflict there during OoP because of it (Ron being jealous as usual). Maybe the parents of Cedric's friend work for the ministry or something and he doesn't quite believe Harry about Voldemort, or believes but doesn't want to get involved and tries to get Hermione to stay away from Harry during that year, which spells doom for their relationship. This in my opinion would have allowed us to see a different side of Hermione (her being a normal teenager with a crush that actually goes somewhere) and her choosing to stick with her friends because not only is her relationship with them more important to her but what they are doing (the DA in OoP) and fighting Voldemort in the future is worth the price of letting go of this guy.

God, I can't believe I just spent this long thinking about this when I find it to be a pretty unintersting subplot of the story. I'll just end by saying this is my opinion of Hermione's character and circumstances in the story, I definitely accept that things could be totally different to someone else simply because they think the decisions made by the characters in the background were different (since almost none of this is ever stated explicitly). I just wrote all of this to explain where I'm coming from and not to say you're wrong to have your opinion.

I'd also put more emphasis on Umbridge in DH, so you have Hermione do more in that regard because she found the Holocaust parallels more obvious than the other two.

** The problem with Hermione is that her entire character revolves around being the deliverer of exposition. She has to be right in order to move the plot along and help Harry solve the mystery of the year. For her character to learn humility and empathy, Hermione would have to make a huge and destructive mistake, because just being /told/ that she's rude and pushy wouldn't teach her anything. And a plot-derailing mistake would never happen because JKR had that "All Was Well" ending planned from the start, and Hermione was always her self-insert, wish-fulfillment character.

So what we're left with is a Hermione who is only willing to learn something from other people if she's aware of what she lacks, and since she's not a self-reflective character, there's not much that she actually thinks she lacks. With school and books, she pays attention because she wants knowledge. With letting Harry teach DADA with Dumbledore's Army, it's because Harry has the hands on experience.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry," she said timidly, "don't you see? This... this is exactly why we need you... we need to know what it's r-really like... facing him... facing V-Voldemort."
#+end_quote

Things that she actually lacks, eg. Divinating abilities, femininity, likeability, and open-mindedness, are traits she rationalizes as unimportant. And her lack of them are only ever tangentially important to the main plot of the books, like the completely irrelevant SPEW subplot.

*TL;DR* - Hermione's arc depends on her making a major mistake. She fucks up hugely, and there are plot-relevant /consequences/ for it, not just brushed aside like Hermione taking Harry's Firebolt in PoA, and it was okay, because it was never jinxed in the first place. Harry learned consequences when he ran to the DoM trying to rescue Sirius, while everyone kept telling him it was a trap. Hermione needs a "come to Jesus" moment on a similar scale of importance.

Ron left because he had a family to go back to. Hermione can't do that because she burned her own bridges, mind-wiping her family and sending them to Australia.

It would be more realistic if Hermione had an idea that she believed was good during the Horcrux Hunt, argued the boys down when they disagreed with her, pointing to her track record of "Look how many times I was right". Then she turns out to be disastrously wrong in a way that she can't blame anyone else but herself for it.

It has to be a legitimate mistake on Hermione's part, and not contrived nonsense like the Taboo that no one conveniently told them about until it was too late.

True. The thing here is that Hermione as a character is effectively perfect except for the single flaw of lacking niceness. And for a character to have a growth arc, they need to face challenges to their flaws and overcome them. So it's really the only place for her to grow.

If there's a character who is not nice but also not trusting, for example, they can stay not nice through their whole arc while still growing in handling their trust issues. That's still a satisfying arc. (Wolverine in Marvel comes to mind as someone who goes through multiple arcs like this, and being nice is never really touched on because he has so many other issues to explore.)

The alternative is to give her other failings and make arcs out of them. Like her inability to think under pressure that was in the books and not the movies. She could recognize her weak point and train to think laterally instead of literally and to think on her feet. That would be less satisfying than a character issue like empathy (which is worthy of a secondary character), but it would at least be an arc worthy of a tertiary character.

What I do want for her is character change and growth that comes from conequences related to her struggles and flaws. So you have an aspect of her personality that caused problems for her in relationships but not explored well and had little in the way of consequence. So there is room for growth there and room for an arc which she doesnt really get in the books beyond the first. Which is unfair cuz Ron and Harry do.

And maybe people feel the narrative might be too nice to her at times. Which is to say her issues suffer fewer consequences in comparison to others like Ron and Harry over similar issues at times too. Even if she doesnt grow that is kinda unfair.

But i guess Social issues specifically is a easier target so its emphasized more.

2) She clear and visibly loses her trust in most authority figures. In other words no correcting Harry on calling Snape Professor Snape after he insults her teeth. Or she ignores the instinct to trust that Dumbledore knows what he's doing in year 6 and listens to Harry.

3) Hermione actually dating people and perhaps even Harry at some time. They don't need to get together but, the characters are done a disservice by having such chemistry and love and yet it's quickly relegated to a sibling relationship. Hermione is also the most outspoken about rights and what is and isn't correct You would expect her to be someone who isn't afraid of Molly Weasley's "Scarlet Woman" title

4) I would have Hermione kill the Minister of Magic during the final battle or another character of high standing title wise like a Teacher or the Head of a Major Department of the Ministry. Complete the turn from teachers pet to girl over throwing the System.

** If you want to write it, then I would argue quite strongly against “retelling whole canon with some changes of mine”. I am just not able to read yet-another ninety-plus chapters of the same stuff while carefully looking for minuscule changes author made. It is just too boring. Make a new story. Not completely AU universe, just write something we don't know about. JKR left so much unexplained and empty, so write just that part which you want to make different or which is missing. E.g., when reading linkao3(17777138) or linkffn(9566537) there are just parts authors wanted to have different, and it is interesting. Or go post-War or pre-Hogwart. Just make your own original story. Most readers of fanfiction know JKR stories by heart (mostly), we may not want to read it again from somebody who is not Ms. Rowling.

Specifically Hermione, it is difficult. Her character was so beaten to death, there is not much to explore. I would specifically warn against Harmony. Story where the major part of originality is that she is with Harry and not with Ron are really difficult, because they tend to end with Mary Sue/Marty Sue two perfect flawless characters which are just happily cooing together and my eyes go automatically to sleep.

The only sensible thing to do (if you are keeping yourself in the canonical timeframe) is to find something which Ms. Rowling didn't write well in the books. And there is really little about Hermione generally which is wrong (oh, yes, I forgot, sending parents to Australia, right).

So, yes, romantic relationships (because Ms. Rowling [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][cannot write a romantic relationship to get herself out of a wet paper bag]], and see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryandGinny/comments/ceiyfj/the_character_development_of_ginny_weasley/exg9nzn/][the linked thread here on the Reddit]]) are probably the only major story-worthy things to change about Hermione. If you want to keep Romione than what about making them more sensible and starting dating earlier? Some kind of Ron/Lavender-like disaster around the Yule Ball (yes, we all did some really stupid mistakes in love, which hurt somebody and us), and then coming to their senses and getting together in OotP time-frame? Or get out of the Gryffindor common room (that's always a good strategy in my opinion) and make Hermione find her intellectual equal somewhere among Ravenclaws (I am always rooting for the secular-Jewish Hermione, so what about her with Anthony Goldstein, he is as blank page in canon as Daphne Greengrass?). Or how many good Dramione pre-War and even pre-HBP stories there are? Or if she was (and why she wouldn't be?) one of many many girls at Hogwarts making puppy eyes after Cedric Diggory (I love linkao3(The Dream Diary by MandyinKC)), why not to make lovely tragic story out of it? Or even make him survive? Non-Romione pairing allow happy Ron/Lavender couple, which is another thing I would love to read more about (they could fit together very well, if they stop snogging and start talking, and how many of us did the same mistake?).

** [[http://globalcomment.com/in-praise-of-hermione-granger-series/]]?

But seriously, most the posts---and the fics---seem to want her to be nicer, better adjusted, more restrained, and there seems to be this preoccupation with teaching her a lesson to be more considerate of other people (i.e., put the b!$# in her place). To be a more stereotypical part of a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoGuysAndAGirl][Two Guys and a Girl Trope]], in other words.

And that's boring.

I'd play up what makes Hermione an interesting character in the first place: make her the full-on Anti-Hero of the group. Pile consequences of her actions on her bushy-haired head, sure; but rather than having her decide to be more restrained next time, have her decide to be sneakier instead. What Harry and Ron don't know can't hurt them. You're only in trouble if you get caught. Memory Chars, Legilimency, Confundus, and Occlumency are the best spells for avoiding that. The ends justify the means. Dark Arts... are probably still too dangerous to practice without an expert to supervise you, but it's important to know the theory, just in case.

I want Harry to be worried about sharing Half-Blood Prince's Potions book with Hermione, because of how she might use the knowledge in it. I want Harry and Ron to learn that Dolohov and Throwle have both died of a mysterious illness or just committed suicide a few months after Hermione obliviated them at the diner---and have a debate about whether or not to talk to Hermione about it.

***** Definitely tribunal as the Ministry, which you would charge with dishing out justice, probably is responsible for more deaths than Voldemort on his own.

You'd probably need to throw half of the Ministry into prison tbh.

****** I think tribunal myself.

Now Lucius getting off on the other hand was definitely bs. Joseph Goebbels would have presumably been hanged or shot or whatever they did, so how did Lucius get off?

** I would change Hermione becoming friends with Harry and Ron after the troll incident. Like the teachers instead of awarding points given them detention for not following the instructions, Hermione decides to stay away from Ron and Harry, becomes bit humble and hangs out with the other girls in her form or Neville. She is still smart, stands up with Neville when Ron and Harry go to face Quirellmort because she doesn't want Gryffindor to lose more points.

In second year, she gets petrified but still she figured out about the basilisk all by herself. Lavender and Parvati find the crumpled note in her hand sooner and show it to Madam Pomfrey, who notifies McGonagall. The chamber entrance is sealed and Ginny is never captured. Mrs Weasley suspects something wrong with Ginny over the holidays and Diary Horcrux is discovered.

Third year- Her cat still "eats" scabbers, she doesn't care about the firebolt because she doesn't know that Sirius is after Harry who is anyway not her friend. She figures out Lupin is a werewolf and tells her friends making him resign earlier and Pettigrew never escapes.

Fourth year- would be AU because no Peter - no Bertha jorkins- no creepy babymort - no rescuing Barty crouch Jr- Harry not part of Triwizard and cheers Cedric along with everyone else- Cedric doesn't die. Would be interesting how Voldie makes a comeback.

*** How would she learn of the basilisk if she doesn't know Harry's hearing voices? And Ginny stays at Hogwarts for Christmas. Tbh, unless Harry investigates who's crying in the bathroom, 2nd year might be a little harder, but I'm not all that fussed about Ginny dying.

Lol i mean in a way yes. I guess its more that 2 out of 3 of the major characters got growth through an actual character arc and Hermione didn't and that feels unfair.

Im not opposed to making her become more dark and harsh for a period but i dont think shes a cruel character over all like the Remus suggestion...doesnt seem in character. I do think that making her maybe a friend but not best friend after the troll thing could work though. Have her feel like a third wheel until maybe fouth year and then she finally feels equal in friendship.

***** Okay, but why would she do that? Ratting out the first remotely competent DADA teacher she's had for having a condition that, per canon, he's managing perfectly well is cruel, counterproductive, and accomplishes nothing.

** I would have wanted her to push more for DADA, to practice her skills more to try and beat Harry, and maybe even beat him a few times (in practical exams). I also would have wanted to see her be the one who kills Bellatrix in the end, and I want her to end up with Harry.
