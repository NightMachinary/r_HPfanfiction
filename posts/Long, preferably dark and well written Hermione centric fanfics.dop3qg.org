Ones I liked: Applied Cultural Anthropology, Unsphere the Stars, Persephone (by dulce.de.leche.go), Nothing Like The Sun, Hermione Granger, Demonologist (despite it being short), Blood and Gold, Strange Attractors, Six Pomegranate Seeds, Yesterday is Tomorrow (everything is connected), Addendum: He Is Also A Liar, and some others that I won't bore you with. These are mostly tomione but I can't say I have a preference for it, there's just a lot of dark and well written fics of it. Ones I didn't like: Green girl and Lady of the Lake, anything by winterblume or starfox (i'm not a fan of the type of plots they write) marriage law or a/b/o dynamics. Just /no/.

#+begin_quote
  There's something unnerving about Tom Riddle. Hermione's never quite been able to articulate just what it is about him that unsettles her so: after all, Riddle's popular and charming and adored by Hogwarts staff and students alike. Still, she'd swear that there's something lurking beneath that warmly polite veneer of his, something that lies in wait like a serpent in the dark. But it's not until her sixth year at Hogwarts, when she rashly confronts him over an unprecedented act of violence, that the full force of Riddle's chilling regard is abruptly and wholly turned on her.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch.

  The true time-turner was slammed savagely into Hermione's throat. It shattered against her neck, bits of glass and gold piercing into her skin. The last thing she saw before blackness consumed her was a plume of metallic dust and vitreous fragments, tiny prisms dancing behind her eyelids. (In which Hermione accidentally ends up in 1950, pitted against an ascending Dark Lord in his prime, caught in the entanglement of pureblood politics, dark magic, and Tom Riddle's interest)

#+begin_quote
  Unspeakable Granger wakes up with missing memories in Hogwarts...in 1942. Hermione might not remember much, but she knew that even post-Voldemort, there were many wannabe dark lords she and her friends had to fight against. The world wasn't automatically sunshine and roses just because they've defeated Voldemort.

  Also, go back? What go back? If she doesn't even know how she got here with all the wounds she had, then there's really no guarantee that a safe way to jump forward exists! Yet the possibilities that are open to her... if she could change the wizarding world half a century earlier, maybe they'd be more prepared against dark lords in the future. Perhaps a better world for the friends she'd left. With this in mind, Hermione Curie (Granger) sets out to use her field healer and master arithmancer abilities to the fullest (if she had to invent a couple of things earlier than they actually happened in her old future, so be it). Not to mention that in her very-biased-opinion, the wizarding world needs to be dragged out of its old prejudices, kicking and screaming if necessary. But who is that particular prefect? Her mind itches at seeing him...

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend". But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle. (1930's Childhood Friends AU)

*** I've read Birds of a Feather- I liked it, for the most part- but Stepbrother for me just gave off wayyyy too many pedophilic vibes. That probably wasn't the intention but I got the creeps. The other recommendations sound really good, thanks! The Apprentice sounds cool.

**** I hope you will enjoy the other fics.

Stepbrother does get pretty weird once Tom and Hermione reach Hogwarts, though rather than pedophilic to me it looks like a strange, platonic blackrom relationship (possibly the author is a fan of Homestuck). Neither character is old enough to comprehend the undertones of arranging meetings to let off emotional stress by beating eachother up. That part of the fic weirds me out to be honest, and I'm usually hesitant to recomend it because of that. I only did so in this case because the chapters before Hogwarts are amongst the best written 'Tom with childhood friend' plots I've seen, and your list of liked fics seemed to indicate you aren't averse to unusual pairings or unhealthy relationship dynamics.

***** I generally don't mind unhealthy relationship dynamics in fics (as long as it isnt glorifying it) but there was one part in Stepbrother where I had to stop reading because I have some stuff with pedophiles that kinda fucked me up. I don't know, I just couldn't read it anymore, can't really read anything with paedophilic undertones without feeling ill even if the writing is great.

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
