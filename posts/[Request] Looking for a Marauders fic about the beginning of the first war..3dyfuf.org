Are there any good fics about the emotional effects of the beginning of the first war on the Marauders? And maybe the founding of the Order of the Phoenix?


** Didn't the first war start before the Marauders' time at Hogwarts?

*** Now I'm wondering if it was kind of a slow moving thing - maybe there were a couple of fights here and there, but it was primarily a lot of tension and an increase in rhetoric, with actual fighting breaking out towards the end of their schooling

**** I think the Maurauders had it much worse that Harry did, for sure. The war was brewing since the day they entered. The day they left, people getting news of dying family members was probably normal.

I would really like to see Rowling write about those gritty times.

*** It did, wiki says it started in 1970, though I don't recall what information they're using to get that date. The marauders started at Hogwarts in '71.

I imagine it grew in intensity while they were in school. Something that may have seemed like an isolated incident in 1973 would clearly look like an act of war in 1979, for example.
