James somehow gets stuck as Turniphead, Sirius as Howl with a canine!Beast self rather than bird (being melodramatic & that part with his hair!)

Like Remus thinks he's just a boring normal dude in a nowhere job til he gets cursed and "sophie you're beautiful!" but with remus idk

Maybe Regulus as Calcifer? (would be fun to see how Snape would fare as gloomy snarky fire demon..but he would not be sirius's /heart/ lol) plus this way calcifer would retain a star reference at least in namesake? As regulus idk

Harry as apprentice Markl? Or maybe Peter, to give him a chance to be good? Idk

Walburga as the Witch, wearing regal furs etc but eventually revealing the ugliness within her. Kreacher as Heen?(the dog)

Dumbledore as Sulliman? Or is that too harsh

Idk obviously many roles could go many different ways but I just love the idea of these worlds+characters and wondered if anyone had stumbled upon or written such a crossover/AU


** I've been planning to write an AU with elements from Howl's Moving Castle (both the film and the books), but haven't got around to it just yet. less replacing characters one-to-one, and more taking elements and converting them. So Harry might open a magic shop similar to the one's Howl runs, I might introduce the idea of a magical oath to the crown like the one witches and wizards have to swear in Howl's universe, etc.

So far it's not very fleshed out though, so I don't have a plot readily in mind.

I haven't seen any already written AUs/Crossovers for this combo yet, but if I turn any up i'll be sure to come back and comment them. It's always fun to look at HP AUs with other proprties and seeing how it effects the characters, the magic system, and the world! :)

** I'd love a Chrestomanci X Harry Potter crossover. Diana Wynne Jones seems to have a better handle on what government for a small population of Magical Britain should look like. Magical Houses too, imagine if The Burrow were more like The House of Many Ways.

Stonewall High becomes the school from â€˜Witch Week' and when Chrestomanci comes on the scene he whisks the witches to an alternate dimension where magic hasn't the same stigma e.g. Hogwarts.

Harry can travel in his dreams much like Christopher Chant, Voldemort's Horcrux is actually an anchor akin to the multiple Chrestomanci lives.

The Magicians of Caprona give material for an Italian Triwizard competitor.
