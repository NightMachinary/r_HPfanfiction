I am very attached to my Kindle. Very attached. But it's hard to read in-progress fics on it, as you have to manually move (or e-mail) everything over. Fics also don't have BookArt on them either, which normally means I'll spend more time using Calibre to import the art of ffn than actually reading.

I'm genuinely contemplating to see if I can port ficsave to automatically sync with my kindle when it gets plugged in.


** Been reading on my Galaxy tablet, which is slowly dying so I've been window shopping for an e-reader. I'm not an Amazon fan and don't wanna give them my money so I've had my eyes on the Rakuten Kobo line. Heard some really good things about them, including auto-syncing.

*** I'd definitely recommend Kobo! I've had a Kobo Touch for 8 years and it still works very well. I meant to get a Clara but my Touch is still doing so well that I couldn't justify it to myself haha. But having an e-reader with a built-in light would be very nice.

** Hm, when I had a Kindle, I used to download the fics in MOBI format on a computer, send it to myself, and download it on my Kindle. Now that I think about it that sounds a little tedious, especially with the number of fics I read, but I guess at the time it seemed fine as long as I got my fix of fic.

Sadly my precious Kindle disappeared, and now I read on the laptop... which is extremely inconvenient since it's not even /my/ laptop and it hurts my eyes. Planning to go back to what I did with the Kindle when I can buy one in the future. Though I do want to know a more convenient way of doing it.
