I am seeking recommendations for Hermione centric fics that contain a pairing that *isnt* either Hermione and Ron or Hermione and Harry.

I tend to read Dramione, Hermione and one of the Weasley twins, or Hermione with Sirius/Snape/Remus that involve time travel. So, I have read pretty much every one of the popular fics with those pairings.

I'd love lesser known gems with those pairings or other pairings as well, as long as Hermione is involved! Recommend me your best Hermione fics!

Thanks!


** How do you feel about Charlie/Hermione?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12789201/1/Last-Christmas][Last Christmas]] is a (long) one-shot by Kittenshift17 that's excellent.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8417149/1/A-Pleasurable-Kind-of-Torture][A Pleasurable Kind of Torture]] by Allotropism is a nice one-shot that I always seem to come back to every once in a while.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12703557/1/Whom-the-Gods-Would-Destroy][Whom the Gods Would Destroy]] is a post-apocalyptic story that starts a little slow, but definitely picks up the more it goes on. This story (by ianthewaiting) is complete at 136,000 words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13228312/1/Lost-and-Found][Lost and Found]] by minasark is a story I found a couple of days ago that is amazing. It tends to lean a bit more Muggle, but by no means is it a Muggle-AU story. Charlie and Hermione's personalities here are done so well that I literally lost myself in the story with them. Unfortunately, the story seems to be abandoned at 43,000 words. However, I highly recommend giving this a shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3550231/1/Only-In-The-World-of-Dragons][Only In The World of Dragons]] is a good story, though it tends to be wordy (and, in my opinion, a tad unrealistic at times). With that being said, it's worth a read nonetheless. At 90,000, this story by atruwriter, is complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3993848/1/Games-are-afoot][Games are afoot]] by grumpy grizzly is a classic in the Charlie/Hermione pairing. Unfortunately, this story does not hold up in terms of how I remember it when I first read it. (I tried a re-read of it a short while ago and couldn't get very far in.) Also, there are a ton of overused tropes used (e.g., "Twin-speak" by Fred and George) and the ending is extremely, and I mean extremely, rushed. For example, the last chapter of the story is a couple of paragraphs long with only one line of dialogue (and it's not even spoken by Charlie or Hermione either). So while it's marked "Complete", I don't think I would consider it as such. Yet, there are some really good ideas used in the story; the only issue is that the execution is wildly off.

Also, if you don't mind two stories of my own:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12915227/1/The-Freedom-Land-of-the-Seventies][The Freedom Land of the Seventies]] is a one-shot that deals with Charlie and Hermione, along with a great deal of smut.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13699001/1/The-Sparrow-Suite][The Sparrow Suite]] is a story I just started posting last Friday (with Chapter 2 coming tomorrow!). It follows a different approach to Charlie and Hermione: with them initially not liking one another. During the summer, both are approached to teach at Hogwarts and the story goes on from there.

** So I'm sure you've read words from these two because they're pretty well-known, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/ShayaLonnie/pseuds/ShayaLonnie][Shayalonnie]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/olivieblake/pseuds/olivieblake][Olivieblake]] are amazing! I believe they can be found on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] too, but i linked to their a03 pages. They've written some amazing dramione, lumione, and sirimione stories!

I've been reading a lot of dramione lately, so here are a few others I've really enjoyed as of late!\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17457683][Sweetly Broken]] it's kinda angsty but has a happy ending\\
i've read several of [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/senlinyu/pseuds/senlinyu][senlinyu's]] stuff lately and it's all been really good, but heed the warnings

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2727356][As the Moon Rises]] is a good remus/hermione fic. So is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8170214][Mine, Always]].

Sirius/Hermione is a personal fav of mine, so once i find some of my favorites I'll link them!

  Lists had never failed Hermione before. So when her feelings for Ron get out of hand, it's only natural for her to write a list to clear her mind. She would come up with a list of boys most objectively compatible with her, detail the reasons why, and choose someone from the list to serve as a distraction. Of course, she never dreamed that her notes would all magically get sent out. (Inspired by To All The Boys I've Loved Before)

** I don't think any of these have been mentioned yet, one of my favorites: The Pranksters Apprentice (George/Hermione), Strange Bedfellows (same pairing and author but an earlier attempt, not as good, but still solid.)

Another fun but of fluff Harmony, no Voldy, just some au 7th year fluff: Thresholds

One of my wife's favorites, I'm still not sure how I feel about it, but it was a story that made Dramione make some sort of sense: The wrong strain.

  Sometimes, George would find himself out of his depths when working on a prank. Problem is, Fred was always the one to help him out.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

** This one is very Hermione centric. The author has not decided on what pairing but it's a great story.

A Stumble in Time by SorcerersScone

Summary:

Voldemort had a back-up plan and came back with a vengeance. As a result, Harry, Ron, and Astoria Greengrass died two months after the final battle, when Voldemort stepped out of the veil of death and destroyed the Ministry. Hermione spent three years afterwards salvaging what she could of the defenseless Wizarding World, helped by a rather shaken Draco Malfoy. When Voldemort targets and destroys both Draco's and Hermione's parents, they decide that they're better off starting all over than they are muddling through another loss. But time is a fickle friend, and not all of them make it back alive.

  Hermione felt the pounding in her ears again. She would see him for the first time since the Great Hall, gaunt and stricken at the Slytherin table with his mother clutching his arm. She hadn't meant to look for him. Not in the corridors, not beneath the white sheets of the fallen, not on the way to the Chamber of Secrets with Ron, but she was a stupid girl.

  Malfoy's handsome face was contoured into a condescending smirk. "No faith in that giant brain of yours, Granger?" She looked up at him defiantly. "Maybe I don't have faith in you!" she said, raising her voice. Malfoy only looked at her. "You'll find I'm very surprising." Dramione AU, Year 6 with a slow burn and a killer twist. Book I of "This World or Any Other" series. COMPLETE.

  Two years after the war, a young stranger pays a visit to the burrow. His arrival alone is baffling, but the news he brings of an upcoming war turns the world upside down. Hermione's quiet, post-war life will never be the same.

  Hermione has everything she could possibly want... Except a life. People are getting sick of her superior attitude, especially Draco Malfoy, who schemes to get her down, once and for all. And then there's the thing with The Bracelet... 7th year AR. COMPLETE SINCE 2009 XD

  He felt something close to pity for the woman in front of him. And while that disturbed Draco to no end, what really disgusted him most of all was the harrowing fact that someone or something had broken Hermione Granger's spirit beyond recognition. Revised 2019. Update your Epubs.
