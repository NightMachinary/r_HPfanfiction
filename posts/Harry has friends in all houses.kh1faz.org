Any good fics that focus on houses uniting/being friends with each other without it having major Weasley bashing or evilHarry. I just wanna see Hogwarts students work together more.

** There's no bashing, very limited evil of any sort, and plenty of inter-house cooperation in linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay). The selling point of the story is the magic and the humour, rather than conflict in the usual sense.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Are you ok with slash? It's Tom/Harry but the romance isn't such a majoring factor. Basically, Harry gets along with everyone and the story starts to change. It's honestly such a cute read, even if unfinished.\\
