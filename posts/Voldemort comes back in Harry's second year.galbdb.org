Just looking for any stories with that premise.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Doesn't have to be focused on any pairings)

NO OP Harry, no Lord Potter, no Harem Harry. Harry slightly more powerful or slightly smarter then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable.

Anyone can be the main character, can be from any site, can have any warnings.

NO Weasley bashing.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

Or secondary request: Voldemort comes back at any time SOONER then he had in canon.


** I got a story, Departure from the Diary - linkffn(13299443) is the only one I know off the top of my head. It's a good story, its got femTomRiddle

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.
