So we all know how Outdated and Primitive the WIzarding World is, yes? Well, what if it were reversed? Imagine a comparably modern WIzarding World nested within a Victorian-Era society. Magical equivalents to our current, modern infrastructure (just more spatially efficient), and just about equal levels of reform and human rights ect.

Write a scene where a victorian era Harry Potter (street urchins are cute) is introduced to the (Politically Ambiguous) Magical Nations of Europe, and is subjected to the trials of, not only getting thrown into this strange, confusing society, but the perils of public education at a school that is somehow still named Hogwarts.

*Requirements:*

- 200+ words long
- Harry-centric, your choice of PoV
- Harry is introduced to a Modernized Wizarding World from a Victorian-Era Nonmagical society

*Bonus Points for:*

- Harry being a cute, 11-year-old street urchin
- Having Harry view modern everyday ideas like school busses like they are the most magical magic ideas
- somehow having Luna Lovegood qualify as a School Counselor even though she's ten
- or, having Harry be fostered by the Lovegoods? they're cool people.
- Voldemort trying to unite the Muggle and Magical worlds. He is a Steampunk Dark Wizard.
- something ironic about Parseltongue

No, we don't, because it isn't.

****** Something looking outdated and actually being outdated (not to mention primitive) is a completely different thing. Also how does that play into the societal aspect? You seem to be backpedaling hard.

******* because its really not the main part of the prompt.

societally, they have like fifteen oppressed sapient species. House Elves (if not citizenship then protection from abuse), Centaurs, Goblins, Werewolves, ect.

Also they have a blatantly corrupt aristocracy rather than any semblance of a fair government.

Eh, in most of those cases the oppression isn't really that clear (especially with goblins), and werewolves (not really a race) seem to not be much worse than a person with AIDS would have in the muggle world then. And people with AIDS didn't change into dangerous, murderous beasts.

They don't have an aristocracy. To the contrary, the Minister for Magic is elected in a popular election and Wizengamot members are also elected (though we don't know how the process looks here).

The first female Minister was elected in 1798. That's over hundred years before women could even vote in muggle Britain.
