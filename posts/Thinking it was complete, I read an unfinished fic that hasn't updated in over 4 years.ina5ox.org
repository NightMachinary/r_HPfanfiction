I thought it was complete when I started it but I guess I made a mistake when filtering. I haven't done this in years and I'm devastated. It left on such a great cliffhanger too and it had so many concepts and tropes done sooo well that I rarely ever seen done well. It's 0800-Rent-A-Hero by brainthief btw. If any one know of any fics similar to it that would be appreciated.


** the worst feeling is getting really immersed into a 100k+ word fic and then finding out it has no sequel/is abandoned

*** Yeah. I looked at the bottom right corner to see no forward arrow for a new chapter and my stomach dropped. Went to the top to see no "complete" anywhere and published 2015.

**** I found one of those from around the same time... and it just abruptly ended in the middle of the day. (Marked complete - I checked. I /always/ check.)

The a/n at the end says that there's a sequel, with so-and-so number of chapters ready and... nope. There's two.

TWO.

I was a little irate.

And I agree: Rent A Hero also ends at probably the worst possible place.

** You gotta sort by complete these days. Seems nothing is ever completed any more, and certainly nothing updated years ago. Everyone starts a story, and just abandons them, only to start another 200 stories that never take off either.

It really sucks, and I know the writers are doing it for fun, but it's the reason this all seems to have stagnated and is beginning to die off.

*** It's what I always do but this time I must've accidentally not. The author only did one shots before and they haven't written anything since the last chapter of the fic I read so I hope they're okay and just quit writing.

*** Unfortunately, I've run across a number of stories marked complete that aren't - the author just posted a final chapter that said nothing more would be done on the story. For one of them, though, the author posted the outline of what was intended for the rest of the story.

I've also run across stories (including one just the day before yesterday) that aren't marked complete, but are. Or, at least, stop at a point that /feels/ complete.

It's why I say that /all/ stories are eventually abandoned, and it's just that some are abandoned in a more satisfying state than others.

** The worst is when you find a series being regularly updated for each book, read along with the author for years, and then sometime in the beginning or the fifth or sixth book, they disappear without a trace :(

*** Hasn't happened to me (yet) but I see sooo many series like that! I keep thinking they were on year 6 why not finish it in 6 if you can't do another, you were so frickin close!

** If there's one unfinished fic that I would love to see updates on, it's 0800-rent-a-hero. I love the take on divination and the story was really interesting.
