I need some help, I have a real soft spot for hp/Luna, friendship or relationship but I've never really found any that I like outside of a few shorter ones. They are either harems/lunar harmony, or the author uses Luna as an excuse for a dark Harry

If any of y'all have come across any good ones, I'd really appreciate them.

So as you can tell above I would prefer no harems or Dark Harry,

I'd also prefer longer stories but as long as the fics are good any length will suffice


** linkffn(Contemplating Clouds), it's unfinished and very short but what's there is really good and very Luna Lovegood. Probably the best Harry/Luna I've read.

*** Thank you for recommending it....I just finished it..I'll start by saying I do like the way you wrote Luna, you did a very nice job, and it's very hard to write Luna... That being said several points of the story didn't make sense to me and there where what I believe are small plot holes (beginning where harry runs off, DDore can just stop him, your notice me not charm, not working on the Aurors, harry going to borgin and Bork's for help)... And Harry in general felt a bit off.

**** Thanks for reading and for adding commentary. I can't write better stories without the audience telling me what doesn't work.

Over time I've found that writing Harry is one of the hardest things for me to do. It might be better for me and the reader if I spend more time explaining why the character is making the choices he is.

As for Dumbledore- of course he could have held Harry back from running off, but he also isn't one to interfere with another's choices, and Harry seemed motivated to go back downstairs for some reason.

*** That was pretty great. I'd rate it 8/10. I *really* like the adventurous lighthearted writing style. Your Holly Potter writing seemed always a bit too angsty.

The ending is utter dog-shit on every level though. You aren't even trying to write a continuation, so why press the reset button? [oh and fuck that "he was just trying to kill himself so we'll just let him die" mentality, your Harry and Luna are both despicable]

No hard feelings.

**** No hard feelings- warm feelings, and appreciation for the commentary!

I've gotten a lot of grief over the ending for this, and I think for most people they feel it was manufactured grief, but the idea behind the story was to write something that was canon-compatible but still interesting and fun, while developing depth in the characters.

Intent <> results, obviously. I think perhaps I should just cheer up (as a writer).

#+end_quote

The idea to use this kind of time travel as a form of grief counceling for Harry is really good. I just wish the resolution had been a bit different... Harry going "fuck that guy" and firmly being stuck in the "anger" phase isn't really progress.

Luna being casually evil and obliviating him is somewhat minor in comparison.
