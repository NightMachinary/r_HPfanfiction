A quick list of things to include when writing the same goddamn story for the 500th time.

-Eyes the color of the killing curse

-Harry is polite to the goblins at Gringotts. This startles them so much that they give him a free inheritance test. Usually wizards are rude to goblins, a nice wizard is a rarity.

-Harry takes the inheritance test, turns out he's heir to 700 different ancient and Noble houses

-also turns out Dumbledore sealed the Potter wills so he could place Harry at the Dursleys

-Dumbledore's also been stealing from the Potter vaults to fund the Order of the Phoenix

-Harry finds this out and asks for a full detail of what he owns, turns out he owns 500 different properties, 300 vaults, and owns shares in 200 companies

-be sure to list every vaults contents and every property owned by Harry, even if it takes half a chapter to list it all

-Right after you list every single asset Harry owns and their value you now have to give a 14 paragraph explanation of various aspects of pureblood customs and the magical social hierarchy. Make it extremely complex, put Harry at the very top of the food chain, and don't mention it again for the rest of the story.

-Harry can revoke Dumbledore's access to the vaults because the goblet of Fire emancipated Harry (it's a loophole, only adults could compete in the Triwizard tournament. Harry competed, therefore he's an adult)

-Harry also takes up the 7 bajillion Lordships that he inherited. With a ring of ungodly power for every lordship. Seriously. Make the Lord rings detect poison and potions, cure many poisons, be emergency portkeys, deflect minor hexes, and grant the wearer unbreakable occlumency shields. Go all out. Those Lordship rings aren't just for show.

-Avada Kedavera green eyes

-Turns out Ginny Weasley was dosing Harry with a love potion. Which Harry found out because the Lordship rings of ungodly power let him know.

-the goblins discover the horcrux in his scar and remove it

-The inheritance test also showed Dumbledore put a block on Harry's magic. The goblins remove it and now Harry is as strong as Merlin.

-Harry takes the goblins to Hogwarts so they can harvest the basilisk corpse for a ton of money. Be sure to make a big deal about how massive the basilisk is. Harry gets 90% by right of conquest and the goblins get 10% for doing the work of cutting up the corpse. Harry also takes 1 fang (optionally the goblins can craft it into a dagger for Harry)

-while the goblins chop up the basilisk Harry goes on a rant about all the horrible things that happened to him in chronological order. Basically give a tl;dr of the plot of canon HP up to this point. Make it 17 paragraphs long.

-Harry then destroys all the horcruxes in a single afternoon. Because he can.

-Dumbledore is now displeased that Harry is acting on his own

-"Harry mah boy, u must go live with ur relatives"

-harry goes on a rant "First of all it's Lord Potter-Black-Gaunt-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-Slytherin-Naruto to you! Second ur not my boss, I'm a big boy screw you! Third the blood wards were never even made right, they weren't my family, they were abusive!"

-while ranting Harrys eyes glow the color of the killing curse

-Harry leaves to find lots of women for his harem because being a Lord of 17 bajillion houses means he must have 17 bajillion heirs

-While gathering women for his harem he decides to catch Wormtail and prove Sirius is innocent through about 5 minutes of work

-Make sure Harry calls Sirius his dogfather. I promise it's the funniest inside joke even the thousandth time you read it.

-Harry decides it's time to end this and meets Voldemort on the battlefield. Provoke him by calling him Tom. It makes him really mad.

-Harry kills Voldemort with a wave of his hand through some bullshit magical loophole. He also kills every marked death eater by accident. Whoops. Oh well, they deserved it.

-Harry (who's eyes are the color of the killing curse) and his harem make lots of babies and live happily ever after, the end.

**** He stood in the great Hall, devastated. First Ron had betrayed him, giving him up to Voldemort, then his sister attempted to dose him with love potions. His sorrow penetrated through his magical barriers, breaking down the locks and bindings the old coot had placed upon him. All across the world, Goblins bowed, they'd found their new king. He brought his head up, staring at his final adversary. Voldemort backpedaled a bit, his breath speeding up. The Seer, Luna Lovegood began chanting the prophecy. He simply stared at Voldemort, his orbs glowing a bright Avada Kedavra Green, his Raven locks flowing in the newly made, magical wind and with a simple whimper, Draco had burst from the crowd, screaming about how Harry was just a half-blood. And Harry, simply responded, "No, u."

The magical shockwave, First disintegrated Voldemort, who only managed out a whimper, before he was turned into a shadow. Malfoy was blown backwards, simultaneously dying and losing his marriage contract with Astoria Greengrass, who promptly started forming a soul bond with Harry. All across the world, people dropped dead, each and every one of them, marked death eaters.

On that faithful day, All of Dumbledore's work was reversed. The genocide of the German people, the Rawandan genocide, the assassination of JFK. All of these, and more were fixed, and the Weasley family was wiped from time. Finally granting Harry's true destiny. Having a harem, of all the girls in Hogwarts, and having their tits, and asses be huge.

** This is something that has been on my mind the last couple days. I have some additions, some for fics where LV/TR is a main character.

He disappears for some time, something life-changing happens, he comes back a changed man - bad-ass motherfucker, darkish, blood mage, necromancer, dark wizard - ah no, it's a Dark wizard.

Long paragraphs of rants full of righteous anger, where Harry spreads out all the numerous wrongs that have been done to him by Dumbledore/the Wizarding world/his ‘so-called'/‘ex-‘/‘former' friends/the Dursleys.

Explosions of rage - again the righteous anger.

For some reason he gets a new name - whether he has to make a new identity, discovers his hidden ancestry - not James Potter's son! - or becomes Voldemort's right-hand man - and it's always something edgy and cooool.

He awakens ancient demon-blood magic-arcanist-mage-druid-high elemental powers.

He is stronger than all other wizards besides /maybe/ Dumbledore and LV and can duel them all into the ground after only a few months of training.

Dark cloaks.

Loads and loads of secrets. Secret powers, secret new friends, secret identity, secret secrets.

Did I mention the righteous teenagey anger?

The horcruxes made LV crazy and he finds a way to unite them with him so he isn't crazy anymore.

Or: Dumbledore used propaganda to paint LV in a bad light - he's really not that bad.

Or: Dumbledore dosed LV with a potion/put him under a curse that made him crazy.

For a slash fic: Harry is small and delicate and thin and cries easily and gets pregnant and generally fits the stereotype of a submissive woman to the t - only difference being his dick.

** "May your gold flow, and your enemies crumble Lord Potter."

"And may you find your golden sword dripping with the blood of your enemies, Griphook."

"You rembered my name?" Griphook asked, eyes filled with utmost adoration.

"Of course I did. What kind of a Gary Stu would I be if I didn't have perfect memory?" Harry said continued, "Now please grant me an audience with Ragnok, the director and king of Goblin Nation."

Griphook nodded frantically. "As you say Lord Potter! You are the most important being on earth, for us. Although, don't you think the readers would remember that a Goblin Nation was never mentioned in canon?"

Harry laughed. "Of course not. Do you think they would be reading this story if they were smart enough?"

"Point."

With that Harry casually stolled through the Gringotts hall, completely bypassing the lines of wizards and witches waiting for their turn.

Some ugly looking guards joined them (of course they were ugly looking, only Harry and girls he likes have a right to be attractive in this story) as they made their way deep inside the bank. And they kept going, and going, and going. Finally they reached a large hall of some sort. It was decorated with all sorts of things that would induce fear in a wizard that the author is too squeamish to search for.

But Harry went right ahead, ignoring all of that in favour of giving Ragnok a bow.

Ragnok stepped off his throne and gave Harry an even bigger bow.

"I am sure you received the letter for your inheritance, Lord Potter."

Harry nodded. "The one you sent me right after my godfather, Sirius Black died, yes?"

"Exactly. As you have already been emancipated last year by the Tri-Wizard Tournament, or by request of Sirius, you can now access the vast fortunes your parents left you with."

"I already know that Dumbledore is a manipulative asshole, because he cautioned me to not go to Gringotts even though there's the very legitimate threat of Voldemort. It's almost as if he was being sensible."

"See if the authors care."

Harry smirked. "Of course they don't. After all, the very existence of this version of you and me is only because so many writers wrote into these clichés that a mediocre author decided to write a parody out of it.

"That smart meta comment out of the way, shall we do what I came here for?"

"Inheritance test?" Ragnok asked, eyes gleaming.

"Inheritance test." Harry nodded.

"Oh, and before we do anything more, please remember to take seven times the normal fees. Because, you know, being rich allows me to buy kindness and friendships."

Ragnok stopped in his tracks, stared, then suddenly shouted, "FRIEND OF THE GOBLIN NATION!"

"Hey don't use so many capital letters, it's incredibly hard to read." But Ragnok wasn't listening, instead he started walking down the hall.

With that, Harry was led through an even longer path, even deeper in the ground.

They finally reached a chamber big enough that Harry's vast intelligence could successfully be contained in it, if only barely. That is, it was a small room barely big enough for a desk and two chairs.

When both of them sat down on the chairs, Ragnok took out a list and handed it over to Harry.

"List of available Inheritance Tests?" Harry read aloud.

"We didn't know which one you would've preferred, so we simply wrote all the possible methods we have at our disposal so that you can easily select the one you want."

Harry started skimming over the list. "Trial by Hogwarts' Founders? You have actual life essence of the four founders? And Merlin's too?"

Ragnok smirked. "Of course we do. Do you doubt our pretty plot convenient extraordinary magic?"

"Of course not," Harry hastily said, "I just, you know, think about why you guys have lost so many wars if you have better weapons, better magic, even more bloodthirsty soldiers."

"No no no that question comes after you're done discussing the money in your vaults and want combat training. We'll see about it later. And don't you dare go out of the script like that again."

Harry sighed, nodded, and went back to reading over the admittedly long list. "This test will tell me all about my true potential, as well as my powers and language speaking skills, almost as if this was a game?" He asked, pointing at one name in the list.

"Yes it will. It will also tell you how most of your abilities have somehow been locked up by Dumbledore to keep you under his nose."

Harry marked it with his quill, and continued reading.

Finally he reached a decision. "That one please."

Ragnok nodded.

Harry was then led to an even longer journey, even more deeper inside Gringotts.

"Just out of curiosity," Harry said, "just how deep do these halls and corridors go? And why am I feeling so hot?"

Ragnok chuckled. "You are 10 meters away from earth's core. It is because of our excellent cooling charms that you haven't melted already."

Harry nodded. That made sense.

"Also, here's another little tidbit: our cave systems and tunnels are very densely crisscrossed in the ground beneath London."

"So one minor earthquake and the city will be done for?" When Ragnok nodded, Harry asked, "Why?"

"How do you think we make the space for so many rooms for inheritance tests, and vaults, and so many other things..."

Harry nodded. That too made sense.

After the overly complicated test was over, Harry was back in Ragnok's room.

He held a parchment that was so long it had to be folded up more times than Dumbledore consumed lemon drops in a week.

"Before we proceed, Sirius Black left a letter to be read to you on the event of his death. Do you Wish to hear it?" Harry nodded.

Hey Prongslet/Pup/Cub!

First of all, let me assure you that you did nothing wrong and my death was only my own stupid mistake, even though I have no concievable way of knowing that when I wrote this. For all I know, you may have joined the Death Eaters, but I will still say these things.

Second, I will explain to you, in detail, why I don't trust Dumbledore or the Weasleys. And I would have arranged a way for you to escape from their grasp with the help of the Goblins. I had no problems, even as an escaped convict, everything happened smoothly, and I was able to talk to and meet the Goblins without anyone ever knowing about it.

Why did I never actually tell you about my suspicions? Because. (To the reader, this statement is not missing any words.)

Anyhow, wishing you a happy life, and good luck!

Padfoot/Sirius Orion Black.

"That out of the way," Ragnok rubbed his hands gleefully, "let's start reading your results."

After twenty years and lots of talking, the reading was finally complete. Here are some snippets from the intervening years:

1.

"I am the king of United Kingdom? How does that even work? I mean, I can't really change the current government in place, just because I say things people will just not start agreeing with me, will they? Also, do you really want the readers to think that the backwards society full of wars and kingdoms and nobility is better than the Democracy in place today?"

2.

"Azkaban? What do you mean I rule Azkaban?"

3.

"Harems? Now I think you're just messing with me."

4.

"What the hell does a marriage contract even mean? And why do I have said contracts with all the witches in Hogwarts, including McGonagall?"

5.

"I have how many Animagus forms?" "Yes."

6.

"Is there a single house in the whole world not owned by Potter family?"

And lastly...

"I still don't understand," Harry was saying, "How can I have the powers of both dragons and yoki ona?"

"You're Harry bloody Potter. Learn to accept these things and move on."

"I guess." Harry was still unsure.

"Now then. Do you know of a method for me to get better at combat training? Also, can you help me travel back to when I was fifteen? I think Dumbledore might suspect something has gone wrong."

"Certainly. Here, have this particularly skilled Goblin teacher, learn all about fighting, then go back in time through that time chamber over there. I sometimes think there may be much better ways of utilizing that chamber..." Harry was staring at him. Other Goblins were staring at him. Nifflers digging through the dirt to get to the gold stopped and stared at him.

"I'm joking!" Harry released a relieved sigh. "As if I am going to do something logical for a change."

All of them laughed uproariously. Such a silly idea that was.

"And don't forget about the paintings of your parents in your vault! Dumbledore obviously didn't tell you about them because he is Evil with a capital E and should just start singing haikus because that's how evil he is."

Harry thanked Ragnok for his help as he was being led away by the Goblin trainer he had been assigned.

He stopped at the door.

"But we totally forgot to discuss how many galleons I have," he turned and addressed Ragnok.

Ragnok smiled. "How many do you want?"

** Reason number 394 why I read fanfics pre-OOTP.

I remember browsing once, and came across about 3 nearly identical stories like this from the same author, then a few more by other authors.

It begins to feel like a website generated story. "Pick Harry's pairing" "Pick Harry's year" "Bashing (Pick atleast 3) - Dumbledore [/] - Ron [/] - Ginny [/] - Molly [/] - Snape [/] - Draco [/] - Hermione []"

Those stories begin to drive me away from my preferred pairings and look for other stories.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

******** It depends, like yeah, he's the biggest asshole going and is pretty much the wizarding world's version of Benito Mussolini, but I would think that he would know how to behave in proprietary settings, even if he didn't want to if it's only just to one-up them. High society would come down on him like a ton of bricks if he didn't.

I honestly get the feeling that he'd do it then once it was over, go home and bitch about it because it strikes me as a very Malfoy thing to do.

I assume it would be similar to him not bowing to the Queen in a crowded room, as an example, you don't need to, and are actually exempt it if you have movement issues, but even a bob of the head is more polite than just flat out doing it.

But then, I don't tend to write Lucius much, as I find him a tough character to pin down, so I'm probably wrong.

** This sort of thing reminds me of an essay I read about how white men have been sold a myth that they're entitled to the world, so they feel cheated when most of them wind up slaving away in cubicles like everyone else. They're waiting for their true identity to be discovered so they'll get handed the kingdom that is their birthright. This isn't just a Harry Potter thing.

Edited to add: The essay is [[https://medium.com/@IjeomaOluo/the-anger-of-the-white-male-lie-6f9a6e646d47][here]] if anyone wants to read it. It's about the phenomenon of the white male mass shooter. It's not racist to acknowledge that this phenomenon exists.

Here's an excerpt:

“White men are the only people allowed to fully believe in the American dream and perhaps that is the cruelest thing to have ever been done to them and the world that has to suffer their anger as they refuse to let go of a fantasy that we were never allowed to imagine ourselves in.”

Edited again to add: This spoof is great, but leaves out a few things, like the house elves Harry inherits. Yes Harry, your ancestors owned slaves, therefore you deserve to own slaves, and they know their place and are delighted to serve you.

Of course the cliche suddenly becoming rich and powerful has universal appeal, but this inheritance trope is more specific than that. This trope says that since your ancestors were rich and powerful, you deserve to be too.

I would know, given I grew up watching them.

The draw of "wealth and power inheritance" is it's convenience and expedience: it comes to you fast, out of nowhere and solves all your problems over night miraculously, like winning the lottery---you really think caucasians are the only ones attracted to such scenario? I'm not white and I can tell you right now I wouldn't mind stumbling upon some titles and gold filled vaults. Not one bit.

I would accept the argument that the trope is directed for people in the medium to lower levels of economic strata, but to make it specifically about white people? That's categorically false and sheltered view, I would say.

****** The essay is by an American, so it describes US-specific race relations. No doubt people in other countries have different experiences and expectations.

There are various fantastical ways to suddenly solve all your problems. Inheritance is one, but there's also winning the lottery as you mentioned, randomly finding some amazing thing, etc. I think that in the US at least, whites find it easier to imagine themselves in a story about a suddenly inheriting their magnificent birthright than people of other colors would.

****** This is literally the first paragraph of the link you gave me: “School of Resentment is a term coined by critic Harold Bloom to describe related schools of literary criticism which have gained prominence in academia since the 1970s and which Bloom contends are preoccupied with political and social activism at the expense of aesthetic values.[1]”

That's the entire point of Bloom's argument, that we shouldn't let political and social activism diminish our appreciation of important works of literature. I don't think the fics being satirized here qualify.

***** I don't know, man. I've been reading fics for about... 13 years I think? and some of these tropes are just so very common.

It has nothing to do with fic length either. Harry Crow (not linking that) is 737,006 long, and it's pretty much unanimously considered as crap.

It doesn't have to follow every point in the formula, but the ones mentioned are considered the "bad" ones.

******** *Mary Sue*

A Mary Sue is an idealized and seemingly perfect fictional character. Typically, this character is recognized as an author insert or wish fulfillment. They can usually perform better at tasks than should be possible given the amount of training or experience, and usually are able through some means to upstage the protagonist of an established fictional setting, such as by saving the hero.
