Let's say the entire fourth year class had been forced to compete together in every task. Obviously to counteract this advantage drumstrang and beaucbaxtons is allowed to have a seventh year class a piece.

The tasks stay the same but are now scaled up or harder.

What changes in regards to the books story and it's aftermath?


** I mean there's nothing in the books explicitly stating that the trials are set in stone for that specific tournament. The organizers could just agree to have the trials be some random games, then have a new tournament without the goblet.

** It's a massacre. Dragons weed out the weakest, second task leads to a lot of lost loved ones and even more weeding out, maze in the third task means only the strongest make it to the cup, and whoever touches the portkey gets massacred by Voldemort and his death eaters. Harry portkeys back to Hogwarts with a look of sheer trauma on his face. Lucius Malfoy who managed to pull strings to get Draco out of the tournament is clapping along with Minister Fudge.

** The Patil sisters Stood on one of the tables at the great Hall acting as announcers calling out the ballots The entirety of the fourth year class had been selected as champions for this deadly tournament, They had taken a vote as to what to do about it. So far the prevailing consensus was to let Harry Potter handle it. But Hermione's Initiative for a Tournament study group to gaining tractionWith the backing of most of Gryffindor house,All of Ravenclaw and Half the Puffs but Draco Malfoy was being a prat about The prospect of facing a dragon so They had to do a second ballot. The Study group suggestion won, Much to Harry's relief. Malfoy stormed out of the hall in a huff muttering About his father hearing about this, when Susan Bones raised the Question about how the winnings would be divided the collective student body groaned And pulled out their quills again They would have to have another vote

  Hermione dies to a surprise attack just before walking off into the sunset and wakes up to find out that her life up until now has been a video game or at least that's what all of the signs are pointing to. This is her attempt to play through the game as other characters so that she can try to get brought back to life.

** I think at that point it'd be beyond a shadow of a doubt that some serious shenanigans were afoot, the whole thing would be written off as a mulligan, and they would use a different method to choose their champions.

** And when the entire 4th year class is pulled into this you would hope that the professors/tournament organizers would scale the tasks down not make them more difficult. If I was a parent I would make sure that if the professors/tournament organizers didn't reduce the danger and difficulty of the tasks that I would straight out kill them for putting my child in danger. And I'm sure I would get several other parents to join me. I wouldn't sue or press charges I would go straight to harming those who put my child in danger.

Now due to the Goblets "protections" I might not be able to do it before the tournament was over but they would know that after it was over if they did not scale down the tasks they would be killed regardless if my child made it through the task without a scratch.

*** This is a society where their sport involves hurling heavy semi-sentient metal balls at their 12 year old children, where throwing children out of windows to encourage accidental magic is barely frowned upon, and where it takes many spectators dying to cancel a tournament (only for it to come back in a barely less lethal form). If they didn't scale the tasks down for the 14 year old, I don't think they'll do it for the far more capable class of 14 year olds.
