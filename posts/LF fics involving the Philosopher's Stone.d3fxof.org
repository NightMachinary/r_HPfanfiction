Anything where it plays a more prominent role or where it's limits and abilities are further explained.

For example, could the Stone be used for other things beside gold and Elixir? If you could make weapons grade plutonium, that'd be pretty neat. Tactical magic mini nukes! Or maybe you could just make a ton of gold and throw money at any problem, that'd be a pretty interesting strategy too. Or what if you mass produce Elixir and sell it as cure for cancer?

The Stone and the Flamels offer so many possibilities that are so rarely explored.

Do you want inflation and a devalued currency? Because this is how you get inflation and a devalued currency.

*** Well, that explains why the value of Galleons to Pounds is constantly fluctiating. It's not that JKR is bad at math, it's that Flamel keeps making more money and Gringotts has to constantly remove some from circulation to make up for it.

*** Yeah, but if you were to throw it at the muggle economy... it'd devalue gold, but you'd still get a hefty profit from it.

Not that philosophers stone really matters, anyone with a modicum of a brain and some muggle knowledge could make a killer profit from muggle economy with secretly applied magic in the right areas

*** Not as much as you'd think. A tonne of gold is worth like 64 million USD. On average, 2500 tonnes of gold are mined each year. An extra two or three more than usual wouldn't impact much.

One of my favourite ongoing fics right now actually, and kind of a rare pairing. You will have to be patient for the stone to come into play, but it does come into the plot eventually.
