What You Leave Behind and Lesser Evils has Harry use his cloak as an actual cloak. And he wants to be invisible, he can will it so. It has little nifty features. Making it a more special invisibility cloak (one of the hallows) and not just a fucking blanket like the one Moody (or Crouch, was it?) and Rosier (in the Santi's story) have.

In a Cadmean Victory, Harry uses transfiguration to block the unforgivable curses and he can turn his Fienfyre into a basilisk. I think he's got the Balrog firewhip too.

So, I'm looking for stories -- preferably, complete -- where Harry learns how to use magic like that. Or in other cool ways. Bonus points if he's into dark magic and doesn't want to shag Voldemort/Snape AND the author doesn't drone on and on about "the light" and how stupid/lame they are.

thx


** Linkffn(10937871) Blindness has Harry who has expert control of his magic and manipulates Fiendfire. He also has a deep connection to the Hallows, regularly wearing the cloak.

Linkffn(9704180) "I'm Still Here" by kathryn518 has Fiendfire shenanigans, specifically [[/s][using legilimency to take control of wild fiendfire]]

linkao3(4413323) A Big Happy Weasley Family has the Hallows messing with Harry's mind and making him more aggressive... it is also pure smut. But the final chapter does resolve the Hallows story in a way I wish someone else would borrow.

Linkffn(11669575) For Love Of Magic has Butifly shields and a host of other inventions, although the story takes a while to ramp up. Harry is way into Nietzschean philosophy in this one so take that as it is. There is smut but it's mostly story related smut.

Linkffn(9036071) With Strength of Steel Wings seems to fit the request, although it's been a while.

Linkffn(11585823) The Art of Self fashioning has a Harry who is super into transfiguring himself. The catch is that you lose elements of your humanity as you alter yourself. Like how Pettigrew looks very rat-like after so many years as a rodent, just turned up to eleven.

Not sure which ones are complete. I hope you find something you like.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

***** The author is very aware of it though. I love the scene where Tonks keeps shouting at her parents that it isn't a harem and Andromeda just praises her for making such a good catch.

It's totally a harem story but imo it's very different from the usual harem stories.
