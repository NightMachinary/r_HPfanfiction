Would a solar-powered calculator work in Hogwarts?


** If it's true that electronic devices don't work around magic then a solar powered calculator would most likely not work due to the failure of components (memory, computer chips, power conversion etc)

Now the problem is if magic is so damaging to electronic devices then why didn't Diagon Alley cause issues with the surrounding downtown London? Why didn't the muggle office building on top of the ministry (and those buildings all around it) have issues with all their electronics? Why didn't we read/hear of a muggleborn entering Diagon Alley forgetting they had an electronic device and that device failing?

As some fics suggested it's more likely that either a past headmaster didn't like the changes in the muggle world concerning electricity or when electricity was first introduced it was so poorly shielded (and some what "fragile" as new technology) that it didn't work at all/or reliably that the wizards decided to not use it. Over time that would result in each new generation of magicals being convinced that electronic devices don't work.

Now the only way that holds true with later more robust devices (that new muggleborn would be likely to bring in), would be a charm around hogwarts to ensure that the devices don't work. But would that mean other magical areas would have to have the same charm? Otherwise, one muggleborn receiving a cell phone call while in the alley or able to use an electronic device (radio, calculator) while in the alley would answer that question.

** Might be an anti-lightning charm someone put on Hogwarts in 1652 that messes up electronics.
