I like the Voldemort wins AUs where society has a dystopian feel to it with Voldemort/death eaters being in political positions and then a resistance is brewing. (So taking any recs in that category as well)

But wondering if there are fics where let's say Voldemort is defeated but then things don't wrap up in a pretty bow. Maybe ppl have differing opinions on how to proceed with carrying out justice/rebuilding society which leads to a split and infighting on the “good” side (do the ends justify the means, is it ok for some to be sacrificed for greater good, using dark magic for a good cause, etc). Or if war still ongoing maybe 2 leaders emerge on “good” side or disagreement in strategy leading to splits/infighting. I think it's common in civil conflict/war for more factions to emerge on either side leading to lots of in fighting or being surrounded on all sides in a sense.

I think this would be super interesting in the HP universe by offering more nuance/shades of grey to characters as the war drags on and people are pushed to their limits. I would love to see how the characters would split off. I even imagine a scenario where Voldemort wins but his reign is awful causing some kids of death eaters/adjacent to switch sides, meaning that the Order has to work with them but we know Gryffindor strategies are often different from Slytherin for example, which causes tension. or some people can't let go of old grudges or their personalities just clash terribly despite having same goal leading to tension, rifts, and new dynamics forming. Like I could imagine a few Slytherins with STRONG personalities needing to be hidden by order and in closed quarters for long periods with war tension just clashing HORRIBLY (prob comically) with stubborn hot headed Gryffindors.

OR

I could imagine a scenario where Voldemort is defeated and a new minister or political figure comes to power that maybe isn't so ~ultra villain~ to point of having no nose and red eyes but is maybe normal/charismatic at first then grows more sinister (authoritarian, secret police, heavy surveillance, or doing something dark behind the scenes) but some still support it maybe while others don't. I would like to see the characters involved in anti-govt/regime resistance but it would be interesting if it didn't revolve around outright pure blood bigotry, instead something else that creates a new dividing line and jumbles the sides.

BONUS:

-I enjoy getting to see strong characterizations and utilizing of other characters than just the golden trio (because I sort of know how they think already unless it's a situation where one becomes believably dark or something). I'd like to see more of Padma, Parvati, Angelina, Blaise, Theo, Pansy, Bill Weasley, George, or Fred...doesn't have to be main person but just prominent

-speaking of dark...I like to see the darker sides of characters slowly come out under the right circumstances. Not per se evil just maybe more ruthless, the ends justify the means, the negative side of an otherwise positive trait coming out, being corrupted, seeking revenge over justice, etc. l can def imagine a dark Sirius, Luna, Ginny, Fred or even Harry.

ALSO

- Prob obvious but I like them to be 17+ and not at hogwarts.

-I would really prefer to NOT read Snape/Harry or Snape/Hermione

-I'm very ok with mature rating, dark themes, horror elements

Any fics that touch on any of these things?

** You might like my story "Divided and Entwined", which focuses on a brutal civil war with multiple factions and its aftermath. Various characters are affected by the war, some sliding down a slippery slope, others managing to keep some of their principles. Often, actions have unintended consequences, affecting the plans of all factions. Even allies can ruin each other's plans.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
