...with an [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/50/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB][epilogue]], but it /is/ something.


** He'd started the Vaults of Valbonë on DLP a while ago. I don't know what's happening with all that /now/, but a number of chapters are there.

*** I think he's probably banned permanently from there, so if Vaults is ever written it'll be somewhere else

****** Wow that Xiph0 person comes across as a massive massive asshole. If that's how mods are expected to behave (and there's even Stockholm-syndrome like comments from users about how it was funny when Xiph did it to them) then yikes. The corporate speak excuses from Raven are also hilarious.

From my understanding, the "discourage" setting makes the whole site frustrating to use, yet Raven says nmb could have contacted any of them through it at any time? And nmb was put on discouragement for more than a week? Xiph is a massive asshole and I'm surprised other users haven't left in disgust. And Raven and other mods enable them IMHO.

******* No- he was muted on their IRC because of the 'argument'. Which is.. a generous way to describe that, frankly.

In response to that mute, he nuked the community C2 that he created, but to my understanding it was a group effort involving the whole site. That resulted in him getting banned, not the argument itself.

That said, this whole situation is kind of a series of fuckups.

This is how Xiph0 described the argument:

#+begin_quote
  People were discussing what made a good King and if there ever had been good Kings. I threw out Darius the Great as an example and some criteria (good administrator, raised standard of living, etc). He disagreed and I asked what the objection to Darius was. His response was to say 'assume we'll disagree on everything and let's just not'.

  Nothing crazy there, but enough to get you muted for a couple days just for not having a basic sense of civility. 
#+end_quote

Which is, frankly, a ridiculous reason to mute someone. Especially someone you have a previous, negative, history with. Which to my knowledge those two have never gotten along well. Civility is a fine thing to expect, but that was hardly outright rude or uncivil.

Enembee's response was also completely out of line, too. Assuming we take Raven at his word, and Enembee never contacted anyone that just makes it that much worse.

In the end, I think multiple people fucked up and it lead to this. I've got no issue with Enembee getting banned, honestly, but I think they should have some moderation changes and clearer guidelines for them. Maybe even some sort of small punishment for Xiph0, if they can think of something that fits. He didn't do anything horrible- he just muted someone that didn't take deserve it.

******** Doesn't that "mute" or discourage option make it harder to use the site as a whole? So I can see nmb trying to contact another mod and getting frustrated. TBH if someone had shat on me the way that Xiph character shat on nmb on a bad day, I might have responded like that. And the mod is being enabled and excused from the whole affair they started in the first place.

Ridiculous, to punish someone who literally backed away from arguing with you. What kind of internet dictatorship is that place? Anyway this is good warning to never try to start an account there. The users concerned about the impact this will have on community growth were right on, at least in my case.

**** No, lol, he started Vaults on there and being banned doesn't erase your posts.
