An interesting fic where Wormtail takes Harry to Voldemort instead of leading Voldy to him. Harry is raised as his son and all hell breaks loose.

I specifically suggest this fic because this has a Moreish quality, making you wanna read more. Which is handy as this author has a total of 10 stories in this universe. The main story, 2 sequels, a rewrite and 6 spin offs, all completed except for the rewrite.
