"It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.‚Äù This is one of the most important sentences in the entire series, thematically, and I think a good one for HPFF writers to keep in mind in many situations, but I'm gonna bring up Hermione.

Hermione /is/ the smart one of the trio, and of the series. It makes sense to flanderize this in fic a bit, and it's not uncommon to make her a genius with an eidetic memory.

But this is explicitly ruled out in canon. Hermione can't remember the details of the Chamber of Secrets despite having read Hogwarts, a History deeply enough to remember relevant facts from it. When she takes all the classes with the time turner, she gets 6 hours extra a day and still doesn't have time to do anything but study. In book 4, the reason she and Krum go to the Yule Ball together is all the time Hermione spends in the library.

Hermione isn't an innate genius, she /chooses/ to dedicate herself to learning.


** But there's some inconsistencies with Hermione's characters in the book too. As you say, she shows she puts in a lot of work to learn, but in other books - especially beginning in book 5 - her character slightly changes to include things like eidetic memory.

For instance, in the beginning of book 5 she is able to recite Dumbledore's end of year speech post the triwizard tournament /word for word/. It's inconsistent that she retains knowledge like a normal person when it comes to textbooks, but is able to remember and recite a speech word for word after hearing it once.

Ron even points this out in the book! - he remembers the gist of what Dumbledore said in his speech but points out how odd it was that she was able to pull lines of his speech from memory.

There's other little bits of this that occur in the later books where she has this perfect memory /when the situation necessitates it./

And I think these changes happened because the movies started before Rowling started writing book 5 - so I think her characterizations were influenced from the movies and the casting choices and even fanon to some extent. Especially since she said she never reread her books.

You can see a shift in the characters when you compare the earlier books to the later books - they were once consistent between book 1-4 but lost that consistency starting with book 5. And I think the inconsistencies are more than just the characters being older in the later books.

***** I'd rather see a fic where /all/ characters go transhumanist (transwizardist?), and it's a part of the setting. I wrote down some ideas along these lines a while ago, but I don't feel up to writing the fic. Here's the basic premise.

It's implied in (or at least consistent with) canon that injury inflicted Dark Arts tends to be irreversible. A corollary of that is that trying to magically alter another person in a /beneficent/ way over and above their baseline state doesn't stick. So, for example, if Pomfrey magically upgraded someone's muscles to have superhuman strength, they'd pretty quickly "heal" back to their baseline human musculature. This makes for the setting's defining element: magical enhancement ("transwizardism") only works if /self-inflicted/.

As a result, all children when they enter Hogwarts start at baseline human level, and Hogwarts has a class, alongside Charms and Transfiguration, on how to alter oneself safely (or at least not too dangerously). Everybody is expected to apply those skills to themselves under teachers' supervision as they progress through Hogwarts. Indeed, starting from third year or so, a typical baseline human may well be fundamentally incapable of keeping up with the curriculum. Along the way, students have to make choices about which self-enhancements they will attempt and when, keeping in mind the risks involved every step of the way.

Some technique developers offer services where they teach a self-enhancement technique, have the customer perform it, and then Obliviate them of the memory of the technique. Wit-Sharpening Potions and the like are used heavily, though usually saved for special occasions due to side-effects. False Memory Charms are sometimes used to transfer knowledge and teach skills, though each application needs to be individualised. Magical prosthetics a la Moody's eye are used by many.

Of course, some families have their own secret techniques for "self-improvement" as well, and some self-alterations involve Dark Arts, human sacrifice, or prices to be paid by the subject. Horcruxes and how to make and destroy them is public knowledge, but after a millennia-long arms race, they are a useful, but not an overwhelming tool, especially considering the costs. The Werewolf Contaigion is a result of someone a few centuries prior trying to make the animagus ability hereditary. They turned out to have side-effects and be contagious instead.

Of course, what's the point of a setting without a plot? I don't have one, though I guess just building on a skeleton of canon events could work. Specifically,

- Voldemort, who's come up with some clever applications of horcruxes, gets discorporated when attacking Harry as a baby. (Potterverse magic like sacrificial protection still works.)
- He is trying to get his body back. Due to the number of self-enhanced geniuses running around, Philosopher's Stones can actually be bought on the open market. But, they are still very expensive, and getting through security measures of those who can afford them is extremely challenging.
- One of Voldemort's earlier attempts at immortality was an upload of his memories able to interface with existing minds. It unleashes something nastier than a basilisk. Because, you see,

  - A mere canon!basilisk couldn't evade Hogwarts's professors with their lifetimes of self-enhancement.
  - A mere canon!basilisk couldn't challenge a tricked-out 6th-year Prefect like Penelope Clearwater when she knows about its capabilities. Mind you, Penny, befitting a Ravenclaw, had prioritised cognitive enhancements over physical. As a result, the rate at which she can cast spells that she can't cast wandlessly is limited by how quickly she can move her hands, which are still fairly close to baseline human.
  - Nonetheless, Ginnymort has to personally intervene to defeat her and Hermione (who's been climbing the transwizard ladder faster than anyone in her year).
  - Sword of Gryffindor is a lot more than an indestructible sword. It actually melds with the wielder's mind and body and does the fighting for them. In its final mode, it tends to leave the wielder on the brink of death, and it takes immediate medical treatment or phoenix tears to keep them from succumbing.
  - Ginny suffers long-term effects of possession, particularly because Diary!Tom had her rush self-enhancements that are on one hand very powerful for her age, but on the other hand not well calibrated. Nor is she ever completely cleared of his influence.

- The simulated Hell that is Azkaban does not hold Sirius, because it is designed to interface with human minds, not canine. Remus---a secret carrier of the Werewolf contagion---teaches Defence. Hippogryphs are a cross-breeding experiment that had escaped into the wild.
- Transwizard Tournament happens. Harry gets roped into it, and Barty Crouch Jr.---or, rather, his brain transplanted into Alastor Moody's magicyborg body---helps him along.

  - In order to accurately emulate Moody's behaviour in front of Hogwarts's hyperintelligent professors, BCJ keeps Moody's brain is in a jar in his trunk, trapped in a virtual reality simulation. Its inputs are piped in from the sensors on the magicyborg, and its outputs are piped back to BCJ's brain to give him some idea of what Moody would say and do in that situation.
  - There are several close calls, as Moody repeatedly discovers that he had been kidnapped and tries to skew his responses to trick BCJ into doing something that would expose him. But BCJ is good enough to improvise, and then Obliviates Moody's brain and keeps going.
  - To keep up with the tournament, Harry has to take some risky temporary enhancers, which last long enough for him to escape the Graveyard (or its analogue), but the withdrawal requires him to be isolated from magic for the subsequent two months.

And so on.

****** More ideas:

- Time-turners either don't exist or never appear. However, students wanting to take more classes than chronologically possible can be cloned and taught a technique for resynchronising mental states between clones. This form of cloning has severe limitations, however. The clones share a soul, and it's an unnatural state of affairs, so it can become stressful. In particular,

  - If both clones try to do magic at the same time, the result can be severe damage to the soul.
  - Some curses---the Unforgivables in particular---will affect every clone if they hit any clone. As a result, having a clone stashed away in a safe location isn't that good a security measure if someone really wants to kill you.
  - Spells exist that if cast on a person who has live clones will give an indication of how many there are and where. (Similar but much more difficult magic exists for horcruxes.)
  - The difficulty of self-enhancement grows exponentially when there are clones of you around, since they need to receive identical enhancements or soul damage can happen.
  - Horcruxes can be used to work around some of these limitations.
  - As a result, it is usual to make a clone for, say, a research project or for taking more classes than chronologically possible, resynchronise periodically, then have one of the clones (often determined by coin toss) autoeuthanise when the project is finished or when self-enhancement needs to be done.
  - As a social convention, clones are expected to designate one (usually determined by coin toss after every resynchronisation) as the "main" clone, who carries the wand and engages in the social interactions, while the others are expected to stay out of everybody's way, emerging only when attending classes, researching in the library, etc..
  - So, indeed, for most of their Hogwarts career, there are two Hermiones, two Percys, and two of various other ambitious students running around, though they are rarely seen together.

- Animagus transformations are very rarely used not because they are difficult but because unlike most self-enhancement magic, it doesn't get quicker or easier with more self-enhancement. No matter how good one is, animagus magic takes up a huge amount of time during which one can do very little else. Nobody has been able to come up with a way to reduce that time (and one such attempt produced the Werewolf Contagion).

** One nitpick:

#+begin_quote
  When she takes all the classes with the time turner, she gets 6 hours extra a day and still doesn't have time to do anything but study.
#+end_quote

She also takes the time to master a completely foreign legal system just from reading books in a library, and without any help from a wizard legal expert.

One thing worth keeping in mind when gauging Hermione's talent is that her highest priority is not magical prowess or even magical knowledge. If it were those, she'd be in Slytherin or Ravenclaw, respectively. Instead, she always prioritises fighting for justice and helping others---whether it's Harry, Buckbeak, house-elves, or her classmates---over her own advancement.

She spends a lot of time studying, yes, and she often learns spells far ahead of the curriculum; but she also studies academic subjects like Ancient Runes (which is basically a language class), and reads obscure history books for fun.

I think that there is a general tendency in the fandom to treat Hermione's achievements in magic as being the full extent of her potential, whereas treating, say, Harry's achievements as just the beginning---that he could have been vastly more powerful had he just worked harder; but we forget just how much time Hermione had spent helping Harry and others get better at magic, getting little in return.

**** I think that /most/ people, when they talk about "intelligence" of a student in a school, are referring to talent, IQ, and other traits that are at least supposed to not be very mutable (or, more precisely, there are things, like infant lead exposure, that can reduce them, but one can't do much to increase them). Also, as far as I can tell, eidetic memory isn't actually a proven phenomenon for healthy adults.

Me, I think it's both, and canon gives us quite a bit of leeway. Hermione /is/ naturally gifted, and she works hard---though not always on things that increase her magical ability. One can try to tease nature apart from nurture, but that's an open problem even at the population level, and for Hermione in particular, we get a few early bits of evidence of extraordinary raw talent, and after that we can't tell how much of it is hard work. (I am referring to her being able to cast spells solely based on reading about them before she even started Hogwarts, and that her first Transfiguration during the first lesson was better than anyone's.)

From the point of view of fanfic, the number of readable fics in which Hermione's is portrayed as an actual genius /and/ her genius has actual plot impact beyond the first few chapters is small. There are many more fics in which Hermione invents something that kickstarts the plot and then never does anything interesting again; or in which she researchers a power-up for Harry and fades into the background. The number of fics in which Hermione translates her intelligence into magical power is tiny.

I get a bit more annoyed by so-called smart!Harry fics, in which Harry gets a personality and talent rewrite that gives him (or her, if fem!Harry) all of Hermione's virtues and talents but none of her flaws and disadvantages, then flaunts how much better this upgraded!Harry is than Hermione.

Don't let Harry (or Hermione) get all the credits for winning. The series says friendship is great, and I think that's a great message. But for god's sake let his/her friends be useful and make some key contributions.

You see it in a lot of fics where Harry has more friends and each and (suddenly, for no good reason) everyone has to fill some kind of unique role (like a puzzle piece), employing a particular set of skills ("oh a botany problem, quick call Neville the green thumb)".

It creates the kind of impression where every story supposedly needs some kind of ensemble cast that can be used to approach the different facets of a problem. Why? In any other story the protagonist just has to make due without intelligence if he isn't particularly smart. That's it. No further action required.

The "characters are describable by particular skillsets instead of being actual characters" makes it so much more boring: "Oh there's a pure-blood snob standing our way, but hey, in my giant bag of holding I have Daphne, who is good at pureblood politics and will remove this obstacle" instead of "Damn, I don't know how to deal with this obstacle, I have to think on my feet and use my wits". Having to read one story after another where Susan Bones is just a glorified stepping stone into the Ministry and politics or law-enforcement just makes me sad.

I strongly disagree. Bashing is just lazy characterization, showing how a writer is incapable of making you dislike a character/see them as wrong and still write them like a realistic human being.

I'd use Molly Weasley as a case in point. Still a realistic human being who loves her kids, loves Harry like a son, is generally a kind hearted loving woman -- and also believes everything she reads, and jumps to conclusions.

#+begin_quote
  Because you can't realistically break up the golden trio without a reason?
#+end_quote

Sure you can. Ron drops dead of a heart attack. The hit from the chess piece in book 1 is fatal. Literally thousands of different ways, not all of which require death.

Edit: Just a few off the top of my head for good measure ; Hermione's parents take her out of Hogwarts for safety reasons, Ron's parents run out of money and can't afford schooling anymore, Harry/Hermione and Ron get into a very strong cultural difference between them that is reasonable for both sides to have (Unbreakable vows ; Harry wants every wizard to swear to not be a murderer so someone like Voldemort cant happen, Ron see's this as a massive taboo) ect ect

And as far as Malfoy goes, I'd say canon ultimately just veers off from bashing in the last few books. Malfoy isn't a complete incompetent, he fixes the Vanishing Cabinet and contributes to the plot. Thats one difference between an antagonist and character bashing- success. Another would be learning from your mistakes, like Malfoy does in the last book. Another difference would be how Malfoy doesn't repeatedly shoot himself in the foot for no reason, which Ron sure as hell does nothing but in the fic you linked.

Bashing is pointlessly exposing a person's flaws. I'm of the opinion that you can use a trope like... Potions Queen Molly, and that wouldn't be bashing. It's a plot device.

And Chess is certainly no good metaphor for actual military engagements because of their unpredictable nature and lack of information about the enemy.

Except that everyone knew that the Russian winter was a thing and about the general difficulty which was to be expected. The German Empire even won the Eastern Front in WWI, and that front was completely expected (although not the speed of the Russian mobilization in 1914).

Napoleon lost because the Russians razed their +own capital+ major city and took every bit of food they could. It was also not a second front because he had already defeated everyone on the continent and couldn't hope to challenge the Royal Navy after Trafalgar.

Charles XII was completely mad and somehow his attack on Moscow ended up in modern-day Ukraine.

Hitler underestimated the Red Army because they had horrible losses against Finland in the Winter War. And even then it was Land-Lease which kept the Soviets in the fight. It was also not really a second front for him but the main battlefield, since the Eastern Front was where the overwhelming majority of German divisions was deployed (153 compared to 2-3 in the Afrika Korps or the 12 which garrisoned France)

Moscow was not the capital in 1812, St Petersburg was the capital from 1730 up until the Revolution.

Second, it was the combination of the USSR's failures in their 1920 war against Poland, and then the Winter War with Finland that convinced a notable amount of the German command that the USSR couldn't fight.

Third, Lend-Lease's importance is generally considered to be the first year of having it. After that most believe that the Soviet economy move to the Urals had kickstarted into high gear.

Well, let's put it that way, without land lease, the Soviets could not have come back in that war. While it would have not been over by Christmas 1941, it would have been pretty much decided as the Soviet economy would have been on the brink of collapsing, as that video points out. There would have been no Soviet counter-offensive in that Winter because LL was that crucial to the Soviet military. And ammunition was in short supply at that time as well.

I totally disagree with this point. While I admit that knowing more spell may give an hedge in some situation, I don't think it automatically make someone more powerfull. It only represent a part of the strenght.

Hermione may know more spell that Harry and Ron, but she is also doesn't react well to stress, and in a situation of pure combat, I'm pretty sure you would be better with Ron than her.

As for Dumbledore and Voldemort, with the exception of their duel in OotP, they may stand at the top, but their spell repertoire isn't that great; I think that outside of it, Voldemort may uses something like 4 or 5 spells? And it's still enough to be the boss).

And my point was that some people use the fact that Hermione has good grade to make wide assuption about her, and make her way more talented than she is. Yes she gets a lot of O, but it doesn't make she can "make her wand do things I have never see before" as Dumbledore did during his OWLs. It's like saying "I got the best grade on my A level, where is my Nobel Price?". And since people are using this tiny bit of information to make so much assumption we are in the OOC territory, they can as well do the same with Ron.

** Yeah, I don't think JKR ever intended to make Hermione all that magically special - none of Harry's generation are. If you were to put magical ability into tiers, I'd put Hermione in tier 3 with people like Percy Weasley and Remus Lupin (where tier 1 is Dumbledore/Voldemort and tier 2 is Snape/McGonagall).

That "tier 3" is essentially that of a skilled generalist: achieving a high level of competency in all (or most) areas of magic, but not setting the world on fire in any. Intelligent and hard working, these people are in the top 5% of magical skill but there's a huge gulf between them and those in "tier 2".

For tier 3, magic doesn't come to them naturally like it does to the most talented, and sometimes they struggle with the material (in HBP, Hermione is said to be finding NEWT Transfiguration difficult).

In that regard, I would actually put Hermione a bit below someone like Lupin, as Hermione is not quite a straight-O student - she has a consistent weakness in Defence Against the Dark Arts.

When you look at Hermione's greatest magical achievements in canon, they are:

- Consistently knowing spells ahead of time.

- Looking up and executing the Polyjuice Potion as a second year.

- Looking up and executing the Protean Charm as a fifth year.

- Looking up and executing the Undetectable Extension Charm as a sixth year.

Contrast James Potter:

- Became an animagus in fifth year without assistance.

- Created the Marauder's Map, a unique magical item.

- Had mastered non-verbal magic by fifth year.

- Achieved Os in his OWLs without any study whatsoever.

There's just a step-change between Hermione and James Potter. Hermione is looking things up and executing them ahead of when a student would normally learn those things; James Potter has the level of talent where he is extending magic to new areas and mastering skills which many wizards /never/ master. Additionally, Hermione is having to work hard for her achievement, whereas by all accounts James Potter achieves his largely through natural talent.

A common response to all this is that JKR has called Hermione a genius in an interview.

Firstly, I'm not sure JKR's interpretation of a character is final, similar to if she declares Snape a hero. JKR gets to dictate the facts, but not the interpretation. And the facts are those above.

Secondly, I suspect that JKR would consider being in the top 5% an example of genius. When JKR calls Hermione a genius, she's not saying Hermione is a Dumbledore-level talent. She is simply referring to those traits listed above and describing them as genius i.e. she would say the same of Remus Lupin.

*None of this is intended to bash Hermione.* She's a great character. In particular, she has capacity to grow and adapt as a character. A Muggleborn, by GoF she is describing technology as a "replacement for magic". That capacity for change is admirable and makes her a joy to write.

But there's a certain group in the fandom who interpret portraying Hermione faithfully to canon as a form of bashing. That is unfortunate.

I have been accused of bashing Hermione in Victoria Potter. I don't think this is the case. Rather I portray Hermione faithfully to canon:

- I consistently portray Hermione as getting magic very quickly, to the point where she would easily be top of the class if Victoria were not around.

- I contrast Hermione's canonical approach to magical study - namely, rushing ahead to study more advanced magic ahead of time - with Victoria's approach of sticking with a topic and delving deep into it. It's a classic tortoise vs hare situation.

- I portray Hermione as capable of learning from her mistakes, whereas bashed characters are stuck in a loop of making the same errors again and again. When Victoria expresses her intuition as regards the workings of the Arrival of Happi (a potion), Hermione's initial reaction was to reject it as having no basis (it's not in their textbook). A bashed character would continue to reject that intuition even when faced with its success, but Hermione looks into the matter further on her own time.

*** I think it's a portrayal of Hermione that would work in a fanfic - but I don't agree with it in canon, particularly the comparison to James Potter. The big issue to me is that it's very difficult (if not impossible) to truly compare across generations in the series - because we see Harry's generation through 7 years, compared to just snippets of the other ones. Inconsistent at that, as well.

For instance, even the number of OWLs is something that is mentioned offhand for some characters (eg, Bill and Percy having 12) /before/ JKR actually went out and did the schedules - and are a number that is basically impossible to attend all the classes for from what we see in canon (other than assuming that Hermione's time turner was a regular thing) - leading to us having to jump through hoops to try to justify how that's possible.

In the same way, we get snippets of the other characters in ways that stand out as more unrelated. Like becoming an animagus - how hard is it, when Pettigrew did it as well? Is it a sign of his hidden genius, or that it might not be as hard as we think? What kind of support did they all have?

It's like the Polyjuice potion - it's described as very difficult, but from the way Hermione (and the others) make it in canon, it comes across as not all that hard.

So for nitpicks from your list:

1) Hermione doesn't just consistently know spells ahead of time, she consistently gets/achieves them first in classes when exposed to them - and is able to help others get it, even when she's first exposed to them in practical exercises.

2) We don't know the assistance James Potter got - but he at the least had the support of his friends.

3) James co-created the Marauder's map, and we don't know anything about the details there.

4) We have no idea about his OWL scores, nor the amount of study. From the canon results, I think it's /very/ unlikely that anyone but Voldemort and Dumbledore received all Os.

Your following description of James includes "James Potter has the level of talent where he is extending magic to new areas and mastering skills which many wizards never master. [...] whereas by all accounts James Potter achieves his largely through natural talent."

Again, there's no indication that James has extended magic to new areas - the closest we get to that is the Map, which we have 0 knowledge of in canon in terms of its creation. It could be as easy as magically hacking into Hogwarts' wards, and putting it in an enchanted object that they took years to make - advanced, yes, difficult, of course, but extending magic to new areas? We don't know. As for wizards never mastering skills, wizards are apparently by and large lazy and don't bother mastering many things - like shield spells, the patronus, and a host of other skills that Harry & his friends manage. Animagus could be easy and tedious, and that would be enough to stop most wizards from trying it. Finally, the achievements that you find most impressive with James are all outside of class - and there's no indication that he did not have to work hard on those.

In fact, the animagus transformation is said to have taken three years of intense study for both James and Sirius - that's hardly skating by on natural talent.

*** I don't think that your comparison of James and Hermione is very fair. In terms of the listed achievements,

- James didn't create the Marauder's Map; he co-created it with three others. Hermione had far less help than that from her friends.
- If we are going by Pottermore, Animagus transformation has little to do with magical skill and a lot to do with investment of time and resources---and, for vast majority of wizards, is not worth it unless one lucks into a useful form or has special circumstances. For that matter, he did it with two collaborators, and we have no idea what resources and assistance the four of them might have had from their half- and pureblood parents.
- Where are you getting that he achieved straight Os on his OWLs without studying? And, how many OWLs? (It's not on the Wiki, as far as I can tell.)

Also, there were a number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that would have caused James to achieve higher magical prowess than Hermione, other things being equal, and few countervailing ones.

- James had few demands on his time outside of Quiddich. Hermione had either a Harry-related crisis or some campaign against injustice every year at Hogwarts but HBP.
- James had a good study group, with at least one equal collaborator and two decent ones to facilitate his achievements, as well as a bitter rival to motivate him to get better at combat magic. Hermione had none of that, and her friends were probably a net burden in terms of studying and getting /herself/ better at magic.
- James's hobbies that we know of---pranking in a magical school---were ones whose practice would improve his mastery of magic. Hermione's hobbies---history, activism---were not.

  But there's a certain group in the fandom who interpret portraying Hermione faithfully to canon as a form of bashing. That is unfortunate. I have been accused of bashing Hermione in Victoria Potter. I don't think this is the case. Rather I portray Hermione faithfully to canon:
#+end_quote

I've read your Alexandra Potter series, and I've read myriad fics with this general premise, but I haven't read your Victoria Potter series, so I am speculating here... Would it be accurate to say that your Victoria Potter is some combination of being significantly more generally intelligent and/or talented in magic than canon!Harry; being significantly more curious, organised and driven than canon!Harry; being significantly more strategic and less impulsive than canon!Harry; and having significantly better social skills than canon!Harry---all without being meaningfully worse than canon!Harry in any of these areas?

Unless I am completely wrong, this upgraded!fem!Harry will have acquired many, perhaps all of Hermione's talents and virtues, without acquiring any of her flaws and disadvantages. Now, every time your upgraded!fem!Harry and canon-level!Hermione interact, the fact of how much better your fem!Harry is than Hermione---often at the very things that canon!Hermione was supposed to be good at---will be rubbed in the reader's face. Am I wrong?

I don't know if that would fulfil a dictionary definition of "character bashing" (if one existed), but it would certainly feel like character bashing if I were to read a scene like that.

One of the key differences between James and Hermione, and and you touched upon this, is that from what we understand James readily shared in creation and discovery with his friends. Hermione approached learning as a singular activity in which she hurried off to find an answer to bring back to her friends group. Harry, as well, was prone to doing this. These character traits aren't failings of other people or even failings of the characters. They just forever handicap where your potential is going to be.

We see that the generation of Harry and his parents got to the higher tier of magical excellence due to consistent collaboration. Magic wasn't a singular study for them. Snape and Lily were partners pushing each other to be better. The Marauders learned how to do everything they did with each other. Harry, Hermione, and Ron...learn things individually and then report back to the group. It isn't until the fifth book that they start learning more advanced magic collaboratively, and this results in (excuse the terminology) a skill buff of sorts for the entire group.

So Hermione is an exceptionally bright character, but she was always going to top out at a certain level simply because of the type of person she was. She's smart, but she lacks the social skill and learning style that has been shown to accelerate people to a higher tier of magic.

I agree that a good study group would have benefited Hermione in particular, but I don't think lack of one was a consequence of the trio's character traits or attitudes as much as of their circumstances. Hermione had no equals or even near-equals that we know of in her year---and certainly not in her year in Gryffindor. The closest were actually Harry and Ron, and they had very little interest in learning magic over and above the curriculum, unless they had an immediate need.

Could they have gone bigger? Harry got ostracised by his House and the rest of Hogwarts at the drop of a hat, while a lot of what they did required utmost secrecy, with life and death at stake. With whom could they collaborate?

Meanwhile, James & Co. were conveniently sharing a dorm and had common interests and attitudes---or, at least, James and Sirius did, but Remus went along out of loyalty and Peter out of sycophancy. They could also be a lot more open about their activities: with the exception of the animagus transformation, the worst consequences of their secrets being revealed would be a foiled prank and a detention.

I don't think we have that much evidence that Lily and Snape collaborated on anything once they arrived at Hogwarts---and it would have been a logistical and social nightmare for them to do so---but absence of evidence is not evidence of absence in this case, so I don't think we can really say either way.

#+begin_quote

Yes and no. Consider that if the trio just wanted to get /themselves/ better at DADA, they could have met in an unused classroom or the RoR whenever it was convenient, and maybe invited some upperclassmen known to be loyal and competent (Weasley Twins?) along to give them some pointers. They could have made far more progress in far less time and with far less risk. Instead, Hermione pushed---and Harry ultimately agreed---to spread the knowledge to two dozen others, at great cost in time and at a great risk to themselves.

Therefore, DA is in some sense an example of Hermione & Co. /sacrificing/ their own magical advancement in order to expand their circle of collaboration. Take it as you will.

Taure, what have I done to you to make you disrespect me so?

I talk about your fic, being careful to provide context and lay out what I know and what I don't know, and judging by your response, my speculation was entirely correct. You reply, questioning my character, and you don't actually address any arguments or provide any evidence for the more questionable of your claims.

And, the thing is, even your characterisation of me is wrong. Yes, I think that canon!Hermione is a far more interesting a character than canon!Harry. There is a reason Harry gets a near-total personality rewrite and a talent upgrade so often: without Voldemort breathing down his neck, he has to be shoehorned into the lead protagonist role.

However, I am fair about it. Upgrading one character and not others is fine. Doing it in a way that alters the relevant canon dynamic between them /and/ rubbing the reader's face in it can easily cross the line into bashing or at the very least be cringeworthy.

In the tiny number of fics in which Hermione gets the upgrade and proceeds to usurp Harry's virtues and achievements, I cringe just as much. (I can cite a number of instances of this in /The Arithmancer/, if you'd like.)

Vous ne savez pas quoi, mais je pense que je sais quoi.

We see these characters in vastly different contexts. To compare the two siblings, we (by which I mean "Harry") see Percy at Hogwarts, as an uptight, officious prefect, in a position of authority over Harry (and we all know how well Harry handles that), mocked by his far more congenial and gregarious younger siblings. Until the Battle of Hogwarts, we don't even see him doing any magic that I can recall. And, he chooses a boring, officious profession. Bill, on the other hand, we don't meet until he is years out of Hogwarts---years of focused professional development and experience in what sounds like an interesting, dangerous, /magical/ profession. He is, unlike Percy, fun and easygoing, and he mainly appears when there is magic to be done---or when it's time to romance a supernaturally beautiful woman. So, one gets the sort of familiarity that breeds contempt, and with the other, we get glimpses of a magical Indiana Jones.

Something similar applies to James and Hermione. We see Hermione at her best and at her worst, and we see not just her achievements but also her limitations, struggles, and failures. With James, we only get to see him as a "finished product", triumphant in a magical conflict, and we hear decade-old recollections by his friends and teachers of a man who died a hero. Even the bad parts of his character that we see---bullying---happen to be ones that emphasise power.

Nous connaissons Hermione, mais nous ne connaissons pas James.

Harry, being the point-of-view character; being driven by destiny; and being given unique powers, tools, and information, can't really be compared on "je ne sais quoi" to anyone else. And yet, it's telling that fics that maintain him as the sole lead protagonist but move away from the canon-style conflict against canon-style Voldemort almost invariably give him a personality rewrite and a magic upgrade.

I think this is the key. Because if you correct the HP universe to be more grounded, where you don't win wars by virtue of being the good guy, then it makes sense to also correct Harry's characterisation to suit the new world.

Indeed, I would say that to change one without changing the other would be a form of bashing, much like when fanfics change the rules of magic so that Voldemort can access Privet Drive because he took Harry's blood in GoF, but don't change Dumbledore's actions to take account of this. Changes to the world *necessitate* corresponding changes in characterisation.

In canon, Harry is said to be Voldemort's equal. That is his role in the story: Voldemort's opposite number. Now, in the later parts of canon, magic ended up taking on a certain quasi-religious aspect, where those of moral upstanding are magically rewarded because they are good. To quote JKR:

#+begin_quote
  It is important to state that I always saw these kinds of magic (the very deepest life and death issues) as essentially un-scientific; in other words, there is no ‚ÄúElder Wand + Lily's Blood = Assured Survival‚Äù formula. What count, ultimately, are Harry and Voldemort's own choices. They have each been given certain weapons and safeguards, but the power of these objects and past happenings lie in how they are understood, and how they are used or enacted upon. Harry has a deeper and truer understanding of the meaning of the objects and past events, but *his greatest powers, those that save him, are free will, courage and moral certainty*.
#+end_quote

So Harry gets to come back to life at the end of DH because he was the good guy. When moral integrity and courage are sufficient to have magic favour you, then you can be considered Voldemort's equal without needing to achieve any particular competency.

Essentially JKR took the trope of authors giving their protagonists plot armour and actually made it a part of her magic system.

It wasn't always this way. For the first 3-4 books, at least, Harry was on a traditional hero's path, with his mastering of the Patronus and using it in such a powerful way a clear step in that direction, as was his ability to resist the Imperius and his defeating Voldemort in what was essentially a battle of magical strength.

So what happens when you come to write a fanfic and you don't want to give your characters plot armour? What happens if your fanfic HP universe is intended to be more grounded and realistic? What changes do you have to make to ensure that Harry occupies his correct role in this altered world, that of the Dark Lord's equal?

The obvious answer is that you need to make him more magically accomplished - "Tier 1".

So where fics "upgrade" Harry to be more magically talented than Hermione, I don't really consider this an upgrade at all. Rather, I consider it /restoring/ Harry to the position he always /should/ have occupied, had the Harry Potter universe not turned into a fable with Jesus!Harry.

******* This strikes me as an interesting philosophical digression that doesn't have much bearing on the main issues of the OP or any of the ancestor posts. For the sake of argument, let's suppose that you are correct and that in an indifferent universe, "Harry" (using that as a placeholder for Victoria Potter, etc.) is in some sense entitled to be better at magic than Hermione.

The form of bashing I had described has two components: upgrading the character /and/ rubbing the reader's face in it. The first does not entail the second. A Powerful!Harry writer---however justified---does not have to set up confrontations between "Harry" and Hermione nor direct contests of magical skill between them.

Nor would Hermione seek such confrontation. Much as I wish it were otherwise, canon!Hermione isn't actually very competitive. She likes to show off her knowledge, of course, but she doesn't generally resent others for being better at something than her, and she doesn't work very hard to catch up when they are. (Even the conflict around the HBP potion text was at least as much about what she saw as cheating and about Harry endangering himself and others with untested recipes.) Therefore, "Harry" can do his/her own thing, and Hermione can do her own thing in the background. There's no obligation to rub the reader's face in the upgraded protagonist's superiority unless the writer has something to prove.

Nor does your framework have any bearing on how we assess Hermione's inborn talents, "tiers", "je ne sais quoi", and how those compare to James's.

--------------

As an aside, the argument that an indifferent universe calls for different characters is a valid one. I have made arguments along similar lines myself, particularly when defending Dumbledore's decisions against bashers and conspiracists.

I have also seen the line of argument that Harry /should/ have been a better wizard before and can genuinely sympathise with it, and I've never seen it expressed quite so coherently. In the end, though, I don't buy the conclusion. There are many ways to address the problem of defeating Voldemort in an indifferent universe that stop short of replacing a canon character with what is, functionally, a powered-up OC and then refusing to cop to having done that.

In some sense, the solution of making "Harry" Tier 1 is self-defeating. It actually goes against the spirit of Trelawney's prophecy, IMO, since "Being Tier 1" is power that [Voldemort] knows all too well. (There are other interpretations of the prophecy, of course, but they tend to make "Harry" even less important.)

Once you're in an indifferent universe, and ignore the spirit of the prophecy (or, as in some fics, make the main antagonist someone other than Voldemort), "Harry" loses his or her claim to exclusive lead protagonisthood. Once that happens, it turns out that there are other canon characters that have interesting personalities and motivations that don't need a complete personality rewrite or a massive talent upgrade to be interesting lead protagonists and/or form an ensemble cast of near-equals.

Nor do I see it solving things, really. Suppose that "Harry" has Tier 1 talent and is to defeat Voldemort in an indifferent universe. Voldemort still has decades of experience and obscure magical knowledge, and so "Harry" needs to be beyond Tier 1 to catch up by the time he or she turns 17. A "mere" Tier-1 "Harry" needs some kind of a cheat---but if you are willing to introduce those, then you might as well give them to a canon-level Harry or to another character.

** IMO Hermione isn't even that smart, she just actually applies herself more to studying. Harry could also be that way, but him and Ron prefer constantly messing around. Harry is amazed by magic when he is first introduced to it, but he quickly loses any motivation or fascination and treats it as a chore. This, combined with Hermione being a bookwork make her seem like a genius in comparison.

But there is more than just one type of intelligence. Hermione might have a bit of an edge with memory recall and retention, but she utterly lacks spatial or verbal intelligence. For example, she has trouble communicating with her peers often and can't explain what she is thinking, like in book 3 with the time turner. She can't play quidditch like Harry.

In fact, I would even say that Harry is smarter than Hermione, using his creativity, his natural athleticism, and his ability to perform well under pressure as a metric. Fanfic writers also like her because she is muggleborn, and they often like to use that as a plot point to bring politics and blood magic into their storylines.

Like, Ron and Harry would be just as smart as Hermione if they did all the things Hermione does instead of the things they do. But they don't, because they aren't her, and as a result are not as smart as her.

Bear in mind she is always helping them with things, and never vice versa, and she's routinely the first or only one to get spells/potions right when we see anything happen in class. Just because she's not the mega genius she often is in fic doesn't mean she isn't the smartest person in Harry's year. She's just... your high school valedictorian, rather than the next Einstein.

Also, what does "learn by doing" even mean in this case? Being able to master complex magic just by reading about it in a book---how Hermione does it---is far more impressive than needing a teacher to explain it, demonstrate, correct mistakes, etc.. There's a reason schools have classes, homework, and other activities, rather than just giving each student a stack of books and telling them to come back in six months for the exam.

He gets more out the relationship than he puts in, from a purely pragmatic point of view. Sure, I know there is no way to measure the value of a good friend and confidant, but Ron just doesn't have that many redeeming characteristics. He doesn't contribute that often outside of friendly support, which is fickle at best. (See goblet of fire) I can only think of the chess match in PS that is an example of Ron actually contributing to progress the plot outside of comic relief.

To your Hermione point, Harry is a half-blood. Hermione isn't. Using Harry as a prop to preach about "magical racism" that many fic writers love to bandy about isn't as effective when you consider that Harry is directly descended from one of the oldest wizarding bloodlines ever.

In fact, consider that Harry was always going to have Voldemort after him personally, and Hermione, as a Muggleborn, was always going to be a target for Voldemort and pureblood supremacists. Their choice was fight or flight.

But Ron, the pureblood, he always had the option of walking away and sitting the conflict out as most purebloods did. He had family in the wizarding world, too. Of the trio, he had the most to lose. And yet, he was with his friends all the way, and it took wearing a horcrux around his neck for weeks to give him a mere moment of weakness.

This would likely have started an investigation and Quirrel would be found out. If this does not happen and he survived this he would not have figured out about the stone and would not know about the trapdoor so he would have no reason to think something valuable is there and Voldemort would have come back and killed him.

*** Harry and Ron apply themselves plenty, and Harry complains about it all the time; and they get help from Hermione, too.

What we do see, is that every time new magic is introduced in class---including DADA related, like nonverbal casting---Harry either observes Hermione mastering it before anyone else, including himself, or doesn't observe who did it first at all. We also see multiple instances of Hermione mastering magic just from reading about it from a book---including before she even starts Hogwarts. (Harry does have a pretty good record in that respect as well, though his is almost entirely with Dark Arts.)

I am not sure where you're getting the verbal intelligence parts; she seems to have no trouble expressing herself and she certainly has excellent reading comprehension. Are you talking about emotional intelligence and empathy? She certainly lacks those in early canon.

I am also not sure where you are getting that Harry is particularly creative. He makes some good leaps of intuition, but he also makes some disastrous ones. And, I don't think I've ever seen performing well under pressure as a metric of intelligence. It sounds like you're just looking for some criteria---any criteria---that you can use to put Hermione below Harry in cognitive ability.

Firstly- I blame the movies. (And especially David Yates) Hermione is even smarter there and Ron got the short end of the stick. And I think that tv series and movies are more visually stimulating. So people remember a scene from a movie more easily than, say, lines from a book.

I've seen this sentiment several times and I agree. "Talent" or "innate genius" is often the result of long hours of hard work and not a given. Sometimes being consistent and hardworking can be better than having a "natural talent" and being inconsistent.

That being said, I still like Hermione. There is just something attractive about powerful and/ or vengeful witches like Morrigan from Dragon Age and Yennefer from The Witcher.

She practically learned all the study material and additional books before entering Hogwarts. And she actually learned it completely. Harry had also read all of his books and he was not able to answer questions at the drop of the hat in potions while Hermione knew all the answers. If not a genius then she would have to have an extremely good long term memory.

I could without anyone's help; maybe learn that year's worth of Mathematics in that amount of time but even that is a stretch because I am going to hit parts I would struggle with. And it's my best subject.

Hermione learnt the whole course material for her year without any help in a time period I would have struggled to do the same in my best subject. Maybe I was just a really dumb student and what Hermione accomplished is normal but IMHO she is a genius.

It was like, two weeks before his birthday if I'm remembering canon correctly. So mid-July. That's not really much prior. Let's say the letters only come the summer of the year that the student turns 11. Hermione and everyone else born later in the year (Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec) are still at an advantage to get more practice down.

****** Why would the letters come the summer the student turns 11 as opposed to the summer of the first year the student is eligible to attend? Sending the letters to any student who turns 11 in the summer of that year makes it so that any student whose birthday falls after September 1st but before the end of the year would have to wait around a year before actually attending.

Wouldn't it make more sense to send letters to students who are, or will be, 11 by September 1st? Hermione's birthday is September 19th, so she just misses the cutoff. It simply doesn't make sense from an administration standpoint to send a letter to a student ineligible to attend until the next year.

The eligibility batch runs by the school year, not the calendar year.

**** Huh really, I could have sworn all students got the letter at the same time. Sorry must not be remembering it incorrectly.

Yeah if that was the case it could be explained by just dedication and she would not have to be genius; easily above average as she still had no guidance but yeah not a genius.

Then again she has accomplished some other things that are mind boggling.

- There is third year in which she took four electives on top of all the core subjects, and also researched the wizarding world's legal framework on her own without anyone with knowledge of the law to help her. She did this to save Buckbeak.

I am studying business law and it is incredibly frustrating with some of the examples for a particular section contradicting what other sections say. It is really hard to navigate without someone to help. And she still did so as a fourteen year old. Given she had a time turner but still.

- Fourth year she helped Harry survive the tournament. She was working as hard as Harry but was not exempted from the tournament and started SPEW.
- Fifth year she helped run the DA and the SPEW, was a prefect and still managed to get 9 O's and 1 E in DADA. In fact the only person we know to have outperformed her in her year is Harry who got O in DADA 5 E's and 1 A, P and D. Ron's result was same as Harry but he got an E in DADA.

The only people known to have gotten more OWL's than her are Percy, Bill, Barty Crouch.

I am not saying that others like Lily, Tom, Albus and the like couldn't have outscored her, we just don't know. So from what we have seen she definitely is really smart academically and unless wizards and witches are a lot smarter than normal people (going by canon they should not be) Hermione is really a Genius to have accomplished some of the stuff that she has.

Or she could have had Eidetic memory allowing her to retain all the knowledge she read and as most of the spells are just memorization of wand movements and incantation this would give her even a bigger leg up on her peers.

*Edit-* I completely forgot about the polyjuice potion she brew in 2nd year. She must have been really talented to have made a NEWT level potion on her first try after only one year of study. Or she could have been genius to have studied at least five years worth of potions in one year. Either scenario proves just how brilliant she was.
