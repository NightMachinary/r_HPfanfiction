**** Linkffn(2595818) has crazy Dark Lord and a competent DADA Professor Riddle :-) Unfortunately abandoned, but still one of my favorites.

If you don't mind slash (all smut is either clearly marked or posted on another sight, and doesn't come into play until late in the fic) then my absolute favorite Dark Lord fic is linkffn(8149841) It even has an awesome explanation for why he's so much more competent than canon. It hasn't been updated in a few months, but I don't think it's abandoned. Let me know if slash is ok. If so, I might have a few more. Lol.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** An obvious answer would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] but I wouldn't be surprised if you've already heard of that one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] is another good choice. It's an AU that takes place in a world where Voldemort won the first war and rules Magical Britain. Voldemort's portrayal is pretty nuanced here, and you get a nice look into his mind-frame through his twisted relationship with Harry (Not slash btw).

** Linkffn(Dreams and Darkness Collide by Epic Solemnity)

No prophecy/BWL/Horcruxes, post Hogwarts, complete AU. Voldemort plans his takeover over the course of decades, going the political route and becoming Minister. Harry is an Empath, able to see the soul/aura of people, whether they are effectively a good person or incredibly vile. The Potters are tortured and killed, leaving Harry tremendously scarred and setting him on the path for revenge and justice by using his Empath ability to target and destroy the worst kind of people in Wizarding society.

It's HP/TMR but it's quite complicated as neither of them are idiots, there is some slash but it is rather insignificant compared to the conflicts. It's a constant battle for control. Riveting ethical serial killer drama and a complex mystery of the reasons and persons behind the Potter murders are the highlights to this ongoing story. It's also very well written. I was turned off by the slash at first but drawn in by what I described above. Definitely recommend.

  AUSLASH! Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned
