Listening to the books on audio book I felt the urge to read ff that starts in the 6th book. Either during the school year or at the end of the book. Please no Harry/Ginny pairing. Would love a story with Harry/Hermione where they spend more time together during the whole Lavender/Won-Won debacle and end up getting together. But as long as there is no Harry/Ginny paring I'm fine with (almost) whatever.

Also looking for stories where Phineas Nigellus has a bigger role than he does in the books.
