I've been searching for a while but my google-fu is terrible. If possible, are there any fics where Harry is seductive in some way and either naturally draws the attention of others or actively seduces someone. I'm fine with M/M and M/F too. No Fem!harry please. And to clarify, By seduce I mean purposely or by accident make others fall in love with him.


** Loose Cannon by manatee-vs-walrus is excellent for this. At first he thinks it's his newfound confidence but then it turn out to be... Well. You'll find out. It's not a sudden late Veela inheritance, mind.

*** Thank you. And it over 100k, lucky knowing how some of these requests end up being pretty niche.

  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!
