** Oh hell, I've read bits of this! I don't think I ever read the whole thing, just skimmed most of it. I'll check my archive but I'm not making any promises; I don't think I downloaded the thing. It was on FFN, if that helps.

**** I believe it was complete, yeah. I still can't remember what it was called, but I believe I found it via the faves list of an author I admired very much, possibly Aurette?

I'll keep thinking, maybe it will come to me.

** I just read linkffn(it all comes down to time) which may not be the fic you're looking for, but is almost certainly the fic I was thinking of when I made my previous comment.
