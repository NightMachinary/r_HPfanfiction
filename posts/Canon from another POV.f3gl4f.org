basically I'm interested in any fics that are canon compliant, just told from a different perspective. Stories about what went on at Hogwarts while the trio were hunting horcruxes or other order members from OoTP on are particularly interesting to me. Doesn't have to be SUPER strictly canon, anything within the realm of possibility would do :)

  CoS according to Ginny. Nobody noticed anything wrong for an entire year -- how did she slip so far from her family and friends? Angst and betrayal, but also mysteries, jokes, an enchanted suit of armor, and a guaranteed happy ending.

** Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, I don't like the Snape bashing in there. I mean yes he's an asshole, but murdering students is not really his style. Other than that it's pretty good.

And Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce, it has Gordon Ramsay, so it's not canon, but it's the best fiction about what happens while they are hunting horcruxes that I know.

If you by any chance understand German I suggest Severus Snape und... der Stein der Weisen/Kammer des Schreckens etc to you, all books until the fifth from Snape's POV. It is completely canon compliant. It's brilliant, He is so in character and it's absolutley hilarious. Also he spends almost all his time drinking with Charity Burbage and McGonagall. And he likes the Weasley twins and helps them with some of their experiments but they pretend they hate each other in front of everybody else. It's so funny.
