He broke up with Ginny because she wanted to go to High Society Happenings but he wanted to study. Hermione breaks up with ron because of the laws she would have no rights, writes a book about it. MC Gonnagal found out. In the end she marries a muggle. Ron gets beaten up by his wife and it is remarked he has a temper like Arthur.
