Basically, I'm looking for more stuff like the past sequences in A Long Journey Home (Link below). I don't care if it's Ancient Classical Civilizations, Pre-History, Founders, etc, but I'd like stuff pre-Grindelwald/20th Century.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home]]

linkffn(9860311)

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** I haven't read a long journey home, but in linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2352896/chapters/5524946#workskin]]) he gets send back in time. It's set in the founders era.

*** Even if you're not into Fem!Harry, I'd very much recommend you take a look. It's got such exquisite 'I am an ancient thing' vibes to it - like a written version of the Man from the Earth movie. And the History parts are fun too. :)

I honestly don't know, but I think I've read this? The name seems incredibly familiar and I remember a couple things in the first couple of chapters, but I don't remember anything more of it. I guess it's one of those ones that's drifted from my brain - thus, probably time for a reread. :)

Thanks for the rec!

** Wizard from Earth is similar (I assume, fem!harry is pretty much the only thing I won't read). Abandoned. I don't believe there's any romance at all, but it's been a while since I've read this. linkffn(8337871)

Of a Linear Circle has some time travel to the founders era in part three. You do not need to read the first two parts first, but... there's a sort of mystery involved that you'd miss out on by skipping around. Part three has an off screen sex scene, and all romantic scenes (intimate and otherwise) can be easily skipped in the rest. I'll link both the first and third part. If interested, there's also a couple backstories in this series about the founders over in part five. The entire thing is full of nerdy eleventh century history goodness. linkao3(11284494; 11631114)

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

*** It is similar, yeah. A Long Journey Home is basically that, but with less focus on the past and more focus on Jasmine returning to the modern day and seeming ancient to everyone.

If you enjoyed Wizard from Earth, I'd highly recommend you at least give Long Journey a try, whether you like fem!Harry or not. It really does the "I am older than you can really think about" thing hella well.

No pressure though - each to their own and all that. :)

Of a Linear Circle isn't something I've read, and it looks interesting, so thank you for that rec. Thank you for answering my smut queries too - I always wonder whether people actually read my ever-growing boilerplate disclaimer. :D

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
