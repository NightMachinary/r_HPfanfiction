Imagine a really old Godric Gryffindor just hanging around in the Lake where Harry Potter starts to talk to since" no one else would listen but hey, the squid probably wouldn't mind" then starts to pour his heart out to the squid. Then Godric decides to just fuck it... If no one will help, I will, it's been centuries since I'm up and about.. how different could it be.

Or just a really interesting story like how the squid being Godric affect HP as a whole.... Like even assisting in rebuilding Hogwarts and his Hat.


** For some reason that infamous giant squid x hogwarts fanfiction (NSFW) comes to mind
