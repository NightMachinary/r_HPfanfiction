** I don't recall the scene but any chance it may be related to the 'Boyfriend' saga of Molly Raesly? linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5548168/1/Boyfriend]]) in which Lily ends up accidently dating James and then falling in love.

  Potter was going to say that he wasn't my boyfriend. I couldn't let him do that. For the love of Merlin, I could not let him do that. I had to stop him. He couldn't tell her the truth. So I did the only conceivable thing I could think of. I kissed him.
