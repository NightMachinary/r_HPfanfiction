** There are several points to make in the resolution: Hogwarts should stop sorting students into houses; the biggest is probably the us vs them mentality, the next is the obstruction of helping the house rather than the school, it leads to elitism, and it separate but equal houses are never truly equal.

Us vs them mentality known as well as the social identity theory The main problem with the us vs them mentality is that it builds animosity that normally wouldn't be there without the system in place. In a, rather famous, study called the “Robbers Cave Experiment”, researchers found that when placed in groups where the objective is winner take all, the groups will resort to violence, vandalism, and other forms of aggression towards the other group, BUT if the groups come together for team building exercises where all groups participate, all groups involved feel attached to each other, it eliminates the us vs them mentality. The us vs them mentality is what led draco malfoy into becoming a death eater, I would advocate that without houses, malfoy would have probably seen the light much sooner, I would also advocate that most slytherins would not be turned without the constant pressure from their slytherin peers and constant repetition, almost like brainwashing. The us vs them mentality is especially cultivated in the classroom where severus snape is involved, favoritism among his slytherins, rarely taking points off from slytherin, but taking as many as possible from the other houses. This demonstrates for kids that it is okay to favor your house while striking down and playing dirty with the other. Integration with the rest of the populous To find the elitism, look no further than Draco Malfoy, who makes several references to his house being the best house and those not in it are of lesser class. This also ties into the us vs them mentality as it advocates finding similarities between the home group and distancing themselves from the away groups. An example of how separating the students into houses creates an unequal atmosphere, what if parents see a trend that leads to create more hufflepuffs or more ravenclaws, this could create an imbalance within the school, with a majority of students taking a single cloth instead of evenly split; what if one group is just more trained as a whole, be it by their parents or by some other foreign entity, with the abolishment of houses, this would not be an issue.
