** Linkffn(Angry Harry and the Seven by Sinyk) Definitely angry, I think he was sarcastic sometimes, but unfortunately very bad. Read at your own peril.

The warning should be

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

***** Yaaas. I agree. I thought I could bear it because the story is kind of entertaining but I soon realized that it was a horrible idea. The futher you read the more torturous it gets to read a story where everyone is dumbed down to contrast a ridiculously cliche character. And things are repeated over and over. All thoughts had to be later voiced, all conversations retold to someone.

Oh, and the "romance" killed me.

****** The romance was fine when it was just Hermione. Then it took a turn for the stupid and contrived.

Edit: and by "fine", I mean barely tolerable.

  Harry, cursed, is repeatedly reincarnated into different "heroes." This time he ends up as a very, very unlucky little Hobbit by the name of Frodo Baggins. [Powerful, cynical, Master of Death Harry; warning for strong language; no pairings] [Q&A added to ch2 because I'm a bit irked]
