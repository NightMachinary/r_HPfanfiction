I've never read Draco redemption fics before (unless you count Isolation as a redemption fic), but the concept seems interesting. What I was thinking about though was a rather specific way of doing things.

The idea is that the fic would largely follow canon events, and starting early in their school-years; like 1991 or 1992. Draco would start off as just as much of a shit as he was in canon, but would slowly form...not a /friendship/, exactly, but a mutual understanding, perhaps, with Harry that ultimately leads to him changing sides in the war or not going through with the Dumbledore assassination.

The question is often asked "How would Harry be affected if he accepted Draco's offer of friendship in first year", which is often turned around into "How would it have affected Draco?" Similar idea, but a much slower burn that doesn't already have Draco being a better person in the first chapter. Some people complain that Draco redemption arcs aren't realistic, but I feel like this idea could be if it was written properly.


** the secret language of plants series somewhat has this. it's focused on Harry, but Draco increasingly becomes a bigger player as the fics progress. in them Draco is his general self, until he does something kind for Harry I think after COS and Harry after that decides they're kinda friends. Draco doesn't officially rebel from his father's side until 5th year, but after that he's p firmly on Harry's side. Although there's a lot of plot besides Draco redemption, so if you're looking for fics that focus on that solely skip this one. linkao3(9323225)

*** Interesting, so it has Harry raised by Lupin? That could be interesting, I'll take a look at this at some point!

**** Yeah, basically Snape kidnaps 3-year old harry from the Dursleys but he has no idea how to deal w a child so he gives him to Remus to raise in secret. the first fic (30k) features harry until Hogwarts, then the next one (75k?) explores his Hogwarts years. the third is over 200k and is the war, but you can opt out after the second. I'm only partially into the third so far but it's good! there are minor issues of grammar that put me off for a long time, but it's mostly just a lack of contractions and missing punctuation at the end of dialogue & you get used to it. it's unique & the way harry uses magic is very interesting and Draco gets a lot of progress and exploration. I hope you like it if you give it a read !

  lack of contractions

A Harry Potter universe where everyone talks like Data sounds pretty funny in a dry way.

And at least Snape is self aware lol.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** Draconian by Noelle N. is a good one. Unfortunately, she has taken it off of Wattpad due to people plagiarizing her story. But it may still be somewhere on the web.

It's a Draco & Hermione fanfic, but more than that, it focuses on how he redeems himself as an undercover Deatheater after Voldemort had beat Harry. Really, really well written, 100% recommended!

** Don't wanna come across as sarcastic or dismissive.

But slash is where you need to look to find that (theres a lot of it). Specifically probably pre-slash stories (where m/m is the endgame) that could be called gen fics.
