I've recently read White Knight Grey Queen and I've loved this pairing since. So does any has some recommendations that is not White Knight Grey Queen?

It is Neville/Pansy, but I am linking it only because it is far less OOC than the one you linked. Pansy is annoying, but not as sanitized as she is in White Knight Grey Queen. Postcanon. The author hits the sweet spot between genuinely annoying and sickly sweet for Pansy, although most characters are a little in reconciliation mode.

  If you look into the broken pieces and cannot find your reflection, the magic of seven years bad luck will take effect. In the spring of '91, Neville Longbottom broke a mirror. And in their 8th year, Pansy Parkinson broke one too. Neville/Pansy
