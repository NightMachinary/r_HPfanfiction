Did anyone else read this? And does anyone know where the author disappeared to? Worst WIP tragedy of the fandom, IMO.


** That fic is one of the reasons I really try not to start reading wips that haven't been updated in years. It's just so tragic when you realize it won't ever be finished.

** I checked this for updates for years! Somewhere I had read an author's note that it wasn't abandoned, she was just busy with other things but was going to get right back to it, and it kept my hope alive long beyond reason. I don't know what happened to the writer. Seems like I was a member of an email group for this fiction and friends of hers posted veiled things about life events, be patient, etc. but it was so long ago now I may be mixing it up with another author.

The [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1362757/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Mirror-Of-Paradox][Mirror of Paradox]] starts with the same premise, the author says "influenced" by it. I enjoyed reading that one, and it certainly stands alone. It doesn't really fill the vacuum left by Mirror of Maybe though, because it has such a different feel. Good, just different.

I really wish writing Mirror of Maybe fanfiction would become a thing, with good writers all writing their own endings. If JK Rowling doesn't make a fuss about all the fanfiction based on her work, surely Midnight Blue would be as gracious. I promise any writers reading now, I'd read (and review!) every single one of them.

I am a sucker for the underlying premise of Harry having some kind of awakening, special training, etc, and being competent, knowing what he is about, and executing his plans well even thought it's out of character. I loved that element in [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=19708][The Apple Tree by Philo,]] and have probably read that one a dozen times, and it is LONG. Since you like Mirror of Maybe, just in case you haven't seen it. I guess it's a classic now. (Also has hands-down the sexiest Neville I've run into in any universe, despite staying very in-character. An author who can keep Neville in character and make him drop-dead sexy at the same time is a real artist.)

*** The genre is called Peggy-Sue, and is one of my favorites. I too checked Mirror of Maybe for updates for years.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterPeggySue][TVTropes has an excellent rec page for Harry Potter Peggy-Su fics.]] One of my favorite modern examples is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Wastelands_of_Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]].

*** Oh my god you just made my life 1000% better. I just sat down and read 10 chapters of The Paradox of Existence.

I feel like timetravel!Harry/Severus will become my OTP

UPDATE: Just finished reading it. Now sobbing.

  The Mirror of Paradox
#+end_quote

I see that there are 3 parts, last one unfinished AND with slash. Is it feasible to read only first two?
