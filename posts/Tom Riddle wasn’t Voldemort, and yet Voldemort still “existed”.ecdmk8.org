:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fic a long time ago, so my recollection is probably a little jumbled. Somehow, Tom Riddle wasn't Voldemort at all, and instead Voldemort was some sort of stage invention he'd cast aside as a youth. I think one of the major points of departure was that Riddle became a stage magician instead. Despite this, everyone still knew that Voldemort was terrorizing the people of Magical Britain. I'm not sure if Voldemort was a separate entity that broke off from Riddle, or if Voldemort was just the name of the people's collective boogeyman, or what. The fic was a one-shot, and was in the form of an interview with Riddle. I don't think there were any pairings, and the title might have had the word “Marvelous” in it. If anyone can find this, I'd really appreciate it.

Edit: [[https://fanfiction.net/s/10129276/1/][The fic has been found!]] Thanks, [[/u/deirox]]! I hadn't read it in years, so it turns out a lot of the details I'd “remembered” were false. For example, it's actually called “Dangerous and Deadly Lord Voldemort” and it's not a one-shot.


** Ohhhhh!!!! I think I know this one!\\
A kid at school invented 'Riddle' and then became Voldemort by branding all the bad people as Death Eaters, the second year Riddle was actually his son who kept the masquarade?

** Easy; Voldemort is the other personality, separated by magic. No I don't know the fic.
