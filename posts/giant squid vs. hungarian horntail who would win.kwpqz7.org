Hey. So... during the first task of the Triwizard tournament, I kind of want Harry to ride the hungarian horntail into the black lake. Sort of like Miyazaki's Spirited Away meets the 1991 action movie Point Break. Bearing in mind they'd be fighting on the squid's home turf, would the combination of squid + chosen one be sufficient to overpower one (1) hungarian horntail? Before you answer, here are a few things to keep in mind:

- The giant squid is, at the very least, giant. Bearing in mind that "giant" is relative, I believe I could get away with imagining the squid as being "massive" or, perhaps, even "colossal".
- The giant squid possesses enough intelligence to (a) realize colin creevy fell in the black lake, and (b) place him safely back in the boat.
- The giant squid can survive in the Black Lake alongside creatures dangerous enough that they were used to test the Triwizard Champions.

A few more considerations:

- If this story kernel came to fruition, I imagine there would have to be a scene before the first task where Harry bargains with the Squid, perhaps bribing it with bread or a snack of some sort.
- Something would need to be done with the dragon carcass if the squid proved victorious. I imagine a scene where Harry drags it all the way back to the stadium --- ya know, like Indie!Harry would.
- This would, obviously, be a slytherin!Harry story.
- Harry would ask the giant squid for advice on who to ask to the Yule Ball. And maybe dancing lessons.
- Perhaps, instead of being the animagus of Godric Gryffindor (thanks JK), the squid could be a smokin' hot Mary Sue like, uh, Rowena Ravenclaw.

So, bearing all this in mind, thoughts?


** If large squids and octopuses can attack and kill sharks (apex predators) in RL then I can easily see the giant squid beating a dragon. The key would be having the squid drag the dragon to the deepest part of the lake. Having the battle underwater puts the dragon at a disadvantage. How much of a disadvantage depends on how deep the lake is and how long you believe a dragon who doesn't normally spend any time underwater can hold it's breath.

Any and all activity would start reducing that time frame. Then the beak of an octopus or squid is very strong and many species use poison. So if the squid can get positioned on the dragon's back you either have poison injected or the potential for the backbone/spinal column being severed. At a minimum you may have one or both of the wings broken making it harder for the dragon to get out of the water.

Depending on their relative strengths and speed the simplest attack maybe grabbing the dragon's tail, pulling the dragon deep underwater and then rapidly dragging the dragon backwards through the water. By being underwater you may have eliminated the dragon's fire as most stories have them breathing in large amounts of air before blowing out flames.

You can also think about use of the terrain. Is there an underwater cave where the squid can fit but only part of the dragon fits. If so and the squid has the initial strength to drag the dragon underwater retreating into that cave trying to wedge the backend of the dragon in there and then holding on until the dragon drowns might work. It would also keep the dragon from using it's primary weapons of teeth and flame.

Now of course all of the above is predicated on the dragon ending up in the water. If not, the fight can go to the dragon but the squid needs to be in shallower water where it's head is susceptible to flame. Or where the dragon can land on the squids head and use flame, teeth and claws to rip into the squid's head where it can tear it apart (inside the mantle are the heart and gills) and close to the mantle but above the eyes are the squid's brain. Since the squid is a soft body that shouldn't be an issue.

So the squid wins if it can keep the dragon from attacking it's mantle/brain and getting the dragon underwater. The dragon wins if it can get stay above water as much as possible and can attack the mantle/brain

** As some have stated. It could go either way.

That squid gets a good grip and drags the dragon under? Odds are it would end up drowning in its struggles to fight the squid off. Even if it grieviously injured the squid in the process, it would be wasting oxygen trying to flail and bite.

That dragon manages to pull the squid *out*? That's charbroiled calamari boys.

It's like the lion vs a shark. It comes down to where the majority of the fight occurs.

** It'd be more awesome-looking the other way around, IMO. Either Harry riding the Giant Squid into the arena with the Horntail, or the Giant Squid leaping from the water and fighting the Horntail in the air. :D

Giant Squid is actually a specific species. Their 'giantness' is about ten meters in length. As is the 'Colossal Squid', incidentally. Though they're only a few meters longer.

Squids are also presumed to be mostly ambush predators rather than toe-to-toe fighters.

In terms of whether it could win, I guess it'd depend on whether you think Dragon Scale can be cut by the teeth along the Squid's tentacles or broken by them clubbing or squeezing. If it can't, then the fight is over pretty quickly on account of the Squid not being able to do anything and Dragon scale canonically being magic resistant. Also whether Dragonfire would work underwater or if the Dragon would be hurt by water getting inside it. Given that Dragons are fictional and the HP Dragons in no way follow the Speculative Biology guesswork at whether or not a Dragon could naturally exist, I'd say that's all up to you. I personally can see arguments for both sides.

*** Well. The entire dragon can't possibly be 100% impenetrable. Even in canon it's told that key points on the body are notably weak. The inside of the mouth. The eyes. The nose. The ears on some species (one or two have external ear openings). Hell, even the wing membranes on some species are said to be a touch weaker than the scales (don't remember where I read that part, but it does make sense. No scales on the membrane and it's relatively thin.)

You also need to account *what* is said to be in effective. Spells. Dragons are told to be essentially immune to most spells. They are *not* said to be immune to crushing forces, physical harm, and the like.

So yeah. If you account that it's entirely likely dragons aren't as immune to physical attacks, it's completely possible the squid could bite through some locations. A handful of specific points come to mind, like the underside of the neck, the place where the wings of legs connect to the body. Essentially anywhere the body needs a high degree of articulation physical couldn't be heavily armored, not without sacrificing mobility it would need to move around.

Also, the giant squid in canon is something far more akin to a Kraken. From what I can remember just one tentacle was like 40 odd feet in length. It's a massive animal by any account. Black lake being presumably fresh water, it couldn't be a regular giant squid by any means, without being magical in some way.

** In theory, the squid could envelope the Dragon in its tentacles and could drown the dragon

** Better than him riding the giant squid, him /fighting alongside/ the giant squid. Perfect teamwork and everything. Teamwork!
