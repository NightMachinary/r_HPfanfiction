Which is a neat trick, since according to Rowling she was simultaneously already teaching at Hogwarts at the time and didn't attend Hogwarts until after Tom graduated.

** It was McGonagall.

"You!" gasped Harry.

McGonagall smiled. Her face did not evoke any of the well-known kind but stern air she usually did.

"Me," she said calmly. "I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here, Mr. Potter."

"But I thought Sanpe..."

"Severus?" McGonagall laughed and it was a cold and cruel laughter. "Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would have suspected strict but fair, stern but kind Professor McGonagall?"

Harry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn't move a muscle. Petrified he watched as McGonagall reached out and began to take her pointy had off. Her head looked strangely small without it. Then she turned slowly on the spot.

Harry would have screamed but he couldn't make a sound. Where there should have been a bun, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.

*** "But surely Potter you wouldn't have been that foolish to think we punish students here at Hogwarts by putting them in mortal peril. Oh no... My master wanted to see what has come of the boy who defeated him as a baby... I had to do a lot of work to hide that information from Dumbledore and for a while I was worried as the oaf was getting suspicious. But he softened the moment I promised he'll have the chance to spend quality time with his favorite Hogwarts student by showing him his hobbies. And surely, you wouldn't have thought that a responsible teacher would ignore even a hint of the fact that a unique magical object for which the whole staff has been working so hard to protect might be in danger, now would you?"

** Hmm, maybe, I might do this. I was originally planning on McGonagall as the /spoiler/ for my story, but that definitely works, though I already have a villian in mind, and it's not Dumbledore or Voldemort. Well they are /a/ villain, but they're /the/ villain of the story, well antihero.

Really it's his own fault. He shouldn't have been singing Celestina Warbek so loudly...

...And I didn't burn my second attempt at breakfast, so it seems like today might be ok after all...

** Here's one.

McGonagall is actually the secret wife of Voldemort. She went to get Harry from the Dursley and thought he could be a get heir to he husband and herself and slowly corrupted young Harry while thinking about setting him up with the daughter of her right hand: Andy Tonks. Harry grows up from 11 acting like Gryffindor Golden Boy but is the next dark lord. People think Harry Skill in Transfiguration comes from James, but McGonagall taught him its easy to hide the body's if you change them into stones and hide them among the stones.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.
