From reading the same 3 or 4 major plotlines and the same 3 or 4 sub-plots repeatedly with only small divergences from the formula. It's getting to the point where I hardly ever even finish a fic.

Please recommend me your favorite fics that didn't follow any main fanon/canon formula. Fics that felt like a breath of fresh air. Fics that you weren't able to guess how they would continue/end after only 2 or 3 chapters.

Edit: thanks to everyone for all of the suggestions! I have a couple fanfic genres to look into now and I really appreciate it. Feel free to keep making suggestions. There's no such thing as too much reading.

** I feel you on this. I've escaped a few times and then I get sucked back in when I run out of other things to read.

You might try linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff). I just read it and really enjoyed it. It still take place at Hogwarts, but Harry is not super prominent. You might also try linkffn(Ghost of Privet Drive) which is hilarious, but hasn't gotten to Hogwarts yet.

Another option is to read cross overs in fandoms you don't actually support. This might sound silly, but I fell in love with Full Metal Alchemist crossovers without watching the anime (I did watch it eventually and really enjoyed it). The idea of a guy obsessed with science discovering that magic is real and being forced to teach alchemy at Hogwarts killed me. If you read crossovers set in the HP universe then sometimes you can just treat them as an OC. My favorite HPxFMA is linkffn(The Colours of the World). HP MOD in the Marvel universe can be pretty fun as well.

**** To be honest, this is still very vague and its hard to recommend something without knowing more. I don't know if my personal taste is going to be at all interesting to you and I (and probably many others) feel insecure making suggestions that people might react negatively to or that may include content/triggers others don't want to see.

There's hundreds of thousands of HP fanfics out there that explore a lot of different settings and characters. Yes, I feel like you are right that a lot do tend to be the same, particularly if you are trying to read things with HP as a character set during the same time as the original books. But there's a ton of side characters and different time periods to explore too, ex. after the books, Marauders era, Tom Riddle era.

As a piece of advice, the more you move toward fics that are centered on characters who don't have much existing story to them in the books, the more they tend to be like original fiction set in the HP universe. Many people don't seem to like that, but others are open to it because there's more room for creativity. There are even AU (alternative universe) stories that take the characters and put them in a completely different setting, ex. modern university/high school or muggle cities. If there's any particular character you really like, that might be interesting to see how people imagine them behaving outside canon.

I am going to go out on a limb and just recommend what is basically the only genre of fanfiction I read/write though it is SUPER niche and I understand if you aren't interested at all - Tom Riddle/OC stories. These tend to have a still villainous but more sane version of Voldemort and a "descent into madness" theme to them, but the plots/methods/reasons differ a lot across stories. If you like shows like Hannibal or Dexter you might like them. If you do like Hermione, there's also a ton of Tom Riddle/Hermione stories, though to be honest I found them to be predictable after a while because most revolve around time travel and the enemies-to-lovers trope.

One of the classic stories for the Tom Riddle/OC pairing is Witchcraft by a Picture, linkffn(5316529). I am trying to write one that looks at a time period I have never read a fic about before right now, after he graduated and worked at Borgin and Burke's. It's mostly romantic but also has a side plot of a first (obviously failed) attempt to rise to power legitimately. The Untold Years, linkffn(13549064).

As you can see, there's a whole lot of weirdly specific fanfiction out there :) I am sure people would be happy to rec their favorites if you have any characters, times, or types of stories you are really interested in. It's just kind of hard to think of anything to rec with such a general request, to be honest.

***** Thanks for the in depth reply! Looking back on my original post, I can see how it could seem vague to other people. I have an idea in my head of what I mean, but it's not always the easiest to relay what's in your head into writing.

To try to be a little bit more specific:

I have ever really only read harry centered stories that take place during his school years. This is what I started with, and by the time I discovered reddit (or even made a ffn account lol) I'd already read so much of that type of story that I really didn't know how to branch out.

Because of this, I am feeling burnt out on fanfiction and am looking for something new (in relation to my fic history). Reddit has been a great help in introducing me to more pairings (daphne/harry, fem harry/OC, harry/several other minor characters) and tropes (time travel, lord of azkaban, lord harry, betrothal contracts, etc...), but there is not often much of a deviation from "widely accepted fanon" in the recommendations on this sub. At this point I am feeling pigeonholed into certain tropes and I want to extend my knowledge of the World of Harry Potter.

I'll definitely check out what you recommended.

TL:DR: I've only really read harry centric schooldays stories, which I am burnt out on. I want to read more variation, but don't know how to start branching out.

Edit: it's hard for me to be more specific when I don't even know what I am looking for.

****** Are you interested mainly in Harry-centric stories? If so, I'd recommend looking our for some AUs or next-gen stories if you're bored with Harry-at-Hogwarts stories - I'm not particularly interested in these (and I'm not a fan of the tropes you mentioned) so don't have many recommendations, but I do love No Voyage linkao3(23968243) for less plot-focused, more character-based look at Harry dealing with PTSD post-War, and for as long as you need us linkao3(16957743) for a short post-War AU with a beautiful (but heart-breaking!) plot twist.

I mostly read Marauders-era and House of Black fic, my top non-slash recs are Blackpool linkao3(14760663) and everything else by the same author, a beautiful story about Sirius and Regulus growing up, and Employee of the Month linkao3(14842689), Remus dealing with the aftermath of Hallowe'en 1981.

There are other stories about these characters in [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/unspeakable3/bookmarks][my bookmarks]], but let me know if you're interested in longer, ongoing stories and I'll look through my subscriptions!

  The second anniversary of the war dawns on Wizarding Britain and Harry Potter still does not feel anything approaching normal. He had really thought waking from that 24 hour nap after the Battle of Hogwarts would fix him once and for all, but two years on, he's still unable to sleep through the night, so jumpy that his girlfriend is worried about him, and he doesn't know what he wants to do with his life after he failed the psych evaluations necessary to become an Auror. He had never expected to feel perfect two years after the Battle of Hogwarts, not that he knew what that was like, but he *had* expected to be okay.Good thing Harry Potter's well used to disappointment.

How much have you read about Severus Snape?

linkffn(The Snape Chronicles) is canon-compliant and takes a detailed look at his entire life, with Harry's time at Hogwarts being only a brief portion of it (and Severus' point of view on Harry does raise some good points).

Severus/Lily is a bit problematic, but I've seen it done really well. linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) has him meet Dumbledore in the afterlife and get a chance to fix all but one of his regrets; he's sent back to shortly after his breakup with Lily to try again. It does a really good job of getting inside his head and showing his strengths and weaknesses realistically. linkao3(Come Once Again and Love Me) does something like that, but with both Severus /and/ Lily being sent back from the points they died. Excellent prose quality, although I found it a bit more grim than Peace Not Promised.

****** Ok, that's good to know you are open to new stuff! I don't spend much time on this sub but I do feel like the general HP fanfic community is really centered on the kind of stories you mentioned you have already read, and have heard negative things about people not wanting to read certain characters or OCs which is why I was hesitant to recommend something out there.

I don't usually read Dramonie but I stumbled on this one a few weeks ago and loved it. It's post-Hogwarts and the premise is interesting. The Library of Alexandria, linkao3(14539968).

I also just started reading this one, so not sure I can really recommend it yet, but it seems like a very intriguing idea. Might be interesting as a character study if you like bad guys. Ouroboros, linkao3(24476011).

At least in my observation, Archive of our Own tends to have more niche fics than FFN. I switched to writing and reading on it for that reason. I feel like FFN was filled has more low-quality fics, but that might just be because it has been around longer so has more fics in general or because it is easier to be more specific searches on AO3. I also find a lot of fics via tumblr, just by following other people that write fanfic or searching the HP tags.

******* Up until a few weeks ago, I was pretty much solely reading on ffn. I don't know why that is, but I've recently come to realize how many good stories are on ao3. I mainly read on my phone so it's kind of hard for me to navigate ao3, but I've started checking out recommended fics from there rather than just skipping over them for the ffn fics.

****** For the longest time, I only read Dramione. It got to the point where I felt like I'd read everything and nothing new would be worth it/any good.

If you're up for branching out, I would recommend going on fanfiction.net and sorting by favorites on a search. I'd narrow things down by rating (I find M fics to be the most well written, generally) and word count (20k+ and 40k+ are my go-tos) but not paring. Read the most beloved works from a variety of tropes/pairings and see what you like.

In a similar vein to the comment above, I'll suggest a few I personally love that are different from your usual:

The Debt of Time by Shayalonnie - Hermione time travel fic

Boyfriend by Molly Raesly - James/Lily cuteness

A Second Look by RiverWriter - post-Hogwarts Dramione, featuring well written child characters

I don't know anything about Warhammer but -Through the Veil Strangely by littlewhitecat is so good you don't need to. linkffn(10150152)

** Alexandra Quick is pretty much original fiction, it uses Rowling's magic system and basic tenets of wizarding culture but is set in a completely original version of Wizarding America. Like HP, it's a coming of age story but ends up much grayer and slightly less apocalyptic and canon, the protagonist is /much/ less sympathetic and brash Americana abounds. There are five complete books and the sixth is in progress: highly recommended. The only links to canon characters are three mentions of Voldemort, but apparently we will see some canon characters in book 6.

You might like anything by Slide: her first series follows four Slytherins working in the background of the second war, her second series follows Scorpius and a couple friends as they find themselves trying to end an apocalyptic plotline. I suggest this because it's largely more apocalyptic and much grayer than the original series, and Slide can actually write romance quite well. Canon characters make an appearance, and this follows more of the apocalyptic plotline, but it's not very predictable and there are a lot of twists along the way.

** Hhhhhh-

If you're okay with creepypasta crossovers, moderate but skippable gore, horror, references to and outright murder, and slash(saw that you don't usually like MC slash but I'm putting the one fic that has it here because it's a subplot and the entire fic is 83 chapters long, than

linkffn(Brother in Arms by SteamGeek01)

linkffn(Harry by Proxy by The Smilimg Crow)

linkffn(Harry Jack)

linkffn(Potinem Domino)

(I'll post the rest in a reply because the bot doesn't like to respond to both ffn and ao3 links)

And if you're okay with angst, self-harm(sorta plot important but not too bad or descriptive) and minor but not outright slash,

  When Albus Severus and James Sirius mistakenly travel back to 1996, they seem to be hopelessly trapped in the past. That is, until a certain greasy-haired Potions Master finds them.This is NOT the classic "James and/or Fred II break a Time-Turner while fooling around" plot. This is a very different one and will ONLY be focused on the two Potter brothers. ON TEMPORARY HIATUS.

  When Albus Severus and James Sirius mistakenly travel back to 1996, they seem to be hopelessly trapped in the past. That is, until a certain greasy-haired Potions Master finds them. This is NOT the classic "James and/or Fred II break a Time-Turner while fooling around" plot. This is a very different one and will ONLY be focused on the two Potter brothers. ON TEMPORARY HIATUS.
