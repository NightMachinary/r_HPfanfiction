** Regardless of having an OC as main character or not, if you *add something to canon*, there should be changes down the road, especially in plot progression.

Our sub appreciates well developed original plots. Unshackle yourself from canon events, and surprise us with unexpected developments

*** At the same time, unless you are doing total AUs, all changes you make should be traceable to your divergence (or the need to flesh out blanks from canon). So if you write a fluffy Harry/Luna fic and Dumbledore suddenly starts cosplaying Joseph Stalin, you better have a semi-plausible explanation ready.

*** Thank you for replying! I get what you say - I mean, that's what fanfiction is about after all, It'll always have some differences to canon.

** As long as you've fleshed them out properly, and didn't dwell too much on how awesome they are, I like OC's. Overly flowery descriptions don't bud well with most readers. For example, there are many, many fanfictions with OC's driving the plot and get they're not known. A series such as Alexander Quick is something I can read very easily, because it's immersive. The author obviously wants the character to develop certain traits, I find that seeing them develop them as the story progresses to be way more interesting than saying 'alright, this is Maeve and she's XYZ'. Similarly, Latet Anguis in Herba.

I generally find complaints about OC's being talented to be unfair. They can be, but we need to see them work hard to achieve it, and look at them achieving these talents and traits, by trial and error. And I don't mean 'he tried once, twice and got it on the third one', but real progress. Introduce a theme or a problem that will make your readers root for the characters, make their actions have consequences and most importantly, this is where some generally draw the line at reading a story: a 12 year old being smarter than their middle-aged mentors are unrealistic, unimersive and frankly, stupid. Raise the stakes by letting them learn through their actions.

And good luck on your story, it has an intriguing premise, I hope it works out for you.

** Remember to have background characters - fic writers sometimes forget that Harry is what is known as an unreliable narrator, meaning he misses things as everything is from his own perspective. It's also alright to add more original characters to your fic, whether they're just names to be used as placeholders in the Sorting Hat's song or if they're your character's best friend.

I won't presume to know what your OC's life is like, but also don't forget that your OC is going to know more people than just his year-group. One of the kids he played hide and seek with as a child might be older or younger than him or not be magical at all and don't have to be always there, on the periphery of the story. The same can be said for canon characters.

Examples of this from canon are Piers Polkiss, Dudley's best friend and the members of the Order of the Phoenix, like Dedalus Diggle - a skinny boy with a rat face and a smiling man with a top-hat, who bowed to Harry in a shop once. Both are memorable characters due to the vivid descriptions of their expressions and appearances, who upon later brief mention in the books, were able to be recalled without a florid description over who they actually were.

** I've read a couple of fan docs with an OC main character. As long as it's not in first person, I'm happy.

** I love OCs as main characters, so long as they're adding something to the story. It's usually boring (and unrealistic) to read a canon rehash where nothing has changed except for the inexplicable addition of a random OC.
