Does anyone know of any fics where Hermione gets mental health help? Could be about anything. Please no dramione, romione or intergenerational ships (eg.snamione, bellamione etc.)


** This happens in Arithmancer, but it's a fairly small aspect of a very long book, so it might not be of much interest. If the rest of the book isn't to your liking then I wouldn't read it just for that.
