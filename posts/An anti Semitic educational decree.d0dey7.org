In what fanfic does Dolores Umbridge posts an educational decree that banns kosher or halal food in Hogwarts?


** If you're looking for a specific fic, try adding the 'What's That Fic' flair. You can find it by clicking on the 'flair' button below your post.

Anyway, I found this: [[https://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=108401]]\\
It has the following tidbit of text in it:

#+begin_quote
  Educational Decree Number 51; Hens forth students who request meet done in the Kosher style will no longer have this
#+end_quote

Is it what you're looking for?

*** Please tell me the students rebel by pouring pig's blood on Umbridge's meals, so they are now not Kosher too.
