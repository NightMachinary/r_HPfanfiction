[Rewatched Akame Ga Kill (it's bad) because of quarantine and this idea hit me]

Money, fame, political/social power and a lot of decisions that need to be made with no knowledge of the world and climate he is operating in: Harry is made the Lord of pretty much every available household in Britain and has no idea what to do with that power or how.

Leading to an adult realising that, ingratiating themselves to him and manipulating him (the most powerful individual in Magical Britian) for their own ends.

*/The story would best be told from a completely different perspective (I'm liking the idea of Neville or Hermione as the protagonist) with Harry as an unwitting antagonist. Obviously the true villain would be the person manipulating him [sidenote, don't be Dumbledore, I like the idea of it being Narcissa Malfoy or someone along those lines] but they are exercising their beliefs and designs through Harry./*

E.g: Narcissa married Lucius and used his political acumen and the families capital to quietly push her plans through the Wizagmot in the background. But then a cute little orphaned celebrity (with more money and power than he knew what to do with) caught her eye. She offered herself as someone to guide him through the Magical World and became an almost mother figure to her new tool. She played off her connection to Draco and Lucius by agreeing with Harry'a opinions on them, but arguing for blood supremacy by saying they gave it a bad name and it was all about preserving traditions and old values. Make it as creepy or as manipulative as you want, but Harry knows she's a daughter of the House of Black (a powerful wizarding family) and she obviously knows what she's talking about, and she's helped him so much he HAS to repay her.

Something like that.
