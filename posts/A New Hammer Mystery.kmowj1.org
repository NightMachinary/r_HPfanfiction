Hello all! I just wanted to plug the fact that I've just finished The Case of the Serpent's Shadow, which is a sequel story to my first fanfiction attempt. The first 13 chapters out of 21 have been uploaded today and I'm planning on uploading the rest on the 2nd of January pending final edits.

This is an AU setting in which Petunia Evans married a Scotland Yard detective named Grant Mason and Harry has grown up wanting to be a detective and obsessed with Film Noir and Humphrey Bogart movies. Adopting a nickname, Harry 'The Hammer' Potter-Mason is on a quest for the truth when he finds out magic is real and it led to his birth-parents' murder.

The first story, Case of the Cintamani Stone, is about 75k words and roughly follows the events of the Philosopher's Stone with a minimal number of in-universe changes to accommodate for a Harry with a detective's mindset.

The Case of the Serpent's Shadow is roughly 70k words and follows the timeline in Chamber of Secrets, though by the conclusion of the story it's wandered far away enough from canon that any subsequent stories will be setting off in their own direction and tone.

I started writing the first one originally as an exercise in rearranging the details of the HP canon into a different genre (Film Noir Detective Story) and it's since flowed from there. The stories themselves are traditionally plotted and paced such that it reads more like a conventionally published novel rather than serialized fanfiction, so please keep that in mind if you're thinking about skipping around between chapters.

Edit: Also as far as Britpicking is concerned, I am definitely not a UK resident, please tell me if anything is glaringly wrong with any of my events!


** That does sound interesting, though I did get slightly disappointed that you weren't referring to the Hammer Horror films from your title. A HP fic in the style of classic camp Gothic horror would be right up my alley. :D

"D-d-d-death Eaters? Zoinks!"

Though Film Noir Detective is also right up there too. Love that old Casablanca-Maltese Falcon vibe. :)

** OK I have read up to chapter 5 of the first fic and have enjoyed it so far. I only have 1 britpick which is in regard to a line chapter 4 about Harry not being allowed to have a weapon, which is complete understandable as he is 11. But for your information the majority of uk police do not carry firearms unless they have been through a training program to allow them to do so. And up to 2008 only firearms officers could carry tasers.

Next point - batons:\\
up until the mid 90's most officers used wooden truncheons with batons being introduced in 1994. If harry became a policeman he could use one .However the baton is classed as an offensive weapon meaning if a civilian harry was caught in possession of it or using it could land him any where from 6 months to 4 years prison sentence.

Final point - the troubles:\\
As you are writing a fic featuring the police in 90's please stay away from the subject unless you have done your research as it is a very sensitive subject for some people and it only ended in 1998 with the good Friday agreement which happen 22 days before the battle of Hogwarts.

*** Good to know! Thank you for pointing those out.

I knew about the civilian handgun ban of 1997, but I don't have a practical expectation of what the distribution of ownership was in the UK previous of that. I also was aware the difference between the armed/unarmed police units in the UK pre-war on terror, but thank you for reiterating the point.

My actual question would be if I got that line about Class A drugs and illicit firearms correct enough for it to work in the story.

As far as the Troubles are concerned, I'm not touching any English/Irish politics. They're off to Hogwarts in a fairly quick manner and Grant's a Detective Inspector with the Yard so the fall off to magic time and magic politics is going to sidestep that whole bit.

Would you be able to give me any pointers as far as crown court procedure goes though? I've been trying to figure out if there's an equivalent to a mistrial declaration in UK/Commonwealth courts, but so far I haven't been able to find a barrister/solicitor who'll give me time of day.

**** The line about drugs and guns would be correct enough to my knowledge. On the law side I have no idea seeing as I am in college. The UK has a rather large problem in that teens are often used by the supplier to deliver and transport drugs. Could be something that you want to include

** Hmm...chapter 2 of Cintamani Stone shows signs of being inspired by HPMoR? Petunia taking a potion to improve her appearance, Harry replying to his Hogwarts Letter by way of Mrs Figg. Is it a larger influence, or just used in that instance?

*** I won't deny that I read HPMoR. If I remember correctly there's 2 or 3 ideas he had which I used since it fit in with the Film Noir archetype and gets the story off the ground a bit more quickly.

Heh, that's a funny way to put that :D. Were you worried I'd downvote you for the association?

^{(Sadly not an entirely unreasonable fear in my experience, although personally I rather liked MoR.})

***** Not so much afraid of the downvotes, I read through the whole thing enjoying the first time without thinking about it and then tried to reread it again recently and realized I hated it since I had some time to process it.

What I was afraid of was being accused of either straight plagiarism (which it isn't) and/or a similar intent to HPMoR (which it also definitely isn't). I do hope you enjoy my story, though.
