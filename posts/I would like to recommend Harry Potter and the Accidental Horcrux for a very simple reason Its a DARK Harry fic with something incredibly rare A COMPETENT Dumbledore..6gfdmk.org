This fic covers the first three years and the end of the year events of first and second year stay relatively the same, while the third year events don't happen.

The Author is very good at characterization, and I hope that you find you enjoy reading it.

** I love this fic, but I am not sure if I would call Harry dark in it (or at least not yet). He is morally grey and somewhat brainwashed by Tom, but he doesn't really do anything dark or evil that I can remember.

*** what about the muggle he murdered to get the horcrux out of the cave. i mean the muggle was a rapist, but that wasnt why harry killed him. harry murdered him because tom ordered it and for no reason beyond that. At the moment harry is pretty evil simply because he doesent seem to understand morality beyond obeying tom.

**** To be completely honest, murdering a rapist does society a great amount of good. I wouldn't call it evil, whether he did it willingly or not.

***** maybe murdering a rapist could be considered good if it was done prevent further crimes, but thats not the case. Harry killed somebody because Tom wanted him to and for no other reason. This harry is evil because he would do anything with the moral justification tom knows best.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
