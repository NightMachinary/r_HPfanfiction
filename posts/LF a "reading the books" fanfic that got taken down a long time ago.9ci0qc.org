So this is probably a lost cause, but I'm trying to find my favorite "characters reading the books" fanfic from years ago. It was originally posted on FF.net before it got removed. It was uploaded to a different site, but I don't think that survived either. After that the author started a facebook group and would email new chapters out. I don't remember if the series was finished but I know it made it well into Half-Blood Prince.

Unfortunately I can't remember what the author's name was or what the story was called. But it was very in depth with a lot of character interaction. There were entire chapters of them just discussing what they had learned. I don't know all of the characters in it but it took place in the "present". The trio, Dumbledore, Snape, Remus, and Sirius were in it, but I can't remember who else.

I've found a few other fanfics kind of like it, but I'm thinking it might be gone forever.

EDIT: After typing all this out I found it. It's For a Better Future by Point Given, but it seems it's nowhere to be found on the internet. If any of the stories still exist out there I would be eternally grateful to find them.


** [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php]] has a lot of deleted fics

*** Yes! I've just downloaded Order of the Phoenix. They don't have Half Blood Prince, but this should keep me entertained for a long time. Thank you so much!

God damn.

These types of fics are guilty pleasures, though. If you have any others that can't be found by a simple Google (as I've already read practically all of them), I wouldn't mind a link.

** Fictionhunt has For a Better Future: The Order of the Phoenix [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/6664082/1]] as well as For a Better Future: The Half Blood Prince [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7750613/1]] . Unfortunately the second one isn't finished but covers at least half the book :)
