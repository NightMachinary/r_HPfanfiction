I actually don't use reddit that much so I have no idea how to do that [Request] Box thing >,> Anyways, anyone know a good harry/hermione fanfiction with little to no ron (i'm not looking for bashing) in post-apocalyptic world. I just read Simple and Clean by Digifruit and that was soooooooo goooooooooood


** Nothing immediately comes to mind for your story request. However, to get the box (actually called flair) in the front of your post, there's an setting after you post your post (heh), or just when looking at your own in general to add flair. Down where it says "Comment Edit Share..." There is one that says "Flair". Click it and you can add the appropriate one. This works on all subs, not just HPFanfiction
