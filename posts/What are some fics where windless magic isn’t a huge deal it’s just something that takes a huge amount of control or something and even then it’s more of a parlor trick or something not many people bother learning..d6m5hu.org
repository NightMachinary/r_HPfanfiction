My head-canon for wands has always been that the wand amplifies magic as well as helps to focus it. Kids have accidental magic so we know wandless magic should be possible but it's more of a simple magic thing.


** Link between the accidental magic and the wandless one has never been mentioned in the canon, and as far as I know Tom Riddle is the only known wizard able to intentionally control his magic before the age of eleven (yes, some wizards like Lilly Potter are able of some really simple fun things like flowers blooming, but nothing intentionally useful). Whole accidental wandless magic is in my opinion just a by-product of JKR's wish to show (especially in movies) some kids' magic without them having wands, so she broke her own fundamental rule about magic that it is always done with a wand (as she broke many of her other fundamental rules).

*** Lily was also able to control her descent from height -- a very rudimentary self-hover, which to me comes off as significantly more powerful than growing flowers. She wasn't nearly in as much control as Tom, but there was definitely control there, not accidental magic.

**** That I think was just a true case of accidental magic (like Neville bouncing), just a simple self-preservation.

***** It was entirely deliberate. When she jumped off that swing, she knew she wouldn't fall.

** Linkffn(Negligentia). Fair warning, though: it's a Twin-Who-Lived fic with /wildly/ OoC Potters.

  Six years after leaving Hogwarts, Harry Potter shares dinner with someone from his past and remembers some of the more important moments of his life. My take on the "brother of the boy who lived" story.

** Magic without wind. Without moving the wand, without pronuncing the words because would move air.
