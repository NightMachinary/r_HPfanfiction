Just theories or ideas about the houses themselves you like but isn't or isnt confirmed to be canon but makes sense to you or even if it doesn't make sense in canon its a change you wish could have been made or you would have liked to have seen.

For example My head canon is the sorting is based on what you value not what you are.

So someone who seems very typically Ravenclaw like Hermione gets into Griffindor because deep down she values those qualities more.

While many actual Ravenclaws you meet are people with specific interests/skills and you could call nerds who would be the type of person who would value knowledge for the sake of knowledge.

But because you value these qualities and people around you do you can grow into someone who does exemplify the qualities of the house.

*** I have the same thing! I reckon that Hufflepuff dorms might actually be cross-yeargroup, so they might have people from 1st year right up to 7th, with the older students being sort of 'dorm parents' to the younger.

I'd imagine that Ravenclaw would probably have two or three to a room until the NEWT years, when they'd need the quiet and space for study, so get a single.

Slytherins... they like their space.

** I personally think that the sorting hat sorts on future potential, not current aptitude, or maybe even where the person will flourish and become their best version of themselves. 11 year olds are almost never particularly cunning, or ambitious in anything but the most general terms. They're rarely hard workers, without an adult standing over them. Some few 11 year olds might make it into Ravenclaw, knowledge for knowledge's sake. But by and far the vast majority of 11 year olds. A small number might make it to Hufflepuff for loyalty. And even Gryffindor...11 year olds are that sort of stupid brave where they don't really understand the risk so they don't care about it. They're generally not courageous in the normal sense of the word.

I also like the idea the Heads of Houses have their rooms either within the House, perhaps on a small corridor off the Common Room, or right outside the entry to the House. And that there's a bell in the Common Room that rings in the Head of Houses' rooms/office.

Any House that has had someone have to do an 8th year because they failed their exams has an extra dorm room. The number of beds in the dorm room is a matter of shame for the House, as Hogwarts only creates a new bed in the dorm when multiple people need to do an 8th year. Ravenclaw's 8th year dorm has a single bed in it, students who are performing poorly are forced to sleep in there as punishment by the Prefects.

** - Since the Sorting Hat is canonically made up of an amalgamation of copies of the minds of all four Founders, I think the Sorting Hat's internal psyche basically consists of the four arguing for who will get who --- not that he /literally/ has a split personality, you understand, but he plays out the arguments in his head the way he knows they would happen; he knows that Salazar would say "this boy is clearly suited to my House, because [X]", and Godric would counter "but have you considered that [Y]", and so on.
- As such, all the really convinced blood-purists go to Slytherin because Slytherin was a blood-purist and the other Founders not, so the way the argument plays out in the Sorting Hat's head is Salazar saying: "but... but... they're stupid! they have no ambition! you can't just--!" and the other three ganging up on him and saying "screw you, we're not having someone like that in /our/ House, /you/ handle that kid". Hence things like Draco's lightning-sorting; it's not that he was obviously suited to being a Slytherin so much as that the imprints of the other three Founders were utterly mortified by the idea of having him in their House.
- A little-known but very widespread element of what makes a Gryffindor is a mischievous streak. Consider the Marauders, consider Fred & George, consider Dumbledore... and, this should not be underestimated, consider McGonagall, for all that she hides it. (Remember, she's the one responsible for sending Hogwarts Letters, so there's every reason to believe the "flood of letters down the chimney"/"letters in the groceries"/"letters eveywhere" thing in Book One was her pulling one over those "awful Muggles".)

*** I personally don't think that all blood purists go to Slytherin and its entirely possible to become one over time after being sorted or stop being one after being sorted. I also think that all purebloods who are very disconnected from muggles have certain biased thoughts about them that they end up getting over eventually.

For example Ron has a instinctive negative knee jerk reaction to Hagrid being half giant. Or at least not the most positive. He easily gets over it but the bias was there in the first place and he's still just a kid. Those biases might be easier to overlook when you are a kid and your world view is much more in flux than it is as an adult. So while the other founders may not have flat out refused to teach muggleborns I think they might have had some muggleborn bias too. After all if they were do on board with muggleborns why not just kick out the one who is blatantly anti muggleborn before he establishes a house?

That being said I actually love the idea of all the founders fighting over each kid. Helga is there like see he said Neville wants to be in Hufflepuff. And Godric is like only cuz he thinks hes not brave enough to be in my house. He thinks Im cooler hes just settling for you. And Helgas like well fuck you too Godric but hey I got Diggory so you can suck it. And everyone sulks because like the rest of the school they too all liked Cedric.

Also Im totally on board with Mischievousness is something Godric secretly values.

I did say "the really convinced blood-purists", not "the unconsciously-biased wizards", you know. Nor did I say that you couldn't become a blood-purist later on; only that any kids who are blood-purists at time of sorting go to Slytherin regardless of whether they're that cunning or ambitious.

I also think bias against nonhumans is an entirely different kettle of fish from blood-purism, and, for that matter, so's bias against Muggles /per se/. You can be biased against Muggles but not Muggle-borns (fanon!Grindelwald), or against all people with Muggle blood but not any form of magical beings (Hagrid, it would appear), or have nothing against Muggles or Muggle-borns but be okay with House-Elf slavery (most wizards in canon).

***** Thats fair there are definetly different kinds of bigotry shown and its possible to be one kind and not the other.

However these kids are 11. And very secluded 11 years too when it comes to purebloods. At that age its really easy to change your opinion on things when exposed to different ideas.

Draco for example didn't start saying Mudblood till his second year. Now that might just be when Rowling decided to introduce that concept. But in pottermore it mentions that Draco grew up around these bigoted views but was told not to broadcast them because it could get his father in trouble. Then he got to Slytherin made more bigoted friends and became more openly hostile. So this in my opinion is him getting more hateful due to his companions because the hostile rhetoric he grew up on is being doubled down on.

Hes kind of like the reverse Sirius. Sirius likely had a very similar upbringing. Like Draco I expect Sirius had certain things he just accepted as true but didn't think much on it. But then had those ideas he grew up with be disrupted. Werewolves aren't like people say, muggleborns aren't like people say. At that age you are constantly learning new things and having old ideas over written. Especially old ideas that had no importance to you. And as a kid growing up around just purebloods muggleborns would be pretty irellevant to you. Until you met one and hated them or got close to them. Then suddenly opinions about them would matter more.

Sure your parents think differently. But not agrreing with your parents isnt uncommmon for kids. If your relationship with said parent is less than stellar you might be more inclined to accept they are just wrong sometimes. And from the interaction in book 2 and given the type of person Lucius is Draco might still like his dad, but I think would be willing to admit he might be wrong about certain things. Especially if his own experience challenged his fathers beliefs

This is not to say Draco had no personal responsibility and had no way of changing his mind at any point or is this poor inocent. But he did have the potential to turn out very different pretty much everyone did. They are eleven. They dont really have the strongest of convictions.

Although Draco isnt the best example since he does have alot of slytherin qualities. He is cunning he tricks Harry into almost being caught by Filch first year. He is ambitious becoming a prefect getting onto the quidditch team second year getting all of the teams the best brooms so they can win. You could say he cheated or is unfair or even talentless but those arent slytherin qualities.

****** I'm not talking about potential, or even moral responsibility; merely whether or not 11-year-old-Draco or 11-year-old-Goyle was likely to want to jinx Muggle-borns for existing and call them names. This seems to me the best explanation of why the Sorting Hat would Sort Draco into Slytherin "the moment it touched his head". If there /are/ rationalizations for why he kinda fits the Slytherin ethos, they are too tentative to be the sort of thing that the Hat would consider clear-cut a second in. And even then I find the examples you cite dubious:

#+begin_quote
  He is cunning he tricks Harry into almost being caught by Filch first year.
#+end_quote

"Almost" is the operative word. He "almost" tricked a /first-year Gryffindor/, and even then didn't quite make it. Tricked him with one of the oldest tricks in the book too, surely not one he thought up himself.

#+begin_quote
  He is ambitious becoming a prefect getting onto the quidditch team second year getting all of the teams the best brooms so they can win.
#+end_quote

Arrogant and privileged is more like it. He didn't have a set goal he worked to attain, he just threw some money around to get the small people to admire him because they /should/ be admiring him.

******* I mean yes he isnt very smart yes and ya he fails to trick a 11 year old but he too is 11. He does become a bigger pain in Harrys ass in 5th and 6th year by being better at being cunning but that's not the point.

He doesn't have to be smart to be in Slytherin intelligence and talent arent the house qualities. If anything intelligence is a Ravenclaw quality Hes not necessarily hard working but he doesn't have to be. He just has to have things in wants that are hard to acheive and want to be sucessful. You can do that with very poor work ethic. Its not exactly a good thing but hard work isnt a slytherin quality its a hufflepuff one.

And this isnt to say that Slytherin only ever had petty horrible greedy people. You can have a hardworking ambitious talented cunning Slytherin who is a good person too and they can be perfect for the house too. But so is Draco. In fact Draco has shows ovbious slytherin qualities than most other people show for their own house.

Hermione for example alot of people say hey could have been Ravenclaw or Slytherin. Harry people say could have been Slytherin ive also seen the Hufflepuff argument.

Pettigrew many argue doesn't seem very Griffindor like Lockheart isnt that Ravenclaw like. But Draco seems very Slytherin at least to me while showing pretty much no qualities that might make him seem like he could be in other houses too.

** Ehem, extremely popular opinion coming through:

In my head canon, houses don't really matter because the Sorting is pretty much an organisational thing, and doesn't have any real meaning. I can't help but throw up a little whenever I read how all the Slytherins have 'aristocratic features' and sneer all the time. The first years are eleven-year-olds for crying out loud. The height of 'cunning' an eleven-year-old schookid commonly achieves is copying someone's homework and changing a few words. The only way I could possibly stomach the Sorting as a value selection or character evaluation would be if Houses could be switched at any time. Like, you do something brave: sorry, you're a Gryffindor now.

**** But what more exactly? Children at eleven can't be sorted based on their character, not even by magic because that would mean they'd never be able to change (before even reaching puberty, mind). A witty, friendly kid can easily become an introvert dreamer though. That's a simple fact.

And this doesn't even cover that eleven-year-olds simply aren't old enough to have super-nuanced characters. Real children are a bit witty, a bit snarky, a bit lazy, maybe friendly, sporty and so on and maybe a combination of two; real eleven-year-olds lack experience and concepts non-geniuses pick up naturally as they grow as a human.

An eleven-year-old wanting to become an astronaut isn't ambitious. He's a child.

*** Acculturation is a real thing. The houses each spend a lot of time separate from each other. They eat only with members of their own house. Most of their free time is spent in house common rooms. All classes are with their own house - even though they're also with another house, the two houses tend to keep separate in class. And of course there's ingrained rivalry between the houses, which strengthens the need to differentiate. So each house develops its own separate culture, and first years will rapidly adapt to that. While you can argue about what, if anything, the hat sees in 11 year olds, there's no doubt that the different houses are going to behave differently. First year Slytherins aren't necessarily going to be cunning, but they are going to sneer a lot and try to seem aristocratic.

** For dorms i would say this.

Ravenclaw dorms have the girl's dorms so that when a boy tries to open the door they are frozen until a girl says their name thrice

Gryffindor would be the original and Hufflepuff would have the same setup

The snake den would have single room dorms which would of course all be different sizes and you would get a room based on your houses standing (example. House Malfoy) so if a muggleborn somehow made it in then he or she would have a small jail like room with the actual ability to leave

Commons.

Ravenclaw commons has the ceiling enchanted like the hall of hogwarts but doesn't show what really is outside but shows the whole galaxy they're in and their private library is bigger than the hogwarts library. They also get the knowledge of the RoR (Room Of Requirement) at year 5 and can't talk about it to people who do not know because of being sworn to secrecy. (Phew that was a long one)

Gryffindor you guys already know (original) EXCEPT they have a small target practice area on the side which in you can practice any spells, but you can only shoot in the general direction of the targets.

The 'puffs have a super cozy and home like room and have a tunnel leading to the kitchens.

And finally the sneks have a similar common room as in the original series, but i don't remember if they had this. A window into the black lake that shows fishies and sometimes you can see the giant squid.

Stereotypes which make it to the houses.

The 'claws are usually smart,wise and extremely good at thinking outside the box

Gryffindors are brave, and courageous and foolish.

The 'puff's are kind, mostly happy and helpful but will defend their friends until the enemy has lost.

And then the sneks The slytherin population of the castle is basically the cunning and ambitious bullies of the school and most of them except a few are blood puristical

Those few being my favourite choice for pairing Daphne and then her friends of course. (they aren't usually paired with MC)

Oh and btw each founder made a secret room for their descendants (some weren't only for descendants)

Rowena Ravenclaw a study with the diadem and all her knowledge (the diadem only helps you learn and doesn't actually give you instant knowledge) she also made the RoR in my ideas

Gryffindor also made two rooms one of which is the headmasters office and the other being a study that you could reach by pressing a brick in the enchanted staircase with gryffindor's sword and then dropping a drop of blood onto a pedestal which appears after sword thingy. After that you have access to the study as long as you have the ring on your finger that appears after the first visit

Hufflepuff made a room you can relax in with your friends (this one is not descendants only this is everyone) which is opposite to the hufflepuff commons and opens when you say ”relaxation above all” and you can then enter a room which has a hot tub and other fun things

Slytherin built the chamber of secrets and a secret study in there which is accessed by blood sample on a pedestal which appears after some snek tongue work and has some personal diaries and some parseltongue guide books and spells in that language too.

THAT is my headcanon gosh that was a long one

Some ideas are very similar to some fanfics and yes i know that but i don't think they have exclusive rights on ideas.

Hope you had fun reading it!
