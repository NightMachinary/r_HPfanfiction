This gets posted every so often so I thought I'd post it again. I recently discovered linkffn(5247028; 11703494). I enjoyed them quite a bit and now I've trawling through some under-used categories for gems. So I was wondering if anyone else here has some more to add to me reading list.

  During the battle with Volemort in the graveyard, Harry finds a new power awakening within him. A power that will turn his life completely upside down when the only other person with this power pays him a visit. Harry's life will never be that same again.
