So guys and girls. I'm looking for a fic. I can't remember where I found it but I am sure it was ff.net. it was a Harry x Narcissa and I think atleast Bellatrix. Harry did something like defeat Lucious or maybe just inherit the head of house Black and such which resulted them being released by a family contract. Narcissa ends up being the main ship from memory and helps Harry through everything after becoming lord. Story has lemons. If you have an idea of this story or similar let me know. Btw its not time travel.

This is very similar in some ways and fits the general themes but isn't exactly what you are looking for.
