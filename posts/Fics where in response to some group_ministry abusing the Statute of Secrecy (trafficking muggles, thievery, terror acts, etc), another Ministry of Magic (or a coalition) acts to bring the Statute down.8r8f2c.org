Just something I thought of; if the original purpose of the Statute of Secrecy was to protect magical humans and magical creatures from persecution, a magical community taking advantage of it to deliberately attack and exploit muggles without retaliation would mean that the Statute is being used counter to its original purpose.

So, if you have something like a bad Ministry that likes spiriting away muggles/muggleborn to use them as slaves, or Araminta Meliflua managed to get that muggle-hunting bill passed, or some wizard's fomenting civil war and famine for their amusement...are there any stories where another Ministry goes "Oh hell no, that's not what the Statute of Secrecy was made for!"

Presumably it would come after a failed intervention by the ICW, mind...bleh, I'm rambling. Does anyone know any such stories?
