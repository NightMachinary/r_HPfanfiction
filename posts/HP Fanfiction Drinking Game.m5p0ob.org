****** The name of a constellation, I guess, keeps with the theme of the Blacks.

Leo Black doesn't flow(unless it's Leonard or Leonidas, but then it doesn't follow the naming rule), closest thing IMHO would be Regulus(the brightest star in the Leo constellation) but that has already been used.

Some people go with Ares Black, due to the connection with the god of war, but I don't know if there's a star or constellation named Ares.

If I had to name Harry as a Black, it would probably be Orion (because it's cool , associated with the hunter, etc)

*** This is too good. I can't stop laughing. Also even before that starts I think the goblins were apparently misunderstood when Ragnok is their king... And Harry asks to be called Harry. So basically you would already have six shots before Harry is declared heir of anything.

And you'd be at least comatose before the first chapter is over.

This is the best shit I read since My immortal.

**** I'm not sure that's going to save you. By my count Harry inherits 247 in that chapter, which amounts to the following number of shots:

1,152,058,411,884,454,788,302,593,034,206,568,772,452,674,037,325,128

Even if you cut this in half so that we only count the first 123 titles, that's still this many shots:

14,028,366,653,498,915,298,923,761

*** I actually decided to read the first chapter once I saw the intro. It's... not well written. But I've read worse, so I decided what the heck and I'd finish the chapter. Then I got to the goblin list. And tried to read it. Then tried some more.

Then it just kept going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going.... and going some more.

So I decided to try and skip it completely and go on top the next segment. But then there was more. And more. And more. And more.

Y'all, don't drink to this. You will die before the end of the first segment of the list. This is brutal. This is madness. And I didn't even make it to the end of the first chapter.

Okay, so. I went back and read some of it, starting from the bottom.

First: descended from Hans Christian Anderson? I mean... I get the royalty and founding fathers nonsense but... the author of the Little Mermaid? Really?

So, there's a family tree of the Potters (which is hilariously marked as /descendants/ instead of ancestors, linking him to Isolt Sayre, a German prince and George Washington. And then, it goes on to say that this Daniel Potter bloke was his /step father/, making everything that came before it nonsense: Henry Potter, therefore, isn't blood related to Daniel.

Also: can we add 'Mixing up ancestors and descendants' to the drinking game? Makes that fic more dangerous to read, but....

Often involves Harry getting with Daphne Greengrass, Fleur Delacour, Nymphadora (Your true form is beautiful) Tonks, Sometimes Hermione, or Susan Bones, or on occassion, Bellatrix Black.

While /most/ Indie!Harry fics are rather poor in quality, by the definitions commonly used for them masterpieces like 'Prince of Slytherin', and 'A Cadmean Victory' are also Indie!Harry fics, so like all things there is going to be a positive example of it somewhere.

** This is fckin brilliant. I haven't actually seen a lot of these personally because I don't read indie!Harry and didn't know what it was until a few weeks ago but am already so aware of these tropes.

The ones that really stood out to me:

I deeply hope no one has ever written smut where a character uses "engorgio" on their genitals, and yes, I would like someone to respond if they've seen this before. Is it meant to be a fun, sexy thing to do, or is it in like a dark Tomarry context? I will be pondering this all day.

Ron eating constantly and speaking with his mouth full is honestly very canon. That's why A Very Potter Musical has him eat whenever he's onstage. When my sisters and I read Cursed Child aloud, my sister reading for Ron just grabbed an apple and said all his lines while chewing. And we all love Ron.

Also, respect for anyone writing their own sorting hat song. I have never even tried.

Both? I mean... there's one where Hermione uses engorgio on her breasts... and was meant as a humour one as well as a smut, I hope. So, guess if the size is very disproportionate, humor must be involved.

**** I am so sure there are fics out there where the size is disproportionate with absolutely no humor involved, but I kind of love it for an American Pie-style raunchy comedy. That's hilarious.

I honestly haven't seen it a lot in fanon because I don't usually read Hogwarts era stuff, so there aren't as many scenes where they're all hanging out in the Great Hall (which is where I'd imagine it usually takes place), but he does it a LOT in canon. Also, something that comes to mind with making Ron look stupid is in Order of the Phoenix, when Hermione passes out the DA galleons and Ron gets excited then disappointed when she explains, like... she's obviously not going to be giving you money, man. Such a stupid time to insert a joke about Ron being poor.

EDIT: mixed up "canon" and "fanon"

***** If you reread the books you will realize Ron doesn't actually eat grossly as much or often as fanfics make us think. It's the same thing with Harry cooking for the the Dursleys, in the books he is asked to watch over the bacon, for a moment, once.

Actually in canon, I think it's more common to see Hermione actually being the one rushing to eat, so she can hurry to the library or something.

****** Yeah I'm not so acquainted with those tropes first hand because not my era, but I've heard lots of bacon references on Reddit. It's the availability heuristic though like I haven't reread SS in a long time but I don't think you see him make food other than bacon, so people just latched onto it. You know what I just remembered is that the thing that stuck out to me about Ron's eating is how often he gesticulates with a breakfast sausage to emphasize his point, which may not happen that much relative to how much content is in the books but I guarantee happens more than once.

** Maybe you could also add

• Harry was poisoned with potions. Dumbledore with obedience, 1 shot. Weasleys with loyalty, 2 shots. Molly and Ginny with love/lust potions, 3 shots. Hate potion towards Slytherins, 5 shots, 1 extra shot per extra potion. 8 shots if it was all Ron, Ginny and Molly, and the rest of the family didn't know

• Dumbledore blocks Harry's magical core. 50% 1 shot, 75% 2 shots, 90+% 3 shots.

• If Dumbledore blocks abilities: 1 shot if parseltongue, 2 shots if animagus form(s), 3 shots if elemental ability, 8 shots if more than one elemental ability, 5 shots if 'speaking all magical languages', 20 shots if all of them, and +1 shot for every extra ability blocked.

• If Dumbledore obliviates: 1 shot if Harry, 2 shots if Dursleys, 3 shots if teacher, 5 shots if potential friend. Multiplied by however many times it happens.

• 21 shots if Lucius Malfoy or any Malfoy was a spy for the Order

• 13 shots if Lily and James hate Dumbledore
