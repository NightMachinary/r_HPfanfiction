  Hey, wouldn't it be cool if someone took as many fanfic cliches as possible and stuffed them all into one story? No? Well, I went ahead and did it anyway. Multi-chapter Mockfic. This summary is actually a lot better than I originally thought.

** Let me guess, at some point it has Professor McGonagall join the Death Eaters so that the narrative will describe her clothes for once?

If that's the one you're thinking of, I suggest Potter Ever After by Kevin3. linkffn(11136995)

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.
