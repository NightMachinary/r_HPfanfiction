I'm especially interested in Andromeda, McGonagall and Barty Crouch Jr.


** Augusta Longbottom was born Augusta Device. Permanently excluding the Devices from the Sacred Twenty-Eight by telling Cantankerus Nott where to stick his engagement ring and offering him the loan of a ball-peen hammer to ensure it was firmly lodged there, she eloped with a Muggle, with whom her whirlwind romance and blissful marriage was cut short after three years when he went in with the Pals at Serre on the north flank of the Somme. The daughter they had followed him three years later in the Spanish Flu, and a heartbroken Augusta stayed in the muggle world for twenty years. Finding new purpose in life driving an ambulance in the blitz - passing for a much younger woman by virtue of being a witch - she met a young Martellus Longbottom while standing by for an unexploded bomb on Charing Cross Road and nipping in to the Leaky Cauldron to get unrationed chocolate for the nurses at the Casualty department she worked out of.

It's why she comes across as really old - "little old lady" as Neville describes her - rather than middle aged as the grandmother of a kid Harry's age would be. She was in her early forties when she met Neville's grandfather, and why she's got that hard attitude, she's been through the wringer of two World Wars in ways that regular magicals haven't.

It also explains why one of the most famous names in 17th century English witchcraft doesn't appear in the list of the most prominent 20th century magicals.

** I'll rep it until I die: linkffn(Order of Mercy by MandyinKC).

Basically a 7th year canon-compliant story showing what Fleur and Percy do to help Muggleborns during Harry's Horcrux hunt. Introduces Audrey, who we all know Percy marries in canon, and also has plenty of Bill and some of the old Hogwarts Quidditch team in it (lots of Oliver).

** Take this for what it's worth.

Andromeda Black fell in love with Ted Tonks at Hogwarts and left her family and all their posturing and pretense behind. She preferred the role of 'wry observer' to gossip/glory hound. At some point she started smoking and hasn't stopped, to the point that her daughter will go out shopping with her and just wait for her to cough in order to find which aisle she's in. Her favorite past-time is watching telly shows, and Andromeda is a close follower of EastEnders. She and Teddy run a year-round hothouse for both muggle and magical herbs... and not the legal kinds, either. The great irony of the Tonks family is that Nymphadora wants to serve the interests of law and order as much to balance out the chaos of her home life as for using her capabilities to their best effect.

** I have a bit of headcanon that says there's an inserted halfblood from our world that owns a pawn shop and apartment block on the corner of Diagon and Nocturn, Gringotts side. He was two years ahead of Voldie in school, and has had ample time to make himself politically and economically untouchable in both worlds; given access to magic, immunity to memory manipulation and infiltration, and foreknowledge of the next 80 Years or so.

He doesn't interfere, though, so I wouldn't be surprised if you've not heard of him. But he â€˜may' have extracted an oath from a certain boy named Tom while at hogwarts, to the effect of complete immunity and retained privacy in exchange for 1000G a year, every year, forever.

As it turns out, the ICW gives no shits what you choose to invest in, in the muggle world, as long as you don't Tell Anyone about magic. How short sighted of them.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

** I don't believe for a second that Barty Crouch Sr was merely absent or preoccupied. I think he was far worse than that. He presided over at least one sham trial, didn't give at least one person a trial at all and authorized the use of unforgivables. He cared more about image and position and perfection than anything or anyone else. Jr sought out a replacement in /Voldemort/ and well within a year of his Azkaban sentence beginning, every good thought was entirely gone and it was killing him. Sr supposedly broke him out for his wife, but Jr was far closer to his mother and isn't knowing she would die in a place like that just the perfect way to torture someone? He clearly did not actually care to free Jr or he would not have kept him imperiused for over a decade. He was all about control and the denial of freedom and of individuality and that kind of person is never going to be a pleasant person to live with. That intense hatred had to come from somewhere.
