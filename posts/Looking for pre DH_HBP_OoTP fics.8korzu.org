To clarify, I'm looking for fics that are complete that were written before the release of Order of the Phoenix, Half Blood Prince or Deathly Hallows.

Anywhere in between books is fine. I'm mostly interested to see what great ideas people had before either the Prophecy or Horcruxes were mentioned in canon.


** Go to the Sugarquill website. They have an indicator of when the fic was written.
