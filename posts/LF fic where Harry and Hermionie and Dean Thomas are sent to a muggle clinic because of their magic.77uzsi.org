  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

**** I like it. It has competent adults, which can be satisfying but can also rob the children of their agency. Also, after five years of writing it's barely halfway into 1st year, so it's hard to say if the story will really be interesting when the real conflicts begin. But these are versions of the characters that I enjoyed spending time with, so I've read it twice now and will now probably read it again a third time.

**** It is pretty good in general, but the first half is where the story truly shines. The author does a great job in painting the hardships these children and their parents face, weaving together just the right amount of angst, drama, laughs and hesitant closeness. The character voices were masterfully authentic. In short, Harry's (and later Hermione's) adjustment period in the institute was a genuine pleasure to read.

*** Yay! I'm so glad it's been update. I started it a year ago, but I haven't gotten very far (not because it isn't good, but because I get sidetracked so easily).
