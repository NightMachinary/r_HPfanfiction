Well... no karkaroff as he is already doing that. But is there a fic where beard is treated as symbol of wisdom, and wizards try to grow theirs as magnificent as possible?


** "Oh, Harry." Cho raked her slim fingers through her love's magnificent, long white facial hair. It was so long it practically reached his belt. "I just adore your beard." Her voice dipped into a husky purr. "It's so sexy."

"Thanks, Cho." Harry smiled fondly back at her. "I like yours, too."

*** I seem to remember a certain fic where bellatrix never shaved down there at azkaban, and harry is horrified when he sees it growing long.

Is that what you mean by inside?
