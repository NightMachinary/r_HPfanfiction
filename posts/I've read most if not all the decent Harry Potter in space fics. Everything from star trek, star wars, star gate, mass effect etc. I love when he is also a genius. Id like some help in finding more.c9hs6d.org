** Darth Mars has a new Battlestar Galactica crossover. I've really enjoyed it so far.

Updating weekly on Saturdays I think. Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13161929]])

On mobile, hope I got the bot format right.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.

** Linkao3(Say a prayer by mad_fairy)

Good Tom, wizards evacuating Earth, MCU Loki crossover (but from a few years back around winter soldier, so a bunch of characters are from the comics or Norse mythology that ended up completely different in recent MCU films)

Linkao3(D.S.S. Requirement)

The Room can turn into a Stargate to an abandoned alien space ship that's floating around in the asteroid belt. While Umbridge terrorizes Hogwarts, the DA slowly repair the ship as a way to distract themselves from the brewing war. When it turns out that some asteroids contain a little gold (which is actually a lot, considering that the asteroid is miles large), they start their own company to get muggleborns off-planet.

Linkffn(Significant Digits)

HPMoR sequel with a space exploration subplot. One of the first fics I've read (second after HPMoR itself), so I don't remember it very well but the space scenes are great.

  (Continuation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) It's easy to make big plans and ask big questions, but harder to follow them through. Find out what happens to Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, Hermione, Draco, and everyone else once they grow into their roles as leaders, leave the shelter of Hogwarts, and venture out into a wider world.
