Pretty much what the title says. From what I remember Harry was having a fight with Ron in the common room and Hermione intervened, breaking the former's wand by mistake. Harry said he'd never forgive her before leaving.

It might be a well known story, but having read so many of them recently things are a bit jumbled up.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** Drat. I caused Cadmean Victory to be linked for the thousandth time.

Anyway, that's the story. Thanks for satisfying my curiosity.
