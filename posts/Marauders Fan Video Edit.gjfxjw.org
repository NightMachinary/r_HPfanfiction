Hi everyone! I made a Marauders edit on youtube - "The Marauders | No Time to Die", Link below:

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIgML7cYLRM]]

This video features young James, Sirius, Remus, Peter, Lily, and a little bit of Severus - the edit has snippets of Marauder's friendship, James/Lily falling in love, Sirius being kicked out of his home, Peter's betrayal, and a few other things. The song used is "No Time to Die" - the new James Bond theme.

Please let me know how you feel about it! This video is my first edit that I've posted online and I would like to improve and make more. Thank you!

(sorry if this is the wrong place to post this - I just wanted to put this out there in case I ever make a trailer or edit for a fanfic)
