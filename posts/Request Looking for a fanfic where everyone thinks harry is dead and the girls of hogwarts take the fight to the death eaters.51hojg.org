I read this story a while ago, where Harry seemingly died and Hermione gathered the girls who knew Harry and they fight back against the Death Eaters and cause a lot of damage. In the end Voldemort gets killed in a muggle hospital by Harry who wasn't dead but severely injured and healing at that hospital.

  What will the Wizarding world do when it's reported that Harry Potter is dead? The answer might surprise you. (Based off an idea by Rorschach's Blot, and written/posted with his knowledge.)
