Hi guys, I hope I did my flair correctly...

I am wondering if there are fanfictions similar to this story: "The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysterie"? ( linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13438181/1/The-Arcanist-Unspeakable-Mysteries]]) )

I like how the author explored different universes and mash them up. Adventuring, dungeoning of sorts, etc. Dumbledore as a party member or mentor would be cool too.

Perfectly no Dumbledore bashing and no slash please (I have nothing against to that).

Thanks in advance!

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, OP!Harry, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, Real Magic, & The TWT in a way you have never seen.

** Are you looking for specifically Lovecraftian similarities, or is just general dungeoneering okay? There's a couple good D&D fics about if the latter is okay, and I think I have a few good Lovecraftian ones if you'd prefer the former.

*** Just D&D in general please. I don't know much about Lovecraftian thing, but from what I read it is mainly horror? Which generally I don't like haha (I want to sleep :P)

**** Lovecraft is more... abstract horror. It's sort of based around the idea that we're insignificant ants and trying to comprehend the universe (and the other things in it) will drive us insane. If you're alright with blood and a bit of mild self-harm (though not overly graphic), this ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7O8mrO_wY]]) video shows the tone of Lovecraft really well. It's definitely horror, but it's cosmic horror and not like, jump scares and gore and such like modern horror. Lots of philosophy and existentionalist thinky stuff with God-aliens that bend your mind when you look at them or think about them too much, basically.

But okay, D&D fics. I know four really good ones.

The first is a big series called Girl in Red. Essentially, an artificer (magical doodad magician) gets thrown into the world, gets to know some people and unites them as her new 'party', then shit gets a little mad (because no sane person becomes a D&D adventurer) and occasionally dark. Never quite goes into scary horror, IMO, but my metric for that is probably different to yours. The first one at least is very nice, though. The borderline-horror is later on.

The second is a classic of this fandom called Harry Potter and the Natural 20 where a similar thing happens, only it's a dude and a rules munchkin (someone who plays with technicalities and loopholes in the rulebook, if you're not familiar with the term).

The third is called Knight of the Radiant Heart and it involves a Paladin teaching Harry how to Paladin, and I think there's some leak-over from D&D baddies later on somewhere. Been awhile since I read it, but I remember it being great.

The fourth is called Harry Potter and the Ranger and the Miniature Giant Space Hamster and it features Minsc and Boo from Baldur's Gate. It's... it's beyond words and I love it so. My personal favourite of this list and really captures the joy I felt the first time I played Baldur's Gate back in the day as a wee sprog.
