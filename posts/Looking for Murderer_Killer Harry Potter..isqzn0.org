** Not evil Harry, kills leftover death eaters after the war. 4.5k words, Ron's POV, Oneshot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13266686/1/Not-Dumbledore]]

Not complete psycho killer but he is pretty much a dark lord with good goals. One of my favourite fics. 26k word Oneshot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4133028/1/The-Birth-of-Evil]]

Ruthless Harry who kills or incapacitates people who wish him harm. 17k word Oneshot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3750393/1/Harry-Potter-s-Life-Lessons]]

Hermione and Ron both disapparate in DH. Harry ends the war earlier than in Canon by himself. 47k words two shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12408440/1/The-Aftermath]]

Some of this is pretty poorly written but its a fanfiction where Harry and Blaise Zabini grew up together and they become assassins. Kills like 50 people and the minister in one night. 75k words, 19 parts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9729235/1/Wand-Knife-and-Silence]]

Don't really know how to explain this one so I'll just leave it here and says its good. 220k words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9486886/1/Moratorium]]

Harry reverses the link he has with Voldemort, possessing him and making Voldemort kill all his death eaters and then himself. 10k word Oneshot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9132770/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Connection-Reversed]]

An old classic where Harry is abandoned by Hermione and Ron during Goblet of Fire, and befriends Ginny. Makes and army and starts a revolution. Kills most of the Goblins and then Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4545504/1/Aspirations]]

One of the best fanfictions ever written. The most realistic post-war Dark Lord Harry you will ever read. He does kills some innocents but mostly death eaters. A must read fanfiction. 140k words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts]]

Funny super!Harry where he kills all the Death Eaters just before 7th year. 11k word Oneshot.

** Not sure if it's exactly what you wanted, but Harry is a killer in this story below, "The Darkness Within." It's my all time favorite story, but it's pretty popular so you might've already read it.

Harry killed in this story, but he isn't all evil, so it may not be what you're looking for.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within]]

If you're looking for a psycho killer Harry, try the one below, "A Shattered Prophesy." This story below was actually what inspired the one above so they are pretty similar. Although "A Shattered Prophesy" is a tragedy and has a much darker Harry.

  A twist of Fate... an opened window... a cradle robbed... two frantic parents... a lost hope, along with a shattered Prophecy. Moved to 'M' for future violence. Extending take down until July 1, 2012, so I have time respond to everyone and its gives people time to finish reading.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sun Source by Clell65619). Harry brought up as an assassin.

linkffn(Black Phoenix by n1gh3lf). Harry becomes a terrorist.

linkffn(Breach of Contract: Twelve Signs by The Matt Silver). Auror Harry has to kill, while investigating ritual killings. Strange, but good.

  To avoid the unjust prosecution of his friends in the days following the end of the war, Harry Potter signed a magical contract in blood. Years later, Harry struggles with the balance of his latest Auror case involving a wizard ritualistically murdering Muggles, periodic contract renewals, and both the developing and deteriorating relationships with those closest to him. HP/NT.
