I am looking for an HP goes dark fic where Harry and Ron (maybe Hermione too) go dark. It was a slash fic I believe. The Weasley's realize Ron has betrayed them because he is never "in danger" on the family clock.

I am also looking for any fic where Harry is Voldemort's son/grandson...I read one I really liked a long time ago, but I don't remember anything other than Harry was related to Voldemort....it was most likely a slash story.


** I know of some. Of course, there are many others that you can find if you search.

Linkffn(9067051)

This one is a dark Golden Trio fic and SLASH. As you may have guessed, it's Harry/Tom

Linkffn(8195669)

This is Harry as a dark lord with his own followers from all Houses and an alliance with Voldemort. Also SLASH

Linkffn(4924413)

Linkffn(10604318)

Hope you enjoy them.

  Everything changes the summer of 5th year when a mere letter causes Harry's magic to react wildly and he finds out that Dumbledore has been controlling him and his friends a lot more than first thought. With the truth revealed to him, Harry shows everyone he isn't the Gryffindor Golden Boy everyone thinks he is and he isn't the only the one with masks. DarkEvilTrio! SLASH

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

  He was a genius. He could paint, play music, talk to snakes, control fire. He was more powerful and intelligent then any knew. He had strong 'friends'. The problem was, he had few emotions. Dark Harry. I Do Not Own Harry Potter. -Slash-

  Tom Riddle/Harry Potter Slash. What if Harry didn't want to fight Voldemort? What if he was fed up with the light side judging him constantly and wants to be his true self? The Slytherin side that he had squashed in a bid to fit in and be accepted? Realizing he never would...what of the prophecy? Could they overcome it? Will Voldemort even give him a chance?
