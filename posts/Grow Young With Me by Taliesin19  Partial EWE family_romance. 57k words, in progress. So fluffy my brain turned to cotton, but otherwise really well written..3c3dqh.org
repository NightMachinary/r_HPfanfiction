** Gah I'm absolute shit at writing titles on mobile, as half of it disappeared.

Anyway, it's 2009 and Harry is dealing with life: being Head Paper Pusher for the Auror Office (by choice), having three lovely little kids, and coping with the loss of his soul mate three years prior. How will things change when a young waitress pesters and pokes her way into his life?

It is really fluffy like I said but there is potential for plot beyond the trope filled widower-meets-girl but even if that turns out to be the entirety of the plot it is still very well written.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

*** I'Ll look up a fanfic glossary for you but in the mean time it means: Epilogue? What Epilogue? Meaning it is post Final Battle but before the 19 years later. In this case it is approximately 10 years later, after he and Ginny had their kids.

**** EWE generally just means that it's post-book 7 but ignores the epilogue, regardless of the time frame. A fic set 20 years later where Harry and Ginny broke up after a few months would be EWE, as would one set only 2 years later.
