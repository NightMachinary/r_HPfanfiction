Do you worry about it at all? Try for British words and phrases rather than spelling? Do you get a British beta? If so, how do you find one? Do you do it yourself? Research the hell out of it?

I'm straight up from the U.S. Southeast --- born and raised in the heart of Dixie. I studied abroad in London for a year, but in no way am I kidding myself into thinking I have any grasp whatsoever on how to write like a Brit. I really just dabble in fanfiction (more like floundering my way through and writing the best I can).

So American writers like me, how do you handle this when writing Harry Potter fanfiction?


** I don't beat myself up over it too much, like I won't spell it as honour, flavour, colour, arse, etc. But I will call it Philosopher's Stone rather than Sorcerer's Stone, and I'll use words like bin rather than dumpster. My only real exposure is from watching Top Gear about a million times, which is better than nothing I guess, but hardly all-consuming.

*** For me, the only one of that list I actually use is "arse." I'm not going to go through and make sure every -or is -our, but arse is pretty easy to do. And I also call it Philosopher's Stone rather than Sorcerer's.

** I'm neither British nor American, and I don't really care about phrase choices or words difference like chips/crisps, pudding/dessert etc. But what I always hate, when its clearly American culture represented, especially with muggle-world centric stories. Like, no, it's not how schools work in England. No, you don't need car at 16, it's not that necessary. No, you don't use dollars in UK... A little bit research please?..

** PSA: If anyone ever does want a Brit-picker, I can't commit to long-term beta work but I'm happy to do one-offs, short stories, quick read through, etc.

From a British reader perspective, I can ignore American spellings or differences in language I doubt are common knowledge, but it really bothers me when Ron walks on a sidewalk past a trash can on his way to see his mom, shouting 'goddammit!' as he spills donut powder all over his pants.

** It's also hard for us Australians. Yes, we use a lot of British mannerisms and such, but a lot of our culture has its own flair. It's hard to refer underwear as pants. Yes, I used trousers to describe what Americans call pants, but undies were always just that.

[[https://www.englishclub.com/vocabulary/british-american.htm]]

Was rather helpful, but I still get most of them wrong as I call it a sidewalk. Another thing is I use the American version of Mr. as it looks neater. I like the period.

I mean, it doesn't bother me, at least I try and stick to canon things and keep them as the same. :p

***** In Australia there is a peculiar mix of American/British English. One of my friends went to the UK to teach PE (Brits still with me - PE = sport) at a posh high school school. The kids all had their trousers on over their running shorts, so she (19 yo, blonde Australian at the time) said "come on boys get your pants off"

She is still embarrassed about it 30 years later.

** I have an American-British dictionary which I have read and now occasionally skim through for a refresher. It doesn't have every little difference in it, and even if it did, I don't have it memorized, so I still make mistakes, but it definitely helps, at least with the major stuff.

The other thing is, once I'm in 'Brit mode', I try to stay as locked in it as possible while I'm writing that chapter, even if I'm writing somewhere else, like Reddit. This possibly makes me look pretentious to people who know I'm American and I throw out a 'favourite', but it really helps me make fewer mistakes if I'm not switching back and forth all the time.

***** I actually like 'goddamn' or 'dammit/damn it'.

It's such a childish swearword that it fits many characters. An eleven year old dropping the f-bomb constantly is rather annoying. Yes, kids swear, but normally it's something else instead of fuck.

My favourite swear word is bastard. It can just fit and it's a longer word, making it more intimidating. :D!

As for usage in fics. I don't mind it. It's kinda like using 'hate'. It's a very expressive word and it can get you into what the character feels. But a character that swears every second word is just an annoyance.
