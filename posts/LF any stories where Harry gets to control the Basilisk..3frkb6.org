  Harry's now going into his 3rd year again & it's getting complicated. Sirius still escaped & Harry has to deal with Slytherin politics & some extra timetravel on top of old drama. Rescuing Sirius is the number one mission, but things keep reverting & Harry is worried he can't change a Thing. Dumbledore/Goodguys bashing. 3rd in series. Rated M coz I'm paranoid. It all belongs to Jo!

** There is one where he convinces the snake that Tom's diary-shade is not worthy of the heir's title any more, but I don't remember which one it was.

There's also /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2750705/1/In-The-Company-of-Secrets][In The Company of Secrets]]/ (W: 420,992; abandoned), which is /somewhat/ relevant to your request but what I'm referring to happens rather late into the (abandoned) story.

  Harry Potter was never a good little child. Harry Potter learned the hard way early on, that the good only won in stories and fairy tales, and so to adapt, Harry Potter chose not to be such a good little girl anymore. Gray!Harry Dark!Harry Manipulative!Harry Fem!Harry F!Harry -COMPLETE-

**** I have it a go - it's probably the best one that I've read recommended in this thread, but it's pretty bad overall.

Starts off moderately interesting but devolves into wannabe crack pretty quickly, and the humour falls very short of enjoyable.

I'm still confused by the concept, so I can't really expand on that summary.
