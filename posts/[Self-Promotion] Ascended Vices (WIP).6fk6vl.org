After much procrastination, I got around to posting the first chapter of my long-awaited (three months!) sequel to Lesser Evils. First of all, the title is less uninspired this time. I also believe myself to be a better writer now than when the thing that eventually became Lesser Evils first took shape in 2012.

To those familiar with the first fic, I'm going to stick to triadic chapter structure and that includes the prologue, of which the first part (posted) is from Sirius' POV, and each of the other two will also exclusively follow one character. I will refrain from more spoilers.

If you've read Lesser Evils, you know what to expect. If you haven't, this story will make little sense to you, beyond the usual familiarity one can expect from having read a lot of fanfiction. But enough babble. Enjoy.

  Sequel to Lesser Evils. Harry seeks a purpose of his own. Lines blur for Sirius as he fills the power vacuum left in Wizarding Britain by Voldemort and Dumbledore. The war never really ended.
