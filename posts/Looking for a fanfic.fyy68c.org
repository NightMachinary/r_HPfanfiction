:END:
So there's this fanfic that starts with harry and the trio of friends at the Dursley Household to stay for a week on the pretense yo fix /something/ at around the time the 7th book starts. without spoiling much Harry has a acctual relationship with Ginny who actually does stuff, the world is more fleshed out, and side characters get more development. I think its called the last horcrux but I can only find something that starts with a mailbox
