Hey all, I'd love to get some recommendations on fics to read!

I would like some : Hufflepuff Harry stories (I've read the Titular Hufflepuff Harry and it's sequel)

Some realistic Harry stories (as in what a kid would actually be like if he went through abuse and how messed up he would be as a result)

Some "dark" Harry stories (I've read HP and the Boy Who Lived and anything like that would be great!)

Rational Harry stories. I LOVE HPMOR

Thanks!


** I can't help you with the others as I don't have much time, but hufflepuff!harry is just specific enough to find /one/ fic in my library that isn't "Harry the Hufflepuff"

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3270283/1/][The value of Teamwork]]

  Quick oneshot of Hufflepuff!Harry at the Triwizard Tournament. Part of the Alternate House Challenge series from Potter's Place 3.

For Hufflepuff in general here are two more:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2872398/1/][Steve the Hufflepuff Deatheater]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5846518/1/][Insurgence]]

** If you are at all familiar with basics of D&D - Harry and The Natural 20.

It has a similar sort of humor that HPMOR has - and from the perspective of a D&D character, some pretty interesting logic/inventiveness.

HPMOR writer endorsed it a while back.

If you are not into D&D at all though, most of it will go over your head.

*** I've been reading this. While I don't know D&D very well I find it very humorous. "Does he have more than 3 descriptors? Then he's a main character"

** Roxie Snape's [[http://ficwad.com/story/167382][Shake Me]] has an older, runaway Harry sorted into Hufflepuff. Not the most polished of stories (an older fic, it has plenty of wish-fulfillment and tired tropes), it might be readable if you're into this sort of thing.

Another is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/C-est-La-Vie][C'est la Vie]] by cwyscross. 108k words, but will probably never be finished (the author is notorious for not finishing her stories).

For "dark" Harry, some of Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/1/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][one shots]] perhaps? Specifically /Dark Aeons/, /Cold Case/, and /Whispers/.

Also, definitely check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]] by Ruskbyte, the classic dark Harry (a crossover with Hellraiser). /From the Abyss/ by the same author is also quite good, though unfinished.

Edit: added a couple.
