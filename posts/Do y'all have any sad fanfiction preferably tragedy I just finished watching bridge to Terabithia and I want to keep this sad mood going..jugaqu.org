*** The whole movie sets up this childlike relationship and then when she dies it comes out of nowhere unless you knew about it and it shatters your innocence and the boys acting is impeccable. It is truly a masterpiece

**** Yeah, I know, but when she died, I was just like "aww, why did they do that? Oh well.", but I didn't feel enough to actually be sad, y'know? I'm actually very sensitive in real life, but when watching movies, I can never bring myself to cry. Like during the Titanic, when both of my sisters were crying, I was just so confused.

********** Omg I wish my older sisters were as understanding as you. From the time I was a toddler until age 8, they relentlessly mocked me and called me overemotional since they liked to insult me until I ran away crying. It stopped at age 9 since they were in their early teens by then, so it was a bit embarrassing to keep making me break down. They still mocked me after that, but it was definitely toned down. Nowadays, they're actually not that bad anymore and only comment on my looks and intelligence.

** You deserve an invitation:

" Yes, indeed, the grief, the sorrow: they are all true. Leslie is gone. Let me guess, you feel it as a real loss, don't you? Well, be no afraid to admit it: you are not alone. I've met many people who had the same reaction. Firstly you feel a void inside your lungs, then it's like you're about to throw up. I feel you, brother or sister; we feel you. It may look absurd, it is like we lived this story in the first person: as if it could have been ours, many and many a life ago.\\
But of course, there's light at the end of the tunnel, and your grief, if it hasn't already, will open to you new paths of exploration. Soon or later you'll find yourself looking for more about Terabithia, without knowing why.

And for this, I've come to thee, for offering you a very merry proposal. A new subreddit has born from a small group of people from all around the world, and we are waiting for anything else but new members to make the Terabithian community a thing. Hence, sorry if this is just a copy-pasted message; but you'll enjoy this more if you'll consider it an actual invitation.

"We Terabithiers are are such lonely critters,, and like anyone, we have to stick together to carry on through these woods"

I'm [[/u/Bacoilieu][u/Bacoilieu]] and I'll await thee at this port [[/r/BridgeToTerabithia][r/BridgeToTerabithia]]
