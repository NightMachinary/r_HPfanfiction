Recently finished linkffn(4978734) and am looking for more stories where either Harry or Hermione travels back in time to the Marauders era (or just before) to raise one of the Marauders, Lily or Severus. Or just anyone else, but the story still revolves around that era with the Marauders and/or the Black/Malfoy family playing a part.

I've read â€˜time to put galleons where your mouth is' or whatever it's called, also the one where Harry is born as Ara Black. Preferably complete and over 100k wording. Or if it's not complete it has to be over 80k wording and updated regularly.

  Hunted by Voldemort, Hermione and Harry make a last stand in Godric's Hollow. When the Boy-Who-Lived lives no more, Hermione is thrown back in time into another battle where she has a chance to save not only Harry, but another Potter. *Art by colour me luna*

  Whenever Harry does something drastic, he always ends up in a strange situation. Time-travel-fic.
