Hi all.

I was wondering if anyone knows of such stories that has Olivander adopt Harry who works in his shop since before first year or doesn't adopt Harry but still has Harry work in his shop with him.

I honestly don't know if this concept has been done before so if there are any recommendations they would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers all.


** He wasn't there permanently, but while staying in the Diagon Alley during PoA, he was helping Mr. Ollivander to make an inventory in [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 BC]].

  Harry's lived a long life. A good life. He's ready to go, but like all bureaucracies, Death's a little behind on their paperwork. He'll be fine in a temporary storage track, right? AU Epilogue-compliant WARNINGS: ineffective suicide(s), light gore, swearing, off-kilter humor, sort of dark!Harry, sort of time travel

** Self-rec here. It's a one-shot that's slightly epilogue compliant.
