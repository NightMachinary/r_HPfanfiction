  Lily wanted her son to live; Jareth wanted an heir to the Goblin Throne. It only took a single wish to satisfy both of their needs.“I wish the Goblins would come and take you away...”

** The best Labyrinth crossover is /That We've Broken Their Statues/ linkao3(840721) - it's marked incomplete but it ends just fine. Sarah graduates uni and gets a job as the Muggle Studies teacher for Harry's first year.

/Sarah's Wish/ linkao3(7240036) really is incomplete. It goes hard for the fan theory that HP wizards are descended from the fae, and Harry goes to Hogwarts specifically to remind humanity why they should fear and worship the old ways...

  Sarah Williams stumbles into the Leaky Cauldron. She stumbles back out again with a Gringotts account she didn't start, a part time job at Hogwarts, and an awkward truce with the Goblin King.

  Sarah Williams lives her life and retires to England, only to have another brush with magic when she witnesses three oddly dressed beings leave a baby on a doorstep. When her attempts to help the child come to naught, there is only one thing for Sarah to do: She must Wish the child away to the Goblin King. - How different may things be, when a child of prophecy becomes Fae.
