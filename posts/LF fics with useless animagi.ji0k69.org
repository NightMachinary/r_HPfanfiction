every time i read a fic in which the main character (usually harry) is an animagus, he gets a super cool form like a dragon or a snake or a bird of prey or a lion!! nah man, i want to see a main character with a useless animal form, like an axolotl or a tapir or a peacock. maybe even a chihuahua.


** Tbh being an axolotl animagi would be very cool. Were it me, I would go chill in the lake hidden between rocks, and install an aquarium in my room to sleep there at night.

Ohhhh! And I would ask someone to cut one of my fingers to see if it regenerates!

  My collection of silly HP one-shots. Often HHr. Now with Chapter 4, "Harry Potter and the Evil Mokeskin Pouch": Why doesn't Harry simply put Slytherin's Locket with the Horcrux in his Mokeskin pouch instead of carrying it around his neck all the time? Here's why.

**** I don't remember, sorry. Harry had to rescue Draco from prison for some contrived reason, like Grimmauld Place needed someone with Black blood. Harry could sneak Draco out by turning him into a ferret. Narcissa had to stay behind because of her impractical animal form. Harry left a polyjuiced house elf in Draco's place. I think the fic was a Drarry.

**** How? You'd be a cat. Great for hiding, and getting away I gues like most small Animagus forms, but cats aren't small enough to be useful spying like Rita's beetle, nor are they big enough, and strong enough to fight like a dog, dragon, deer, etc...(sticking with the D's). Night vision might be useful, but now that I think about, with magic you could do that. Also getting away would be difficultish since you're not small enough to go unseen, and magic is probably fast enough that any decently skilled magical could tag ya. I mean i'm open to being wrong, but I don't see much value here myself.

***** He uses it a /lot/ in the fic though, which is an argument firmly in favor of it being useful.

The story /starts/ with him escaping the Dursleys in cat form. It's a decent spying form (as seen when he uses it to spy on Snape and Quirrell), catches rats quite handily (which is, of course, used to catch Pettigrew), nimble enough to escape a Basilisk, comes in handy throughout the Tri-Wizard Tournament... It's only the sequel fic where his animagus form kinda stops coming up much.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  Little Harry Potter was not the biggest fan of his own life, but what could he possibly do about it? Escaping to play video games in the dark of night helps... but only a little. A Gamer Fic.
