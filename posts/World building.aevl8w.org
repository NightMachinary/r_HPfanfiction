In my stories, I've used two pieces of head canon that have made the Wizarding world make more sense to me.

British Wizarding Population

PotterWiki gives two numbers - 3,000 wizards in Britain, with a third of those students at Hogwarts; and a claim that wizards are outnumbered by muggles by a factor of 10. I'll start with the second by deciding that it is not wizards who are outnumbered but all magical races. This means that back in the 90's when the world population was 5 billion, there were 500 million assorted witches, wizards, goblins, vampires, merpeople, giants, veela, etc - basically any magical being capable of speech. As such, I am estimating the global wizard (humans only differentiated by being able to perform magic) population to be closer to 20 million at most, with Europe's being especially low due to Grindelwald and Voldie.

As for the first number, I don't know what 'Britain' is referring to. There is Great Britain, which is an island encompassing most of Scotland, Wales, and England. There is the UK, which encompasses Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and England. And there are the British Isles, which is the UK plus the Republic of Ireland. So, if instead we say that Great Britain has a population of 3,000, with a third of that being Hogwarts' population, it makes more sense since GB, as the most populated and urbanized land mass, would not be as safe for raising magical families in secrecy as the less populated Ireland or smaller islands. GB mostly has the wizards and witches who work or are comfortable in the muggle world or those who were too stubborn to move away when the muggle cities overtook their homes.

My estimates for the wizarding population of the British Isles are based on there being 1,000 students at Hogwarts, which includes all magical children aged 11-18, and assuming that they make-up 8% of the total population (significantly longer life-expectancy balanced by Voldie's death toll on adults). Harry's year may have been small, but that would have been due to 1979-1981 being the height of Voldie's terror attacks and parents doing their best not to have children, never mind the ones who died. So the other years would have been significantly larger, like triple or something.

GB: 2,000 general + 1,000 Hogwarts students

Northern Ireland: 2,000

Republic of Ireland: 5,000

Smaller Islands (some of which are unplottable): 2,500

Total: 12,500

Wizarding Economy

It is often pointed out that Wizarding economy as explained by Rowling makes little sense. The rules I am presenting will be based on 2016 money, so when I say £1, I am talking about the purchasing power that £1 has in 2016 (approximately equal to the purchasing power of £0.31 in 1982). The purchasing power of wizarding currency does not change because the goblins keep it constant. As such, it is only the exchange rate of muggle to Wizarding currency that changes over time. Also, some muggle prices that I can't find from the time period (i.e. baby food in 1980's) I'm estimating as 25% of modern prices (as inflation has been an approximately 307% increase in price levels over the past 40 years in the UK).

Canon economic rules I am keeping:\\
1 galleon = 17 sickles = 493 knuts.\\
1 galleon = £3 in 1982 = £4.93 in 1991 = £10.30 in 2016.

Rules I am making up:\\
Average daily wage = 10 galleons = £103 in 2016 - this is lower than what muggles make, but the wizarding world is slightly cheaper due to magic powering their production process.\\
Basically, the price level is on average a third lower than in the muggle economy. The difference is much greater in some sectors (example: housing and non-magical food), while in other sectors there is very little difference (example: vehicles and other transportation methods).\\
A galleon has a small seed of gold in the very middle of it that is valued £9-11 in 2016, depending on how the gold market is doing. That means that selling a galleon in the muggle world is not profitable. However, due to gold not being reproducible by magic (except the Philosopher's stone), it means that galleons can't be forged without the forgery being caught via a simple spell that checks for gold. Similarly, sickles and knuts hold tiny amounts of gold, equal to their respective values.

Cost of school supplies:\\
In the UK in recent years, parents spend approximately £250 outfitting their kids for school not including uniforms. This is about 16 galleons when you take the 33% decrease in price level into account. UK school uniforms are approximately £96 in 2014. Again, with the 33% decrease in price levels, this rounds to 9 galleons.\\
Both UK estimates are from the article "Cost of kitting out kids for school hits £240 per child -- totalling £2.5bn" by Rebecca Smithers posted on The Guardian website on Aug 28, 2014.\\
Wands cost an additional 7 galleons, totaling to 32 galleons if you buy everything new.


** Interesting. I usually go with a population of roughly 20-30,000 for magical Britain, because I feel this is needed to justify such a large administrative apparatus as the ministry and sustain the number of shops seen in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. A five-digit number I think also fits better for the overall feel of the magical community. It feels more like a small to mid-sized town rather than a village. Such a number also allows for more creative worldbuilding, like villages other than Hogsmeade, or magical communities inside cities like Edinburgh. I know this clashes with the number of students at Hogwarts, but I ignore it because my stories (all WIP, I haven't published yet) are set post-Hogwarts.

****** Interesting that you mention this, since coincidentally I've been thinking about writing a fic based on this premise and thus have been thinking about this problem.

Muggle conflicts will impact the magical world often not directly, but indirectly. Imagine, for example wizards living in Eastern Prussia. How will the German wizards living there deal with Polish muggle-borns entering their community? Even if wizards are less nationalist than their muggle counterparts, I could see that being a source of conflict.

Or do those Polish muggleborns enter the Polish magical community instead? That also would have implications for the East Prussian magical community, since there would be no influx of muggleborns, their community would likely be way more conservative than other magical communities.

Would the Austrian Empire still exist, or would it split up, like it did in real life? Transsylvania is apparently an independent country in the magical world. Bulgaria's independence implies that the Ottoman Empire at least partly broke up in the magical world too. Did Bulgarian wizards gain independence together with Bulgarian muggles, or separately?

******* Eastern Prussia is mostly the Kaliningrad Oblast nowadays, aka Russia.

That being said, the Polish question is one of the large holes of Rowling's worldbuilding, which stops to work somewhere between the low countires and Alsace-Lorraine.

Silesia is especially interesting since it was part of the Bohemian domain since the 13th century. Despite being ruled by the Piast dynasty, it was no longer part of Poland. Bohemia as a whole fell to the Habsburgs in the 16th century before Silesia was lost to Prussia in 1740. So the question of governance is complicated beyond belief.

Overall, my take on the HRE is that there was the tradition of intermarrying the magical rulers with their corresponding Muggle nobility. And once a new dynasty took over on one side, they were simply added to the existing family on the other side. Not a ruler with a ruler, but a brother or aunt could certainly be spared.

Obviously, you would need to have more schools than Rowling has in her vision of the world, but I don't think that it would really matter. From what we see in canon interactions with the government, you don't have a "Finanzamt/Inland Revenue" equivalent, there is no draft. Overall the question who rules you would be largely irrelevant since you live in your local communities. And you can always move simply by thinking about it. If a Polish Muggleborn was dissatisfied with his "German" administration, he can simply apparate, or take a train/bus to Warsaw and be in the Polish(-Lithuanian) part of the magical world.

It was mostly autonomous under Ottoman overlordship between 1526 and 1687, and a part of the Kingdom of Hungary before. It's really up to your interpretation what kind of impact the Turk wars had on the magical world.

Now if you really want a spot of trouble, look no further than the Balkans, where you had a genocide going on during the book timeframe.

The 1000 students at Hogwarts I assumed as just the portion that chose Hogwarts as their school. There is still Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, but I also assumed that you could choose to study under a Master, or in regional schools.

I further added the idea of magical enclaves, mostly only as big as a family Clan (~30 people) that make up a large portion of the magical population, and are mostly pretty self sufficient. Which also means that the Galleon economy is one of luxury and items that require special education to produce. Food, Housing, Clothes... are not actually dependent on your wallet, unless you want something special (like Malfoy Mansion, for example) that requires you to specialize in agricultural spells, or architectural spells.

The problem with this assumption is that wizards have firmly established themselves at the top of the proverbial food chain as far as magical might is concerned, and they've accomplished that with multiple shows of strength. When it comes to armed conflicts, greater numbers are always going to be an incredible advantage for any side.

Your estimate has wizards being just 4 percent of the overall magical population. The probability of a population that small managing to overcome such huge odds and establish themselves at the top of the magical chain is astronomically low, especially considering that the rest of the magical races like vampires, giants, veela and gobbos have their own unique magic or natural advantages over human wizards.

20 million is far too low. In fact, anything less than 120-150 million out of 500 is too low. Even 120 is pushing it. If it were me, I'd put the global estimate around 300 to 350 million.

Not necessarily. If you look at battles like Hill 3234 you have terrain and air/artillery support equalise a five to one disparity in numbers. And Rorke's Drift was a victory of 139 Welshmen against 5000 Zulu.

I'm convinced that Voldemort or Bellatrix Lestrange could singlehandedly exterminate the entire Centaur population from the forbidden forest within five minutes.

Why did you cite this example? This is one side having an incredible technological advantage over the other in spite of low numbers. If you're going to cite anything, give examples of conflicts where the technological disparity between sides is minimal. Also, cite examples of wars, not individual battles. One battle rarely makes for a war.

I specifically mentioned that the other races in magical conflict would have their own set of magic or natural advantages over human wizards. A handful of veela are enough to mentally disarm a hundred thousand strong crowd of wizards. Imagine what a few thousand of them are capable of.

Not this shit again. You've got it built up in your head that Voldemort is an unstoppable force of magic. He isn't. For all ff authors like to write about his supposed power, he is successfully held by 3 wizards in the last battle. He cannot completely overcome McGonagall, Shacklebolt and Slughorn in a 3 on 1 duel. Slughorn isn't even a fighter like the other two are. Bellatrix tries to do a 3 on 1 duel with children barely of age, and still fails. In the end, the woman is defeated by a common housewife.

Voldemort might be able to defeat 30 centaurs if he's allowed to apparate in and out with impunity, but you're under the impression that the centaurs are stupid enough to engage in a fight where he has that ability. They aren't. They're also not going to queue up to take shots at a wizard so that the wizard has a much higher chance of winning like imbeciles.

But magic is just that, a massive amplifier of force. A massive disparity of technology.

Centaurs have arrows (not even lances). They are unarmoured. Compare that to wizards, which have semi-homing sentient napalm, grenade launchers, ballistae, water throwers and so on all in their wand. And deflector shields as well as excavators... you get the picture.

Also, any Muggleborn could summon a machine gun, put on some charmed armour and go to town.

Voldemort could burn down the entire forest and smoke them out that way. I bet there is a potion equivalent of either Agent Orange or Mustard Gas. Apply that liberally and the Centaurs have the choice between abandoning their homes or giving battle.

  A handful of veela are enough to mentally disarm a hundred thousand strong crowd of wizards. Imagine what a few thousand of them are capable of.
#+end_quote

We are not talking about Veela, but given the canon descriptions and the lack of male Veela, witches would be immune to that sort of attack. Not against the fireballs though. And veela can use magic.

The Russo-Japanese War. Italy's invasion of Greece. Prussia in the Seven-Year war. The First to Fifth Anit-Hussite Crusades. The Falkland war (the British could deploy far fewer forces to the theater than the Argentinians). The War of Israeli Independence. The Six-Day War. The Jom-Kippur War.

Have you ever wondered why not a single Muggleborn does this in the books despite being hunted by a regime?

Oh gods, this again. Every time, I swear, there's Fiendfyre.

You do realise that standing in the middle of a forest-Fiendfyre isn't beneficial to Voldemort himself, right? He can't apparate out, and the flames rage and get bigger and bigger until the point where he can't control them himself.

Get a grip and stop thinking of Fiendfyre as a one-spell-to-rule-them-all. It isn't. Otherwise we'd see dark wizards and witches use them all the time instead of just twice in a three year conflict.

The Centaurs have Divination as a magic on their side, and theirs actually works. They predict the coming war and bloodshed six years before it comes knocking - any attack on them will be detected long before the attack is even thought of.

If you're going to say their ability in Divination is reading too much, I can easily say the same about your proposed Potions. Besides, the Centaurs live in a forest - they can brew potions of their own if they want to if you're going to go superfanon.

They're not as cosmetic as fitting a man on a horse as you seem to think they are.

Fleur being part veela is semi-canon. That clearly means there are indeed male veela otherwise they'd have died out.

#+end_quote

Which is what I've been saying throughout my comment. Gobbos have magic. Veela have magic. Giants have their spell resistance, and so on. Wizards cannot have subjugated each of these races while being outnumbered by them 25 to 1 when they have those strength .

Can't speak for the Seven Years War or the Hussite Wars, but the Russo-Japanese war was more or less even on numbers. Russia had a larger overall population, but the troop counts were almost even. Even then, Russia's population certainly was not larger than Japan's by a factor of 25, like OP is trying to suggest. The same goes for Italy-Greece, Falkland and Israel's wars.

Because the Death Eaters being cut down by machine guns before they reach the walls is rather anticlimactic. Hundreds of yards, uphill and across open ground sounds like a textbook example for a unnecessary WWI attack.

Also, in Rowling's world the heroes don't kill despite fighting magical Nazis busy to carry out a genocide.

  Male Veelas

They could be monogendered like the Asari and reproduce using magic to share genetic information.

< Centaurs have divination

So they see the attack coming. Nice. They still lack the ability to stop Voldemort. Like the Germans, who could detect the massive allied bomber fleets coming in but could not stop them.

The Russians had by far the larger base for their army. Just look at the numbers they fielded during the World Wars and compare them to the Japanese.

#+begin_quote
  Falklands
#+end_quote

The British took more prisoners than they fielded soldiers. And they shot down roughly the same number of planes they brought into the combat area.

  Italy - Greece
#+end_quote

The Italians constantly had the numerical superiority and by far the bigger industrial base but were pushed back into their own territory before they called in the Germans.

Even if you limit yourself to blasting curses, the Centaurs will be massacred. Or the good ol' killing curse.
