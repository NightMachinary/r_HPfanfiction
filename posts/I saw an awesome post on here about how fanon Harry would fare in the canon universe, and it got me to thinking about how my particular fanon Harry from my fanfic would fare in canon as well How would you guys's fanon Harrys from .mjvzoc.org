My fanon Harry, being an open Parselmouth with a big ass cuddly boa constrictor for a familiar may or may not do well, considering how accepting the Wizarding World would be of The Boy Who Lived being an open Parselmouth. If he was treated the way canon Harry was in second year(I don't know if that would happen or not considering people and animals were being petrified in second year, but not in first year), between that, Snape, and a troll, he'd probably try to nope out of Hogwarts with his familiar before First Year was even over.

How would your fanon Harrys from your fics fare in canon?

The original post about generic fanon Harrys dealing with canon is here. It's really funny and I'd recommend giving it a read. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/mhfec3/there_have_been_posts_about_how_harry_would_fare/]]


** Well, I'm not sure about my Harry. Psychologically, he's a fairly normal person. Now, physically, he's six foot five, quite muscular, has pointy ears, eyes like a Witcher and fights monsters with a bastard sword.

He has absolutely zero tolerance for bigots, and he's also known to cut the heads of Death Eaters with his weapon.

*** He sounds really cool! He'd probably definitely make the series shorter(especially if he cut off Wormtail's head before Wormtail could resurrect Voldemort.). I'm not sure if he'd get arrested or not since the Wizarding World's a little hypocritical(which is why I'm kind of worried mine would get outcasted before he could even start to be a hero.))

****** No, canon divergence after Half Blood Prince, and it mostly takes place a year out of Hogwarts. The war stretches on.

** I described my Harry with the word "violent", so my fic could be "dark". Because I was wondering "What if Harry loses his temper more than Canon?" And, also, "What if Harry senses when an object or person has a strange and familiar energy?" Either way, for now kill the Dursleys in an accidental magic attack; he befriends Hermione and Ron before Halloween, so the troll kills some Slytherins and/or Hufflepuffs; kills Quirrel in his first Quiditch match ... Anyway, my Harry is the only "non-canon" so I'm deciding how others react to different situations (I was already starting to include the Ministry, for the deaths of students, for example)...

*** I think it would depend on whether Harry could be charged with a crime. Some students could be afraid of him, and the Ministry might tell the world he's violent and dangerous. Your Harry sounds cool though!

** Well, I have a couple of different HP fics, so it'd depend on which one.

But the one that's technically the most removed from canon is a female!Harry who grew up outside of Britain, first in Muggle Italy and then as the princess of a Wizarding nation in the Alps. She winds up going to Durmstrang and making friends with students from other countries, and is generally very progressive and gay, as well as a being grumpy bookworm.

Overall I'd say she'd do okay in canon? Magic's about the same, just that I assigned some fanon utility to runes, so her main issues would be in finding that she's not a princess anymore, and frustration with the isolationist (from other Wizard countries, not from Muggles), conservative British Wizarding culture.

And if she winds up swapping places with canon!Harry trying to explain to her that she can't freeze the Dursleys to the walls would also be a struggle.

*** She sounds amazing! I understand where things would be confusing for her. It would be a heck of both a culture change and a slight difference in abilities. My Harry hasn't gotten too far in my story (poor kid just found out he was a wizard thanks to a letter that arrived to him in the middle of nowhere and freaked him the heck out), so he'd have canon Harry's amount of confusion, but the prejudice against Parselmouths would be what got him. Also, I feel like he'd get along really well with your Fem!Harry.

Can you link me your fic? It sounds great! I love the idea of her being in another school.

**** Thank you, you're very kind! I confess my fic's only 6 chapters in, hasn't even arrived at Durmstrang yet so I'm more going off of my plans for her.

Here's the link to the fic! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30041187/chapters/73974762]]

** Harry Potter as a Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Mask Vampire.

First: regarding the sun: do you truly believe no-one made Sun cream for vampires?

Second: regarding Umbridge, the slytherins and the like: he is as melodramatic as DIO, why would he care about some heckling?

Second-and-a-bit: in response to the REALLY burn-the-sinner type wizards, he would definitely escalate the situation. Tell Me DIO wouldn't.

Finally: regarding Voldemort, he would get steamrolled with proper application of vampire physiology.
