looking for a Harry sorted into slytherin preferably either completed or constantly updated as for pairings anything but Harry/Ginny or Harry/Hermione


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/1/They-Shook-Hands-Year-1-New-Version]]. Six years completed. An AU where Draco wasn't a dick in madam malkins. Pretty awesome. The author has written like six of seven books.

** A Cadmean Victory was really popular when ongoing but lots of people didn't like the ending IIRC he's not actually in Slytherin but moves out of grynfindor and is mentored by portrait of Salazar and is/becomes very independent / underhanded linkffn(11446957)

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin is reced a lot and recently started updating again, starts a bit slow gets exciting and is very long linkffn(11191235)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
