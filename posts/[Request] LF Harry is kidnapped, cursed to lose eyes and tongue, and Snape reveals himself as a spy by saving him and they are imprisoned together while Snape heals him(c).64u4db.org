** I feel like I remember a fic where harry gets cancer and gives it to Voldemort during which he bonds with snape. Later on I think that it was found that harry is afraid of needles and Lucius ends up torturing him with them in front of the remaining death eaters. Is this the fic?

**** That's a "Year Like None Other," which I like a lot, but Petunia is the one with cancer. Harry volunteers to see if he's a marrow match and is, but that's where he finds out he's afraid of needles.

*** I don't believe they are ever imprisoned together in this fic and I don't think the Carrows are in it so I don't think it fits OP's description.
