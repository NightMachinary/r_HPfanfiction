I'm a big Harmony shipper. I'm looking for some good, completed Post-War Harmony stories. The longer the better. Plus one is okay as long as there's no slash.

*** I read Right and Easy, and I looked at Just One More Thing, but was disappointed because it looks abandoned. I'll check out this author you linked to. Thanks!

** here's a few you might not have read =) :

*[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5750][Fixing Harry]] by Lynney* <- this one is REALLY good. excellent characterization all around - the author's other fics are also very much worth a look.

/Post Voldemort's defeat. Harry's got a bit of a problem. He's finished off Voldemort, and according to the Prophecy he should finally have a life, right? So how come he feels so lost, and why is his magic getting away from him like he's 13 years old and blowing up Aunt Marge again every time Hermione and Ron are around? It was bloody embarassing, ... and now the Ministry is getting involved. AU./

--------------

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3595714/1/Just-One-More-Thing]]) starts with a bit too much angst and contrived miscommunication IMO, but gets really good after it's resolved in chapter 5. 254k words, mostly fluff and very cute =). Ignore the misspellings in the summary, the fic itself is fine.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12720625/1/Right-and-Easy]]) - gets good about halfway in, when they ease out of R/Hr. 128k.

Harry is expected to move on, but what will happen when old feelings rise and new feelings topple? What will happen when Harry Potter realises the true love of his life has always been right next to him? Story rated 'M' for mature content.

  The Real Us by Seel'vor

This is trash, though. And hoping dangerously close, or even over the line of portraying pedophilic scenes.

I think its one of two stories I ever filled a report against, even knowing how little FFN admins actually care.

**** If you're referring to the scene I think you are; you're right it was damn creepy. I would've had her give him a chaste kiss on the cheek with a heartfelt 'thank you'. That's about as far as romantic gestures your average 11/12 year old would go.

***** My thought process was:

Somebody capable of coherent English in large quantities, in other words a young adult or up, has thought about a scene with two children at the age of 11 and 12 doing /that/. And not just thought about it. Wrote it out. Edited it. Read it over several times. Then decided to upload it.

It wasn't just creepy. If I knew the guy I would give an anonymous tip to make the cops check his harddrives.
