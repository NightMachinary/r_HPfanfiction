Also, why are there so few decent HP/ASOIAF crossovers? You'd think these two fandoms would go well together.


** I quite like The Last Lion of House Reyne linkffn(11388514) and The Difference One Man Can Make linkffn(11132113) Even though they seem to be abandoned.

  When Tywin Lannister crushed the Reyne-Tarbeck Rebellion everyone in the Kingdoms believed he ended two noble lines. But thanks to one unique infant, one Harrion Reyne called Harry by his parents, some survived.

** Not really, since power differentials between the two worlds are too big.

As long as HP characters could keep up in the ruthlessness department (no "good guys don't kill" or "we must not become as bad as them" tropes), they would have their empires in the Land of Ice and Fire within a few years. People in that world were basically medieval Muggles, and had little chance competing against powerful HP wizards with potential knowledge of modern Muggle technologies. For example:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of the Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136): Ginny and Sirius conquered most of Essos in about two years, and were now working on Westeros.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12689889/1/the-Winter-Witch][The Winter Witch]], linkffn(12689889): HP magic is nerfed a little in this fic so that Hermione was only making slow progress after one year. Robb however ended up in the HP world and got to know some modern Muggle capabilities.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11255223/1/The-Wizard-of-Harrenhal][The Wizard of Harrenhal]], linkffn(11255223): Harry cleaned up Westeros easily.

  After suffering unimaginable loss, Ginny falls into Westeros where she quickly realizes that the world is very different from the one she knows. With the help of new friends she begins to thrive...until a lord from across the sea comes looking for something only she can give him. The game is on...and House Gryffindor is now a player.

  Hermione realized it began with a sense of Impending Doom and finished with a battle outside her tent. The deciding line between staying and helping Robb Stark, or returning to her universe, is getting harder to see the longer she's in Westeros. But it's a decision that she has to make, or it's one that will be made for her. Part 1 complete; Part 2 is now ongoing!

** There aren't many good crossover, especially if you want something finished.

I'm looking through my favs and (besides those already linked by others), I only find these few: linkffn(10216252; 10918531; 4826372; 6436196).

Keep in mind that I haven't read most of those in quite some time.

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand. A Boy, a Potter, and a Thief.
