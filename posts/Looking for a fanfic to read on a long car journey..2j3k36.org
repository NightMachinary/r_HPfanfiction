In short, i am going on a long car journey with people i don't like and want a fanfic to get my teeth stuck into. I'm OK with any nonslash pairing, but the quality has to be good. I would also prefer a longer one, as its a long car journey. I'm kinda into Harry in other houses, but its not necessary.


** Any particular characters you want to be the main focus?

** If you don't mind it being based off the system, but completely different cast and what not, this is one of the best FF I've ever read. Also book one of four currently, five is on the way. Alexandra quick and the thorn circle.

** The brave new world is a great fic. can't link at thie moment. also The Refiners Fire is a great long fic to read and it has a sequel granted Harry is in Gryffendor. Also Check out all of Jeconis's fics on fanficauthors.net Some people love them, some think they have no confict so they arent good.

** For a completely, and I mean completely re-imagined harry potter world, read this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy]]

Darth Mars keeps the major theme of Harry Potter, but changes just about everything there can be about it, it's like reading a whole new book
