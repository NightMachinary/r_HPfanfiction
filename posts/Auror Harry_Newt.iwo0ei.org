:END:
Harry Potter time traveled back in time and met Newt, it started with him apparently slept under a rock thing with snakes at the begining. Sometime in the story he 'defeated' a runespore with newt. And the chief tried to bond Harry with his daughter but instead Harry bonded with Newt. Harry went through something about worrying about changing the future because of his bonding with newt but he went flying with Phoenix's and understand that he wont change the future and him and newt get along more. I cant find it and I've been looking for 2 days please help.

** I believe the fic you're looking for is “Against my Nature” by Araceil. Unfortunately, I think the author took it down.

*** Oh no! I kept trying to find it and I think you're right, that's sad I loved the story and kept rereading it. Im sure they had their reason for taking it down though if you're right. :(

  "Against my Nature” by Araceil
#+end_quote

Just did a brief search and it looks like someone posted it on Wattpad after attributing it to Araceil, if you're interested in reading it. [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/190422945-against-my-nature]]

**** She got a bunch of death threats, stalkers, abuse from readers, etc. so she deleted everything from ffn. She's still on ao3 and she also posts updates on [her facebook page]([[https://www.facebook.com/pg/Araceilfanfiction/notes/]]) although she doesn't post the actual chapters there anymore, just links to ao3. As far as I know, Against My Nature has been discontinued, but she has up to chapter 32 on her facebook (you just gotta scroll a bit) and I think many of her old fics can be found there, too.

Ultimately, an unfortunate reminder to all of us to be kind to writers!
