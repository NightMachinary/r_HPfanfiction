pretty much in the title, just him getting used and not knowing bout it and then he finds out yadda yadda yadda


** Canon? He gets totally used by Dumbledore, and "raised like a pig for slaughter".

Of course, in every indy!Harry fic, he finds out and raises a ruckus. A couple fics have however unique takes on this matter:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): [[/spoiler][He and Ginny first killed him outright in a carefully laid trap. After interrogating Dumbledore's soul using the Resurrection Stone, Harry sentenced it to eternal torment in hell.]]

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Dumbledore is totally manipulative greater good here. The kids also finds out on their own, but since Hogwarts is a spy school in this universe, they are kind used to all sorts of dirty tricks, so no hard feeling here. They even quickly realize that Snape killing Dumbledore is that old KGB â€œshoot your own guy, gain enemy's trust" deal.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.
