I'm trying my hand at writing fanfiction again. The concept of this story is simple: What if Grindelwald won WW2 and against Dumbledore during their infamous duel? It's a dystopic AU--one starring Fem!Harry and other familiar characters as they navigate this brave new world.

I'm very open to feedback as I've never really published my writings before (minus an abortive cracky fanfic). I've got a good idea of where I want the story to go and a couple more chapters written, but I'd like to collect some initial thoughts before getting too in the weeds. I'm also open to folks who'd like to beta, as I got none.

Disclaimer: the first 'chapter' is a foreword of what to expect in the story. The 'second' chapter is chapter 1, and the right proper start.


** Slightly better than usual throwing link and leaving it at that, but there is still zero actual promoting in this self-promotion. And not much content to judge.

One thing immediately worries me.

  What if Grindelwald won WW2

Why WW2? Is this one of those "Grindelwald worked with Nazis" fics?

*** In this fic, Grindelwald basically used WW2 to kill as many of the Muggles as possible. This exhausted their armed forces and allowed the far less populated wizards to take over. He did work with the Nazis but he also worked with the Soviets and the British. Hitler still died in 1945, but unlike in our world, this set off Operation Unthinkable, thanks to Grindelwald's influence and magic. This eventually led to mass nuclear warfare. Millions more dead later, and by the early 50s, wizards took over with relative ease.

**** I feel like this explanation doesn't work so well.

Firstly, Muggle armed forces were incredibly more powerful in 1945 than they were in 1939. Yes, the war killed millions, but there were still millions more that could be called upon. Meanwhile, military-industrial production had been increased to levels unthinkable in 1939 - well over 100,000 fighter aircraft produced /per year/. Not to mention the technological advances.

WW2 doesn't weaken Muggle militaries, it strengthens them. But in any case, if you're having to consider the strength of Muggle militaries in the calculation of wizards' ability to take over the Muggle world, your wizards are doing it wrong.

Secondly, Muggles did not have the nuclear arsenal in the 1940s to unleash "mass nuclear warfare". As of 1950, the USA had 299 nuclear weapons and the USSR had 5. Further, these were atomic bombs, not ICBMs with thermonuclear warheads. They could only be delivered by aircraft (vulnerable to being shot down by Soviet fighters) and their destructive power was no greater than conventional mass firebombing.

***** Of course, taking over the Muggle world wouldn't be a question of brute strength. The idea I think would be to exhaust the manpower pools, imperius the leaders to liberally exhaust their men even more, and then use whatever little nuclear weapons the leaders have to launch them on major populated centers, even if it's their own. By whittling down the fighters, the rest comes easy: consecutive coups in the ruined remaining wrecks.

****** This explanation does not work at all tbh. As Taure said the war just created more military strenght. In percentages of the population soldiers are just a very tiny part. In the USA pouplation wise the war was barely felt.

Killing of big parts of the population with nuclear bombs? Not going to happen early atomic bombs are just not that effective. They are effective enough do not get me wrong. Just not that effective look up the casualties of Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

Why would you want to kill of the muggles anyway? In a war between wizards and muggles wizards always win. Just make them take over its much easier to explain.

** Seen it done well in the The Skitterleap, but never really done anywhere else well (except maybe one that was sort of a hitler-youth esque story).
