Preferably not just one-shots. Looking for completed multi-chaptered fics.


** So this isn't a pairing I read, but I did happen upon this a while ago. A cursory read through the first few paragraphs shows that the writing isn't detestable at least.

If you don't mind trio fics (Harry/Ron/Hermione) I can be of much more help though!

** This isn't a pairing I've ever read so I don't have any recs, but I would recommend you try [[http://archiveofourown.org/][Archive of Our Own]]. They have a lot of slash, and you can search by pairing and all sorts of other fields, including word length.

I'm assuming you've tried fanfiction.net?
