I'm trying to find a story that I read once before. IIRC, it wasn't listed as a crossover but it had a few chapters in the middle where SS & HG wound up in the US and training with Buffy (BtVS) and her Slayer training camp. Hermione has been there before but not Severus; she even has her own room there. Or a room that she always stays in. Hermione hosts an annual "How I Would've Killed Voldemort" contest for the potentials (so I guess it's post-war). And Severus spends hours floating in the pool and trying to figure out what element his magic is based on. When he first meets Spike (or was it Angel?) Severus doesn't immediately realize he's a vampire, he's just impressed with his fighting. And before they leave, there's a group dinner at Giles' place.

I've done a bunch of googling and I can't find this one. Please help! Thanks!


** I think I may have read this a very long time ago. Was it pre-HBP? If it is the same fic Im thinking of then I believe it's on ashwinder. You might have better luck with a fic search here: [[http://snapeyluvshermy.livejournal.com]]
