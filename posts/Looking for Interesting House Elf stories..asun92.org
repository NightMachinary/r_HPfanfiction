Can anyone rec me some stories where Harry uses house elves as thiefs, spies, warrior etc.

I don't care what the pairing is or if they are good or bad. Just looking for something interesting.


** I believe linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) included house-elf utilization, though it's quite long and iirc doesn't occur until later on. It's Harmony, and one of my favourite overpowered!Harry stories. It's not really focused on the house elves, but it's the closest I've read to what you're after.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** What does the story mean by scientist? I love an overpowered character, but if it seems cheap and obvious, then I don't really get into it. Like Harry realizing before anyone else how to use a simple spells to essentially exploit a game mechanic that the author created solely to be exploited.

Is an exploit even an exploit if it was designed intentionally?

**** It's not a lame gimmick like that at all. Yes, Harry ends up very powerful with his unique ability, but it doesn't feel cheap. Give it a try, I highly recommend it. It's one of my top five fics.

****** Because he's physically blind, he learns to 'see' with magic instead, which allows him to discover things that people who see normally can't.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
