It's driving me crazy that I can't remember the name of it. Snape was Harry's guardian and Harry got addicted to a spell of some sort, so Snape sent him to some kind of “no magic” camp where he had to live in a tent and had overly strict supervision. (Maybe Moody, but I might be remembering that part wrong)

Does that sound familiar to anyone? Thank you!


** i would really like to read that too
