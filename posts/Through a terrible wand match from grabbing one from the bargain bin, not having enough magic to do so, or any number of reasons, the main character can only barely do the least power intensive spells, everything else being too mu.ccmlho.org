  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

** "Harry Potter, prepare to..." Voldemort suddenly giggled, like a little school girl in fact.

"Hahahaha...stop that. I'm going to kill..." Voldemort then began a flamenco, preventing him for attacking.

Harry grabbed the Sword of Gryffindor, using the simple levitation charm, he sent it at a low speed towards Riddle's neck. Voldemort was now dancing a slow waltz, the inevitable was about to occur.

"Noooo!"

Voldemort's head lay dead on the floor. Harry Potter had killed the Dark Lord using half a wand.

** You may also be interested in\\
linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20)

Some familiarity with the mechanics of D&D is recommended. The use of an OC character is excellently done. (I am usually one to bounce off of a story for having an OC, so I cannot confidently call it 'the best OC story in the fandom' /but I'm thinking it/.) Highly recommended.\\
The entire story is not focused on the topic your request as written, but a few plot threads deliver on /exactly/ what you are after.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

** There's a story called When Harry Met Wednesday, that is an Addams Family crossover. I enjoyed it but it does have a graphic sex scene, and I think the author went too too accurate/realistic with the Addamses.

Anyway Grandmama gets a job at Hogwarts teaching Witchcraft that the curriculum has somehow dropped. Witchcraft not involving any of the "foolish wand waving" that even someone with almost no magic can perform.

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?
