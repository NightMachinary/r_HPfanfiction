It's Ron's birthday today, and I'm in the mood for some Ron fic. Anything goes as long as the fic has canon pairings, and no bashing:) Long fic, drabbles, one-shots etc are all fine


** Ron's a leading character in my AU story "The Dark Lord Never Died", where he's acting as a agent for Dumbledore. He's also a POV character in a few of my other stories, but not always with canon pairings.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
