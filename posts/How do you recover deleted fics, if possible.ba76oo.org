Is there a way to find now deleted fics that's not on the web archive? I have the titles and original links, if that helps.


** There's [[http://www.ff2ebook.com]] which has a lot of stories archived, and there are dumps around the Net (e.g., [[https://archive.org/details/Fanfictiondump114]] but consider the size). Trying to Google (or DuckDuckGo) it, can help. What exact story you are looking for?

** Have a look in public archives, or PM me. I archive fanfiction.net and have almost every story that's been online since late 2015 onwards (and a lot of the ones from before that too). I do need to know the story ID though (the number in the URL).
