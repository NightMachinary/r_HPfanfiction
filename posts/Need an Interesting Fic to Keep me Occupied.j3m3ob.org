Preferably of decent length or finished. I love ones where Harry is a little smarter than canon - so political!Harry or Slytherin!Harry ones are usually up my alley. Don't particularly care about pairings as long is it's not slash. I also love gray or dark!Harry fics. Recently got done with the "They Shook Hands" series and "Mason Jars." If there's a fix rec similar to Mason Jars in that it's just AMAZING canon-aligned writing I'm willing to give those a go as well. Snape involvement is always a loved bonus.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/737220]] is great! Starts with Harry aged 8, currently in 5th year.

  In which James Potter isn't as dead as everyone thought and Harry has a strong mistrust of all adults.Reconnecting with his son isn't going to be easy, not just because Harry's in Slytherin.
