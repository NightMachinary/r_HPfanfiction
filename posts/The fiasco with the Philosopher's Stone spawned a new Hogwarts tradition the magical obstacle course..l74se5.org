** Now every year, a select few will compete in races where they'll have to demonstrate their endurance, quick thinking, intelligence and magical abilities in a tournament in which if they shall win, they will have eternal glory.

"But Dumbledore... there are serious safety concerns about this type of gauntlet. It has been banned for 200 years and for good reasons. Also if you want to get the other European schools involved, it's going to be a real mess," said Bartemius Crouch in an exasperate tone.

"Nonsense, Barty," Ludo said cheerfully putting his hand on his concerned colleague's shoulder, "Dumbledore's right. We need something other than Quidditch to entertain the masses. Everything will go according to the plan this time. I'll personally make sure of that."

** I remember reading a fic where Hermione did think it was literally an extra credit magical obstacle course that Hogwarts do a version of every year. She thought the â€˜prize' at the end could be exchanged for house points or something lmao.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.
