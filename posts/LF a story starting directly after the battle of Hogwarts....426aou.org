As noted above, but i would prefer one that is long, either completed or nearly completed, or at least a decent length. Has a bit of action and a bit of romance and doesn't steer away from the details... In other words, a bit more adult then most stories, lol that sounds a little creepy... But overall i want it good and realistic!

**** The thing I liked most about it was the character development and realism to it. Ron's and everyones reactions to what has happened are all really believable. When I look for fanfics I prefer reading stuff that delves more into the characters than just another magical adventure and I think this does it well.

  After leaving Britain to continue his education, Harry tries to bring the British Wizarding world into the 21st century. Author's note: This was written before the seventh book was published. Character-driven drama with a lot of introspection.

  It's the afternoon after the Battle of Hogwarts and people's priorities in getting things back on track come into conflict. The new Minister and the Ministry have their priorities, Harry and Hermione have theirs. EWE? Compliant. My apologies if anyone is offended by the joke at the end of the story. They really need a genre category for 'snark'. If this has been done before
