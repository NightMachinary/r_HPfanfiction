** I'm reading 30 Minutes That Changed Everything by Radaslab. And it kinda has this. 160 year old Harry makes an avatar copy of himself and sends it back in time to young Harry. Its definitely AU. And there's a lot of explanation about how the Wizarding World works. I'd recommend it given what I've read so far.

*** True, but this is only the first part of a multi-story series - the sequel of which hasn't been updated since 2011. Actually none of their works have been updated more recently than 2013 so just beware of that.

***** Yeah, just thought I'd give you a heads up. Many people don't seem to mind abandoned stories, but it irked me to no end when I finished the story and realised it is actually abandoned rather than completed.

  AU. Year 2148: Gobal Population: 1. He made a mistake 150 years ago or so and now the human race no longer exists. For a century or so, he has sought a way to fix it all. Can he, or is the end of the world inevitable?

  In one world, an old man's life ends. In another, a foolish wizard performs a ritual and calls upon the Master of Death. And in both, there is a sound-a sound like an oncoming train. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

** Ancient Harry, alternate universe Fics

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8446057][On a Pale Horse]] by Hyliian. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. Unfinished. Dark humour. AO3.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/0800-Rent-A-Hero][0800-rent-a-hero]] by brainthief. Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP. Harry is quite young in this one. FFNet. Unfinished.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9649140/1/To-Call-A-Place-Home][To Call a place home]] by missmusicluver. Harry won the war. It's months afterwards and unexpectedly, he's literally picked up off the face of the world and shoved into another. One where Harry Potter died a long time ago. Where the Potter family's still fighting a war against a Dark Lord that's ruling the world one muggle murder at a time. They say he's their only hope. Harry doesn't really want in. unfinished. FFNet.

He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!). good bust has a lot of bashing. FFNet.
