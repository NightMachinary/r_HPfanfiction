You know how in some ghost stories ghosts kind of obsessively fixate on a object or person or place that held some kind of meaning when they were alive? They may loose everything that made object person or place meaningful but the obsession remains.

I wonder if its like that with Horcruxes. I know Voldemort kinda has the cliche wants to be immortal/afraid to die supervillain motivation. But for Tom Riddle growing up in a muggle orphanage in london during WW2 and getting obsessed with not dying makes perfect sense. The blitz ended in 1941 but there would be air raids till 1945. Riddle makes his first horcrux in 1943.

He is active till Harry's Birthday in 1980. Imagine he failed to make any horcruxes during that time. As time went on and dying by bomb blast became less of a threat would he loose his obsession to be immortal?

Did making the first horcrux stick him to the same desire and mental state he had in 1943 despite the world around him changing?

Im not saying he'd become necessarily a better person or not create the death eaters. Just that his preoccupation may not be immortality had he been unable to create a horcrux.

What do you guys think? If you also think he wouldn't continue to be obsessed with immortality what do you think he'd fixate on instead?


** Some rich business people in our mostly peaceful times are putting a lot of money into immortality [[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/silicon-valleys-quest-to-live-forever][research]].

Also being a revolutionary leader would be quite hazardous for Riddle - we know the Aurors were authorized to use lethal force during the First War.
