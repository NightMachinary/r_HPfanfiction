I have to wonder, given how unpopular OCs are in general, how many people have a favorite OC. I actually don't have a favorite OC, myself. I haven't read many fanfics where OCs have a big role, except for maybe Milo from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][/Harry Potter and the Natural 20/]].

One poor soul made a reading of the fic, and made an animated illustration. The whole thing last around 1h30 and it's a master piece that should be seen by everybody (the animation add a "je ne sais quoi" which make the whole fic even more enjoyable).

I have to admit the animations do make it more bearable. Usually I can't even make it past the first sentence of a dramatic /MI/ reading, but this time I made through two!

**** Same, and I think I know why too. JK did a really good job of writing teenagers, including making all the relationships feel like those of teenagers. As a result it all feels authentic, but there is also a feeling like it's just kid stuff, like all the relationships really are just schooltime things. Whereas, Talesin19 writes adult relationships with emotional depth, commitment and maturity. As a result Talesin19's relationships read as being much more precious and meaningful. It also helps that Harry's relationship with Ginny has profound impact and consequences on Harry's life in Grow Young With Me, hell, it's practically the entire premise. However, Harry's relationship in canon is barely explored. Its very much /"the hero got the girl and they all lived happily ever after"/ and as a result it really doesn't have much impact. They're only together for the last few weeks of Half Blood Prince and she's pretty much completely absent from Deathly Hallows. You could remove Harry and Ginny's relationship from canon and the only thing you'd really have to change would be some flavor text and a bit of dialogue at Dumbledore's funeral. The plot wouldn't be affected at all. With Grow Young With Me, you'd have to rewrite the entire story.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

*** A great fic, but I admit that (like most/all other HP fanfic OCs I've seen), I wasn't able to recall her when I saw this thread. Not sure I'd call her my favorite OC when I couldn't actually remember her at first. But I do agree that she is well written and the fic overall is good.

** There's a lot of good OCs in both linkao3(The Heir of House Black) and linkao3(Basilisk Eyes).

From THoHB, some highlights are Alex Fawley, Carmichael Wilkins, and Kaiden Potter.

Basilisk Eyes has Gemma Boot, Mei Lee, and Tony Montague.

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Updates once every two weeks. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

It could be a sudden draft, but Amy is doubtful. Her fist clenches shut around the marble. It is pretty. She could look at it for hours, the way it catches the light. It's almost like a sweet. Want curls up in her chest like a cat. She thinks she'll keep it. A gift from the big grey orphanage, just to her.“That's mine,” comes a thin, cold voice, and she sees the boy across the hall for the first time. His room is directly across from hers. He is pretty, she thinks, like a drawing from a book. The lines of his face are smooth and pale. His hair is dark and neatly parted. He holds himself very rigidly, like a miniature soldier or a wind-up toy. “That's mine,” he repeats, sharply.(In which Tom Riddle is not the only strange child to come out of Wool's.)
