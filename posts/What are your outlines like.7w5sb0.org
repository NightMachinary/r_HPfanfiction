** I hand write them all.

General stream of consciousness prose where I talk to myself about what i want the story to be about, the general plot line, certain scenes I want to see and the like. This is usually 3-5 pages.

I then write a one page outline of each chapter. This is typically more focused and less rambly, as it were. Highlighting the specific scenes in question and what the point of each chapter should be.

** Nonexistent. I have some faint ideas about things that will happen in future years, but I mostly make it up as I go along.

** I don't write outlines so much as rough drafts. I have a good idea of where I am going and how, so ill maybe write a general missions statement like "Tonks fights death eaters with muggles using x y and z" but that's about it.

** I make each chapter title name to give myself a vague idea about the themes and plots of a chapter, and then I write the first few paragraphs at the start and then at the end to lock it in. Then I make NOTES about ALL THE EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE. :) And then I write them! :) Yes like coloring insides lines!

**** Thanks Achille. :) Yes I'm not good with doing too many things at once so I made it into STEPS and FILLING IN BLANKS. :)

** Not too specific. I write down the end of each part and the big finale, the important milestones of my main plot and subplots, the backstories to my characters.

I don't write an outline for each chapter, but I always know what is going to happen in a chapter before I start writing it.

Plans can still change while writing though, sometimes I only figure out that something I imagined doesn't work when I try to write it down, sometimes a new character or a subplot develops unplanned.

** Beginning

Main points

End

Then that gets fleshed out into: This happens

That happens

He reacts this way

SHe reacts that way.

This other things happens

So and so dies

This happens

That's basically my outlines. I have to have a pretty solid starting outline. Midpoints can be fluid, but I need to have a solid grip on what is going to happen or I can't get anywhere. I get overwhelmed.

** Generally messy and tragic. I'm very seat-of-the-pants, but I'm trying to be better and use the Notes and Synopsis sections in Scrivener. I find it helpful to take notes of dates and character ages as well, but too often I write them down, save the file and never look at it again.

** I start off with a general idea of the story, just a few paragraphs. That's pretty just the idea coming into my head, and then me writing it down before I forget, so it's usually a bunch of chunky paragraphs. Then, I'll start writing the first scene out, and as I get more ideas, I just put them in parenthesis either at the bottom, or after where I want them to go. If I get a lot of ideas, I might preemptively decide roughly which chapter the idea goes in. It's a bit messy, but I've found that as long as I actually record my ideas somewhere, I generally remember what I want to include.

This is an [[https://imgur.com/IGtdWqp][actual example]] of the kind of notes I write for my outlines. Not everything gets used, mind you, but I'll pretty much type out every idea that I think of and see what works or not, as some will invalidate others and things like that.

** Depends on the story. More serious stories have more solid/detailed outlines, humor/parody stories have vague goals every so often.

** A collection of random scenes written in a journal which I use like stepping stones. I fill in the gaps between the main stuff I want to happen and plan the big things, but only vaguely. Probably don't copy me.
