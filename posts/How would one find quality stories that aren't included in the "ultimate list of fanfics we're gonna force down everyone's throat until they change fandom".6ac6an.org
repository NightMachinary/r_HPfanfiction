** I found that checking the favorites of authors I like is a good way to discover more stories. Although with the authors who have huge lists of favorites, it's not too helpful.

For reddit, asking for particular plots - "Good stories centered on Neville", "Good Slytherin!Harry stories" etc. - is a good way to hear about less popular stories, since that way you can exclude a lot of the most popular stories you already know.

** In addition to checking favorites of the favorite authors, I found it useful to quickly go through reviews of the stories I liked, find long and thoughtful ones with which I agree, and checking the favorites of those reviewers.

** Looking at other reviewers'/authors' favorite lists is a good start, but they tend to be full of all the popular fics.

To find hidden gems, I filter the wordcount (100k+ and complete narrows the "lolzmyfirstfic" writers down to the serious writers). Then I sort by reviews, but instead of starting my search from page 1 (the fics have thousands of reviews), I go to pages 30+. This gets me to fics that have around 1000 reviews--not the most well known, but well-liked enough that they have hidden gem potential. When you get to page 50, you get to fics with reviews fewer than a 1000, and I've found a lot of hidden gems there.

** Go to your favorite authors' favorites lists and look through those fics. Get an opinion from someone whose tastes you already like. Alternatively, write down what you are specifically looking for in a story (themes, genres, etc) instead of making a generic request for quality fics. Quality means many things to many people.

** Mainly, for me, it is all about knowing what you want and figuring out how to use Google carefully with keywords.

** Keywords, fellow reddit lurker. Playing around with synonyms and tags would help. Like crossovers or indy/independent /insert preferred character here/ on ff.net comb through the communites. The filter option is too broad, and sometimes they filter out one shots or short stories.

Try author names as well. If you know an amazing author most likely they have other stories/favs that are amazing too.
