Hey there! (First time posting here after lurking around for a bit)

I would really like it if you guys can link me Fanfics where Harry is the reincarnation of a Founder instead of the heir and he receives his memories or experience a select few in his dreams.

Also, if there are fics where Harry is paired with Daphne, Tracey, or Astoria but that the girls will either be dark or Death Eaters. I read a fic that showed Daphne (who was a minor character there and not the pairing) as a Death Eater like Draco and that she tamper with Dark Magic and such and I wanted to find a fic where a similar Daphne (as well as Tracey and Astoria) is the main pairing and not a minor character. It can be a harem or single pairing of one of the girls I do not mind.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: To clarify things both themes were meant to be seperated and not combined.

  The Founders found a way of putting powerful safeguards into their bloodlines. Now, as Harry faces off against the shade of Tom Riddle and the basilisk inside the Chamber of Secrets, the Sorting Hat causes one of those safeguards to activate. The result means Harry Potter is now Salazar Slytherin and the most misunderstood Founder is the Boy-Who-Lived.

*** I did not mean that lol. I mean a Founders reincarnation OR Harry x Daphne/Tracey/Astoria. I might have not stated my intentions clearly but those were my intentions. My intentions were two different themes entirely and not a story that combine both.
