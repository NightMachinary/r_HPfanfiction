Hi!

It's understandably weird to most Westerners that magical folk wear robes all the time, since robes were largely a ceremonial thing in Europe. So I thought I'd share a few examples of robe or robe-like apparel from around the world that are regular attire for common people:

1) The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellabiya][*jellabiya*]], its cousin, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thawb][*thawb*]] and the woman-specific [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaya][*abaya*]], worn pretty much daily by people in the Middle East/North Africa

2) The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegalese_kaftan][*Senegalese kaftan*]] or boubou, which is a pullover kaftan with bell sleeves (kaftans can also be jacket-like), also daily wear for a lot of people in West Africa.

3) The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agbada][*agbada*]] or *grand boubou* worn across West Africa, which refers to both the robe and the full suit of clothing the robe is usually worn with. This is more of formal attire - bespoke (it's almost a fashion faux pas to just /buy/ agbada off the rack), made from rich fabric covered in heavy but understated embroidery, often inherited. Some people wear agbada everyday in a not-so-subtle display of wealth/power.

4) A whole ton of robes and robe-likes from East Asia. Danryeong, kimonos, jifu pao, etc. These were mostly jacket-style (so rather unlike HP robes), although you can find a few examples that were worn over the head.

So instead of an academic or priest's robe or defaulting to Muggle clothing, you can picture these or variations of these as what your characters are wearing :) I particularly like [[http://verastic.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Nigerian-Woman-In-Agbada.jpg][this agbada]], and [[https://goo.gl/images/KS9Ho6][this kid looks cute as hell]], and [[http://themuslimmale.tumblr.com/image/162905693656][here's a guy in a plain thawb]]

*** Oh these are lovely, although a few seem to be, well, just dresses (Admittedly it's an odd line to draw, seeing as a dress is /une robe/)

I tried to limit the real-world examples in my post to robes that are pulled over the head, partly because we tend to default to [what you've termed] outer robes when we think of "regular" robes (probably because the only robe that's commonly worn in the west is the bathrobe)

*** Seems pretty much along the idea I go with.

From what we can tell in the books, the hogwarts uniform is most likely a thicker full length robe that doesn't open.

As for the other robe, I'd say the more progressive wizards and witches would wearing open robe and/or shorter inner robes paired with tropes, where the more conservagive wizards would wearing full length robes.

Unfortunately I've gotten a lot of hate on other subbreddits for suggesting this, particularly how muggle suits with a longer cut jacket or a cost just doesn't cut it as robes.

**** I feel like there's this fashion/culture war thing going on with the older generation who, uh, like to have some breeze about their privates and younger people who like to try out shorter cuts and trousers (like [[https://goo.gl/images/5YGoL6][this]])

*** These are amazing! I could even see myself wearing some of these dresses/coats, a few are quite modern and stylish looking! I do wonder how a similar style would translate to men though. I like pants and long coat look like what Newt wears in fantastic beasts, but I feel like full on robes are harder to make work on men than on women.

** Well, arabian, african and asian robes don't really fit a western culture like magical Britain. However, these just show once more that the style of the attire of a people is no indicator of their social progress or advancement, but rather how much their sense of fashion is dominated by modern western consumerism.

And just like all of these, the wizarding world's robes probably also have a fashion behind them which is constantly changing and switching (and may even take heavy inspiration from any of these styles you showed).

In any case, I love the fact that wizards and witches wear robes, and wide witches hats and whatnot. It makes very clear that the moment you walk through the Leaky Cauldron you enter a different british culture, different but parrallel to the british muggle culture. Which is also why I almost always give an approving nod when an adult Harry is described as wearing robes rather than muggle clothing.

*** The idea was less that British wizards would be wearing exactly these (although to be honest there's reason to expect the magical world to be way less divided along race/ethnic lines, what with people Apparating and Portkeying all over the place and international cooperation being achieved way back when) and more that these are examples of what a culture that regularly and commonly wears robes would come up with in terms of fashion (hint: probably not heavy, ceremonial academic robes). Beyond that, actually seeing people move around in robes can give you a better sense (as both a reader and writer) of how certain motions would look.

** Even since the Communists took over in China, they worked very hard to stamp 'feudal traditions' out of existence. Nowadays, nobody there is wearing robes. I had worked in China as an expat for almost 10 years from 2005-2014 and can attest to that.

For those who are interested in knowing what traditional Chinese dress looked like, here are [[http://i2.w.yun.hjfile.cn/slide/201302/song5_5022.jpg][examples from the Ming and Qing dynasties]], and here are some [[http://i2.w.yun.hjfile.cn/slide/201302/zongti_5022.jpg][examples from the Han and Tang dynasties, and from the 1930s]].

*** Interestingly, there's a Chinese woman in Fantastic Beasts during the ICW scene - Madam Ya Zhou. Pic:

While I don't consider movie costuming decisions canon (whereas I do consider the script canon), it is nonetheless interesting that she was depicted in a form of dress reminiscent of the Imperial era (or at least, what the costume department apparently considered traditional Chinese, though it has a somewhat Pocahontas look to it...). FB was set in 1926, 14 years after the fall of the Qing dynasty, and at a time when Muggle China was essentially involved in a drawn out series of civil wars. I've always wondered if magical China kept Imperial traditions or if they too had a mirror revolutionary conflict.

** Hey I'm from West Africa (Nigeria), and I think this is a very cool idea. The clothing in the third link you sent is called a baban riga in Hausa, the language of Northern Nigeria. This literally translates to "big shirt" which I've always found quite funny. I've never heard it called an grand boubou, but then again I've never been to the surrounding countries. Women don't wear it, most choose to wear abayas (in northern Nigeria at least). As you said, some people wear baban rigas daily as a statement of wealth. Recently, I spent over 250 USD on fabric and tailoring of my own! Although I never wear it because it's very heavy. That being said, it was a pleasant surprise to see parts of my culture on possibly the least likely subreddit I expected to it in.

Coincidentally, agbada is pretty much "big attire" in Yoruba, and grand boubou is West African French for..."big shirt" :D

And yeah, they can be really expensive! I've heard of boutiques on Victoria Island whose starting price for tailoring alone is around $700.

  Odd colour combinations for one thing.

You are aware that you can cut and sew garment styles with literally any (appropriately weighted) fabric, yes?

#+begin_quote
  And they seem very ordinary and therefore do not fit magic. It's like a suit
#+end_quote

I fail to see how a danryeong, an abaya or a kaftan are anything like a (western) suit
