** The author says he will now update every two weeks. For the last year and a half updates came incredibly slow.

*** Well, The Sinister Man said that in the last chapter. In /this/ chapter he claims he will not update until October 1st, which seems pretty in-line with the past year+ of updates. Barring some unexpected turnaround of course.

**** Let's do the maths:

Third year began in chapter 96. So, assuming that the fic continues at an even pace, that makes 48 chapters a year. That would make the complete, 7-year fic 339 chapters long, or 231 chapters remaining.

From one update in August and and the next in October, let's say that's one chapter every 2 months, or 6 chapters a year. By that measure, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin should be completed some time around 2057.

****** I have already mostly bowed out, just can't stay invested in a fic if I only read a chapter every couple of months

** That twist on wandless magic was amazing. Once again, I applaud the Sinister Man for completely destroying tropes.

** I just finished this after spending every free second of the last week reading. Does anyone have any recommendations for stories of the same quality? Not necessarily the same ideas, just...a well written, long story. Thanks!
