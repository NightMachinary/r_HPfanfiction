Is there a widespread HHr hate in the fandom? Is the popular opinion against this pairing ? If so, why?

NOTE: I don't like HHr, I tried reading them, but I've read too many harry/other fics in which Harry and Hermione are usually portrayed as having a platonic sibling relationship, so I think that may have colored my opinion of a HHr pairing. But my opinion doesn't matter here, I don't like a lot of other pairings too, but they are quite popular.


** A good chunk of the fandom does not ship them. And there are always people who are a little militant about certain characters.

Generally speaking, there is always an ebb and flow to the popularity of any pairing or character, and recently I'd say that disliking them seems to be in. There are no new fics which really sell the ship well, which certainly contributes since it takes away the "but look at fic X, it is done really well there" argument.

Tl;dr: Yes, but within the usual patterns.

*** I agree with the ebb and flow on a personal level. My mood for fics depends on what I read, compared to my ideal.

I get in the mood for a well-written Draco and Snape redemption after reading nonsensical bashing of their characters. I get they were both generally bad people in canon, but sometimes it's taken to the extreme.

Likewise with Hermione. A smart for her age, teen girl with a few insecurities and flaws, but a heart of gold is pretty much the ideal one to read. Same with Ron, except perhaps make him wise rather than book-smart. Harry as well.

You get polar extremes for these characters.

I looked at the top fics in fanficiton.net under HHr and most of them seemed to pre-DH.. I guess it was a good enough ship before Rowling started her Canon pairings..

**** The number of favourites increases over time, so naturally the old fics are most popular, that's the case with most pairings. Potato19 has a few good HHr fics, but that's pretty much the only recent author who writes good, long stories with that pairing. Starfox also has a few, but those are AUs with significant divergences, so certainly not everyone's cup of tea.

Although to be fair, most pairings do not have more relatively new quality content if we are being honest.

** H/Hr attracts more hate simply because it pisses off H/G, Dramione, Drarry, and Romione crowds. H/G and Dramione shippers can be totally at peace with each other, while Drarry and Romione fans can generally get along.

Dramione and Drarry are the two top pairings in this fandom.

** Funny, I always got the impression H/Hr was one of the more popular pairings on the sub. Certainly more than the Draco pairings, which I understand are popular in the fandom as a whole.

I personally find it the only main character pairings that I like. I really don't like Ron/Hermione (that is not a healthy relationship) or Ginny/Harry (also not a healthy relationship). I usually prefer my fics to pair with less known characters or OC's, but if it is going to be a main character pairing...

** I doubt it!

Hell, I don't love Hermione (I don't hate her either, despite criticising her often because while good at school and sometimes smart, she is not the prodigy so many fanfiction authors turn her into! Her grades come from hard work, unlike the grades of say the Marauders who were pranksters and slackers and all had above average to very good (Harry's father is said to have a knack for transfiguration and Sirius was noted to have good grades, too and Remus was a bookworm brainiac!)), but:

I don't like how Harry/Hermione stories often turn out!

Either Hermione is right all the time and Harry is a whipped idiot who wouldn't manage to put his underpants on the right way without her or it is the other way round and Hermione is a non-personality who is only good for book-knowledge, copying homework from and sex!

Seriously, find a damn balance and I will probably like the story, especially if it deviates from canon (new magics and other additions are a must...I don't like canon-rehashes, hell if anything I hate them, with the exception of say start of first year or canon till the fanfiction starts...but if your supposedly different characters act the same as the canon ones and the same things happen, then it is a boring read!)

Hell, they (Harry and Hermione) can fight - as long as they respect each other and can agree to disagree if they can't find a compromise or convince each other!

** I like book canon Hermione as a character. I like book canon Harry as a character. And the biggest strike against HHr - I like book canon Ron. If people who wrote HHr did not have to completely fuck up their personalities to pair them, I'd probably not dislike the pairing so much.

I just hate how she takes over the plot when she's paired with Harry. Like, why is she even with him if he's needs her to tell him everything?

And HHr fics that talk about how they love and respect each other always, always tell and not show how exactly they're supposed to be equal. When it comes to the actual plot, there's always a disparity in contribution. It's either Harry's show or Hermione's show all the way, with a few (excruciating) conversations or descriptions along the way that talk and talk and talk about their feelings. (Like, I'm a girl and I cannot stand half that much feelings talk with my SO). They can't ever just talk about the epiphanies they had on the shitter or negotiate on the picking of visible blackheads or something, which according to me are the true markers of a successful relationship.

I truly enjoy Romione when it's done right, because people don't have to be idealised versions of humanity to be loved, and Ron and Hermione love each other because of their flaws and not inspite of them. IRL people remain family or besties or lovers even after they've been hurt by them because these relationships are fulfilling in other ways. And if nothing else, they can always unite in their mutual mother-henning of Harry which they've been doing since the age of 11.

*** To be very frank, if I had discovered HHr fic first, I think it would have became my favorite ship as I like Harry and Hermione as the characters. As it happened, I ended up reading a lot of other fics that firmly established a platonic relationship between the two. As it happens, this might be unpopular, but I don't think Ron Weasley is good enough for Hermione Granger, (maybe I would have picked up Dramione but I started reading Drarry so that's out), simply by process of elimination I like Ronmione better than Harmony or Dramione.

** I honestly couldn't care less about practically any ships in HP. Some make me uncomfortable to varying degrees, but I'm just kind of meh on the vast majority. HHr is one of them. /However/ the militant shippers are extremely off-putting, especially since it usually comes with a huge side-order of bashing. Therefore, I am unlikely to read very much containing it.

** This subreddit is biased against it, myself included. There are communities that do. There is no cohesive community.

I myself don't mind it, despite a slight judgmental bias. I dislike how the narratively Hermione gets away with things Ron and Harry would be punished for, and I probably wouldn't be friends with her in real life, but she has a ton of good aspects. Movie Hermione and fanon Hermione are just terrible characters.

I also dislike the way she's featured in stories. She becomes this damsel in distress or this super hot genius that's better than Dumbledore, and Harry becomes this Super genius or this wimp who couldn't have gotten through classwork without her.

Their relationship often receives excessive focus in said fics.

I myself could see it working out provided they were attracted to each other. But they're not in canon. Quite a few Harry/Hermione authors use their fic's author notes as a soapbox for the pairing.

I really dislike these characterisations. Hermione is not a genius, she is a talented person who gets most of her abilities through extensive study (and the ability to apply what she reads, like the DA coins). If the author depicts her as genius he makes her a Mary Sue and takes away one of her core aspects.

Same for Harry. He is good with DADA, but he is also too lazy for his own good and still struggles while learning new magic.

Making them genii is just a cheap shortcut to write out a power fantasy.

As for the attractiveness, that again seems like projected wish-fulfilment (being attractive, having an attractive partner or both). Most people are average looking, usually with a few attractive and a few unattractive traits. There is no need to make them models or porn stars because you can take what is already attractive and use that as the base for any romantic relationship.

You can even take things generally not considered attractive and write an attraction to that, like untamable hair, being short and so on. Tastes are subjective, so Harry might as well be into girls with messy hair, 10 pounds too much and the like. Or there is an attraction despite the flaws and/or they are counterbalanced through the character of someone.

Tl;dr: Flawless characters are unrelatable and signs of bad writing.

*** I understand. The reason for my asking this question is I really really like Book/Canon Hermione - she's a faithful, loyal ,smart friend and a powerful witch and is an inspiration to women fans over the years..\\
I do have to agree that her Fanon portryal has really colored my view of her in which she's consistently portrayed as a bossy know-it-all or bashed in other fics, which is sad really. The few HHr fics I tried reading had her play damsel in distress, pretty OOC, which is something that I can never really see her as, one of the main reason I liked her in Canon.
