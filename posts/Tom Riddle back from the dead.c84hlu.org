Struck me as an interesting fic idea the other day, figured I'd ask around. Are there any fics wherein Tom Riddle actually manages to come back at some point (through the Diary or one of the other Horcruxes) during the HP school years?


** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/book-learning-hp.446003/reader][Book Learning]] by Zerrer has a diary Ginny.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16594244/chapters/38889167][Spoonful of Sugar]] by widdlewed) has a diary Tom Riddle that came back at some point during Voldemort's first war.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16697380/chapters/39160087][Diablerie]] by Oceanbreeze7) is a summoned from the past Tom Riddle.

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.

** These fics have addressed this scenario:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052 ): Harry and Sirius both fall through the Veil and end up in a new dimension, where Diary Riddle is secretly fighting Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13274529/1/An-Old-and-New-World][An Old and New World]], linkffn(13274529 ): This Diary Riddle even takes Ginny's body and has helped Voldemort regain his body, for now.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13299443/1/][Departure from the Diary]], linkffn(13299443 ): AU with female Voldemort. She finds out about Harry's scar and uses it as a place to live temporarily. At moment, she is sharing Harry's body and interacting with him as a second voice in his head.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/][The Imposter Complex]], linkffn(13275002): Diary Riddle regains a body without killing Ginny. This fic assumes the theory that he no longer functions as a soul anchor, but is an independent copy of the 17 years old Tom Riddle. He decides to fight the deranged and crazy older self, goes around subsuming other Horcruxes, and has even recruited Sirius as his follower.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106 ): This is the most popular fic on this sub by a wide margin. This Horcrux actually took over or merged with Harry on the Halloween night. Chaos and hilarity ensue, as Harrymort is determined to get rid of his competition to achieve his ultimate goal: teaching DADA forever.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186430/1/][Thunderstorm]], linkffn(7186430): Another female Diary Riddle gains a body after interacting with Harry's scar. She hooks up with Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]], linkffn(8192853): Voldemort regains his body only after 5 years, but there's a catch.

  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane. Still, it's the only game in town...

  End of second year AU. fem!Riddle. Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Thankfully, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride.

** This is a fairly popular trope. The Diary regaining a body is the most common version of it. Oddly enough, a great many of those fics focus on a Harry/Tom pairing. I can link some of those if you are curious, but for now here are the ones with no pairing:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11358664/1/Warning-Signs-Read-Desolation][Warning Signs Read Desolation]] - (169k+ words, dead) Voldemort successfully steals the Philosopher's Stone and kidnaps Harry in the process. He soon regains his body and begins to gather his forces with his human Horcrux at his side as an unwilling apprentice.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9702269/1/Do-Androids-Dream-of-Electric-Sheep][Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep]] - (81k+ words, complete) Harry gets the Diary while he is a child living with the Dursleys.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10785698/1/Transcendence][Transcendence]] - (101k+ words, last updated a year ago) The Diary wins in the Chamber and leaves Harry for dead. It sets out to reclaim the seat of power that the original left behind, but things don't quite go according to plan.
