An acquaintance of mine found out there were no Dennis Creevey/Ariana Dumbledore fics on AO3. I immediately sought to rectify this.

You may ask, "how on earth could you make a crack pairing like this possibly work?"

That's a very good question. You'll have to read it to find out if I did.

** Beautiful writing! Would love for the story to continue, maybe a chaptered fic where Ariana slowly pieces her old life together and becomes suspicious of Dennis. But she doesn't tell him about magic and he thinks she is definitely a muggle. Haha now I want to write a fic based on this fic

Anyways I loved how you wrote the story, will check out your other work.

*** Please go ahead! It would be great if there was more than 1 Ariana Dumbledore/Dennis Creevey fic in existence.

I personally don't feel like writing a continuation myself because the characters aren't strongly defined enough in my head to survive so far from a source like canon, so to speak. But it'd be interesting to see what someone else might pull together.

** Oh this is excellent! I didn't expect to like this fic as much as I did or for it to not be a crackfic lol. I always wanted to explore the Creevey brothers - I don't know why I loved their characters so much. I know you said you won't really continue it but I hope you do :)

**** I did, the whole dream thing and all. My comment was more of a comment on the idea of it being an Ariana Dumbledore fic. I should have been more clear in stating that I don't really feel this would count.

***** that is certainly a valid intepretation, but given the number of fics who have Salazar Slytherin reborn into the body of Harry Potter that still refer to the character as Salazar Slytherin I'm fine with counting it this way

** I was thinking, "Ah, this is genius! I must find a pairing I can at least entertain that no-one else has done and do the same thing". (Well, aside from not having an AO3 account but that's a minor quibble.) Then I read the fic.

You make it sound like you were just trolling or whatever but that's really good. Like, I don't think it's unfair to compare it to Cauterize.
