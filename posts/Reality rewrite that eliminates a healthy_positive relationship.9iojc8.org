Looking for Reality Rewrite fics (time travel, alternate dimensions, rebirth, or similar), where the principal actors are in a healthy relationship but end up with other people after the rewrite.

Usually you see: * A) characters are in toxic relationship that rewrite knocks out (ex. Harry is ensnared by love potion by Ginny, time travel to escape) or * B) Characters are already in love / positive relationship but go back anyway. This is usually "relationship denied by life" (ex. Harry always secretly loved girl, but then she is killed and time travel to fix it) or "I knowingly risk my relationship being wiped out, but it somehow works out" (ex Harry & girl love each other but Harry is broken so girl risks time travel to spare him abusive childhood, even at the cost of their relationship, but they end up together in the happily ever after)

Having "good" relationship erased seems uncommon. And I do get it, if an author is writing a particular ship, they don't want to spend too much time on a different relationship. But it can be very powerful when a character is sacrificing their own reality in order to address some problem, and it is cheapened somehow if they always regain all that was good that was lost.

Only one I can think of strongly in this category is Red Knight, where reborn!Ron is shipped with Dalphe even though he had a good R/Hr in his past life. linkffn(12141684)

*BONUS POINTS* if traveler is knowingly removing their own relationship. (Ex. Ginny goes back in time to stop Harry from going to Hogwarts, even though she knows it means they do not meet)

*BONUS POINTS* if new world characters eventually learn/recognize the sacrifice (Ex. In the happily ever after, they pay tribute to the person-who-could-have-been, even if they ended up completely different)

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

*** Nope. This one was safely in the "I knowingly risk my relationship being wiped out, but somehow it works out". Hermione was clearly stated to be with Harry previously (Harry is described as her Boyfriend). This one does deal with the whole "The relationship may never happen because of the changes I did", but the Happily Ever After puts them together in the end.

(Great Fic though, that was exactly the one I was thinking about when I put down the "I knowingly risk my relationship category, because at the end she discusses how it would not be guaranteed in the recreated future and she knew this going in).

And if she had ended up with Ron after the rewrite, since she was described as previously being with Harry, it would have fit perfectly. But been a bit more bitter-sweet.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.
