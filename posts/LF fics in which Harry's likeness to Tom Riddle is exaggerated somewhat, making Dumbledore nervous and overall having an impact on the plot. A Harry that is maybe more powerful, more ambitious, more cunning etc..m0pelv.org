  Loneliness was something that Harry Potter was accustomed to. He had learnt that there was none that cared for him, none that would rescue him from his misery and none that heard his pleas for help. Much to his surprise, however, Harry Potter had been wrong. Someone had been listening, had been there with him through it all. But, just who was 'Tom?

  There are more similarities between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle than most people think. The voice in Harry's head only confirms that. A more competent Harry with Voldemort in his head comes to Hogwarts. Smart!Harry, Riddlesque!Harry, NoBashing!, NoSlash!

  Powerful!Harry. Dark Magic (eventually). Harry is raised by a sarcastic egomaniac, and canon's paths are left deserted. Featuring a competent Quirrell, intricate plots, and an exploration of magic. No bashing.

  There wasn't a single member of faculty at the orphanage that didn't worry about Harry. He had an air about him. He just felt so... disturbing. Well Harry doesn't feel disturbed. He feels great. In fact, he feels powerful. Ever since his imaginary friend taught him how to control his magic, everything started going really well for him. And he's very excited for Hogwarts.
