I have a ship happening in a WIP at the moment, out of curiosity, I checked the Ao3 tag. Only NINE entries - I was astonished, as I assumed there'd be at least a few hundred.

Any ships you love that don't have the fics you expected? Any pairings you're SURPRISED are so unpopular? Any rare ships you've given up on entirely?

*** Severus Snape/Bartemius Crouch! It isn't a shipfic - homophobia is a pretty big theme in the AU I'm working on, and it's just part of some manipulations on Snape's part, but I assumed there'd be a lot of fics on the popularity of the respective characters in smutfic alone.

** Dean Thomas/Lisa Turpin. I believe I created the pairing, (Could be wrong, but almost certain). I don't know why I like it I just do. (If anyone writes Dean/Lisa I'd love you forever).

Padma Patil/Anthony Goldstein: My headcanon is that they meet up again after the war and get together then.

Rita Skeeter/Gilderoy Lockhart: This pairing is more popular, at least on fanfiction.net but still not enough people write about them. It's just perfect to me personally. I tend to write humor when it involves them.

I have a love triangle against Lucius, Narcissa and Rodolphus. In my headcanon Rodolphus has always loved Narcissa, Narcissa turned him down and they are still friends but Lucius knows that Rodolphus likes Narcissa and ever since has hated Rodolphus. So Lucius and Rodolphus have a feud going on. (Bellatrix is too in love with Voldemort to care and only married Rodolphus out of obligation to her family).

Since in my headcanon it was Andromeda that was suppose to marry Rodolphus but Andromeda left Rodolphus for Ted.

Amelia Bones/John Dawlish. Thanks to some stories I ship it. Amelia is the more stricter of the two while John tends to get Amelia to lighten up.

It was... ok.

Very friendly goblins, Lord Potter-Black, unnecessarily evil Kingsley, falling in love the immediately with Andromeda, magical bonds, unnecessary harem, fucking magic into Hermione's mom, Harry as biological father of Teddy, it was pretty impressive the amount of cliched tropes the author packed in.

Even so it's nice to read about Harry getting a happily ever after once in a while.

** I personally read almost exclusively Hermione paired with older, darker men (mostly Snape, Lucius when I can find a good one, and obviously Tom Riddle/Voldemort, few are good but when they are they're amazing). So Volmione fits your theme. Unfortunately, while there is a relatively decent number of fics available, more than half of them are abandoned stuff written by 15 years old with all the clichés you can think of. Only a few are long, interesting and well written. I love AUs (obviously) and especially when Voldemort is still the charismatic mastermind he used to be. I'm sad about the many wonderful stories that are abandoned mostly, to get them together you have to invent a scenario where it'd fit. One of the most promising was a group of people brought together (they didn't have any choice) because of some sort of magical plague (they had to find a cure) - including Voldemort and Hermione, and 3 or 4 others. It was abandoned pretty early, but I'd have loved to read it - probably a story about the research of knowledge, greater powers and curses, a meeting of two bright minds... Sigh.

Oh, and Hermione/Salazar Slytherin. I read 2 or 3 that were good, but there aren't many.

  The Not-a-Sequel Prequel to "So Random" from Fanfiction.Net (Here to be known as So Random II) The Marauders try to make their lunch while discussing the weather. Sirius does battle against Lucius Malfoy and his army of Albino Peacocks for James' honor, and Hagrid looses his one true love. Will things ever be the same at Hogwarts...? Yeah probably...
