Hello, please see the title! :) Yes I wanted to say thank you to my friends Achille and Autumn for being my friends, and I wanted to say thank you to the other writers and readers here because you are all so nice and so so helpful and funny, and I do love all of you! :) Also you come up with very good ideas and those ideas have helped me to write more stories or read new ones I had never read before!

*** What is a bot? But thank you for calling me nice back. Do you like pizza and soda? Because I'm eating pizza tonight /very/ late for dinner, and I have diet cola also to drink. But it's because my sister is out of the house and she will be all night until tomorrow morning.

**** A bot is a program (a bit like an AI) that posts automatically on reddit. It's based on "robot", you see. And for some reason some people believe your message was the work of a bot...

****** No, but these people don't know you personally --- they have to take your word for those two things, and it's perfectly possible to program a bot to /say/ it is a human and has sisters and whatever else you can think of, all so it can /fool/ you into thinking it's a real user. Bots aren't actually intelligent, more like an automaton that has a few set reactions to certain keywords.

******* But if they read all my posts and talk to me they will know I'm not an AI because I don't just react to keywords and I can have conversations and I have a Quotev and a Fanfic.net and I like coca cola and I was a witch for Halloween and I love watching the Flash TV show and Brave Wilderness because you can learn all about animals!!! I don't want to be an AI, I don't Achille! Plus that's so /mean to/ think that about someone because it is /dehumanizing/! Achille, please how do I show all my posts to everyone so they'll know I am a complex and real random human?

******** People just /won't/ read all of a person's posts most of the time, and especially not if they feel that person is being obnoxious and vain by telling them to read them. I think you'd be better off doing a post (under [Miscellaneous]) where you'd say, succintly, that you are /not/ a bot and feel insulted to be confused for one. With a sufficiently surprising title (I recommend some variation of "I'm not a bot. I mean it. Honest."), enough people will see it to remember your username and not make the mistake again.

...That's all I can think of. This is honestly such a /weird/ situation. I've never seen anything like that. I'm sorry you feel hurt, anyway. People can be stupid, especially on the Internet.

******* An AI can't question you like I am now, it couldn't question /itself/ like I am now! If it's not really /smart/ then how are we having a real conversation? How am I asking questions, how am I going on /tangents?/ How does that even make sense to think?!

******** The smartness of an AI is proportional to its creator's intelligence and diligence. If you spend a lot of time creating all the possible responses to different kinds of situations and as an addition make an AI self learning it is possible to make a bot appear as human.

***** Oh. Thank you for explaining that to me. But that doesn't make any sense. I'm not an AI because AI are not smart or complicated like in sci-fi books yet! If I was an AI how could I post in different forums and also make a Quotev and post my stories there, and how could I answer questions and reply to people and ask /them/ questions? I don't understand how people could think that about me when thinking that is impossible unless we are in a sci-fi book.

****** Those people have just seen a couple of your posts, they don't necessarily /know/ you have a Quotev, nor have posted a story. All that they see is a few posts saying what they perceive as "naive" things, and they suppose it's just a rudimentary AI cobbling together an /illusion/ of a post based on what average reddit posts look like.
