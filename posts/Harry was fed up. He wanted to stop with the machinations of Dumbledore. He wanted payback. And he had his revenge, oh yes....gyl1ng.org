The students of the Great Hall were sitting in silent anticipation. Everybody fixed their eyes on the Headmaster or upon the Goblet of Fire; an ancient artifact which its origin was unkown. Harry had researched the goblet, though. He had learned a lot about its history... and abilities.

He had learned that the goblet was a very powerful artifact, one that merely needed a written name to bind someone to.

Being honest with himself, Harry was /scared./ The last three years had been full of monsters (an ancient basilisk, a colony of giant spiders, hundreds of demons seeking for his soul...) and he was fed up. He just wanted to have a little peace but it seemed like he could never find it.

That was mostly because of Dumbledore. /He/ was the one responsible for the student's safety. The more Harry thought about it, the more he realised Dumbledore could have done much, /much/ better.

Why did he allow the staff to punish 11-year-old children by sending them to the Forbidden Forest? Why did he go to London the night Quirrell tried to steal the Philosopher's Stone by broom if it was an urgent matter? Why did he use "defenses" that 11 year-old children could easily defeat? Why didn't he do anything when the chamber was opened when someone died when it was last opened? How could he bring a /troll/ into the castle instead of acquiring other, more effective means to defend the Stone? Worst of all... /he/ was who put him with the Dursleys, who abused him.

The list went on, and on.

Harry, for once, wanted /revenge/. He wanted /him/ to /suffer/. He slipped into the restricted, and studied a variation of the Confundus charm. It was very difficult to perform, but he perfected it with extreme dedication. His invisibility cloak was more powerful than he guessed. It allowed him to bypass the stupid age line.

Next, he went to Hagrid. He steered the conversation to owls and letters, in order to learn whether he had letters from Dumbledore, which he did indeed have. Harry managed to steal one.

"The Champion for Dumstrang is... Viktor Krum!" Loud cheers erupted in the Hall.

"The Champion for Beauxbatons is... Fleur Delacour!" Once again, everybody clapped and cheered.

"And finally the Champion for Hogwarts is... Cedric Diggory!" The Hogwarts students cheered loudest of all.

"Thank you for participating! This has been a..."

Everybody went still as the Goblet lit up once again. Dumbledore caught the little paper that flew out.

He paled as he read it. "H-how..." he stuttered.

Madam Maxime approached him and plucked the paper from his fingers. She read it, and an amused smile appeared on her face.

"Albus Dumbledore" She announced.

Harry smiled.

Chaos ensued.


** Umm, i don't think Maxime would have been amused at all. More like ranting and raving about cheating.

Her reaction when a 4th year was added was bad but Albus Dumbledore who can steam roll anything?

Oh yes she would be angry.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11331407/1/Supreme-Champion]]

In his dreams Harry discovered Voldemort was going to attempt to get him into the TriWizard Tournament. In retaliation he tricked the Goblet of Fire to emit the names of the people who wanted him in the tournament. Four names came out, including Albus Dumbledore. Now the new Supreme Champion is forced into the tournament. See how he fares. Dumbledore!Bashing.

Note: I found this after reading the main post, and have not read it/do not know if it is good.

** It's good that the OP is taking the corrections so sportingly. While some of the corrections that were made were more due to personal taste or preference, some very valid corrections were pointed out. Besides the language, the prompt is amazing. I would definitely read it. Sounds fun, Dumbledore utterly destroying the competition with that smug, serene smile of his. That twinkly eyed bastard, it would be like a game to him.

Frankly, a lot of these changes seem to be your preferences. I agree with a few changes but a lot of the OP's original writing was workable.

**** "Said" is perfectly fine in /conversation/, but the instances of "said" I changed were part of other actions. At least, I was assuming that Dumbledore was stuttering, and Maxime was announcing what the paper said to the Great Hall.

I actually don't avoid, "said" all that much, but this only had two instances of the word, so there wasn't a sample size sufficient to demonstrate that I don't. If there's a more appropriate word to describe /how/ they're speaking, I'll certainly use it, however.

For example the line "How are you today, Harry?"

I probably wouldn't use "said", I'd probably use "asked"

But with the line "I'm just fine."

I might either use "answered" or "said"

#+end_quote

There's no need to add stuttered here. We know he's stuttering. The dialogue itself shows that.

Similarly, adding an exclamation mark for Madam Maxime's dialogue removes the need to say announce.

If your dialogue conveys the type of speaking, and it usually should most of the time, you don't need to use those other tags. Resorting to other words in these instances is just lazy writing. It's telling instead of showing.

Obviously there are many cases where you can't get certain things across in dialogue and need to use a different tag, but these two examples are not those cases.

**** You barely made any mistakes! The commentor has, mostly, changed your perfect English to suit their preferences. I can only see a few actual errors like lightened and lit. (Sorry I'm on mobile otherwise I'd go through it all properly).

Why I'm writing though is because one of the suggestions would make your writing incorrect. You had the phrase 'had learned' in reference to Harry researching the cup and this was 100% correct. You were told it should just be 'learned', which is wrong. Had learned is right because it happened before another past event. That past event is what's happening with the cup, since writing employs the past tense.

I know the instinct is to trust the corrections of native speakers but your level of English is good enough that if someone gives you this many corrections, it's probably personal preferences as well as actual grammar. A few changes also made your original writing less descriptive. You've got great English!

Although I know that lots of the corrections Vercalos provided were just to drive me to opt for better wording, I still think such corrections improved the quality of the text.

I don't know, perhaps it's because as a non-native speaker I am quite insecure about my English, but after comparing my version with Vercalo's I just couldn't help myself... Ugh
