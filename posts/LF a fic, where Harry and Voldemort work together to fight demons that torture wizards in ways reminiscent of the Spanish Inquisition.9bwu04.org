I've read it before and searched for it many times, I think it's on ffn because I never really use other sites.

I think dumbledore might be evil and convinces the muggle pope to summon the demons. It might be a Tom/Harry but idk. Luna and maybe Hermione join the dark side, and the dark side is generally good. Oh and every time the inquisitor demons torture someone, harry experiences it through the eyes of the victim
