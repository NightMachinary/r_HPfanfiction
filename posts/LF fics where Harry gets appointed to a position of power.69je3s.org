  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years

** I think this requirement is too broad. Thousands of fics have Harry attaining a position of power. Even in Canon, he made it to director of DMLE, which was one step from the Minister.

Maybe you want stories that have him attaining positions of power early on, instead of at the end. Then [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005), is one suitable fic for this theme. Harry became the Chief Warlock already in chapter 1.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.
