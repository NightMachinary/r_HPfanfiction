** Harry: "Sorry, goblins kind of look the same to me..."

Not Griphook: "How specist."

Harry: "Sorry again... Errrm... May your enemies die beneath a pile of your gold and diamonds?"

Not Griphook: "Well met. Why didn't you say so from the start, Mr. Gary Stu?"

Harry: "My name is Harry, not Gary..."

Not Griphook: "Come now, Gary. Director Ragnok awaits you now with your inheritance test results! Between you and me, he already appointed Knutsack to be your goblin magic trainer!"

...

Harry Potter was never seen or heard from again. He died during his first goblin trial.

** I can't remember which fic, but there was one where the goblins started taking human names to be more approachable, and one of them was named Sally. Harry was mentally debating telling them that that was a girl's name and ends up not doing it, then after he leaves Sally asks the other goblin if they think Harry noticed that she was in fact a girl.

*** That is so cool Aaron! :) Yes it is because it shows harry was WRONG all along and he just thought he was better and smarter than the goblins, but they actually were right and knew what they were doing. :)

**** You don't have to read it all to read the goblin part tbh. It's just a little self-contained crackish bit I wrote while high out of my mind.

  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Iris Potter doesn't do normal, and her fourth year at Hogwarts is evidence enough. Two new tasks. Tiny amount of femslash. Sort of complete, sort of abandoned.

  All goblins are named Griphook. Right? Harry certainly thinks so. Humorous one-shot, inspired by a reddit prompt.
