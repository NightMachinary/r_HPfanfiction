A major example is linkffn(Victoria Potter) by Taure, which is probably one of my favourite pieces of fanfiction, largely due to the whimsical feel of magic which so closely resembled canon. Any sort of magic is fine by me - I don't care if it's canon or not, as long as it's /magical/.


** Saphroneth's /Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay/ ( [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548]], linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/Harry-Is-A-Dragon-And-That-s-Okay]]) ) for sure.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** One of the things which were present in JKR books (and films), but almost no fanfic story was able to include was general feeling of imperfection of magic. Magic is great, but it kind of fails a little bit most of the time: magical transport is awesome, but all modes of it are a bit of disaster; Weasley's Burrow is kept together by magic, but it is still slightly falling apart; Hogwarts castle is magnificent but a little bit shabby (remember Snape's office in the films?); professor Flitwick can teach students about levitation charms, but he constantly falls from the heap of books; house-elves are faithful slaves, but they their own head as well, and don't let me start on the Hogwarts' library.

Victoria Potter tries to achieve the similar effort by making the magical world closer to the nature, but it just makes magic more Rousseauian, not this half-comical effort to pretend perfection where there is none.

*** The mundanely magical nature of the Burrow is honestly my favorite thing. The ramshackle and extremely lived in look gives more magic and character than anything.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.
