** I just want to say something about these Laws, mainly the first, and their general reception.\\
... went on a bit long there heh heh.

TLDR - The Laws, particularly first, don't imply that the nuts and bolts science magic is a requirement. Sanderson loves that and writes that but it is only needed if using an exploit/loophole/trick etc. of the magic for a solution/resolution of the plot then to be satisfying we need to know its limits/capabilities beforehand. Alternatively if using mysterious magic then it needs to have a cost and/or cause more problems. So the point is I think the OP is asking for magic that is explained but while that is what Sanderson does I don't think he is saying that is the 'law' when it comes to writing. Which for whatever reason I needed to get off my chest since I have seen the Laws poo-pooed when it isn't a law/guideline on how to write magic so much as simply good writing advice.

--------------

I have seen a number of times in different subs etc. where people disagree with the Laws and that magic shouldn't be so completely laid out. As well as presumably the OPs request for fics that go into depth and explore the limits and theory (and the other two laws).

However the first law itself, to me, says that both nuts and bolts science magic and numinous magic are fine. The point isn't one or the other but how that effects the plot. examples I have heard (I think from Sanderson himself in lectures) are take LotR- Gandalf uses magic to defeat the Balrog/save the party. However even though we don't understand the magic and forces at work we know the results. Yes the party lives but /Gandalf/ is lost. That is a big problem. It doesn't feel like a cheat because the solution is balanced with a (rather steep) cost.

To use the movies as an example in the Two Towers- Gandalf says hold out 3 days. Lots of stuff happens, the men of Rohan are hard pressed, the Fellowship at helms deep tested. When Gandalf comes it feels awesome. They did their job. They held out until the morning of the third day and so when the plot is 'solved' by Gandalf seemingly magically showing up it is a pay off rather than a let down. On the flip side is in RotK where PJ sets things up very similarly but the promise isn't there and the delivery then feels cheap. The Army of the Dead are anticlimatic and not only don't add to the satisfaction but IMO add some dissatisfaction.

So all this to try and make the point that I have seen missed before that you don't need to have nitty gritty magic (Sanderson loves that stuff but he isn't saying that is a must) but if your crucial plot piece is solved with magic that isn't explained, promised/hinted at etc. then it falls flat. If the magic isn't explained then solving a problem in general should probably cause a bigger problem/have a high cost. Basically don't introduce something late on (/right at climax). This isn't only for magic either as the principle can be seen if say Hagrid is introduced and takes Harry away from horrible muggles and takes him to a world of magic- works great. Hagrid being introduced in the final chamber with Quirrelmort and he shields Harry with his massive frame and innate giant magical resistance... not so satisfying. (or Hermione fixing Harrys glasses vs being introduced as a clever Ravenclaw 3/4 through PS who solves a few challenges for him). Or IMO GoF Priori Incantatem in itself is fine (brother wands foreknowledge) vs. DH wand ownership, elder wand confluence of sheer dumb convenience for our hero.

Again the point that these Laws Sanderson made weren't (I believe) made to say you have to write magic/stories like him but just good solid writing advice.

*** I don't think OP was necessarily asking for well explained magic, although they might have been, but just asking for magic that wasn't used as a cop out.

**** Could well be. But yeah /my/ guess is OP is looking for something that goes in a bit into magical theory (first law- explains/sets up), doesn't make Harry godlike/OP (second law- puts Harry in a situation where the theory/knowledge/talent of the First is made null and void... only for Harry to make clever use of said theory to get around it), and expands on something canon doesn't (most everything) ie. expecto patronum has been covered but transfiguration hasn't (Third Law- no real need for inheritance, necromantic, ancient sumerian magic when the magic we know of has barely been brushed over). Though honestly that Third Law is really the biggest and probably the hardest since you know Rowling wasn't writing with the idea of fully grounding say the economy or little things like summoning water, and duplicating food/materials, altering and creating new creatures via transfiguration etc. etc.

OP - To try and provide some help- (I can never remember specific fics well enough) I think the closest you can get in general is look at Taure and the DLP- their library (5star?). In general they will have more stories relevant to the Laws/ of the magical theory expounding and try to cultivate good stories (ie. limit Harry, and expand on how magic effects the wizarding world) I'm pretty sure Taure's story Alexandra Potter(?) goes into your interests and he has a best of doc which probably has a few leaning in your direction. Otherwise search for magical theory, particular magical subjects, or certain things like wizarding world, enconomy etc.

**** Bit of both really. Magic with a decent explanation that isn't just "Harry trained and trained and blew Voldemort away" but rather had clear boundaries that are followed.

The main problem i'm having is actually that one spell will be focused on rather than an entire topic, so Harry will learn a really obscure spell really well and use it constantly rather than wide ranging world development.

Actually the best example I can think of are his magical arms in A Black Comedy; restrictions laid out, not too powerful other than that and he never exceeds his limitations. Voldemort even finds a way to use them agains him.

*** I really want to read worm and if I could buy an actual copy I would but the serialised format bugs me. Particularly since the chapters seem short and reviews take up most of the webpage.

I'll definitely check out that trilogy though, thanks!
