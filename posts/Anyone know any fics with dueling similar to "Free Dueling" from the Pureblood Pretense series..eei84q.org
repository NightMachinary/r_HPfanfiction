** I can't think of any at the moment that fits those specific parameters, the closest thing that I'm hesitant and cringing to say is Harry Crow?

BUT if you want a GOOD story that's decently written and pretty much centered around dueling, you should checkout Hogwarts Battle School. linkffn(8379655)

An Ender's game take on HP. Using everything at your disposal to get an edge over your opponents, new take on the triwizard tournament too.

** Alex, Max, and Martin do this to an extent in the second book of the Alexandra Quick series. Not formal dueling though.
