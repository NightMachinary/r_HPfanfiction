As stated, this is a gathering of inspiration for a fic I keep typing on next to my original work. I hope I may even find some truly inspired ideas to work upon.

My basic assumption for the rest of the wizarding world is a bit like comparing post-WW2 Germany with post-WW2 USA. Magical Britain went through 2 devastating wars that not only shattered families and friendships, but also the trust of a people in their nation. Britain is healing but has inevitably lost much of their grandeur in comparison with other magical nations. I have a few scenes in which people like tourist-guides and historians lament the fact of a destroyed Diagon Alley, or the loss of so much history in the Battle of Hogwarts, much like we are disappointed and appaled when we read of fanatics destroying historical sites in Iraq, or the burning of books by the Nazis.

This may sound to some like I'm falling into the "Britain sucks, yo!" trope, but I'm confident I won't. I'm just trying to describe a country ravaged by war, which hasn't even begun to heal it's wounds. This is the challenge I set myself with this fic, to find compelling worldbuilding for many more sites and places, which includes to show some of the negative as well as the positive.

I've already started with a few places and took my inspiration for them from folklore and the HP universe.

We're starting off in Nancy, France, where Harry and Hermione begin their journey. We see the "Place Jeanne d'Arc", the magical hub of Northern France, Belgium and Luxembourg, named after the great witch Jeanne d'Arc. I tried to get very close to what we've already seen in HP canon in terms of feel. For example, the way Harry and Hermione travel there:

#+begin_quote
  “So, how are we going to find the magical side of Nancy?”

  Hermione rolled her eyes and gave him an exasperated look. “You really slept through History of Magic.” she admonished. With a exaggerated swish she rose her wand and then, as if she was showing him something secret, she held it out.

  “I don't think the Knight Bus works in...”

  “Bonsoooir!” came a drawling voice from behind him.

  Harry looked around, but couldn't see anything. His eyes fell on Hermione who grinned with mirth as she pointed downwards. Between them a little rat with a basque hat of all things stood on it's hind legs and looked up to them. If a rat could look bored, this one did.

  “Où puis-je vous porteeer?” the rat asked.

  “It's asking us where we want to go.” Hermione translated for Harry. She then bowed down to the rat and answered. “Le quartier magique de Nancy, s'il vous plaît.”

  “Très bien.” the rat drawled and held out his tail to them.

  “I think we need to grab it.” Hermione suggested and held onto the rat tail with two fingers. Harry, not knowing what else to do, followed her lead and held onto the tail.

  #+begin_quote
    ...
  #+end_quote

  “Place Jeanne d'Arc.” the rat announced and once more held out its tail for them to grab. This time they had to use both hands to find grip on the naked tail.

  The moment they held onto it, their bodies were hovered away from the rat's back and found their original dimensions again, right in front of the little platform.

  The rat stood up on its hind legs again and held out one of its small paws. “Ce serait trois d'argent, s'il vous plaît.”

  “It wants three sickles, Harry. Have you got some in your pockets?” Hermione translated for him.

My next stages will gradually lead away from a known universe to more culturally different areas of the world. I plan on including a wide spectrum of places and am currently having fun researching the term "magic" in these areas. The following is a maybe slightly rambly bisection of what I have already planned:

Magical Germany, Austria and Bohemia - The Holy Roman Empire. Having got a tip about the dwarves in the Untersberg and the mythical Lich Kings Charlemagne and Barbarossa, the Cursed Kings of the West and East, Harry and Hermione make their way to Bavaria to see the dwarven city. They soon find that you, in fact, do not travel to the magical nation of Germany, but into the political +clusterfuck+ construct that is the Holy Roman Empire, with the "Court Mage" being the ruling power of each and every little nation. They get invited to the Nymphenburg, the ambitious magic-architectural project of the Court Mage of Bavaria, who has begun serving under [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_II_of_Bavaria][King Ludwig the II]] and has sworn to realize the King's original ideas for Neuschwanstein, never to be realized due to the Statute.

Through the Court Mage they get an invitation to the Lich Kings below the mountain, for the price of something built for the castle so that the Court Mage could boast that a tower of his castle was built by Harry Potter.

Down in the belly of the Untersberg, after two days of hiking down the almost endless mines of the dwarven city, they reach the Hall and prison of the two Kings. Charlemagne and Barbarossa are chained to thrones, three stories high, made of crystal and quarz, metal and wood, gold and silver. Their bodies are but skeletons clad in finest silk, with a white and a black crown on their heads, and the light of their soul shining from their eye sockets and every crack of their bones. Hermione begins to ask them a myriad of questions, but the Liches are much more interested by the boy who had seen death and decided to come back. They talk about the war on the British Isles and the depravity of the magic of a horcrux. They tell Harry that he has power at his hands, as a man granted mercy by Death and that this power could be used to right the wrongs commited by what "Nature never intended to be". Harry asks how he could use the power and the Liches tell him that he has to convince the "Wardens of the Underworld" of his honest intentions and of the injustice of those people's fate. This stakes out the next stations of their travel, as Harry is overcome by the possibilities. The Lich Kings tell them of the 7 Wardens, Hel, Hades, Anubis Nephthys and Osiris, Ah Puch (Mayan Mythology), King Yama (Hinduism / Buddhism), Baron Samedi (Carribean / Haitian Voodoo) and Hine-nui-te-pō (Maori mythology).

These mythological entities I chose because they would lead to places I found interesting to explore. Hel would lead us to Northern Europe and Scandinavia, to the folklore of the warriors who go to Valhalla and Fólkvangr and to Durmstrang where Hermione and Harry begin their research as to how to get to Helheim to convince Hel. Hades will lead us to Southern Europe and the middle east, delving deep into a mythology that has shaped Europe at it's core and is still present in our culture. Anubis, Nephthys and Osiris almost represent the baseline of "magic", in a way, as the actual mythology of Ancient Egypt has shaped and formed so many different pantheons, and even the monotheistic religions of the world. There Harry and Hermione will delve into the Library of Alexandria, the large magical cities of Africa and find a magical culture that has "let loose", so to say, never much burdened by secrecy and so different from a magical Europe that has had close ties with it's muggle counterparts for the longest time. They end up spending a year at Tumbo la dunia, one of only two magical million-cities of the world while they figure out how to convince Osiris, the Lord of the Underworld of the righteousness of their doing.

For the other Wardens I haven't done enough research yet to see where I'd take it, or if they even stay in the story, but the regions they represent give me a lot of inspiration for worldbuilding the magical cultures there. For example, I have planned the city of Trashiyangste, the second magical million-inhabitants city in Bhutan, which builds /itself/ towards the stars, meter by meter, year for year, having by now reached heights so that on the top you can look down on the peak of Mt.Everest. Hermione is fascinated by the astronmical society there and they spend another year, figuring out how to gift King Yama starlight to illuminate the underworld. On Haiti they meet Baron Samedi and to convince him, they have to make it worth his while (which currently means in my sketch that they have to produce the best rum ever drunk and the best cigar ever smoked served by the most beautiful woman ever seen, which nicely coveres all of the Baron's interests). The last one, Hine-nui-te-pō, will be the trickiest as she is convinced that not only are all of the fallen rightfully dead, but she is also convinced that Harry too is supposed to be in her realm, as he eerily reminds her of the last one who tried something similar, the half-god Maui (and here is where I'm currently at with my research into Maori mythology. No idea how one would convince Hine-nui-te-pō to release the unjustly fallen). Ah Puch is probably the most shaky one of them, as Mayan mythology is... not well researched, it seems. I'll probably switch it over to something like Navajo culture, as these are mythologies that are still kept alive even to this day.

In the end I plan on the Wardens to plead Harry's case in front of Death himself. Unsure Death calls upon Harry to speak for himself and grants him a deal. He would ressurect all of those dead by the machinations of Voldemort, and in return Harry would gift him something much more precious. On the day the last of the unjustly fallen dies, Harry would become the eighth Warden, the Boy-Who-Lived, responsible to oversee the world and make sure that such depravity as Voldemort's could never again happen. Epilogue will have Harry plant a prophecy in the mind of a seer, spoken before a mighty wizard, conscerning a boy who will rise to defeat the evil that befalls the land (/s?).

Anyway, this became somewhat rambly and I apologize. This should also be a thread to discuss your idea and inspirations. Just for complete info: This will /not/ be a Harry/Hermione fic, I plan on having them find lovers and eventually partners throughout their journey (eg. The Veela Angelique who seduces Hermione in France).

*Anyway, this is a Discussion post, so I would love to hear your input and ideas in the comments below.*


** Fuck Nancy. If you're looking for a magical French city in the north-east, Metz and Strasbourg are better places for magic to happen. Verdun as well, come to think of it. Nancy's most interesting feature is the blur it makes when your train goes through it.

As for having the Holy Roman Empire around, well... the Hapsburgs and the Hohenzollerns still exist as public figures today, so having a group of magical cousins try to gain some semblance of order in that most epic of clusterfucks that is a series of tiny nation-states just coming out of hiding from the Soviet Union/East German intelligence arms (and you can bet that those guys would have definitely noticed a number of eleven year olds suddenly up and disappearing to go to a boarding school outside of Stasi/NKVD range without leaving the country/continent) and finding themselves slap bang in the middle of a very different Europe with little forewarning... again.

If you're toying with 18th and 19th century power structures, though, things get interesting. For one thing, Eastern Europe is a very different place if the old power structures are still in play. The Holy Roman Empire had vast holdings in Poland, its Austrian counterpart had similar ones in Hungary and the Swedes actually held a lot of power in Northern Europe, having held Finland for 700 years until 1809 as well as vast swathes of Eastern and central Europe at one time or another.

If that power structure still exists, then that means that the magical world in mainland Europe is still engulfed in what's known as the Great Game-namely the struggle for dominance and survival in the constant back-and-forth that had characterised Europe ever since the days of the Romans. If you think I am joking, consider that there was a major (and by major I mean huge) war fought in Europe every fifty years on average for almost the entire span of the written record. The current period would actually be somewhat terrifying to people just 200 years ago, as the last major war having taken place 70 years ago and the whole place finding itself unified under a central semi-governing body is likely to have been considered the equivalent of bad sci-fi by Europe's ruling class of the time.

If that is the case, however, then you can expect a lot of tension to have the Trio walk into. Like, whoa, a minor skirmish that killed as many people as Voldemort did would likely occur roughly every what, ten years? And that's exacerbated by Durmstrang's purebloods-only policy; with the Eastern European muggleborn being left under/un-educated in the late 20th century, it's not beyond the realm of possibility that there is a very large population of muggleborn that decided to turn communist in spite, which would make life very interesting indeed for the rest of society since the very thing that communism needed to work (magic, duh) was now in play.

So not the best environment to take a break in.

*** This took me a while to respond to, to be fair.

A very general response to your long comment would be that I do not think of magical history as being 100% in tune with muggle history, especially not after the Statute as there are only 2 conclusions for the absence of magicals in muggle history in the HP universe. 1, magicals haven't interacted much with the muggles before, having been almost a myth back then as well. 2, and this is what I subscribe to for this fic, after the Statute an enourmous wave of altering historical documents has occured and much of muggle history is straight up faked.

For /after/ the Statute, 1692, I assume that while mages still held power in muggle governments (the Court Mages for the HRE, for example), the muggle governments lost all power in the magical world over a short period of time, making such positions as the "Minister of Magic", or the "Court Mage" the defacto heads of government of those regions. That also means that the magicals, bound by the Statute, but also using the Statute as a good excuse to not interfere, did not necessarily influence the powerplays of post-Statute Europe, but played their own games with quite unique results that sometimes lead to almost unrecognizable political constructs, only using or helping their muggle counterparts if it benefitted themselves. I also assume that the Grindelwald Wars brought a rather rapid end to smaller conflicts and the aftermath lead to a similar yearning for peace as it did in the muggle world (also assuming that Grindelwald left mainland Europe in a similar state as Voldemort left Britain).

For the Soviets, I assume that the communist regimes are why East Europe is so incredibly blood-purist in the first place, as they had the misfortune to experience what it meant if the muggles actively go after them. Here I go for an idea I got from a few conspiracy theories in which orphans were stolen to be recruited as KGB sleeper agents. Just that I assume that eventually, wizards started "liberating" muggleborns from their parents by eliminating the parents and then stealing the muggleborns from the orphanage they're brought to. On the other side, the wizarding world completely isolated themselves from the communist regimes, going so far as to have active death- and obliviation-squads in place that went after any possible investigations.

Furthermore the Statute is only the biggest split between magical and muggle cultures, while there have been other splits in the past that I will take note of in my fic. For example, I will assume that the scandinavian mages never agreed, and fiercely defended their paganism against christianity and split themselves from their muggle brethren because of that in the 12th century. Or the mages of the middle east who have gradually left the scholary institutions shared with muggles when Islam rose in popularity.

All in all the way in which we saw mages act against muggles in keeping the Statute up, I thought that history can be played with a lot in pursue of creative worldbuilding. Quite frankly, I think if any reference is made to muggle history it will be pre-Statute (like Jeanne d'Arc) or in a way that shows you that magical and muggle cultures are quite different from each other.

Also to note is that I assume that I always thought that magicals see muggles at best as pesky nuisances, but not truly as capable enemies, /and are right in that assumption/. It's just that there is no gain in fighting them, hence any risk taken is a risk not worth it.

To end this, i'd likemto thank you for your comment. It got me thinking a lot about this project from a different angle and I think I'll have fun playing with the "what ifs" of some of the questions you posted.

The departure from Magical Britain is a breath of fresh air, as the vast majority of fanfics only really focus on Wiccan history, or druidic roots. I would certainly read this further, and I look forward to what comes up.

I only agree partially with it, remember that Britain was largely sparred effects of conflict with Grindelwald. Still, Voldemort try to either recruit or eliminate all of Britain's brightest and it has to have an effect on the nation.

But to give you some ideas regarding places you want to use. In regards to Egypt (and especially Alexandria) you should have a look at hermeticism and Papyri Graecae Magicae.

In regards to magic in India - the idea I recently got when working on worldbuilding for my own fic is that it would have spells constructed not around words, but sounds - in the vein of mantras.
