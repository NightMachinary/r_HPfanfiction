** Linkao3(honey there is no right way by sincere_lies)

Great fic. Wonderful. It's the best Harry/Cedric fic I have ever seen. I love time travel fics but the HP fandoms time travel fic are mediocre. This one is a time loop where Harry gets stuck on the day of the 3rd task.

I will never stop loving this fic

  ‘Have you tried everything?' Hermione asked insistently.‘Yes! Every time I get to the cup and Cedric doesn't take it with me I go immediately back to my bed in the morning. But all the times he is with me, he dies and after I fall asleep I return too.'‘I guess it is obvious then, isn't it?' Both Harry and Hermione turned to stare at Ron, who looked at them defensively and shrugged ‘You have to go with Diggory and make sure he survives.'Harry/Cedric - Groundhog day AU

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

Linkffn(The Chamber Strike) [a top notch crack fic]

Linkao3(Grounding Magic A-T; Letters and Shopping by NotVampireJasper)

Linkao3(ever upward by stranglerfig)

Linkao3(Amethyst) [ First work in the series linkao3(A Very Slytherin Harry by geoffaree) ]

Linkao3(Evitative)

Linkao3(The House Next Door by Des98)

ever upward and Grounding Magic both have beautiful (but different) magic, they delve into types of magic, traditions, lore, etc.

A Very Slytherin Harry and Evitative are some of the few Slytherin!Harry fics I like. In the former, Harry is in slytherin from when he's eleven; 6 works in the series are complete, the 7th one is ongoing. In Evitative, he goes to slytherin in his 5th year and learns more about wizarding festivals/celebrations/rites. it's the first work in the series Mutatum, and the 2nd work is a WIP.

The House Next Door is the first work in the series What If? and it features a toddler Harry and his mamas Minerva and Poppy. THIS IS THE CUTEST THING EVER. Fluff, fluff and more fluff.

WARNING: Evitative and A Very Slytherin Harry have slash.

These are just the ones off the top of my head.......I'm probably going to come back with more.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

Backwords with Purpose is wildly popular if you look at reviews and favorites, but i almost never see it on these things. So im mentioning it again, because its hands down my favorite fanfic ever. I know not everyone is a fan of time travel, but i think she gives it a great depth that lots of authors do not :)

  Last time Harry was lead around by his nose. Only seeing what others wanted him to, only doing what others wanted to. Everyone had their own agenda, and it eventually got them all killed. Except Harry, who couldn't die thanks to accidentally becoming the master of death in his teens. Now he's back. A new timeline, a whole new world of opportunity. He'll save the world, but not by following anyone's script for him.

  Alfred never thought that grocery shopping was incredibly thrilling -- in fact, it was more of a routine chore, something that had to be done regularly. When he finds a note addressed to him left on an empty shelf, the weekly journey to the grocery store quickly became something he looked forward to.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

** Can I recommend The Pureblood Pretense even though it was already in the top three? A lot of stories feel like altered versions of canon, but this one feels like a whole new story that just (skillfully) weaves in some canon elements.

Harry is more powerful than canon, but that is partially the result of suppressed emotions that cause her problems with controlling her magic - and it attracts unwanted attention from people like Tom Riddle. She has a loving family, and makes friends in all four houses, but has to lie to all of them except her cousin, in order to protect her identity. She's focused and motivated, enough to get her in trouble waaay over her head. And frequently her greater skill is used to explore the rich world of magic (especially Potions), so it adds to the story rather than taking over.

The author also has a great sense of deadpan humour, and blends HP smoothly with the Song of the Lioness elements.

  Long haul Remus Lupin story. Book One covers his First Year at Hogwarts and all its ups and downs. Making friends, keeping his secret, and trying to cope with being in the real world for the first time in his life.The world of Shifting Lines will eventually include Wolfstar. Mostly canon with a few exceptions.Please note there really should be a lot more tags but I dont want there to be a wall so I'm trying to keep it short. I took some of the fluffier tags. I mostly kept in the darker ones as warnings but I promise there is more than angst in this.Completed 3/3/2020!
