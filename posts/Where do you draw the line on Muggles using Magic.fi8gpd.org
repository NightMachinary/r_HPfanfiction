So the line between what magical things a muggle can and can't do is very blurry in canon. Some authors write with an all or nothing mindset, others have rules about what a muggle can and can't do, and others just don't bother with it? Just magical things do you think muggles should be capable of doing if they had the opportunity?

Taking a portkey? Side Along Apparation? Taking the floo? Using a broom? Using generic magical artifacts? Brewing a potion? (should the magic be in the brewer or the ingredients?) Taking potions?

Between all the fics I've read I've seen each of these both explicitly allowed and denied as being something that a muggle can do while still being a muggle with no magic that could never use a wand or cast a spell.

Personally I think that it's entirely dependent on the tone of the fic, and that it's fairly easy to justify one way or another depending on your goals.

What do you think though? How do you like to see these things (or any others you have seen) handled?


** I mean, Muggles can canonically use magical objects, just not very well. Wands react badly, portkeys need to be kept safe, Arthur has plenty of stories about how muggles activated and were affected by magical items.

Not sure about the rest of it - I'll leave those answers to someone better versed in the fandom than I - but muggles can definitely use magical objects - keeping them away from them would be pretty pointless otherwise. :)

*** Yeah, that's really the whole point of Arthur's job. I've read a lot of fics where potions are poisonous to Muggles, or brooms are just brooms to them. Obviously these are AU fics because of canon, I just wonder why people like things to go the way they prefer

**** Ah, okay. Hmm, then. Well, I'd say that Muggles could use everything Magical, only it's a Dark Sun sort of scenario where the magic is pulled from the world around the Muggle instead of the immaterial battery/conduit inside a Rowling-Magical person. Too many Muggles use too many Rowling-Magical things and the planet starts to die. The Unspeakables found that out centuries ago and were so terrified of the thought they started their Binding Curse that makes them unable to talk about any of their work so they can keep that secret safe. And they're quite willing to kill to keep it secret too.

That'd be fun. :)

** Muggles would definitely be able to be brought by Side-Along Apparition or Portkey and the magic, IMO, is in the reaction between fire and Floo powder, not necessarily the one who tosses it in the fire. Muggles cannot brew potion because you need to cast spells for most potions and potion-brewing in general is like a sacrificial magic ritual; the time and effort put into the potion being the sacrificial offrande and the ingredients and spells the magical aspect. I must make it clear that Potions are fundamentally not cooking despite appearances. Potions would most assuredly work on them. As shown by the books they can't perform magic but can be affected by it. A top of the market racing broom would be of no use for a Muggle except for sweeping the floor. Lastly, for Magical objects it depends. They can very well be affected by a biting teacup, but they can't activate a pensieve. I wouldn't even know if they could use a pensieve though their memories could be extracted from them. I also like White Squirrel's view that Occlumency isn't really magic but a mental discipline and that Muggles can practice it, either directly by being trained by a wizard like a monarch with their court magician or indirectly like a Buddhist monk who spent their life clearing their minds and trying to reach Enlightenment.

** I'm not sure about anything else, but we do know that potions work on them in Canon because one of the twins gives Dudley a tonne-tongue-toffee in Goblet.

Personally, I draw the line at the Creator's intent. Portkey or Flo powder should work on anyone, but wands, brooms, moving pictures and other magical items were intended just for wizards (in my mind) and therefore would react differently when a muggle interacts with them. I don't know if my concept has any logical follow-through, but it is how my brain works...

** Muggles can use any plug-and-play objects that do not require the user actually do anything magical themselves. Activate portkeys, drink potions, fly a broom, etc.

They cannot do anything that would require magical work from the user. They can't create potions, they can't use runes, nothing like that.

** My head cannon is that muggles using magic items depends on what the item is. Basically i think items they use have to be "always on" and able to self control.

So a sponge enchanted to clean anything it it placed on, a muggle could use, BUT if it's enchanted to clean something when "turned on" with a spell, then they can't.

Basically the item has to be always on and controlled by outside factors not spells.

Potions i can see going either way, but i think some would be impossible for muggles even if they could do some potions. (Some potions require spells). I like either take, that muggles can't because magic is put into the potion by the brewer by the act of brewing, or that the magic comes from the ingredients.

** Stuff that is imbued with magic is easily usable for muggles. Stuff that needs magic to use, like a wand or specific potions, can't be used by muggles.

** is there a fic with muggles using magic artifacts, desperately trying to retain their knowledge of magic, running from obliviators, fighting amongst themselves for different types of artifacts? maybe a bored/dark wizard/witch, gave them to muggles making a game out of it and whoever lives at the end would win a 'prize'

** Muggles can canonically use potions. It's how Linfred of Stinchcombe made his fortune, by helping his Muggle neighbours with their ailments.

Wands don't react well. Portkeys and Apparation /should/ work. I don't know if brooms will. Potions canonically can't, they need a 'magical component'.
