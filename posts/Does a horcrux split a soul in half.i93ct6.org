Then Voldy at the end only had 0.78125% of his soul.

| Soul Part          | Soul %   |
|--------------------+----------|
| Tom Riddle (whole) | 100%     |
| Diary              | 50%      |
| Ring               | 25%      |
| Locket             | 12.5%    |
| Cup                | 6.25%    |
| Diadem             | 3.125%   |
| Harry              | 1.5625%  |
| Nagini             | 0.78125% |

Might explain why Riddle's soul in diary was able to interact physically.


** I don't see souls as a piece of cake you just take chunks out of. I've always imaging that if you took a piece, then the rest of the soul would expand to fill it (like a gas). Nothing to say the soul doesn't regenerate over time either, though if you apply Dresden-esque logic, then it would probably be pretty slow for voldemort.

*** It's stated in the stories that it only regenerates only once you show regret. My headcanon is actually that once you split the soul, you basically have some sort of wound, kind of like chopping up a limb or a chunk of yourself. That's why creating a horcrux is considered a painful process and, in my mind, it's a wound that unlike flesh never heals so you just live with the constant pain. That's what usually drives people insane and not necessarily some magical effects.

** You are hardly the first to make that calculation. As amusing as it is, though, it's probably not how it works. Remember Voldemort /started out/ with the intent of creating six Horcruxes, splitting his soul into seven parts, because he believed the number seven was magically stable. In that light, if you /must/ bring actual fractions into it, I'd reckon he carefully cut one-seventh of his soul at a time so things would be equally balanced. (Then, presumably, the Prime Voldemort post-1981 has somewhat /less/ than a seventh of a soul, because part of it was ripped from him and went into the Scar.)

All that being said, the more likely option is still that "splitting" the soul is a somewhat metaphorical phrase, and that souls aren't quite so physically-defined that you can "quantify" them with hard numbers. Perhaps, also, a soul is able to regenerate itself when split, starfish-like.

In any event, the Diary appears to gain physical reality by absorbing /Ginny/'s soul to complete its own existence, so I don't think the amount of soul he started out with really matters.

**** I mean, it's all shrouded in ambiguity and metaphor when Riddle explains it, but he does at one point say that her writing in the diary consisted of her "literally pouring her soul" into him, and I see no reason not to take him at his word. It's not entirely clear there'd be a meaningful distinction between "soul" and "life-force" in the /Harry Potter/ universe, anyway --- Dementors are soul-eaters, but being around them has the sort of effects you might describe as draining your life-force. I think it's all rather potato-potahto.

** There's no canon evidence. Slughorn uses the words: part, portion, pieces. Dumbledore did say “tear his soul in two” which is probably where the idea comes from

Also remember that Dumbledore said his fragmented soul did not affect Voldemort's mind or magic in any way. So his craziness is not because he split his soul

  “Yes, I think so,” said Dumbledore. “Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.” DH ch23

Being intelligent and crazy are not mutually exclusive. At the start, he was this suave teenager who could talk a ghost into giving up her most guarded secret and treasure (Diadem of Ravenclaw) or knowledge about horcruxes from a teacher. What faces Harry is this bipolar asylum escapee who constantly gets in his own way by acting like a Bond Villain.

When you get kissed by a dementor, you effectively become a vegetable. So it's natural that when you start shaving off hunks of your soul (so much that it becomes unstable to the point that fragments are made without your knowledge or consent) that it effects your mental /state/.

And canon reflects this as he has these periods where he is remarkably sane, and fully funtioning. And then Potter is mentioned or shows up and Voldemort is suddenly insane.

**** I have a different interpretation, since I think that Dumbledore would have said something if he noticed how different Voldemort had become.

I interpreted it as his craziness being an inherent part of him. He spent years as a spirit and was unable to kill a child multiple times. For somebody as arrogant as him, that must have been a hard blow. Harry was that annoying kid that triggers the worst of his anger

Remember that Voldemort was always a showman. His convoluted plot in GoF is an example of that

Like you said, being intelligent and crazy are not mutually exclusive. I think that even without Horcruxes, Voldemort might have still been a bit of a Bond villain.

I really wish we could see more of Voldemort as the suave schemer than the crazy villain. It's my favorite trope in fanfiction honestly

** I don't remember being specified in the books the quantity of soul that goes into the Horcrux. In my mind it was always the idea that murder makes it "brittle" and you can easily tear up a chunk of it to place it in a container. But I guess your assessment could coincide with what JK was thinking because it's heavily implied that Voldemort had kind of reached the limits of splitting his soul.
