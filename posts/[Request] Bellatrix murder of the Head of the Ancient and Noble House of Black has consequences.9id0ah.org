** You could say that canon sort of covers this - Bellatrix, LV's last and most terrible lieutenant, was taken down by a /housewife/, of all things. Before that, she was fighting three school girls, and couldn't take down even one of them.

**** You mean, don't underestimate JKR's ability to write BS. MW's "duelling skills" are not shown anywhere in canon. Her brothers were said to have fought like heroes, but that's it.

The sacrificial protection thing is also BS - HP even sees a mother try and shield her children from Voldemort in a vision in Book 7. Guess what, no blood protection for that NPC! Besides, even if the great blood protection is something that's reserved for Lily and Harry, it affects Voldemort and those he tries to kill. The defenders of the school would be protected from Voldemort alone. Bellatrix and the other fighters wouldn't be affected by it.

But then, it is a children's book series. Good must triumph over evil and all that shit.

So? We've never been told that she /wasn't/ a good duelist, either. It was a twist, not a mistake.

Rowling has explained that the point is self-sacrifice. Not just dying for those you love, but /choosing/ to do in a situation where you had a very clear choice not to. Lily was offered a chance to live if she let Voldemort kill Harry, Harry had a choice whether to come out into the open and let Voldemort kill him. The mother in the vision would have died anyway.

No, actually, I do believe you're wrong there. The blood-protection on the Potter house kept out all agents of Voldemort, Death Eaters included; so this sacrifice might have too.

I've talked about this elsewhere on this subreddit, but the people I discussed it with were either selectively blind or complete blockheads, but the sacrificial protection thing is a shit mechanic as it works and doesn't work depending on whether JKR remembers about it when she writes. If the blood protection works against Death Eaters, then Crouch, Pettigrew, Greyback, Umbridge, the other Snatchers are all unaffected by it in spite wanting to kill or harm HP at various points in the series. It works against Quirrel, but that's it - even there, it's just wonky, as Voldemort himself is unaffected to a degree that he can escape in spite of Dumbledore rushing to find and capture him.

******* Oi, I'm not saying it's the best-designed magic ever. Just that it's perfectly possible for it to make internal sense.

The various Death Eaters and Snatchers may have meant to kill Harry but none of them landed a lethal blow; and in the Battle of Hogwarts, we see that Voldemort was still able to land curses spells and have them take a temporary effect, they just broke easily, with the Killing Curse being the only thing that flat-out didn't work.

I don't recall Crouch ever trying to kill Harry at all --- he just took a bit of blood, certainly not enough to do him any lasting harm on its own.

Umbridge was /not a Death Eater/, even if she unwittingly furthered their agenda through her own evil deeds.

As for Voldemort escaping at the end of /Philosopher's Stone/, Voldemort at that point was a mere shade (so there was no body to be blistered), and he probably couldn't do any magic aside from possessing people (so there were no curses to be neutered). I don't really see what you think /should/ have happened.

A random thought: does the timeline work out for Delphini to have partially been conceived in an effort by Bellatrix to produce a new Black heir?

****** Well, Voldemort and Bellatrix were never married, and it's unclear whether Voldemort recognized the child publically (even if only to his Death Eaters). If neither is true, then the kid /wouldn't/ legally have anything to do with Voldemort's family.
