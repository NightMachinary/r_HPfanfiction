So, I've recently started watching the television show /Supernatural/ and I've been greatly enjoying it. I'm near the end of Season 1,

A few months ago, I saw a HP/Supernatural fic where Harry was raised by the Winchesters recommended on here a few times. I've searched through the subreddit but I can't seem to find it. Can anyone here help me?

Thanks in advance,

** I think there are a few, but the only one that comes to mind is this one. I'm not sure if it's been recommended or not (I don't check this subreddit a lot). linkffn(9098123)

  When the Potter family was attacked, the Wizarding World mourned their death and celebrated the defeat of the Dark Lord for weeks to come. But people would be left puzzling over the disappearance of the youngest Potter for years. It's too bad nobody thought to include the Winchesters into their equations.
