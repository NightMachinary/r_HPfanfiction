** I would say good prose, engaging writing style preferably with a light hearted tone and some humour. I tend to find that I can pick up new meanings and lines with each reread so even knowing the plot doesn't stop the fic from being enjoyable. Fics like linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) and linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom)

** I'm often read again a few fics by LaurieLove, mostly her Lucius/Hermione one shots. They're mostly smut but I love the way she writes those characters together. There's passion, and romance, and it's also sometimes funny. She has a way to create one shots that kinda make sense, when I read others that seemed really forced. It isn't easy to put those two characters together, but she does it very well IMO.

The other fic I read almost monthly is linkffn(The Scientist) (or maybe linkao3(The Scientist) ?). HG/LV, non magic AU. It's wonderfully written and The story is great. I prefer slow romance development in multi chapters fics, this one is perfect for that. There aren't many good non Mac fox AU fics, but I love to find a good one so...
