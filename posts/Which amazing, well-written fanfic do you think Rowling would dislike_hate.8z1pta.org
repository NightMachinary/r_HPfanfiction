** Anything with smut in it. The only time JKR has interfered in fanfiction was to shut down RestrictedSection.Org (they were later permitted to return with an age-gate).

** I'm on an Annerb kick right now, so I wonder if Rowling would like the idea of a Slytherin-Ginny. Perhaps not, considering how vilified Slytherin house was in canon but I think Annerb's fanon is a great version of Ginny. Certainly more interesting than in canon.

*** I kind disagree. Giving Draco a redemption arc already shows a change of attitude in JKR. I think she would love Annerb's Slytherin Ginny series.

I think she will despise powerwanking Indy!Harry harem fics, regardless how good the writing is technically. Similarly, she will hate fics that actually support the Death Eater ideology.

***** Nope, long before CC came out, JKR said repeatedly that Draco had changed (a lot due to his wife Astoria) and were on reasonable terms with the Potters by the time of Epilogue.

Even the Epilogue itself shows Draco nodding at them.

***** Yes.

I mean, it's sort of hard to buy, but it's there.

** A Black Comedy linkffn(A Black Comedy): it has a lot of the tropes of the fandom, but they are done so well it makes you realize how stupid a lot of Harry Potter actually can be.

** Well-written is really subjective.

I dont like most of the top-rated fanfictions.

Rowling probably would enjoy smaller fanfictions that dont aim too high and were written by chance. You know, original stuff that brings a smile to ones face. Not the 1000 copies of the same concept over and over again and again and again. +Pure+ Poor Harry's been abused so many times and has been a Lord in thousands of stories.So yeah. She would enjoy small and creative stuff and not the common-overrated tropes.

** Probably any of the amazing HG/LM or HG/SS fics that have found their way into my heart. She, and the actors who played them, would probably be disgusted but I love them.
