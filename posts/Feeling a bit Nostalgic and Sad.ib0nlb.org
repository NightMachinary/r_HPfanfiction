Hi all,

Last night I had an amazing dream that a new HP book had come out amd everyone was swarming the book stores to get a book. I was so excited, and I already new parts of the plot, and it seemed really exciting... and then I woke up.

God I miss those days with all the anticipation and hype. I wish there were new books coming out.


** You're still in the dream. It's a nightmare though. Cursed Child is real.
