** *** History
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: history
    :END:
Fanfiction in the Harry Potter Universe has existed since shortly after the Chamber of Secrets book was released, but exploded in popularity between July 2000 and June 2003. This period known as the Three Year Summer started with the release of Goblet of Fire and ended with the release of Order of the Phoenix and is the longest break between books. The release of the first film in November 2001 and the second a year later also contributed to the boom.

By and large the fandom has been generally organized by pairing rather than plot. Most stories are written with the intent of getting two (or more) characters together. This is known as “shipping”, a term broken off of “relationship”. The shipping wars, though tongue-in-cheek, shaped the fandom from its inception.

In the first decade, there were untold dozens of sites, including many yahoo groups, subforums, geocities, early social media sites such as tumblr, mailing lists, and usenet groups. Almost every single one was started as a repository for a specific pairing, such as Harry/Hermione on [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/fanfiction][Portkey]], Draco/Ginny on [[http://www.dracoandginny.com/][Fire and Ice]], Remus/Sirius on [[http://www.wolfandhound.com/storyline/][Wolf and Hound]], and Harry/Draco on [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/][Hex Files]]. Being largely decentralized, it is impossible to count the number of fics that were created during this period.

While fanfiction did see another boom in 2007 and again in 2010, the release of the final book and movie respectively, it has generally lacked sustainable growth and as such many sites have closed their doors, and their users migrated to larger sites, if they migrated at all.

At least 80 of the 180 sites listed on [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_Archives][Fanlore]] are completely gone from the internet and many more have lost databases or been scrubbed by admins. At least one, the once booming Sugar Quill, has closed submissions but remain open for viewing. Today there are less than a dozen sites that receive regular submissions. Here are some of the most recommended sites:

- Fanfiction.net: FFNet: While the absentee admins are generally disliked, and many parts of the site have been in dire need of overhauls for at least a decade, it is the standard site for submissions at over 702,000.
- ArchiveOfOurOwn: AO3 is run by a nonprofit that is attempting to centralize legal defense of fanfiction and its authors. HP content is mosly smut and slash. The site is actively trying to create backups of other failing sites. ~89,000 submissions
- HarryPotterFanfiction: Ran “The Dobbys” fanfiction awards from 2007-2013. ~83,000 submissions
- HP.Adult-Fanfiction.org: Started in 2002 when FFNet removed NC-17 fics. ~21,000 submissions
- Ficwad: FFNet competitor. ~1900 submissions
- Wattpad: FFNet competitor. Pain in the ass to use and impossible to search. ~10-50k stories
- HPFanficArchive: HPFFA is small and generally adult-oriented. ~1200 submissions\\
- FanficAuthors: Has some of the most popular authors' works, and members are invite only. <500 submissions\\

As is probably obvious, FFNet has always been a fixture in the HPFF community. Despite a number of competitors and off-shoots, it is still the largest and most active site both in reviews and submissions. As such, it is this writer's recommendation that new authors primarily stick to FFNet where stories receive the most possible attention and where it is convenient for readers. While it is sad to see further decimation of the fandom's many sites, in the end it benefits the audience most.

*** *** Cliches and Tropes
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: cliches-and-tropes
    :END:
Before I send you out into the wonderful world of fanfiction, you need at least some tools to sift through the junk fast enough to not become disenchanted. Too many people come in here looking for some good entertainment, read one or two recs, and go out on their own without knowing what to avoid, and end up finding the worst of the worst. Just like that not only do they not come back, but they often are left with such a bad impression that they discourage others from discovering fanfiction. Nobody will deny that there is bad fanfiction, but some of the good stuff is so good that it is worth all the effort. That's not to say every fic that uses those cliches is bad, just most of them.

The influence of those former shipping sites can still be seen in the fics on the major archives. Cliches, tropes, memes, and even some characters (ex: Amelia Bones is a fan creation in all but name and title, while Connie Hammer, who pops up in fics by several dozen authors, is completely fan created) are still recycled from story to story. There's at one decently praised author who was born just 18 days before the release of the first chapter of After the End, one of the most influential early stories, written by Sugar Quill mods Arabella and Zsenya. She hadn't even read the story until just recently, more than a year after reading and writing fics, yet traces of that story's ideas are still visible in her fics. (Out of respect for her privacy and age, I won't be naming her.)

As you read fanfiction you'll become very familiar with a couple cliches that reappear constantly. Most of these come from two things: the tone shift between the first half of the series and the last half, and pity. The dissonance between Harry Potter as a children's story and Harry Potter as a young adult novel causes many, many authors to conclude that those on the “good” side, such as the Weasleys and Dumbledore, must have been evil, and that they intentionally caused Harry strife. These authors tend to pity poor Harry.

#+begin_quote
  He's a good kid and he deserves better. You know what he needs? A boatload of money, all the magical devices and books he could ever buy, the most expensive shrinkable trunk, complete with hidden apartments, and why not have the Goblins give him lists of stolen abilities which read like the wiki page as well enough evidence to get the good side's own grandmother to incarcerate them. That should do it!.
#+end_quote

And then there's no good plot left because [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue][Gary Stu (tvtrope)]] just won everything without lifting a finger.

There are other characters that get the pity treatment as well, such as Draco and Snape, who are made out to be sad and lonely instead of twisted murderers. Both situations are trope namers: [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater][Ron the Death Eater]], and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][Draco in Leather Pants]].

As you become more familiar with fanfiction, you'll find more and more of these types of situations. These cliches are often used as a lower limit of what makes a fic generally unentertaining because they tend to eliminate any and all challenges to the protagonist without any effort, or create challenges that are completely illogical. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanon/HarryPotter][This TVTropes fanon page]] has a small list of the most used fanon misconceptions that appear in Harry Potter fanfiction. While it's not really a comprehensive list of cliches and themes that tend to resurface frequently, it has fairly good explanations of the ones it does have. Thanks to /u/Lane_Anasazi for the suggestion.

As they are usually frontloaded to the first three chapters, they show a lack of creativity that will almost definitely be continued through the rest of the story. For most readers, especially those of us who have been around a while, it's just boring. For you, as a new reader, you might not find it to be as bothersome, but as you read more you'll be able to recognize these things, and I find it's best to be straightforward and point out they exist instead of pretending every single story is unique and worth reading.

**** *** Getting Started
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: getting-started
    :END:
Acronyms and descriptive terms that you may not know appear just about everywhere in fanfiction, especially in the character limited summaries of FFNet. Though it is ugly as hell, [[http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/moonbeam/terms.html][this site]] provides a pretty thorough list of terms, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/44309/112420890/Fanfiction-Terminology-Dictionary][this forum post]] includes a few more Harry Potter specific terms. As mentioned before, shipping is pretty important to the fandom, so in addition to initials, ship names and portmanteaus are used regularly to denote pairings. [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_Pairing_Names][Fanlore has the most complete list]]. The ship names with HMS/SS designation are almost never used anymore except facetiously, but shortenings such as Harmony (HP/HG), Drarry (HP/DM), and Wolfstar (RL/SB) are used regularly.

In order to properly set yourself up for a successful reading experience, you should start by making an account on Fanfiction.net. All you need is a unique email and username. I've used the site for years and have never had a problem with spam, so don't be worried about that. The three main features that FFNet offers users are Follows, Favorites, and Reviews. All three are accessed from any individual story's page, [[https://gyazo.com/6876c67f55725e07300e270fc968f596.jpg][as seen here (img)]]. Following a story sends you an email every time the story updates. Even with 150+ follows, [[https://gyazo.com/f5f718826c9375b331eadc336962e006.gif][I get less than 4 emails a day (gif)]] which I tag and store for later reading.

Your favorites list appears in your profile. To view any profile, you can use the tilde (~) link, fanfiction.net/~username or the uuid (unique user identifier) link, fanfiction.net/u/uuid/ to get there however the tilde links do not work from the mobile subdomain ([[https://gyazo.com/d09abaccddf297aff1a15c3a1dd76a94.jpg][example (img)]]). Additionally it strips the link down to alphanumeric characters without spaces: Rorschach's Blot becomes fanfiction.net/~rorschachsblot.

The Harry Potter section on FFNet is located at [[http://fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/]] . That page shows all of the HP stories on the site but you have to change the filter to Rating: All as Mature stories are filtered out by default. If you want an upgraded search engine of the same database, a HP Fanfiction fan forum called DarkLordPotter maintains the [[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net][Scryer]]. Using the Scryer you can search for or exclude terms in the title and summary, exclude an unlimited number of characters, and filter by word and chapter count. It is useful when searching for specific stories as well as for browsing new stories by advanced users with specific taste.

Direct links to the other archives are: 1. [[http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter%20-%20J*d*%20K*d*%20Rowling/works][AO3]], 2. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/storysearch.php][HPFanfiction]], 3. [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/index.php][HP Adult Fanfiction]], 4. [[http://ficwad.com/category/19][Ficwad]], 5. [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/][HPFFA]], 6. [[http://www.fanficauthors.net/][FanficAuthors]]

It is a good idea to keep a personal file in addition to your ffnet profile for links to stories you've enjoyed, as it is very possible you will find favorite stories across each of the sites.. Google docs is good for this, as is a simple notepad file or browser bookmarks. Some readers also list summaries, add tags, and list major characters and plots to help them search through and find fics later. Since downloading fics from several of the sites, especially FFNet, is really simple, some readers use ereader programs such as Calibre to track them. Since none of the sites have a way to mark fics you've read or know not to read, this method can help with that too.

*Reviewing Etiquette*

Reviewing is fairly straightforward. it allows you to communicate with the author, but it is necessary to discuss some etiquette. Never ever post anything along the lines of "please update more/faster". It doesn't help anything. Also don't be a dick. It's pretty simple. If something makes you angry and want to yell at the author, just close the tab. There's no reason to put that negativity out there. If the person is breaking rules, just use the report button. The ffnet admins almost never respond to reports directly but usually take care of them within a week. Other sites may or may not be better about responding and taking care of issues.

If you want to typo or grammar bust, be polite about it, including asking the author if they mind if you do so. Most of the time if they do mind, they will have said so in an authors note somewhere, so definitely don't just skip those. If you want to make suggestions (on in-progress stories only), again be polite about it. Telling the author to do something will just annoy them. If you want to offer praise, that's fine, but under 10 word reviews such as "I liked this" are generally frowned upon. If you want to review, take an extra minute to tell them what you liked and why.

***** *** Recommendations and how to find the best fics
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: recommendations-and-how-to-find-the-best-fics
    :END:
When I talk about "Best stories" here, it is very subjective and your milage may vary. A lot. For example, the top 25 most reviewed stories page is riddled with poorly planned and/or cliched plots, bad grammar and spelling, overly proselytizing authors (both religious and non), ships that tend to be divisive, abandoned fics, and author misconduct. Despite that, most are worth reading if only to get acquainted with the fandom. After all, they are the most viewed stories and therefore by default have great influence over readers and both authors who wish to imitate or emulate, and those who wish to completely reject their style and ideas. Some of the stories are even /good/.

I would recommend reading every story on both the 25 most reviewed list and the 25 most favorited list (they share only 10 fics at the moment) after checking out the curated lists below though. In order to find these lists, just set the filter to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=3&r=10][sort by reviews]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10][sort by favorites]].

This subreddit is a good place for both general recs and themed/pairing recs. Some links to get you started are the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3f97u2/the_most_popular_fanfics_of_all_time_in/cz8rk2c][Most Recommended Stories thread]] and the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3hsfw0/general_recommendations_thread/][General Recommendation thread]]. If you use the search bar, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=best&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all][you can look for terms like "best"]] and come up with threads like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3ofzz6/best_fic_ever_read/?ref=search_posts][this one]] which have lots of discussion and suggestions. A topic I always like to comment on is sad stories, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3zqz17/your_favorite_emotionalheartwrenching_fics/][such as this thread]].

On FFNet, there are what is known as C2s or Community Collections which are favorites lists that are curated by multiple users and generally arranged by theme. You can see all of the C2s at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/communities/book/Harry-Potter/][this link]]. The most used C2 is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/][DLP (DarkLordPotter) 5 Star and Featured Authors]]

In addition to the main search pages, other authors' and readers' favorites fics and authors pages are a good place to look for more recs. Just click on an author's name and then [[https://gyazo.com/efc08921d79cf905c43a9b605e9a05be.gif][click the favorites tab on their page (gif)]]. Pro tip: make use of the hide bio button in the top center of the screen to make the screen much cleaner. This is basically the only way to find old complete fics from 2002-2005. Many still hold up very well and they're part of the history of this fandom.

To get you started on that front, I've included a list of a few authors who hang around this sub (or used to around the time that I wrote this), as well as a few other authors. You should check out the fics they've written in addition to the fics they've favorited.

One particularly interesting way to explore fics is to look at the various one-shot and idea collection the exist out there. These are fics that usually last a single chapter between 1k and 10k words. Some are as small as a single scene and others are complete but trimmed stories. While this link is over a year old, it's still relevant and a good jumping off point, and I still use it occasionally. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2qytzh/more_drabbles_ficlets_idea_files_plot_bunnies_and/][Link to my old reddit post]].

*What to search for*

When looking for new stories on your own, there are four things to really keep in mind.

First is the summary: if there are spelling/grammar errors or it's really incoherent, the rest of the story will be worse.

Next is the wordcount: between 2k and 5k per chapter is generally the best possible range. Lower and it feels rushed, higher and it feels too dense. Your preferences may vary.

Then consider the status: is it complete or not, and is there a note in the summary saying it's abandoned, on hiatus, has a sequel, etc. Obviously completed stories takes away the possibility of them never being finished but following a story is cool too.

Lastly there's the update date. If it's incomplete but recently updated, that's good to know and bodes well for the completion of the story, and if it's complete but updated years ago, you know you should give it an extra bit of leeway as it may have been before some of the books came out or before some plot points and cliches became overdone and lame.

Once you've gotten this far, you know just about everything you need for reading fanfiction. If you want to leave this thread here and go exploring now, you'd be just about as prepared as I can get you, and I wish you good luck. The following sections are mostly to just get you acquainted with the fandom as a whole rather than specific stories.

*** Extra reading
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: extra-reading
    :END:
One of the main issues you might see pop up in authors notes and reviews is the difference between canon, fanon, and headcanon. They are fairly clear cut, but some people tend to confuse the latter two with the first.

Canon means the contents of the original work, as well as occasionally [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod][Word of God (trope)]] such as tweets, and additional works such as Pottermore. The [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/][Lexicon]] and the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page][Wiki]] both have all of canon pretty much covered.

Fanon is ideas and thoughts about canon that weren't explicitly stated in the books that are generally accepted by a large portion of the fandom. The most used example is Charlus and Dorea Potter, who were seen on the Black Family Tapestry, being James Potter's parents and therefore Harry's grandparents. Though that has recently been explicitly disproved by Pottermore, it is present in so many fics and so completely accepted that its part of the fanon. Additional bits of fanon are listed in the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanon/HarryPotter][tvtropes page]] I linked above.

Headcanon on the other hand is a single person's fanon. This can range from simple things like the color of Petunia's flowers all the way to the function of magic in the universe. The latter would be [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/][Taure's headcanon document]] where he discusses his ideas and beliefs on the fundamentals of magic. Headcanon most often has to do with character descriptions and especially sexuality, most of which is based on the person's feelings and opinions instead of descriptions in canon.

I mentioned above that the audience age gap between the early books and the final books caused a lot of people to question the motives of the characters. One such user, ARedHair, has written up a rather exhaustive list of these issues as well as plot holes and gaffes. Among other things it serves as a list of almost every plot point that authors like to change and exploit in their stories. While the tone and format can be off-putting for some users, I personally find it interesting and useful. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Earedhair][Here's a link]].

Another project that is probably considered headcanon, even though it uses mostly evidence from the books and JKR's comments, is a very detailed map of Hogwarts and the grounds that was made by Whitehound and is maintained on his [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/map_of_Hogwarts.htm][website]]. It is an incredible tool for authors who want to keep their setting accurate across stories. He also has several other essays which are interesting reads. Thanks to /u/Taure for the suggestion.

If you're new to reddit in general, you definitely want to download [[http://redditenhancementsuite.com/][Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES)]], learn [[https://gyazo.com/88e7c518b60ac300fa76939a22a82ef8.gif][how to flair posts (gif)]], learn [[https://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/cw70q/reddit_comment_formatting][how to format posts]], and get acquainted with our mods: /u/denarii (the boss), /u/tusing (the bot creator), and /u/kemistreekat (the friendly one). (Just smile and wave, don't get too close they might bite, yes even Kat.)

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3d40r7/guide_so_you_wish_you_had_more_harry_potter_the/][Our mod /u/tusing created a guide]] several months ago that I secretly hope to have blown completely out of the water but contains some additional thoughts and opinions that aren't all bad (I'm totally kidding by the way, tusing is great as is the post and the discussion within).

The sidebar has a bit of the information I posted above, but one thing you should make note of especially is the [[https://github.com/tusing/reddit-ffn-bot/wiki/Usage][subreddit's linker bot]], created by /u/tusing and some others. It has greatly streamlined recommendations on this sub and has made everything a bit easier and more enjoyable. One of the tools included in the bot is downloading stories from ffnet to ereader files. That's done with this site: [[http://www.p0ody-files.com/ff_to_ebook/download.php?id=]] where the id is found [[https://gyazo.com/88849c936a5cbbab70d4e154c8fc7012.gif][like this (gif)]].

*Finding a story with [[/r/hpfanfiction]]*

While reddit's search bar sucks in general, for shorter searches you should have some luck with it. Things like “Time travel”, “Sad”, and “Draco” tend to have good results. If you can't find a story and want to submit a “looking for” or “LF” request, to best help the people responding to you, try to include as many details as you can think of:

- Site it was posted on
- When you read it
- Completion status (abandoned, in progress, complete, sequel/prequel)
- Approximate length in chapters and/or words
- Main characters and OC names, if any
- Setting\\
- Genre/theme
- Cliches used
- as many scenes that stick out to you as possible

Most of the replies are someone knowing exactly what story you're talking about already or some exceptional Google-fu hitting the result on the first page. The latter basically comes down to jamming enough keywords into the search to trick Google into giving you what you want. Localization and your search/page history is a factor in this though, so your mileage may vary here as well. Luckily, Google has a search option that removes personalization (pws=0) so we can test results. An example being if I remember a story that had Nicolas Flamel and Draco had a tattoo, those terms come back with the exact stories in [[https://www.google.com/webhp?pws=0&gws_rd=ssl#pws=0&q=harry+potter+fanfiction+nicolas+flamel+draco+tattoo][results 2 and 3]] . Fairly easy right?

******** *** Addendum / Thoughts

After talking about all the lost sites and fics I generally have to pause here a moment as I'm reminded that just a few months ago that another two sites fell, TrioFic, and TheQuidditchPitch. A lovely woman named Triisha who went by the penname Simons_Flower among others, was a mother, a wife, a friend, one of the most prolific authors of trio fics, and cofounder of TQP. She passed away suddenly in 2009 at just 37 years old. In the last few years we've lost other amazing authors such as Broomstick Flyer and MSgt Silver Dollar, and now Bobmin too is dying of cancer. Among the other untold hundreds of abandoned stories and accounts, there are surely quite a few others what passed away suddenly and without any way for us to know and memorialize.

On the one hand, it's sad that they're gone and their work will never be finished, but on the other, how amazing is it that those ideas can get out there at all? In the past, if a creator passed away before completing their work, more often than not it's lost to the sands of time but with fanfiction and other online media, you don't have to wait until it's done. You can upload and keep records and open it up for the world to see. It might not be a life changing legacy to be written about in history books but surely entertaining even one person makes it all worth it. I know I believe that.

******* On the topic of headcanon, I feel like this extended and absurdly detailed analysis (with drawings!) of everything about Hogwarts and Hogsmeade geography and layout has to be mentioned:
