Now, don't dismiss this theory just yet.

I have evidence.

#+begin_quote
  Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign ... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever.
#+end_quote

Seems pretty contradictory right? All will be made clear in due time.

This establishes that Voldemort does not know love, or that he does not understand it.

This is very important.

#+begin_quote
  “The old argument,” he said softly. “But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic, Dumbledore.”
#+end_quote

This furthermore strengthens the point we reached above.

Now let's see a quote that will change everything, shall we?

#+begin_quote
  . . . This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it . . . but no matter. I can touch him now.”
#+end_quote

But wait? Voldemort recognized Lily's sacrifice?

A man who does not believe in the power of Love?

This tells us that the magic Lily used is different from 'love magic' for the lack of better word.

Here's another quote:

#+begin_quote
  You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated --- to his cost.
#+end_quote

Since he does not know 'love magic', nor understands it, it also serves to show us that Lily's Sacrifice was something else.

Perhaps it's Blood Magic (I know that the name is not canon, but the Sacrifice would fit here)? Here's my reasoning:

#+begin_quote
  She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother's blood.

  Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.

  While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge.
#+end_quote

See the strong emphasis on blood? There are more quotes like that in Book 7.

So, that's my theory.

Lily's Sacrifice was Blood Magic, and not 'Love Magic'


** You misunderstand. Voldemort does not understand love, literally so. However, he understands the magic that powerful love can grant under the right circumstances. In fact, the bit you quoted makes clear Voldemort's view here (emphasis added):

#+begin_quote
  “The old argument,” he said softly. “But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than /my kind of magic/, Dumbledore.”
#+end_quote

After all, his resurrection potion /did/ let him overcome Lily's sacrificial protection magic (and it was only the accidental turning of Harry into a Horcrux that gave him a way to survive). We know it's blood magic, but there's a pretty obvious relationship between blood and the heart, no? :)

*** Interesting view.

Never thought of it that way.

** I always thought it more Sacrificial Magic rather than Love Magic. It's Sacrificial Magic fuelled by love. Love is the reason behind the magic, but not the magic itself.

#+end_quote

Just because Voldemort doesn't understand love personally doesn't mean he doesn't know about its magical effect. You don't have to have any clue how a human being could even get the right sadistic mindset, to know that the Cruciatus Curse exists. Mark also that he said he was "foolish to overlook it", that it was "something [he] should have foreseen"; he's putting it down. He cannot deny the existence of love magic, but he /does/ do what he can to rhetorically imply it is a trifle, an annoying caveat he could easily have dealt with if it hadn't slipped his mind, as opposed to something truly formidable.

You quote:

  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

There is no reason for Voldemort to "despise" blood magic. It's clearly Love Magic that is referred to --- which he knows /about/, though he cannot practice it, and "despises" and "underestimate" (see my argument about his putting it down above).

#+begin_quote
  Lily's Sacrifice was Blood Magic, and not 'Love Magic'
#+end_quote

There's no reason it can't be both, in the same way as the Resurrection Ritual was simultaneously Potionning (for obvious reasons), and Dark Magic. It was blood magic drawing on the magical resonance of love.

** I think the main problem which causes some people to be confused or misunderstand “Love” in the Harry Potter series is how often the discussion of it switches from symbolic to measurable.

Remember that Dumbledore considers Music to be a “greater magic than anything we do [at Hogwarts].” Yet, no one is suggesting that the Weasley Twins are Musicmancers.

There was a really, obviously physical manifestation of Lily's love when she sacrificed herself to save Harry. But this isn't the “Power the Dark Lord knows not.” The wording is important.

Voldemort is a very learned individual. There is very, very little that he does not know in regards to Magic. And, as you've quoted, some form of Ancient Love Magic is not included in that short list.

No, the Power Voldemort knows not isn't literal Love Magic, it's Love. It's something Voldemort has never received and never given. Something he doesn't understand. He knows /of it/, but has never known it. The Power he knows not.

That is what the prophecy is referring to and it was his downfall several times, in different ways, even if indirectly.

** Maybe it was some kind of Pagan/Hellenistic magic that he overlooked because he didn't think Lily knew about it.
