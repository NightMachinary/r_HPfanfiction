** "Look Harry," she said with an air of impatience, "All I did was try to find a way to set the house elves free. I never intended for all of..." Hermione gestured weakly to the window and the armies beyond, "/This/."

Harry pulled a face, looking at the couple before him, "You're alright with this then, Ron?"

Shrugging the redhead retreated a bit further behind the dark lord. His hand fumbled a bit with his brand-new wand, his gaze lingering somewhere around Hermione's backside. The witch in question rolled her eyes, sighing dramatically before turning on her heels. Her hand reached out, grabbing Ron in passing as her other hand dug into the pouch of flu powder at her waist.

Her back toward Harry, she spoke softly, "I never intended for this to happen, Harry. You of all people should know that. You of all people should know how many hours I spent at the library, the trials I went through to get here-"

"You mean here as in, at the head of your own private army?" One of the twins sneered, "you're taking away not only our little brother-"

"-Who you're welcome to-"

"-but every house elf in Hogwarts-"

"-Now who's going to make dinner?"

She spun on her heels, spitting out, "Then why don't /you/ do it?! With all your mighty magic you should be /plenty/ capable!"

Fred - or George, who knew, threw her a mischievous grin, "Barf Brownies for dinner? Sounds great!"

Hermione didn't respond, instead looking at Harry with pleading eyes, "You have to believe me, Harry. I just thought they ought to be free. I never imagined so many of them would be this /angry/ -- though I suppose I should have realized. Besides, who knew people were keeping Kobolds? Centaurs? /Trolls?!/"

"All I did was amplify my magic to set them all free at once. I tried to /avoid/ war. But then so many of them wanted vengeance, and they were looking for a leader, and I just..." again she helplessly motioned to the thin glass window, "I couldn't just /leave/ them, now could I?"

Suddenly, Hermione's demeanor changed as she straightened her back and cast her fiery gaze upon those that had once been her friends, "No, I couldn't. And I shouldn't be made to feel guilty about it, either. These creatures were kept in servitude for so many generations that no one can even find a /reference/ to a time when things were different. Well, they're different now. Now it's their time. And I'll see to it that they get what's theirs, even if they have to take it by force-- I will help them take it!" She took a deep breath, turning back to the large chimney, flu powder in hand, "Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a revolution to run. You can come with me and be part of the change, or you can stand against me and face the same fate as the likes of the Malfoys -- their former servants decapitated them. With their bare hands."

The fire glowed bright green for a moment, and Hermione and Ron were gone. Harry looked at his remaining friends, was there any way to stop her?

*** "You could join me Harry, the house elves respect you. You have powerful and resourceful, I need a wizard like you at my right hand. Maybe you want to lead a stealth platoon with Officer Dobby or Commander Winky?"

Honestly it didn't sound all that bad to Harry. He was used to doing chores from his time with the Dursleys and his friends the Weaslys didn't have any house elves, so it is not like they were in danger. Plus without Hermione how was he ever going to get his homework done in time?

...Screw it, might as well, people kept calling assuming he was dark anyway, why not embrace it and support his friend?

**** Hermione was the only one who cared in canon, so it's not at all implausible that confronted with the enormity of what was happening, they would instinctively defend the status quo.

That said, I don't think they are seriously defending slavery in this snippet, just reacting in a familiar way (humour) without thinking. I can easily see them sitting down, talking it over with Harry and maybe others, and then joining Hermione.

*** Hermione looked up at the guillotine blade hanging precariously above her neck.

Apparently no-one told the house elves that the condemned were supposed to be looking /down/, not up.

Her famous last words were both uncharacteristic for her yet very apt for her situation.

"Well, shit."

The blade descended, the world spun, and Hermione's last few moments were of her staring at her own decapitated corpse being hacked into pieces by rabid house elves armed with meat cleavers.

Her last thoughts, however, were of her friends. She hoped Harry was at least happy -- even though he stood against her revolution, she still loved him and couldn't stand the thought of hurting him.

So, the sending him away for his own protection was the logical thing to--

The world went black.

---

Harry, with a silk collar around his neck, couldn't believe his life had ended up like this.

Hermione, the girl he considered a sister and one of his closest friends, had /sold him/ to the goddamn princess of the veela nation, who happened to be Fleur's second cousin, like cattle! "For [your] own good!"

...And a shit ton of gold to fund her revolution.

His new "owner"... fiance? humming "here comes the bride" still gave him nightmares.
