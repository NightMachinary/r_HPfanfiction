I usually avoid most cliché stories, and that includes wrong-boy-who-lived stories. However, I saw 'Antithesis' linkffn(12021325) being recommended in lots of threads with premises I found interesting, so I decided to give it a chance. I wouldn't call it perfect, but I really enjoyed it. So I would like you to recommend fics which impressed you despite having a cliché premise, with your own thoughts attached if possible. I'll also take fics where the cliché premise can be forgotten early in the story.

Edit: Thanks for all of your recommendations!! I'll be definitely checking them out.


** linkffn(The Merging) ploughs head on into just about every cliché you can imagine but comes out of it pretty well. It doesn't take itself too seriously and is quite a fun read.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is one of the best Fem!Harry and Slytherin!Harry fics IMO as these are often genres that fall into the same traps across many fics.

linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) has a go at the idea that a basilisk can just be dismissed out of hand although it does fall into the Super!Bones cliché fairly hard.

And of course linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) is good with tropes too.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff]]

A first person POV fic about a self-insert (more of an OC though) that gets transported to Hogwarts as an 11 year old. Yes, I know. It is the most cliche, horrible premise imaginable, but for some reason I absolutely love this fic. This is despite me usually hating main character OCs and first person POV in fanfiction.

The main character has a running commentary on everything that is both entertaining and hilarious. She really has a great character voice and is a very likable. Things constantly don't go the way she thinks they will and there is never point where she feels super powerful or good at everything.

It's a Gen fic with no romance that focuses on friendship and adventure with lots of humour. She befriends Susan Bones, Hannah along with Hermione and Neville after she (to her displeasure and surprise) gets sorted into Hufflepuff. She does influence canon events, but often not in ways that she expects or realizes. While it follows canon (kind of), its from the perspective of an outsider and the scenes and descriptions are completely original.

It's really nice to read something and not know what happens next because the author doesn't feel the need to rehash canon plot points even if they make no sense.

The descriptions of magic and Hogwards are just wonderful. They really expand the Harry Potter world and are full of small details that are not in the books but feel canon. Anyways, great fic that I recommend.

(It's a regularly updating WIP at the moment so still ongoing and fairly new. )

***** There's stuff in that fic that's excellent, like the really in-depth examination of magic and spellcasting and there's stuff that's terrible, like the "Heir" business and the "Light/Dark/Grey" stuff.

If you can accept that Harry's family, which is supposed to be the epitome of "Light" families, would abandon him willingly to the Dursleys because he's a squib, then this fic might be your cup of tea

I could see the Malfoys doing that and not attracting criticism, but the "Light" faction don't even blink. IMHO It should be an immense politically fatal scandal to discover a prominent family of the "Light" faction would disown a child for being a squib

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

I've been busy reading up on philosophy too for various interaction points and to incorporate it into the story. I have classes and exams that are going quite poorly so I've been working on that instead of writing! The story should be finished pretty quickly once I get started on it, although the themes and content will be much darker than Antithesis if I play my cards correctly!

********* Oh wow! That is a /huge/ complement, thank you so much!

I personally hate the idea of bashing, to me it feels...wrong? It feels inherently flawed for writing- readers should determine who they like/dislike based on the actions or mindset of that character, not on how they were written. I felt like it would be wrong to write anyone in a purposeful negative way without justifying their perspective or actions, hence why so many readers were split on who they loved and who they hated.

I felt like it would be a huge error on my part to write Voldemort as someone cocky or someone loving, and in return I felt like it would be a crime to the character itself. I wrote Voldemort in the most logical realistic way I could see him being, and I wrote other characters similarly. That's why there was no sudden twist of love towards the end, or why Voldemort completely ignored Adrian in every sense since his use had finished.

Now for my next story I'm going to try and twist that- I like taking famous or common tropes/cliches and twisting them into something new. I'm going to take various things that are incredibly opposing or unrealistic of various characters in canon, and try to write it and twist their perspective/mindset so it /isn't/ out of character. Basically, maintaining the canon personality while having a character do something incredibly /out of character,/ while not /actually/ being out of character.

I figure it'll be a really interesting challenge and a wonderful experience for me to try before tackling an original publication.

** I've heard a lot of good things about antithesis and want to give it a shot because I like a lot of the themes it deals with, but I hate reading about child abuse, especially from family. Could I read it where I skip chapters (if I remember right, it was several of the beginning chapters) and assume that it happened and was awful? I'm fine with reading about the aftereffects, but I really don't want to read about it while it's happening. I don't mind having to pick up on a couple things here or there that I missed out on.

I guess it's a question of how integral is Harry's worse than canon child abuse to the story? Is it just his motivation for revenge and cause of psychological issues or is the abuse actively ongoing throughout the story?

If skipping some is feasible, what chapter should I start on and are there any I should skip later on?

*** I actually am the author of Antithesis and I can 100% answer this! First, I understand that the topic may be sensitive but if you don't mind me asking, to what extend of abuse are you referring to?

**** Hi! Thank you for responding! I really appreciate it. I'm not super sensitive to abuse, I just dislike reading it, so if you accidentally send me towards some it won't ruin my day.

It's more that I want to read about Harry going dark, magical realism, the influence of the horcrux, his relationship with Voldemort, his mental health problems, and all those other ao3 tags you have, and I don't want to read about Harry's parents/the Dursley's being awful, or even just neglectful and preferential to Skylar as it happens. So it'd be really great if I could skip past that.

If there are several chapters in a row later on where harry spends a summer at the Dursley's or something like that, I'd prefer to skip that too. But I'm fine doing a little skimming when it come up for a couple pages here and there.

Is it feasible to read your story like this? I really want to give it a better try because everything else about it sounds so interesting and I've heard lots of people raving about it, but I just couldn't get through the child abuse happening in the first couple chapters.

***** Alright yes! I can explain this easy peasy.

Chapters 1-4 set up the story, and although there is child abuse it's more neglect or disregard for Harry. In these chapters it basically sets up the dynamic between the conflict, and Harry and his twin.

(here on I'll mark it as spoilers.)

Chapter 5- abuse, feel free to avoid.

Chapter 6 this is where a snake named Lutain is acquired, Lutain is pretty much Harry's familiar throughout the entire story. Considering how long the story is, it's important but there are scenes of abuse with the Dursleys here

Chapter 7-8 orphanage which is iffy in how abuse is portrayed. Mostly bullying, but plot for two characters: David and Suzie, as well as the fact that David dies as Lutain (the snake) kills him on Harry's accidental/misunderstood order. Rabastan and Rodolphus is there, so Bellatrix Lestrange acquires Harry.

Chapter 9 first view of Voldemort, but basically is just setting up Harry's role in the story and all the conflict of the two sides. There's no Dursleys past this point.

Chapter 10 the story "starts" in regards to the first year of Hogwarts and supplies. Minor mentions for how Bellatrix's household is in general pretty dysfunctional and unhealthy.

Chapters 12-16 is all of *Year 1.*

Chapters 17 - 23 is all of *Year 2*

Chapters 24 - 32 is all of *Year 3*

Chapters 33 - 39 is the summer between Year 3 and 4 There are some things that can be considered abuse, although most of it is psychological parts and not outright scenes of abuse. It's...Voldemort being Voldemort. Nothing to do with Potters or Dursleys.

Chapter 40 - 47 is all of *Year 4*, and /End of Part 1/

Chapters 48-50 is the summer between Year 4 and 5

Chapters 51 - 54 is *Year 5* and /End of Part 2/

Keep in mind, there /is no Year 6./ (you'll see why if you read the story.)

Chapter 63 is the /End of Part 3/

+Chapter 72 is named 'Abuse' and+>! the chapter is dedicated to explaining unhealthy households and abusive living situations. There's no actual abuse in the chapter; it was intended to be the closure and catharsis that people needed.!<

Chapter 80 is the /End of Part 4, and the End of the story./

Chapter 81 is the Epilogue.

If you want to jump in randomly, I think that chapter 9 or 10 would work fine for doing so. I want to throw a disclaimer out there that the first third of the story is agonizingly slow at times- I'm aware of it too don't worry! The real mental health issues and psychological factors start to come in around chapter 33, so if you ever want a summary of the early bit of the story because it's dull to read, don't worry at all and I'll do my best!

(Sorry if any of my chapter numbers are off, they're a bit out of sync in my document I use for writing but I did try to make sure things were accurate.)
