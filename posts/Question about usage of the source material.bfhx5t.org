Hi, I'm new to writing fanfiction and I was wondering - how accepted is it to re-use material from the original books?

I'm trying my hand at an AU fanfic that branches off at a specific point, but I'd like to keep a couple of scenes from the original to "set the scene", so that the reader isn't dropped in out of context. Sure, as big HP fans most of us would be perfectly aware of the scenario and don't need the introduction, but I feel like I'd be not writing properly if I didn't even offer a good introduction.

Can/should I use a couple of Rowling's paragraphs to start with and then go from there? Should I re-write the whole thing but keep the lines and general gist of it? Should I skip it altogether and just start at the point where the story branches off?


** Go with the assumption your audience has already read it. Added in small doses to reference it in a scene wouldn't be amiss. Rehashing entire sections of the book gets tiring to read. Plus, depending on the site it's published on you may get flagged for doing it.
