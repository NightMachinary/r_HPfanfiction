Hello all! I'm looking for some good time-travel fics. Here are some guidelines. Thank you all for any recs!

1. Harry going /forwards/ in time.
2. Harry interacting with technology or just screwing with it to the bafflement of everyone.
3. Harry in Space / Space-travel
4. It can be an AU, Crossover, or another immortal MOD Harry
5. I don't care about genre - it can be a hurt/comfort, humour, or just good action. Whatever.
6. I don't mind pairings, as long as it's something new - feel free to use those crossovers. Could be an OC, but well-written. (Please no H/G or H/Hr. *Shiver*)

For reference, I've read /Browncoat, Green Eyes./ The plot doesn't have to be the same, and neither does anything, really. But the premise should be similar. Maybe even more romance would be good.


** Two Star Trek Crosses.

Linkffn(Harry's Trek)\\
Linkffn(where no wizard has gone before)

Both good lighthearted fics although where no wizard starts out with some heavy emotions and concepts.

Linkffn(harry potter and the four founders by darth marrs) this is the first of a trilogy. It's not time travel but the other two are. They are based on multi relationship and the first is certainly M rated although the other two aren't as bad.

Linkffn(the forever mage) the second of the series set in Trek universe. You dont NEED to read the first, but you won't understand everything if you dont.

Linkffn(the lord of light) the last in the trilogy and is a star wars cross. again you dont need to read the previous, but there will be small things you won't understand if you dont. It actually has 2 versions. The first the starts with chapter 1 is the more light hearted and the second is darker and is posted in the same story on ffn.

Darth Marrs' fics can have their dark moments and they can be a little more realistic (smarter, more powerful bad guys) but he is a good prolific writer.

None of these really interact back into the wizarding world like browncoat does although forever mage trilogy does maintain the same universe. Same with another one of his fics linkffn(the revenge of the wizard) revenge isnt time travel. The empire and 21st century earth is during the same time period.

There's another Trek cross where Harry gets sent into the future and the wizarding world has disappeared. The finds what remains of them and marries one of the legacies although most are squibs. I can't remember the name of that one.

There are a couple HP/Mass Effect out there, but I think they are all in a new universe. The only one I can remember right now is linkffn(harry potter geth) like all of her fics they can have moments of eye roll when things tie up really neatly, but it is generally well written with a decent storyline.

  During the final battle, Harry gets thrown into a new universe, landing on the bridge of the USS Enterprise-D. This should take place in about "season 4" of ST:TNG, but I'm not going to be strict about the timeline, using things and events as needed.

  Harry has been reborn time and time again after becoming the Master of Death, living through hundreds of lifetimes in dozens of universes, but this rebirth is strange even by his standards---no doubt thanks to how he had died the last time.
