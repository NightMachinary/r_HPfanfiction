Seriously, it was ingenious! Gringotts was meant to detect any /magical/ method of theft thus it could‘ve left a hole in muggle means considering that they would not think anyone crazy enough would do a good old fashion break-in!

I'm upset that I forgot the fic's name, so I am begging that if someone remember or simply know the fic's name, to tell me what it is. I really want to read this story again.

*** Nevermind, this is not it. I took the time to skim through the fic again to refresh my memory and it seems that the scene I was looking for is not in this story. I had a fun time rereading some parts of the fic, though. There's just a nostalgic feeling go back through a story you've read before.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** Could you remember anything else about this fic? Was it on fanfiction.net or archiveofourown? Was it a slash fic or not? Was it Regulus-centric or he was just one of the main characters? Was it time travel or not? I'm so curious, I'd love to read this story...

*** I am pretty sure it was a Regulus is alive fic, so no time travel. Though, I think he left Britain for awhile. Yes, I am certain it was Regulus-centric. And no, there wasn't any specific form of romance in the story. The plot from what I recall was where Regulus was tracking down other Horcruxes. The other details are really vague to me because the time I read that story was when I was going through a phase of reading as many Regulus-centric or Black Brothers fanfics as I could. That phase started late October 2016 through the middle of of my summer which is June 2017 (if that information is any help). The stories kind of blended a bit after awhile, but the scene I described in the post was one that really stood out to me. I definitely recall Regulus tying a rope to a rock and proceeded to climb down to Bellatrix's vault. He had other details to his plan, but those details seemed to have left me too. When he left, he cast a Disillusionment Charm on the rope in order for it to be detected, just to baffle people. It was a kind of lengthy fic as well. Also, I really cannot recall which site it was from. I usually go back and forth between archive and ffn. I am sorry for not remembering anything else that might narrow the search down. I'm currently looking through my favorites and bookmarks, but it's slow going. I am leaning towards that it's probably from archive considering I checked my ffn favorites twice over lately.

**** I spent an hour yesterday searching for this story, I'm a big fan of Regulus, but unfortunately I still couldn't find it.Will try again later, thank you for the info;) It's also really difficult to browse ao3..

***** Same, I already spent the past 2 days looking for that fic through ffn. I surprise myself by putting up more effort looking for this fic then I though I would. And I completely understand about ao3. Though I have to admit that ao3 have some gems there once every now and than.

No problem! The accuracy of my info might be shady though considering how long since I last read the story.

****** I was reading "renascentia" linkao3(11914698) yesterday, it seemed promising, Regulus is portrayed quite good there, and he is also researching and hunting horcruxes in it, but in the end it wasn't that fic, unfortunately.

  In the wake of the Dark Lord's resurrection, fractured shards of the Black family - once scattered - are pieced together as the embers of resistance flicker to life once again. Unlikely partnerships are forged, and trust must be earned in a race against time to protect the next generation from the mistakes of the past and guarantee a future for the wizarding world.

******* I actually read that fic when it was starting out (chapter 7 judging from my last review) so I am caught up with that. The story is pretty fresh on my mind. Detailed and lovely fic overall.

I know that scene is not there considering this fic was pretty recent too.

*** Disappointingly, I could not find it. I looked at every single one of my favorites and follows in FanFiction.Net, so I conclude that it was from archiveofourown. I may have confused it for most likely Harry, but I am 95% certain that it was Regulus and I read this scenario from somewhere, I just don't know where is it!
