  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Updates once every two weeks. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

  When Sirius falls through the veil, Harry chases after him, determined to find him on the other side. Instead, he finds nothing at all. When he wakes up, he is informed by Unspeakables that he is from an alternate universe. Thanks to his uncanny resemblance to his counterpart, Harry is readily recognized as a duplicate of Harry Potter, a normal fifteen year old boy, and is entrusted to the care of Lily and James Potter. From them, Harry discovers that Voldemort is not, and never was, a threat in this universe. Now, Harry must adapt to life with loving parents in a peaceful world.

#+begin_quote
  Interacting with Petunia Dursley is an exercise of patience. Without time served in the Eternal Void, Mari doubts she could manage it. Listening to Petunia describe her---their?---family still tests it.“What about our nephew?”Mari asks only when Petunia breaks for a breath after a long-winded personal essay about how her Duddykins hung the moon. Petunia's gaze shutters and her lips twist as if Mari has interrupted her.“The boy is,” Petunia raises her teacup to her lips, “disturbed.”Mari curls her own hands around her cooling teacup and imagines tossing the Earl Grey into Petunia's face at the blatant dishonesty.“Losing both of your parents would disturb anyone,” Mari comments and raises her teacup for a sip.  That's the tea.

** The Disappearances of Draco Malfoy (WIP)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23296162/chapters/55794568]]

Found it because I'm writing a similar premise but I love how the characterisation. They've also gone out of their way to be creative and world-build. I'd complain about the pacing but actually it just gives more chance for the awesome description of personal interactions.
