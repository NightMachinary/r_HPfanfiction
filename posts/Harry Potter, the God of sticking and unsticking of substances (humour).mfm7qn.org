A quite funny and condensed, thankfully, fic about an 11-year old Harry winning a divine lottery and becoming the "God of matters that pertain to sticking and unsticking of substances" (his official title). It's surprisngly well written and tries to treat itself, well, not seriously, but consistently within the absurd premise.

Hijinks ensue.

P.S. The author rushes the book plot too much in my opinion, but apart from that aspect everything is quite funny. Recommend it for a light-hearted read anyway.

  When the post for a minor Godhood fell vacant, it was decided by the council of Gods to hold a lottery to fill the post. As luck would have it, the God of Lottery pronounced the victor to be Harry Potter, an eleven year old wizard. So begins the story of Harry Potter, God of... Glue?

*** Oh dear... Rereading the initial chapters of squatter, there are some similarities that I didn't expect. I didn't think about this fic when I wrote harry potter: minor god, since I had read it a few months ago and didn't follow up on reading it. Looking back, I should've been more careful. :(
