I've read a lot of posts and comments about how stupid and annoying the camping was. I agree that JKR probably only included the camping so that she can have the heroes "suffer and overcome the suffering."

Many people suggest that the trio could've hidden in the muggle world. But consider this. What happens if the muggle Prime Minister and other high level people in government have been imperiused? What if there's an arrest warrant out for Harry in the muggle world too? It's possible, especially with the fall of the Ministry of Magic.

Hiding with the Order is also out since Snape knows every member and any of them could be compromised. They would also be under heavy surveillance.

IMO the main fault in the Hunt was their lack of preparation as far as food and shelter was concerned. Hermione took far too much of the burden and responsibility and Harry and Ron simply didn't do enough. The trio should've taken a little bit of risk once and raided/shopped to stock up on non-perishable supplies once the situation was evident to them.


** Camping was the only way to continue after they lost their safe place. The true problem is that Rowling made the hero hold the idiot ball during this phase (as she did with a lot of characters in the last books ). Ex : the heros are starving for weeks, barely gathering things like mushrooms, and during all this time, none of them thought of trying a spell like "Accio " ?

*** Rowling having her characters conveniently (or rather, inconveniently) forget that they're freaking demigods on a regular basis is something that has truly been fucking me off whilst rereading the series.

** Camping itself is fine, it's them being absolute dullards and whining about having to eat shit fish when they could have just gone into a Muggle grocer for like five minutes once a week.

*** Invisibility cloak+apparatition+Hermiones bag of holding=empty supermarket.

Or: cloak/disguise+gringotts=money=food. Or:disguise+confundus=free room and board. Or: call houseelf. Or: nighttime city+accio dropped change=money

There are so many choices both legal and not that simply starving in a tent is just too stupid to beggar belief

** I've only read DH once and it's my least favorite book not counting CC. I had to read it quickly before I went back to work at a summer camp where there would be spoilers galore, but, even so, I felt the biggest drawback was the frantic pace of the plot. Though chronologically takes the same amount of time as every other book stylisticly it is the climax of the arc begun in HBP. I think this is one of the reasons there is very little prep for the trip or build up to the events before the wedding. Honestly, it is why many fanfics I read are alternate book 6 or 7, I like a lot of the ideas JKR used in those books but don't love how they were written. I also remember actually having to wait for the books and in some ways, the fandom and speculation was more fun, that lasted longer than reading the new book for me.
