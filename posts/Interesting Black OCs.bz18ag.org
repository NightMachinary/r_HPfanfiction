I find the Black family to be one of the more interesting elements that isn't that explored in the Harry Potter series. However, a lot of fanfics revolving around the Black family give me the urge to roll my eyes because the darkness isn't subtle, the madness over accentuated in a way that makes it tacky, etc. Im especially interested in any good Black family OC's---fic should preferably be long or looking like it's going to be long and it should be OC-centric. Black OC's I want can include but are not limited to a son or daughter of Bellatrix Lestrange or a son or daughter or Sirius Black. I'd rather especially like to see a story where Sirius has a slytherin son who struggles with inner darkness. Perhaps some conflict with Harry over Sirius...


** I've been liking Black Luminary so far.

** Linkffn(Growing up Black By Elvendork Nigellus)

Sadly it's dead, but it incorporates a lot of the Black family that otherwise only appear on the family tree or get a brief mention in canon

  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II in progress.

** Linkffn(Black Bond) is commonly recommended here. Haven't read it, so I can't say anything about it.

You may attract more suggestions if you change your flair to 'request', as 'recommendation' is meant for a post which recommends a fic.

** You may enjoy this. It centers around a Black OC and explores lots of interesting fanon elements. It's not terribly dark though, it's more hilarious. I love it!
