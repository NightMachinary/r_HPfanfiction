It's basically that. when I was a teenager and absolutely had nothing to do, it didn't even cross my mind that fanfics exist. but with 20+ I have read HP and plunged into the world of fanfics, I'm not ashamed to say this, it is so funny and fun, even my dad loves it, he's getting addicted to it. xD. so I started writing an HP fic just for fun and I really liked it, but when I was at the end of year 1 I got a cool job and a cool college project, but I don't want to accept that I have to give up on this hobby üòí.

Does anyone who has gone through this and completed a story or is about to complete or even did not gave up have any advice to share?


** Heya. 20+. Working. And I write, same as you, fell back into it during the pandemic.

You find time, honestly. I use writing as my little escape from work and stress. It's nice to use my laptop for something fun and for me rather than work and emails. My relationship with that computer has improved dramatically. I used to get serious anxiety when I looked at it but writing has helped ease that.

I mostly do short stories and one shots. This year I was drafted into one of the ffnet writing comps which has been just awesome. Chatting to other writers and having deadlines and prompts for stories was so much fun. It forced me to take breaks from work to write which I so needed some days. So much fun. If you can, join a writing comp it's the best decision I've made.

Don't stress yourself out. Use it as an escape. Write what you want to read and if you do that it won't seem stressful. I write short oneshots. I prefer them. Instant gratification of starting and finishing something in one go. You definately don't have to give up the hobby just because of work. Sure people go to the gym or play sports and have a life? Why not writing? You write for you, not for other people. If it makes you happy, you'll find the time.

  Harry accidently gets good at chess after playing Ron for 6 years. Pity he doesn't even notice.All the chess matches are real and linked in the fic for you to follow along for context since, as it turns out, writing chess is bloody difficult!

  Which is scarier: the Boggart itself, or the few seconds before it picks its shape? An exploration of fear.

** I had the fiftieth birthday just couple of weeks ago, and I can only add one very depressive comment. It will never get better, just worse. Yes, it is a shock how little time you have after leaving your school, but it gets worse and worse from there.

If you want to keep any hobby, the only way is rigorous time management and planning. ‚ÄúWe don't have time, we have to make time.‚Äù

** I'm in my thirties and have been in and out of fandom for the past twenty years. Basically it's like any other hobby, you do it when you have time, sometimes that's on the weekend, or on evenings, and some days it just doesn't happen.

** I'm 31 and have been writing my fic for several years. It's over 700 k right now and close to being done. I have a full time job, a two year old and a husband in his third year of surgical residency. It's definitely hard to find time to write, my husband is obviously at the hospital all the time leaving me with a lot to do at home, but it's also my ‚Äúme time‚Äù. Having hobbies is important for my self care, I do at times feel bad when my readers wait so long for an update, but I'm also very open with how busy my real life is. I typically will write at night when everyone is asleep and I'm winding down for the day. Just write when it's convenient to you and don't feel writers guilt over it- writing is for you and if you treat it like an obligation you won't enjoy it as much.

That's it. Choose an hour, and that's your dedicated spot. If you want to, you'll always find an hour.

** 30+ here. I managed write something a bit more longform by setting aside 2 hours at the tail end of the day most nights. Not every night, because long day at work or just too worn out to do anything creative, but nighttime became writing time after a while.
