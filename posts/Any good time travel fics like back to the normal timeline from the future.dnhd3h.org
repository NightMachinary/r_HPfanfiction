Title says everything other than that it should be over 100k and for the pairing I prefer Haphne but can be other pairings too

Thanks


** I'm a bit confused with what you mean by "back to the normal timeline from the future." Could you elaborate?

*** Okay like this Normally Harry went on to do all the stuff he normally did in the series and in like 2010 He is like ”okay this is boring in going to go back in time” and he goes to like maybe a bit before school starts and he of course knows everything already from the previous tile He did it, the time travel could also be with another person (maybe his loved one idk) and then Harry (and the people who know of it) do like a mini speedrun of the whole thing and destroy voldemort in about 10 days worth of time

**** !linkffn(the unforgiving minute) is very close to what you want. In the future, Voldemort wins, so Harry has to go back in time and has 12 hours to kill Voldemort.

  Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours.

*** It gives the things I am looking for, which is a pretty large area of stuff, but let me make it clear to you

Harry became old, wanted to be young, time travelled back to when he was 'insert an age' and does his life again, but in the way he wanted it to have gone before

Thats it, thats the only thing aside from it not being under 100k words that I require.

**** Yeah, no. It didn't convey any of that. In fact, it didn't actually convey anything at all, because it was wholly incomprehensible.

That said, what you're looking for is called a Peggy Sue fic, and they are fairly popular. Harry Potter and teh Wastelands of Time is probably the best known of the genre, but there's a whole bunch of them listed [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterPeggySue][here]], and even more on this sub- search for the phrase "Peggy Sue" or "Time travel."
