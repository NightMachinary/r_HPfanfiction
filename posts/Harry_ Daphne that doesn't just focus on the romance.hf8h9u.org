I do enjoy a good romance fic better the two but sometimes I like to the story a little fleshed out. Would prefer to have some action in it and maybe the reality of the world they live in. Would prefer of it complete or at least regularly updated.


** Some shameless self promo but I'm delighted with the feedback I'm getting on this. Updating every week too! It's Post-Hogwarts and has some action and crime to it.

** Linkffn(The Uprising by Captain Cranium) is a decent fic, if a bit meandery. No romance but HP and DG are Auror partners. It has action and politics.

  All is seemingly well in Wizarding Britain as the last aftershocks of the War against the Dark Lord fade away, but a series of murders lead ace Auror Daphne Greengrass to a threat that may throw her world yet again into imbalance. COMPLETE!

#+begin_quote
  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Secrets of the war, a murder and a fatal attraction: After his victory over Voldemort, Harry became an Auror, and realised quickly that it wasn't at all like he had imagined. Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG

** Shameless self promo but

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13504671/1/Fireworks]]

Things unrelated to romance happen.

And romance.

I've got another HP/DG in the works that's not so typical.
