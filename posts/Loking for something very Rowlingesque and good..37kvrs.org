** Alexandra Quick is said to be one of the most cannon like fics out there. And it's quite good.

*** I don't know if it can be considered one of the most canon fics out there-it has next to nothing to do with the content or world of the books. Nevertheless, it is a good suggestion.

**** So far, it is 100% canon compliant I think? (bearing in mind that no one from the HP books plays a role at all, really. However, it's a big world so it's not a problem.)

However, I meant that it was canon-like in the writing and style of the story. (School year and slow build adventure at the end. World building, etc.) OP asked for things Rowlingesque and I think that AQ fits that bill well.

***** It is; the pacing and plot-building is definitely that. The content is a bit (read: a lot) darker.

** Err, could you be a little more specific? Like, genre, character focus, maybe share a few existing fics you like so we know what you mean by 'good'?

** Unfortunately, you won't find any fanfiction that reads as if JKR has written it. Because if it did, there wouldn't be anything "fan" about it! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness][Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness]] and the authors [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] are commonly recommended places to start.

**** Anywhere! The author is writing one continuous story, but they have the order on their author page. Some of my favorites are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5486126/2/Fred-and-George-s-Busy-Day][Fred and George's Busy Day]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5670953/1/The-Mind-of-Arthur-Weasley][The Mind of Arthur Weasley]]. I really like how he portrays the characters and I like his depiction of Harry as an Auror. Writes a good mystery too.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/][Weasley Girl]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9932798/1/][sequel]] by Hyaroo: We all know the stories that ask "What if Harry Potter was a girl," right? But what if Ron Weasley was a girl? Imagine that the first person Harry befriends on the Hogwarts Express is not Ronald Weasley, but Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first born daughter of the Weasley clan for generations... what might happen then?

The author does a very good job of maintaining the feel of the early books.

** I don't normally read next-gen fics but I highly recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8417562/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Global-Revelation][Albus Potter and the Global Revelation]] by NoahPhantom and it's sequels.

#+begin_quote
  BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.
