** Dark ones or redemption ones? Because I got a lot of dark ones I could find for you, and maybe two redemption ones. She Rises by giraffelove92 is one of my favourite tom/hermione ones. Its in progress but has 308k+ words so far. Its pretty dark.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC

** I have recently have read an amazing crossover with HP and the Avengers (specifically Captain America the First Avenger) called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12490736/1/Come-Together][Come Together]] by oniforever. linkffn(12490736)

It stays true to Tom's personality but made room for him to grow. At age 16 at least. This took place after the Chamber of Secrets which he is still very much guilty for. The story is very well written from the beginning and continues to become more impressive as I read on. It's to the point that I have no clue how many time I've reread this specific fanfiction.

  It begins in 1943. Tom Riddle searches for his place in the world, and ends up getting captured by HYDRA. After being saved by a crazy muggle in spandex, he must learn to adapt to the new playing field, and have some odd friendships along the way. AU. Soldier!Tom Riddle. No pairings. Starts in CA:TFA but will spread to the other films.
