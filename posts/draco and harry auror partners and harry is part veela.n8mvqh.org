y'all know that one ? they're auror partners cos harry can't hold a partner and it starts with draco dying laughing about harry finding out he's part veela and needs to mate lest he becomes unbearably attractive. draco is engaged to katie bell and then she finds out he was the one who hexed her and like they have to keep stringing peppermint around the office cos it's the only thing that helps and then there's that line when draco is like ‚Äúi'm not immune‚Äù AAAAA anyways it's literally the only drarry fic i ever read but it's Stupendous and i can't for the life of me remember the god damn name of it.

Thanks ! üò¨‚úåüèΩ
