My idea is this:

In 1991, the Communist Hardliner coup against Mikhail Gorbachev succeeds.

This results in the Cold War not ending, but Gorbachev's Soviet Union being replaced by a new, more aggressive version. One which hates the West with even more fury than before.

In response, Prime Minister Major elects to transform the London Underground into one large nuclear bunker, inspired by the Moscow Metro. The project lasts around four years, and is successful.

In the magical world, meanwhile, several seers look into the future to determine how to avoid a nuclear war. They see that the Hardliners are in fact supported by several Russian wizards, and that any attempt to stop them will only increase the chances of armagedon.

Because of this, the Second Wizarding War ends in early 1996, with the detonation of over a hundred nuclear warheads over Britain.

The wizards managed to save many thousands of people, including most of the Order and Voldemort's army. The Special Air Service also manage to make it to the Underground.

No one knows if anyone else in the world is still alive.

The remnants of the SAS, Order, and Death Eaters together form the Rangers of the Order, dedicated to protecting the Underground from mutants.

The hastily assembled London Underground Authority collapses into warring factions, including the Empire League, Red Line, Fourth Reich, and Underground Regency.

Any advice? What would the relations between Wizards and Muggles be? How can the DEs, Order and SAS overcome past feelings to defend what remains of humanity?


** I think if you have to explain why ICW just outright imperious the world leaders to not launch any Nuke. 'Seers said it would be worse' explanation seems lazy.
