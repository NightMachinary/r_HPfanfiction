I'm writing a fanfic where Dumbledore is no longer able to be the Chief Warlock. Amelia is the Minister of Magic. Who would you suggest to be the new Chief Warlock? (male or female) It's an Alternate Universe fanfic in the 5th year. Thx!


** Depending on what you're looking for...

Augusta Longbottom

Scrimgeour

Umbridge

Greengrass parent

Davis parent

Amos Diggory

Gawain Robards

** If this is an AU in which Dumbledore leaves from his own volition, I could see Griselda Marchbanks, Tiberius Ogden, or Elphias Doge becoming Chief Warlock since they are quite the senior members of the Wizengamot.

*** I was not previously aware of Griselda. I looked up her wiki page and she's perfect. I put her in the position. Thanks!
