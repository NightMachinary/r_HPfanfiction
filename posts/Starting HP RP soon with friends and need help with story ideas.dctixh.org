We're starting as first years and it's ser 10 years after the battle of Hogwarts. I have the main story for the first year worked out, but I'm stuck on figuring out some other things our characters can do when the story isn't taking the main role. Basically, I need some filler ideas. Ex: Nick's death day party, mirror of erisaid, etc. So if anyone could help me with ideas, I would really appreciate it. Thank you in advance if you help.


** 1. Explore the castle. Not sure if have ever been to one, but those things are bloody massive and it would take years to scout out every nook and corner. The same applies to the grounds. And keep in mind that there might be mysterious magical plants, animals and traps to be found as well, not just a hidden door.

2. Hang out with friends using those locations. Way too often in fanfics, you see Hogwarts interactions limited to the common rooms, classes and the great hall. But there is nothing stopping people from hanging out outside, walk along the edge of the Forbidden Forest and the like. Even go for a swim during summer and early autumn if the weather is good.

3. Same goes for dating (relevant later). Hogsmeade is not the only possible date. A picknick on the grounds, flying together or even sneaking into an abandoned classroom to dance to a radion/recond player would be viable choices.

4. With the mundane stuff out of the way, Battle damage and ghosts. Maybe even find a body/skeleton and try to figure out who that was (eg in a collapsed passage). Maybe the Carrows made someone disappear, or the DA was more violent than they told Harry.

5. Get lost at night. Without the Marauder Map and an invisibility cloak, staying undetected and making your way back is very difficult and all kinds of dangers lurk along the way.

6. Broom racing. Set a course and have some fun. Maybe even an underground racing league where they meet in secrecy to fly through the Forbidden Forest or around the castle.

** 1. Clubs and societies. The quiddich teams are obvious ones but there is nothing saying that there are not equivelent ones for other subjects and such
2. Depending on house and such, why not try and think up a couple of 'schemes' that older classmates are working on. Be they malicious or not, but an older Slytherin offering a first year a bit of gold or help with their homework in exchange for telling them what that argument was about in the Hufflepuff common room last night. Or any other variation on typical RPG favour requests from older students of fetching somebody, planting something for a prank or similar.
3. Have other students do shenanigans. Think of when the Weasley twins would set off stuff to annoy students and teachers. A prank goes off in the great hall meaning that everyone is speaking in really high pitch voice or really low depending on gender, and opposite to stereotype. But the only way to solve it is to find the student with the matching other half to a common saying written on their arm. Or a simple spell. So one of your characteres might have 'Leviosa' written on their arm. So they need to go and talk to that person in the other house that has 'Wingardium'. Chaos ensues in the great hall as everyone is going round trying to talk to each other while also laughing hysterically.
4. Actual lessons. Make the teachers competent, but have the concept of safety be different than it is in a mundane school. If nearly anything except death can be cured overnight, then it means that throwing around spells in classrooms isn't out of the question. Have your teachers set actual challenges for the students.
5. One thing i thought of, maybe since the final battle, some of the academic powerhouses of the war survivors who came back to the school put an enchantment over the grounds which means that any time a current student or staff is the subject of immediate mortal peril (they were knocked off their broom while flying somewhere without the safety charms, they knocked the mufflers off the mandrakes while sneaking through the greenhouses) they are portkeyed to the hospital wing in a 'secret' room and put in stasis for the healer to come and check on them and berate them for being so stupid. They are then sworn to secrecy about the system and let out again. So you have one of your players suddenly dissapear in the middle of an encounter where they would have died and then can't tell their friends about what happened when they reappear the next week.

Just a couple of thoughts off the top of my head. I really hope you have fun and please please please get back to us with how it goes because I SOOO want somebody to come up with a good way of doing a Hogwarts RPG

*** Thank you for the ideas. And yeah, depending on how it goes, I'll post an update to how it's going.

**** Keep in mind that pranks quickly lose their novelty and therefore their entertainment value. Most pranks are funny the first time you read them. But if you see someone dye the Slytherins pink for the fiftieth time (in different fics), it's not hilarious anymore.

Also, quite a lot of the pranks authors come up with are assault or worse. Anything with love Potions is basically rape. Half of the twins' candy is assault if given someone unsuspecting. Even those "you have to kiss to get out from the enchanted mistle toe" things are sexual abuse and coercion. So depending on your players, your mileage may vary significantly.

***** I don't plan on doing anything that can be seen as assault. If I have any pranks in the RP, it'll only be some childish fun, nothing that is actually bad. I do appreciate the warning though.

** There's a big spooky forest full of evil stuff. I for one think that the spider population is inevitably going to outgrow the forest. Hey, maybe a centaur will seek help. Like a young one who isn't as proud and unwilling to ask for help.

or the lake with the merpeople. lots of potential interactions there.

you could try some more schooly type things. Maybe a dare/prank thing to try to infiltrate all four house dorms. something like that.

Your intrepid role players go to a dusty corner of the castle and accidentally discovers a boarded up and forgotten portion. It was boarded up for a reason, but no one now remembers.

I've always enjoyed the idea of getting trapped in the portraits and being forced to move around the castle in them.

a student led quidditch game inside the castle, complete with angry spell slinging teachers and dangerous moving staircases

An eccentric teacher has some grand idea for extra credit or for a test. like a scavenger hunt or surprise duels.

Peeves successfully figures out how to manipulate the castle more holistically. He can now control the whole castle, like rude messages on the great hall ceiling, hitting people with doors on their way out, activating castle defenses like all the statues and things. wild wacky flailing staircases.

​

this was fun but i'm tired and so everything seems like a good idea. hope something helped

** Battle of Hogwarts is May 2, 1988. Plus 10 years is 2008.

From wikipedia:

September 10, 2008 -- The proton beam is circulated for the first time in the Large Hadron Collider, the world's largest and highest-energy particle accelerator, located at CERN, near Geneva, under the Franco-Swiss border

Might be cool if something happens on the magical side of things when this happens.

Other fun ideas:

- A painting that is actually a wizard. An alchemist found a sort of shitty immortality; a potion that can turn a wizard into their own painting.

- A reverse boggart. It turns into what you most like.

- Rowena Ravenclaw's Hidden Island. Submerge yourself in her bathtub, close your eyes, hold your breath, and then come up on the 17th second. You'll find yourself coming out of the sea on the shore of an island. If you do the same thing in the sea near the island you'll come out of her bathtub.

- Lewd messages are spelled out all over the floral arrangements around Hogwarts if you happen to know victorian flower code.

- One of the suits of armor in the castle is designed for a woman. If you touch the boobs it slaps your hand.
