Just read Charon for the first time. Loved it, disappointed to see that it hasn't been updated in over a year... Wondering if anyone has any similar fics they'd rec? (I've already read WTT, Triton, Deprived) And or if they know if the author will update in the future or if someone has adopted it?

** Have you read LF74's other fics? *Soul and Body* and *Blood and Water* are both very good, I liked them better than Charon.

Don't know what his deal is with updating. Hopefully he continues, they are good stories.

If you want more WBWL-ish fare, the usual suspects (Ashes of Chaos, Prince of Slytherin, Sarcasm and Slytherin, Boy Who Lived) should all be good options if you haven't read them already.

  Everyone knows that wizarding children often take on an aspect of magic during their childhood. Innate specialties. Children of quidditch players might be able to fly without a broom for a time, those raised by fisherman might be able to manipulate water with great ease. Harry Potter comes to Hogwarts able to heal from any injury. At least he's got Tom keeping him company.

  What if Petunia wasn't so poisoned by jealousy her sister's magic, and when her orphaned nephew appeared on her doorstep chose to treat him as family rather than a burden? Sorted into Hufflepuff, how will the Wizarding World react when their saviour finally returns? And is being fair and loyal really as good as people say?

*** I'm about to check out Soul and Body haha. Not too big on Blood and Water's premise/summary. Leaning a little more towards a little heavier/darker fic with violence/op ish harry at the moment. B+W seems a little more lighthearted

**** Give it a chance, it's not your typical Hufflepuff Harry story. I didn't think it was very lighthearted at all, but Soul and Body is definitely a good deal darker.
