This is driving me nuts, and I'm finally forced to ask for help. I'm looking for a specific story, but I don't know what it is. Here is everything I can remember about it right now:

Harry has a sister he doesn't know about. She doesn't know about him either. She was stolen out of Lily's womb the night the Potters were killed. Snape was supposed to be her god-father. Harry finds out about her and discovers that she's living in Atlanta. Harry and others go to find her. DE also go to find her. Draco somehow meets her first and she ends up with a crush on him.

That's it. I know the main pairing was Harry/Ginny, but I remember if it was a major thing. Any help figuring this one out would be appreciated.


** I think the story you're looking for is:

*** Damn. That's why I never found it. I was looking for something completed. This is permanently, I think, unfinished.
