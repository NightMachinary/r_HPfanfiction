So I was thinking, and I remember this fanfic, Its a crossover between Avengers and Harry Potter. I would consider it good, but then again, my standards are low. Its a reborn harry potter fanfic. He was reborn twince. Hasn't updated in a little bit, but I would still consider it a well written fic. Harry is reborn as an alien first, and becomes one of Thanos' child. Second is reborn as Harley Keener. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13336843/1/All-I-Have-All-I-Need]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19797934/chapters/46872697]]
