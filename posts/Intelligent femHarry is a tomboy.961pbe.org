Hi guys,

while I like the normal fem!Harry fanfictions, too (not all of them of course, I've gotten picky and I will probably get pickier the more fanfiction (and original fiction!) I read, too) I'd like something different this time:

I want fem!Harry who is a (smart) tomboy (kind of Hermione + sports)!

At best she is also unwilling to let herself be pushed around (sorry, Snape! Sorry, Headmaster! etc.) and is also into sex (without necessary needing love or a relationship for it!)

Basically I'd like a fem!Harry who is kind of a man's dream:

- smart

- assertive

- independent (not whiny and can take care of herself and things (doesn't need to call a man for the heavy lifting - hell, why should she: Magic takes care of that!)!)

- not a bitch (as in: Doesn't treat men like crap and boss them around etc.)

- into the stuff boys are into (sports, cars (ok: (racing) brooms!) etc.)

- not into jewelry, dresses, makeup etc.

Note: I have no problem with femslash :) (real slash isn't my cup of tea, especially if the main characters are turned gay, so keep that in mind! I don't mind it if background characters are gay however!)

So, the stage is yours guys and thanks for your recommendations in advance :)


** Linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise)

She's not really feminine, is smart, assertive, independent I think. I don't think she's a bitch, but she is kinda bratty. Idk it's been a while since I've read it. She's supposed to be gay, but I don't think it ever gets to the point where she actually dates or fucks anyone.

*** She's with Fleur in the epilogue. That's it, really. Other than general talk of her sexuality and some teasing from Fleur, there's not much of femslash.

*** I am not done reading yet, but I am enjoying this very very very much! So here, have an upvote and my thanks and gratitude :)

Sassy, sarcastic "go fuck yourself" Potter (no matter if male or female) is always fun to read :)

Also: The femslash is not a requirement (hell, in this case - fem!Harry, I don't have as much a problem with HP/DM, a pairing I despise under normal circumstances (Harry just isn't a poofter for me, can't make that mental leap - despite being for gay rights, gay marriage, adoption rights for gays (don't know if that is good for the kids, but on the other hand: Better to grow up with great gay/lesbian parents than growing up without any parents at all!) etc...but I prefer watching/reading about lesbians instead of homosexual men, sorry))

  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Iris Potter doesn't do normal, and her fourth year at Hogwarts is evidence enough. Two new tasks. Tiny amount of femslash. Sort of complete, sort of abandoned.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
