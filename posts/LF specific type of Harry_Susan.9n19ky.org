** Could you clarify as to the specific type you want?

Susan siding against Harry is canon, so will be in almost all of them, and "a relationship through normal means or a contract" similarly covers basically every relationship. As it stands, this request is basically for any Harry/Susan fic in the fandom.

*** What I mean is that Susan believes Harry to be the Heir of Slytherin during their second year and believes Harry cheated during their 4th year. And from there, the author either tried to bring them Harry/Susan together because Susan feels guilty or there is a contract between the two and the previous factors cause for struggles in their pairing

Because the stories I have all read have Susan going about how she always believed and supported Harry from the beginning.
