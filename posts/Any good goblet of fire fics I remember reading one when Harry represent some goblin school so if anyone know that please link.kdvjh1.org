  The second half of goblin-raised Harry's third year and the first half of his fourth year at Hogwarts. Harry is a proud participant in the next goblin rebellion, getting justice for his godfather, freeing artifacts who shouldn't have to be enslaved to humans, and creating alternatives to silly human traditions.

**** So in the fic you're looking for, Harry is a Hogwarts student, then at the beginning of 4th year someone else enters him into the Tournament as "Harry Potter from Goblin School". Is that right?

** Inspected By No 13 linkffn(10485934)

Harry attempts a bavarian fire drill against a dragon.

The Substitute linkffn(4641394)

The Goblet of Fire restores the Potters. Good, but not exactly a happy ending.

#+begin_quote
  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.
