Fanfic idea: Just thought it would be an interesting idea if Moaning Myrtle is freed from her "obligations" to haunt the bathroom after Harry defeats the basilisk in Year Two and, instead, haunts Privet Drive, protects Harry from his abusive relative, and perhaps even teaches Harry.


** What exactly would Moaning Myrtle teach Harry? How to hold petty grudges? The subtle art of teenage drama? Getting Murderkilled By Giant Snakes 101?

  "Nobody missed me even when I was alive. Took them hours to find my body --- I know, I was sitting there waiting for them. Olive Hornby came into the bathroom --- 'Are you in here again, sulking Myrtle?', she said, 'because Professor Dippet asked me to look for you ---' And then she saw my body... ooooh, she didn't forget that until her dying day, I made sure of that..."

*** Still, what year is Myrtle? If she was older she could maybe teach Harry some stuff. But I thought she was actually confined to Hogwarts by the Ministry after she messed with Hornby too much?

***** oh, wow, the wiki has a lot of info on her! JKR musta put it on pottermore at some point because her full name is apparently Myrtle Elizabeth Warren, she was a third-year when she died, and yes, she was confined to Hogwarts by the ministry after Olive Hornby complained of her harassment (I remembered that part from the books).

**** Not at all, you just need to say your story is AU, and Myrtle is older or whatever. Maybe Harry helps her get around the Ministry restrictions and that's why she helps him. Maybe he can help other hot ghosts (Grey Lady?) and get a ghost harem!

** I could see her being a help, showing him secret places in the castle (maybe find the RoR a bit earlier), be a lookout/information gatherer. While she has been around a couple decades, I doubt her magic/academic knowledge has progressed. She splashes water around a bit, but I doubt she can flip through a book if she wanted to. She can't practice any magic either. How much memory capability would she have anyway? It seems that the ghosts have some capacity for making/storing new memories (they greet people by name, haunt them, etc), but if you came back 10 years after graduating would they remember your name? You can make the ghosts strongly AU by giving them attributes and powers they don't have in the books, I suppose.

** Something similar does exist:

"Myrtle would be allowed to leave her bathroom three days a week, providing she spent two of them with a certain family from Surrey. Myrtle would be allowed to torment the family as she pleased, knowing that no one outside of the Dursleys would be capable of seeing her during her visits."
