That story is written so well and is so moving. It hasn't been updated in a year, which is such a shame.


** Yes, the author. And it updated little more than a month ago.

****** Yeah, I started reading it sometime in September? October? Something like that, and it only had 15 chapters, so it has a pretty good update rate.
