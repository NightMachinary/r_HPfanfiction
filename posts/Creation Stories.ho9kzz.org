Do magical creation stories exist? Various religions have creation stories, and I feel like there would exist lore about how magic came to be. I know that Merlin is credited as being very powerful, but I don't recall any further elaboration on the history of magic. I feel like it would be an interesting idea.


** Obvious problem with this request is that magic is not religion, so there is no the magical creation story, for that every wizard or witch had to go their nearest true religion (be it Christianity, something Celtic, or something even more weird).

*** Good point. Magical people would probably end up worshipping the relevant god of Magic in their culture - Marduk, Hecate, Odin, Isis, etc. Don't think they'd go with Christianity, given the whole witch-burning thing and the general anti-magical sentiments of the Abrahamic religions, but I could see them going for some religions, at least.

**** I don't think so.

First, people are not idiots, and they are able to distinguish between idiocy caused by stupid mob or bunch of power-hungry idiots, and what the Christianity is truly about.

Second, there was continuous trickle of Muggleborns and Muggle-raised (or outright Muggles) as spouses coming into the magical world. Until roughly the Second World War even in Europe almost everybody was at least professing Christianity (or Judaism and some other minority religions), so I guess this continuous (albeit perhaps not very strong) pressure would turn at least some wizards and witches towards Christianity. I could imagine some traditionally fiercely Christian families and some (probably some ultra-anti-Muggle pureblood ones) who would keep some Celtic/pagan rites.

And that's just in Europe/America with regards to Christianity. In cultures where no witch-hunts happened ... actually, I don't know whether they really didn't happen elsewhere ... hmm, [[https://wikiislam.net/index.php?title=Islamic_Witch_Hunts][they exist in Islam]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt#India][in India]] (or [[https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/12/13/witch-hunt-women-india-real-and-deadly/930270001/][here]]) “The practice of witch-hunt among Santhals was more brutal than that in Europe.” Hmm.

***** I mean, I very much disagree with the first point - the very existence and semi-prevalence of anti-theism alone would point to that. I'm not saying they're right or wrong to link the 'idiocy' and Christianity - I don't have an opinion and I'm vehemently unqualified to have one, never mind offer one, and I really, really don't want to be the kind of person who debates religion on the internet anyway - but to say people don't distinguish Christianity from the bad things Christians have done is highly inaccurate. Hell, I remember a few people in my A-Level theology classes angrily talking about the Curse of Ham and how Christianity was complicit in the slave trade. Whether they were right or wrong, they definitely believed it was true. People say similar things about most religions. People also believe the Earth is flat and that man never walked on the moon and that mental health is a sign of demonic possession. People aren't all idiots, sure, but there are enough around to be statistically significant. :)

It's like interpretations of Harry Potter characters. Right or wrong, canon or fanon, some people will wholeheartedly believe that and back their interpretation with something from the books, often with the same words being used to back completely different conclusions. That's Humanity. If there's an opinion on something, someone somewhere has it and will fight to the internet death to defend it. :)

I can see your point about muggleborn-immigrant conversion of Magicals to Christianity, though. Just by sheer weight of numbers, probability would mean there'd have to be at least some Magicals converting to Muggle religions.

And yep. Hunting Magicals is a worldwide hobby (:D). And I didn't mean to imply it was specific to Christianity, I was only naming it specifically since you used them specifically in your earlier post. Academic habit. Really though, pretty much every terrible thing you can think of has been done by pretty much every culture to at least one other culture at one point or another. If only he who is without sin can throw the first stone, nobody on the planet is ever throwing anything ever again. :)

Well, of course, I know about William Wilberforce (who I guess was who Hermione dreamt about when founding S.P.E.W.), but there is also [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_slavery#The_Bible_is_not_against_slavery]] and I had in my hands the book “Biblical Foundations of Slavery” (sometime from 1820s or so), which proved by the Bible study, that slavery is not only most-Christian order of things, but that nations based on slavery are more civilized than the barbaric ones, which don't have it. I think, we Christians (and I am the practising Christian), should be very humble.

I dunno. I mean, I personally think humility is just the easiest and most effective way to go through life (With pride comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom and all that :D), but I don't think that the actions of other Christians necessitate your specific humility.

Christianity is a very diverse religion full of diverse beliefs and diverse levels of commitment about those beliefs. Taking the blame for those power-hungry idiots and arseholes (both those who are active now and those who and deciding you specifically need to be humble about it is a bit self-blaming for the actions of other people - actions that you had absolutely no input into or control to stop.

But that's also really not what I meant in my last message. Literally all I was saying is that some people see Religion and the bad things the Religious have done as linked. Whether they're right or wrong to do so is quite far above my metaphorical pay grade, and I wouldn't be comfortable making that value judgement anyway. That kind of thing is frowned upon in Psychology. :)

Heh. Good quote. :)

Though I will say that I don't believe in stupid people - just people who haven't learnt the things that will make them understand yet. It's all about what you experience and how you develop as a person from that. :)

Ooooh. Interesting. I'll take a look, thanks! :)

I think I understand what you mean. I don't take personal responsibility for actions of somebody else, I really don't pretend to be Torquemada, but I am always wary of people who thoughtlessly follow the path of “Christ is always right and virtuous - Church is always right and virtuous - I am always right and virtuous.” There are too many of them around and they look completely ridiculous to any non-believer, and that is one of the most common acts of /Chillul Hashem/ I can see here.

********* Fair enough. Apologies if that came off as patronising - I really struggle with phrasing my thoughts properly when I'm tired, and I've been talking mostly to mental health people for about two months now, so I'm still defaulting to reassurance and rebuilding self-esteem mode. :D

Also, completely agreed on the wariness note - thoughtless adherence to anything is rarely a route for people to live their best lives. Especially since believing yourself perfect seems to be sacrilege to most monotheistic religions anyway. Most Holy Books and Churches tend to be firm on the idea that only their God is perfect, after all, and we are but imperfect sinners. :)

*** But their nearest religion might not explain how magic came to be, or why purebloods are superior to muggles or whatever else they want to believe.
