As it says in the title. We always see the good guys go back in time, it'd be interesting if a dark/evil character went back in time.

For the last part of their joining the light side; they could either change how they feel about stuff, or join to save them self. Or they DON'T have to join the light side at ALL.

No OP Harry please.

Would rather no Weasley bashing if possible

Characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but an author going out of their way to bash a character is normally a no go.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be on any site.

Would rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine.
