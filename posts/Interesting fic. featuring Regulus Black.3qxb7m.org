  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.

** linkffn(8895954)

Well worth the read, though it takes a bit to get into it. Young Harry makes a wish for a better life and a supernatural entity decides Harry deserves it. So the entity goes back in time far enough to change history to the point that, by the time young Harry makes his wish, someone is ready to step in and rescue him. Which means Regulus Black survives his canon death and grows badass. (There's also a slight crossover with James Bond.)

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

  At age fifteen, Regulus Black became the sole heir to the largest fortune in Wizarding London. At age sixteen, he joined the Death Eaters, but what price did he pay? The story of a boy who managed to defy Lord Voldemort at the height of his regime. Reg/OC

  Regulus was drowning.Or At Least he thought he was until a woman of light came to him to offer a second chance. Thrown back into the world of the living, He basically plans from thin air to work around the new world he is in now. He will be helping Harry Potter go against the Dark Lord and saves Sirius from dying by Bella's Hand. Looks like Harry has perfect Ally on his side. AU
