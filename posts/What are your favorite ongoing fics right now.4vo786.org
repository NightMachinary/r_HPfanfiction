  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

*** Spoilery question: What changes didn't you like, or what did you feel was missing from the rewrite?

**** Just to preface my opinion, I can't be sure anything I don't like about the rewrite wasn't going to happen in the original anyway and wasn't just moved up, with the journey to King's Landing put off or skipped. Basically, I have two big complaints about the rewrite. 1) Aeryn's presence has been really cut quite significantly in the newer sections. Harry is now betrothed to Margaery and seems to be in love with her, with some indications that his relationship with Aeryn is becoming less important to him. I worry that she is going to replace Aeryn. Aeryn and Harry's relationship was honestly about 75% of why I loved the story so much, so the less she appears, the less I find myself caring about and liking the story. 2) The focus of the story is moving quite a bit away from the main characters of the Seven Kingdoms and "the game of thrones" and towards the warlocks of Qarth as well as premonitions of the large scale trouble coming about. It looks like Harry might even leave the Seven Kingdoms for a while.

** While there are a few I'm following, the one ongoing fic which I'm most interested in right now is listed below

linkffn(11120079)

It is a version of Deathly hallows which provides enough AU while maintaining the original plotline more or less. Ex. the order in which some information is gain is changed. It is also a H/Hr that has no Dumbledore or Ron bashing, though the latter is sidelined a bit. But, the author has said that he plans to give Ron his moments to shine in future chapters.

#+begin_quote
  War changes everyone: Harry resolves to face destiny and struggles to reconcile with Dumbledore's past, fully aware of the price he must pay for victory. Hermione walks through fire, determined to share in Harry's burden. Ron battles resurgent jealousy and soon discovers he may lose far more than he stood to gain. One thing is certain; peace is never cheaply purchased. H/Hr

** I'm following these stories, ranked by order of interest:

*Divided and Entwined*, linkffn(11910994): my favorite WIP fic. It's a significant improvement over [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5's]] previous work *Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, which also features the theme of Muggleborn resistance/uprising. The plot, characterizations, writing quality, and realism are much much better. I especially like the fact there are good and evil people on both sides of the conflict. The pairing is still unclear, as Hermione is agonizing over whether to engage in romantic relationships with both Harry and Ron.

*The Animagus Series*, linkffn(9863146;12076644): the first part, *The Accidental Animagus*, is finished, and I like it a lot. Both good and bad guys are smarter and more powerful. Dumbledore is not ineffective, Voldemort is not overly psychotic, and the Ministry is not too incompetent. Harry will most likely get together with Luna.

*[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]*: non-magic, sci-fi AU. Excellent writing, characterizations, and plot developments. The kids are a lot smarter and ruthless, Dumbledore is a brilliant strategist, but the Ministry in this story is far more pro Riddle than in canon. The general tone of the story is fairly light, but a few chapters are truly grim-dark. The author also goes into great technical details, even describing various computer hacking techniques.

*Strangers at Drakeshaugh*, linkffn(6331126): I really hope [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] can finish this fic soon.

*Blindness*, linkffn(10937871): very unique story as it explores lots of magical theories. Harry is overpowered, but he is also trying to solve complex social problems where his power is necessarily effective.

*The House of Potter Rebuilt*, linkffn(11933512): the title is a little misleading because the fic has little to do with 'Lord Potter' trope. Dumbledore is killed off early, and the story takes a very different path right off year 1. It's a great example of logical plot development.

*The Changeling*, linkffn(6919395): I like this Ginny even more. Year 6 is absolutely brilliantly written, and Ginny & Snape interactions are terrific.

*Escape*, linkffn(11916243), is a story about Harry/Hermione running away from a marriage law in year 6. Interesting premise, smart characters, and logical plot developments. Hermione is not flawless, and Harry will stand up to her if he thinks she's wrong.

*Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water*, linkffn(12076771): AU postwar & a little crossover with Kantai Fleet Girls. Voldemort was sensible enough to use one insignificant rock for his horcrux, which he dumped into the Atlantic. Unfortunately, that piece of rock got too close to the sunk Bismarck and corrupted the ship's spirit. The BismarckMort was thus born, along with all the firepower of the original battleship. Fortunately for our heroes, [[/spoiler][HMS Hood also rose from the depth of the Ocean in form of another Fleet Girl to do battle with Bismarck one more time]]. Harry, Hermione, and Ron started off in a three way romantic relationship.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

  The distance from war to a happy ending is vast and ugly. Close to a year after the final battle, our heroes make their final public appearance for the wizarding press.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** I've got a thing for crossovers, so...

Linkffn(Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock by Sage1988) is a ASOIAF crossover that deals with the series' political intrigue with a few splashes of action and hints of magic along the way. You don't need much of the other series' backstory to understand it too.

Another crossover, linkffn(The Lesser Kindness by Zeitgeist84), is made by a fellow redditor of the same psudonym, and one of the rare Witcher crossovers that reimagines the characters in the universe. Basically, the names and attitudes of the characters in the Witcher universe.

Another fic set in ASOIAF is linkffn(The Difference One Man Can Make by joen1801). The early parts of the fic focuses on base building, and just recently, the big bad was shown to the greater populace.

YMMV on the topic of linkffn(Warm Shadows by Storm0fCrows). It is a rare dc crossover that is relatively well written. It explores the DC world and Potter's interaction with it. You'll be surprised with the DC characters that the author featured.

Crossovers, got to love the new spin they put on things.

  It goes without saying that a witcher's life is one of thankless peril: brutal training, mutations, vagrancy, and all they get for it are insults and a few coins to tide them over to the next contract. Still, to be a witcher is to lead an interesting life, and Harry tries to make the most of his. AU featuring HP characters if they were born into the Witcher world.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  When Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire Dumbledore gives him a choice. Either participate in the tournament or lose his magic and leave Hogwarts. The Headmaster would never have guessed Harry would lash out and choose the latter. Minor Ron and Dumbledore bashing at the start. Wizarding War on a quicker timescale than in canon. H/Hr.
