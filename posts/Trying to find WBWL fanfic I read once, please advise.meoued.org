:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So this is more or less what I remember about the fanfic. First wbwl of course with Harry having a brother. Harry has had a very very hard life. Dumbledore makes constant attempts to secretly kill and/or make Harry miserable because of the horcrux. Harry fights the troll bare handed I think and gets stronger from doing so. Umbridge takes Harry's wand during the weighing of the wands (Goblet of Fire) after declaring it a Dark Artifact (Not sure if this happened in the same fanfic or a different one). I remember Cedric telling Krum about Harry's actions in Hogwarts and Krum saying something like "Can we just give him trophy now?" And the Power He Knows Not is I think Harry took some of his opponents strength such as the trolls strength and power from the dragon. And I remember Dumbledore finding out that Harry is the Real BWL


** I am pretty sure what you're talking about is Blessed Blood by AngelSlayer135

Edit : But this is not a WBWL story

*** Yep that seems to be the one. I knew I got a detail wrong but I thought it was the Umbridge part not the wbwl part. Thanks.

** This is the only thing I have come across that seems to match what you're describing, or at least most of it.

*** Though this was not the one I was talking about, as I have never read this one before now, I have rather enjoyed reading it. Thank you for your suggestion.
