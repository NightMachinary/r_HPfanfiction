Preferably where Ginny fucks up. I love Ginny, but one fic where she cheated on him with Zabini and sued Harry or something was great. Also, he hooked up with his lawyer, Malfoy. It was a ridiculous and good time. Anything along those lines would be great. I'm pretty open to most all pairings! No harems please. Thanks so much !!

*** This is a great example. I love how un-cracky and mature it was, as fucked up as the situation presented was. Thanks so much!!
