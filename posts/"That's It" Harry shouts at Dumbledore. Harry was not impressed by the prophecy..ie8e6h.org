End of 5th year. Dumbledore reveals the prophecy to Harry, but Harry could care less. "It basically just says that one of us is going to kill the other. I've known that since I ran into snakeface two years in a row! **** the prophecy, that would have happened anyway after he attacked Hermione in 2nd." Harry ranted. Dumbledore gaped, then twinkled most irritatingly. "Precisely how prophecies work, my boy." Dumbledore said.
