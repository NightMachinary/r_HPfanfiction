I'm screaming. I just read a fic where Diary!Riddle destroyed itself by regretting its own existence because it never got laid, and never will.

Please tell me there's other stories like this with just as ridiculous ways to destroy Horcruxes.

(The fic in question is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11640741][The Alternatieve]]. It's slash and Very OOC, but also ridiculous)


** Does absorbing one into the Sorting Hat and turning another into a chimpanzee count? If it does, my linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) is what you're looking for.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11102515/1/Uncle-Quentin-s-Spy][Uncle Quentin's Spy]], linkffn(11102515), they used a ritual to put Voldemort's soul pieces back into him, and made him far stronger as the result.

** Huh, I wonder if Ginny feeling strong regret would work while her soul was being absorbed.
