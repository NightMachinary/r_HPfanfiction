** I really like the premise here. It's interesting to think what would happen if Voldemort spared Lily or somehow Lily survived Godric's Hollow.

I read a fic with a similar premise (can't remember the name) but it was less dark and had a very unlikeable (in my opinion) Lily.

I like the mood of despair so far in the fic and the choice of the four main characters. I like the progression of Snily. I hope Lily fully regains her memories.

** This is my fic, which is a work in progress with real goals, a figured out ending, and eventual Snily without time travel shennanigans or apology. Happy to hear any feedback!
