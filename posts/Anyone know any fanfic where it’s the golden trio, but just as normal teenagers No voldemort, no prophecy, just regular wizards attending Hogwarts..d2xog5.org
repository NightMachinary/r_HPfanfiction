I don't mind if there's swearing or sex or anything, in fact I'd prefer it since that's what teenagers do

Thanks in advance


** I've read rogues bet, so if you could recommend ones like that?

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11746692][Five Facts You Won't Find in "Hogwarts, A History"]] linkao3(11746692), maybe? It's not /quite/ what you've asked for, since it's canon compliant and just a oneshot, but it doesn't involve Voldemort/the prophecy/etc and is just about them getting to be kids.

  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‘em all out.”
