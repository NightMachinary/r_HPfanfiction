I have been toying with the idea for a story using this prompt, and was wondering if anyone has read anything similar.

James and Lilly were never targeted as Harry was abducted straight from St Mungos the night he was born, along with a hand full of other magical children. The muggles behind the plot are filthy rich Americans with military connections that are interested in creating magical super soldiers. Harry is raised inside a secret facility with many other magical children taken from their families all over the world. Eventually breaking free, he is faced with adjusting to life in the real world, discovering a family he never knew existed, and managing his deep seeded hatred for muggles.

If there is anything else out there like this, I would be very interested in reading it. As far as my preferences lean, I will only ask for no slash. Thanks for reading my silly post!


** I've read one. it was still, James and Lily died, but someone discovered that Harry is making weird stuff happen. so they locked him somewhere. (some muggle scientist) it was terrible. like really really dark. he was locked for years, I don't think he could even talk. I believe it was mentor Snape eventually, since he was the one to take charge of him once Harry was found. sorry, don't remember the name. I think it was on ffnet.

I think I found it. it's called my dark protector. but it isn't actually about him being a lab rat, just aftermath.
