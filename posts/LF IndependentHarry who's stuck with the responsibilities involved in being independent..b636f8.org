You know, adult things. Managing his bank account, organising his diet, housekeeping, paperwork for his Apparation license, Saint Mungo's medical forms, on top of all his practice and schoolwork. And no, he doesn't have a house-elf to take care of the menial things.

Spoiler alert; the Dursleys don't hate magic and Harry 'just because', they're mad because of all the paperwork that comes with adopting a magical child. Yearly filings to get the stipend for raising him, forms to get him warded against magical diseases, and even more forms to get these wardings done at home because like heck they're going to St. Mungos. And so forth. In triplicate.


** An interesting idea. I just want to comment that rich people don't have to do a lot of that stuff for themselves as money can pay other people to do so. That's only if the Harry is rich though.

*** Harry Potter might be a poor orphan who wears scraps that aren't even fit to be called rags, but Harry Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Merlin has enough money that the goblins fellaciate him when he enters the bank because he has more gold in his multitude of vaults than the rest of the entire wizarding world combined.

**** Which must be great for the economy. How does a currency system even work when it has seemingly been around for so long without taking some galleons out of circulation?

** Honestly, as a logical person, I would have hired Dobby at the end of book 2. He's insane but damn he would be super helpful.

*** To be fair, Harry was a 12 years old Muggle raised wizard (so not really confortable with the idea of having a slave or whatever you would call an house elf) and said house elf had tried to expel/ hurt/ maim him just to "protect him".\\
Imagine the kind of things he could do to you with another order?
