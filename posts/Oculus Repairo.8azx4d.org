I've been thinking about something for a while now. What would happen if anyone were to cast oculus repairo on Harry without his glasses on? Would is eyes be able to see normally again? If so, why haven't they done this?


** Probably not, the repario is an all purpose repairing spell- the oculus an added bit to help with the visualization/spell effect, but- and it's a pretty big butt, we never see the medwitch use it on anyone. I figure if it worked like that it'd work on bones and shit too, bones really are simpler to repair than eyes, we muggles figured out casts ages before we managed laser eye surgery.

So, TLTR: Nah, that or Madam Pomfrey is a squib/likes to see people suffering.

Edit: Then again... Witches and wizards are stuck in the Victorian era, maybe they don't know enough about the human body or biology in general /to/ repairo people if the spell needs visualization of the damaged parts coming together/fixing... If a doctor became a wizard, maybe they'd manage to repairo everybody.

That or it's a simple "return to previous state" spell and it'd turn us into fetuses.

*** The Reparo spell apparently does work on injuries, but is prone to being very rough and leaving extensive scarring that proper healing spells can avoid.

*** There should be a fic where the ministry (or another authority figure) scar infants so that if they break the law they cast an overpowered reparo on them, making them infants fit for reeducation.

**** There sadly are. I say sadly, because it always turns into Harry, Snape, or Draco being turned into a baby, and one of those three being the one forced to raise the other, the plot line so predictable and boring- they eventually come to like/love each other, and if you're particularly unlucky it'll be a slash between the parent and child.

***** Oh.

Maybe I'll do it as a crack fic or a very small piece of a more serious one but this is just sad.

** No. It's not an eye healing spell.
