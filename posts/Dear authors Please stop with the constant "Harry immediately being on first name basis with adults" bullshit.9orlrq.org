If I have to read another fic where Harry (as a teenager or child) immediately is on a first name basis with Amelia Bones I'll blow my fucking brains out. I'll only accept it when he is adopted by her or is literally fucking her.


** I completely agree with you, but only because of the cultural background being British. I'm Danish myself and in Denmark we basically NEVER use last names when speaking to other people. Not strangers, not your teachers, not even your boss. The whole concept is funny to me, but I understand it.

****** Nah! We don't have that 'gotta show people respect instinctively just because they are older or in a position of power over you' - thing. Social equality is a big thing in Scandinavia and so we like to remain on even level with everyone. It's also pretty normal for inteviewers to refer to politicians by first name during personal interviews. I think the only reason we even refer to politicians by last name MOST of the time is because of foreign media.

Edit: Same for titles like doctor. I would absolutely never hear; "Doctor Jensen is ready for you now Mr/Miss." They'd say; "Lars is ready to see you."

  "Oh!" said Ronnie suddenly. "Professor Dumbledore --- I have a question!"

  "Yes?"

  "Why do you call Harry and Neville by their first names, but Hermione and me by our last names?"

  Dumbledore actually looked surprised at this, his eyebrows raising and his blue eyes twinkled behind his half-moon spectacles. "Heh," he finally said. "I must admit, that was not a question I had anticipated. Quite encouraging to know that my students are still able to occasionally surprise me! But to tell you the truth... I'm not quite sure. It may simply be the fact that I knew both Harry and Neville when they were very young."

  "You did?" said Harry, though Neville didn't seem at all surprised.

  "Why, yes. I knew both your parents quite well, after all. I was quite saddened to learn that --- well. In any case, I suppose it just feels more natural to use your given names. If you're not comfortable with this, I shall of course do my utmost to use your surnames for the future."

  "I don't mind!" said Neville hurriedly. "It's kind of nice, actually."

  "Yeah," Harry agreed. "You can call me Harry, Professor, I don't mind either."

  "Only ---" said Ronnie, turning pink again and averting her eyes. "Only I wouldn't mind if you, you know, wanted to call me 'Ronnie.' Not that you have to or anything, but, well, er, I think I would like it."

  "Hm," said Hermione, who didn't seem quite convinced that such informality between teacher and student was called for. After a few seconds, though, she smiled. "Hermione."

  Dumbledore's eyes actually looked like they were watering over for a moment, but his voice was steady as he said. "I'm quite touched. Yes, I would be most honoured --- Ronnie. Hermione." He nodded slowly at both girls. "Now... Shall we go and see if we can wake everyone up?"

** This might depend on your cultural context. In Australia we almost always call adults by their first names only- even from childhood. All of my primary school friend's parents were only ever their first names, never mr/mrs so and so. If it's a teacher that's different and they get their title, as do aunts/uncles etc, but for general adults you come in contact with it's their first names only.

*** To be fair, mate, I reckon it's where you're raised in Aus too. I'm from a rural city in NSW and we always addressed teachers by Mr/Mrs and surnames, never by first names until later teen years.

In Harry Potter though, you'd expect the children to always address adults by their surnames. Harry's consistency in calling Molly ‚ÄúMrs Weasley‚Äù in canon establishes this as well. I think OP just wanted to remain immersed in Pommy culture whilst reading fics. I don't really mind, myself, as long as it is consistent with the character.

**** Inches and miles, yes, because Britain is a bit weird about selective metric, and was even worse about it in the 90's. We use centigrade, both stone and kilograms for a person's weight (but no two people seem to use both), kilos for most other weight, miles for long distances, meters for short distances, except height which is usually feet unless you are at the gym or GP. Sewing and building materials are usually referred to as inches for width and meters for length (e.g. 2 by 4's or 60" wide fabric) though sold in metric. Drinks come in pints of beer, and litres of milk but we still call it pints of milk, no matter how much milk is actually in the container. Cider comes in gallons, but only if you buy it from the factory. Cooking is done in grams, millilitres, teaspoons, ounces, pounds, cups, and any other measurements we can rustle out if another countries pocket, except for Delia Smith, who has a couple of cakes that are just ratios of the weight of the eggs.

Makes perfect sense, obviously.

** This whole argument reminds me of an exchange I had when I was very young, around 5 or 6 years old. My grandmother used to have a neighbor that she'd been neighbors with for decades- since my father was a kid growing up there. My grandmother was obviously on a first name basis with the woman, whose name was Marie.So that's what I called her: "Marie;" I was introduced to her as that, so I had no reason to call her anything else. So, when I first met her, I went back home and started talking about "Marie" and my dad, who'd grown up next to the woman took a while to figure out who I was talking about: "Oh, you mean Mrs. Russo?"

‚Äã

Point is, that because I was introduced to her a certain way, I was on an informal first name basis. whereas my father who had known her for decades still used the formal address, probably because that's what he would have called her when he was a kid.

I always assumed the Mr. So and So was a boarding school thing. Maybe that is coming from the US where you get occasional use of last names by teachers, most students call their teachers by their titles (Professor So and So), although it isn't universal, and it is non-existent outside of the school environment.

Might be different in Britain though, I always thought the whole "*Professor* Snape Harry" to be a very weird tic for JKR to include in the series. Mostly ignored it or read it as 'Hermione/Dumbledore are overly formal and no-one else cares'

*** Depends where you're at in the US. I grew up in the south and we always address people as sir/ma'am or Mr/Ms/Mrs /insert last name here/ as a sign of respect. Several of my friends growing up were required to answer their own parents' requests by saying yes sir or yes ma'am. The only time we didn't address adults with this form of respect was when it was someone we did not respect at all and we made it obvious simply by using their first name.

**** It is definitely different in the US compared to UK/Aus. My partner is from north west US and he tends to call adults by their last names or say sir/ma'am. He even calls his college professors as 'Professor' or 'Professor Lastname' which is not really a thing here in Australia. To do that is quite formal.

Honestly if I introduced myself as Gold and anyone, kids or adults, proceeded to call me Mrs. Opal, I would feel that they were kinda rude and ask them to just call me Gold.

I had teachers in middle and high school who deliberately called all their students Mr/Ms LastName as a deliberate choice to treat their students like (young) adults and not children. To change expectations of behavior and achievement, etc.

** Why is this shit even upvoted this much. This complaint is definitely colored by cultural differences and even simple geographical or school/education differences. If you want to argue that HP takes place in Britain that's fine, except you conveniently forget that it also takes place in the Wizarding world, which is VERY different than the Muggle world, and is a FANTASY world. So an author can interpret it how they see it.

Honestly the only argument that may have merit would be "how did JK write it in the books". But if you argue from that aspect, than whats the point of fan fiction?

**** .... your response makes zero sense.

The OP made a post asking authors to stop the constant first name basis shit. By that logic, the OP is only interested in reading FF that caters to "their" cultural/geographical/education situation. In other words, what the OP is asking for basically comes off as, "cater your FF writing to my needs/views or its bullshit writing".

That's not remotely reasonable, and the OP's experiences, OR YOURS, are not indicative of everyones. I got a bit of both myself, as my high school had a policy of using your teachers first names, while up until that, it was always Mr. or Ms. "last name".

My point is that that view is not valid because FF is read by people from many cultural/geographical/education situations. Its not bullshit because in some situations being on first name basis is normal. If the OP doesnt like it, the OP can write their own FF, or search for authors who cater more towards their views. But the OP should not come in here, and act as if its "bullshit" to have Harry be on a first name basis, especially because the books themselves support BOTH sides of the debate.

** Wouldn't it depend? If you're reading a fanfic where he is an abused child, an adult might give him permission to call them by their first name as a way to make him more comfortable and them less like the "adults" who have been abusing him. If he becomes family in some way--not necessarily adopted, but family. I used to call close family friends by their first name, only sometimes giving them the "Aunt" or "Uncle" appellation.

But I agree, those "Harry is the most intelligent, most wonderful human on earth" fics where he is smarter and better than all adults that you normally see that in are very annoying.

** Actually, I also have a question around this.

Titles at Hogwarts confuse me a little. The teachers are all addressed as 'Professor' So and So, implying a certain level of higher education and study as well as respect for their teaching position. This is gender neutral and easy enough to understand.

But then you have Hagrid, who is never called Mr Hagrid by anyone as far as I can tell, but is also never referred to by his first name by anyone but the faculty. Sometimes I forget that Hagrid isn't his first name because it's bandied about with such informality all the time by the trio. Then, despite never having graduated Hogwarts and presumably not having the higher education levels of the other teachers, Hagrid is granted the title of Professor as soon as he starts teaching.

Filch, by comparison, is addressed as Mr Filch by the students, presumably by virtue of being a faculty member who is not a teacher.

Then you have Madam Hooch, and her title probably confuses me the most. She's sort of a teacher but not a professor, and Madam would imply she's a married woman, but isn't called Mrs Hooch. What does Madam imply here? If she was not married, would her title be Miss Hooch among the students?

Madam Maxine is similarly confusing because she's a headmistress, and no one addresses her as Headmistress or as Professor, but only as Madam, even though she most certainly has the education and position to warrant the Professor title.

What does it all MEAN?

** Well in some languages you can also add the informal /formal you to the list of difficulties. But in German, and mostly in synchronized films or series, we have people still using the formal address. I think in BBCs Sherlock both Sherlock and John used the formal you even years after moving in together. So there you have the complete opposite problem

*** I have a related question, that I hope you don't mind answering. I am currently studying German and was just watching the first HP movie in German. I was a bit confused why Harry instantly used the informal "you" with Hagrid. Was it just poorly translated or is there something I don't understand about the whole formal/informal system? It seems to me that when a child meets an adult they should use the formal form of address, unless instructed otherwise.

**** That's kinda complicated. Because the whole formal/informal system is complicated. But I think he uses the informal 'you', because he considers Hagrid as a friend and saviour. Hagrid also mentions that he knew his parents and in general you speak to friends of your parents with the informal 'you'. There is also the fact that it is a children's movie and it just fits better. Especially when you consider the role of Hagrid. It shows that Hagrid is a good friend.

**** Harry also addresses Hagrid right away with "you" in the book as well. Which is rude but a lot of children around that age do use the informal version unless otherwise instructed or with a teacher. I have taught children that age and I had to constantly tell them to use the formal form of address because apparently primary school teachers allow them the informal address. It is realistic, a lot of children don't understand the difference until they are around 11...but you are right that Harry should have used the formal you.

*** And in a lot of dubbed films and shows you then have the odd situation of people "siezen" each other but at the same time addressing each other by their first names. Which is not actually much of a thing in Germany.
