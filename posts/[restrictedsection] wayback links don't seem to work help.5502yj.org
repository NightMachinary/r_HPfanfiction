I found the archived post with the links to wayback machine, in an attempt to try and find more of my old favorite tried and true restrictedsection.org stories. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but I can't seem to read any of the stories that ARE there, and the ones that I try to search for apparently weren't archived so I can never read them again. T_T does anyone have any suggestions?


** Yeah, list the stories names and authors here so people can tell you if they have them.
