:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all, I've been trying to find this particular fic for a few days and I havnt been able to find it. I still remember some details, I'll list those below.

When Umbridge tries to catch the DA, they revolt and demand she be put on trial, as well as the inquisitorial squad.

After the trials, Dumbledore duels Voldemort, and dies defeating him. Dumbledore defeats Tom by trapping him in a transfigured prison (basicly a solid ball of rock encases Voldy.)

Voldemort uses the Dark Marks to power himself further, killing all his Death Eaters in the process.

All that happens in a few chapters, if you need more details, I still remember a fair bit about the story.

Thanks in advance guys!


** Got it!

  People rally to a just man, as Umbridge finds when the DA follows Harry to arrest her and demand that the Wizengamot try her for torture. When Dumbledore seeks atonement in battle against Voldemort Harry inherits his power and his responsibilities. Harry must learn to wield those powers in a world where law and justice have powerful enemies and many must atone for injustice done.

  Harry received some useful advice before the third task. The butterfly effect will be going full-speed. Not everyone is happy with the changes. Enjoy
