As above, does anyone know and good long tics where Harry joins voldemort after/causing him to win the war.

Don't mind what the relationship is between Harry and voldemort, lovers/adopted/just on the same side/slavery ect

Don't mind if it's during the war/After the war/massively AU ECT but would particularly like one that's set or has elements years after voldemort has won the war

Thanks :)


** Prince of the Dark Kingdom is probably the best written of what's available tbh. Very original AU with great new magicks, along with a nice plot and developed characters. The world-building is probably the best I've encountered in the context of fanfiction.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming)

Its part 1 of a 6 part series and the series itself is complete. It does start with harry during his first year at hogwarts, but the war starts a lot earlier (Year 4 I think?). It gets pretty dark halfway through, and not the normal dark where it's just harry casting crucio.

Harry's relationship with voldemort starts pretty early on as well.

There is not as much post-war stuff as you would probably have liked, but there are a few good chapters wrapping everything up and the epilogue is a good ending.

I know it's what you asked for but I'll do spoilers just in case, Voldemort does win the war

*** If you have a weaker stomach (not judging, it was really bad for me) I'd suggest you skip the chapter of the Diggle Family in book 6. Just a warning. And don't read the one-shot spin-off of Bellatrix and Tonks.

If you don't mind and has a stronger constitution, go ahed, its wonderfully written, even if its graphic as fuck.

** Like someone else said, in the sequels of Harry Potter and the Homecoming, Harry joins Voldemort and they achieve total victory. However, do not read it if you're not prepared for some really disgusting scenes. It is on the level of A Serbian Film.

** Here are a few that I have enjoyed:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6512582/1/Keep-Your-Enemies-Closer][Keep Your Enemies Closer]] - (no pairings) Voldemort finds out that Harry is his horcrux, wins the war during 5th year, and captures Harry. After that Harry must learn to walk a fine line between appeasing Voldemort to keep his friends alive and trying to maintain his own principles.

Here are a few where Voldemort won the /first/ war rather than being banished to existence as a wraith. They both are fics in progress, but each is moving towards the point of Harry supporting or being controlled by Voldemort.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14527497/chapters/33565593][The Philosopher King]] - (many minor pairings, eventual Harry/Voldemort) Harry grows up as a ward of the Malfoys in a world where the Dark Lord reigns supreme, having never descended into insanity.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12228520/1/Consuming-Shadows][Consuming Shadows]] - (working its way towards eventual Harry/Voldemort) Lilly raised Harry covertly in France after escaping Voldemort's fateful attack on Godric's Hollow. Unfortunately, the Triwizard Tournament brings Harry back to England with his Beauxbatons classmates, and he cannot avoid drawing the Dark Lord's attention.

  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.

  Voldemort wins and discovers his human horcrux. Attending a darker version of Hogwarts, Harry deals with new Pureblood regulations, vengeful classmates, a strange connection to Dark Marks and worst of all, Tom Riddle's mocking voice whispering inside his head. A story about two arch-enemies. AU dystopia. No slash. Minor het tensions.

** linkffn(The Nightmare Man by Tiro)

The regular Harry in this story technically joins the evil time travelling Harry, but the evil time travelling Harry hangs out with Voldemort, so it still counts.

Bonus points for time travel Harry corrupting regular Harry first. There are other stories about these people by the author, and they add more to the whole universe. There's even linkffn(The Nightmare Man's Journey by Tiro) which happens ten years after the first story I linked.
