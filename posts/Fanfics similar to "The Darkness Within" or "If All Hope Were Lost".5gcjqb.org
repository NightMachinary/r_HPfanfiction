Hi all!

So I've been a relatively casual harry potter fanfic reader for the past ... probably decade or so now. I don't keep up with fanfics, because i really hate the wait especially when I start a story only to find out that it was abandoned. Anyways, two of the very first harry potter fanfics were [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][The Darkness Within]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/971021/1/If-All-Hope-Were-Lost][If All Hope Were Lost]]. These were both stories that got me through the lull in between waiting for the official books and these made me fall absolutely in love with the harry potter unvierse, desspite it not being really official.

Does anyone have any recommendations similar to these kinds of stories?

*** The fics aren't even that similar, so I have no idea what he wants from us.
