Like, the most read stories of all time on fanfiction? I know other websites keep track of their top but I don't know how/if Fanfiction itself does. EDIT: Guys, I have been an avid fanfic reader for about 10 years now, I know all of the big names, heck, I was reading them as they came out. I was just wondering if there is a way to actually see the most read stories because I couldn't find any way. It was out of pure curiosity


** Probably if you sort by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10][favourites]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=5&r=10][follows]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=3&r=10][reviews]] you'll get a fairly good idea. You can't sort by, or even find out, view count though AFAIK.

E: Although these are by no means the best fics.

*** Its worth mentioning that, with all of these three, the most preferable would be by faves. Considering a completed story couldn't get anymore follows compared to on-going/abandoned stories and the review count is just based on how active the author is in his/her author notes.

There's been a trend of late for users to add a story to their Follows instead of Favorites if they want to be able to track it down again but don't want to be judged for bookmarking it as a Fave.

My take on it is to try sorting by each and see where the top contenders land in comparison, if you're trying to judge 'popularity'. If you're looking for the best-written fics, you're better served by asking around in forums (like Reddit) for opinions based upon similar interests.

*** I agree that these can become skewed rather easily as series are finished. Take A Black Comedy (a story I read back in 2007 when it was being updated), it gets significantly less follows or reviews simply because it is finished. Follows and Reviews depend heavily on interest at the moment, rather than all time. As for favorites, many fan fiction apps require you to favorite a story to download it (Highly recommend Pocket Fiction. Love that app) so even that I think can be a little funky to base off of. It'd be really cool if fan fiction could post a Best Of section just to see which fics have been read the most.

**** I have to say I'm pretty hesitant to leave many reviews on stories finished long ago -- for one, I feel like I'm talking to a void, or someone who could care less because I'm commenting on a story they haven't thought about in years.

** The ALexandra Quick Series, Backwards with a Purpose, Nightmares of Future's Past, My immortal are all pretty amazing.

*** While I appreciate the recs, That isn't really what I was looking for. I was curious what fanfics are the best based on traffic and pure reads.
