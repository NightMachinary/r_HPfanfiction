There was this fanfic I read where Harry and Ginny's children and Ron and Hermione's children are victims of immoral testing after muggles have won the war against wizards and I think the story focuses on Rose as the main character.. I looked for it few years back but couldn't find it. Bit of a long shot but I thought I'd ask here. Pretty sure the story was discontinued but the setting was pretty amazing and I always wanted to read it again and maybe build on it. Anyone know anything abt it??


** Unfortunately I'm not aware of this exact fic, but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971), has kind of a similar outcome.
