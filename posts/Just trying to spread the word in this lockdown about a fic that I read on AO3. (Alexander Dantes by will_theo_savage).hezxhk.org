I recently came across a wonderful fic on AO3, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24499420/chapters/59138692][Alexander Dantes]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/will_theo_savage/pseuds/will_theo_savage][will_theo_savage]]. It is a fairly large fic, (>100K words), about a Ravenclaw muggle-born who gets bullied and is treated harshly by the Wizarding world.

â€‹

*Warning: The fic has dark themes.*

He is no Mary-Sue, but he learns, braves through hardships, and grows with time. I was genuinely able to relate to Alex. I was so into some parts that I had to calm myself and tell myself that it is just a story.

Here is the link for the first chapter: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24499420/chapters/59138692]]

P.S.: The author told me that he will be writing a sequel to this fic soon. Looking forward to it soon!
