Every time I read a fic and a character asks Harry for his name and he has to make one up he says Hadrian Evans. Why Hadrian and not Harold? Where did Hadrian come from? I personally hate the name Hadrian and would love to see more fanfics where Harry calls himself Harold or James or literally anything else except Hadrian ( with reservations)

** Hadrian is a Roman name like lots of names in canon (Severus, Minerva, Luna etc) and it also ties in with the use of Latin in Harry Potter. Usually when a writer wants to imply an old history of (pureblood) magic or mysterious powers they use Hadrian, the name Harry is just too ordinary. Like there a lots of people named Tom, there are also lots of people named Harry.

To be honest, Harrold sounds like an old man's name to me, not the name of a child but I'm fine it. I think James Evans is a bit on the nose for a pseudonym but there is nothing really abhorrent about it.

Personally I despise when writers give him a name that doesn't start with an "h" (It is kind of quintessential for me even though it is a bit illogical, any other letter and it might as well be just an OC), is just something really obnoxious (I've seen Hyppolyta once in a fem!harry fic and that was her real name) or really American (Someone used Sean once and I laughed out loud and immediately closed the fic)

American? Sean is one of the most Irish names Harry could possibly use. And while I don't know the context of that story, I can easily imagine a context existing where using an Irish name would make sense.

**** The context was Harry who grew up in France and no doubt Sean came from the writer's American background (irish-american influence or not) considering the spelling.

*** I agree. I used it in one of my first fics in this fandom and then yesterday someone asked me for the link and I had forgotten if used it so I was embarrassed.

But honestly I think it's just the nature of fanon that some things will feel refreshing when you write it (when I was writing that fic I saw more Harolds and Henrys and Harrisons) but you're not the only one who thinks so, and momentum builds and then suddenly everyone is using it.

I agree about H though. For some reason that's the most important thing

** I use Moon+ Reader Pro on my phone to read fics and it has a Name Replacement feature, so I generally change Harry's name whenever the writer renames him as something too annoying. Except, Hadrians are generally super annoying and keep trying to get everyone to call them Hadrian, so I keep ending up with sentences like, "Harry! My dear boy!" "My name is Lord Harry Et Cetera, Et Cetera, Et Cetera, not Harry, Fumbleboor! I don't have to listen to you!"

** Hadrian was a very cool alternative for Harry. Like it was stated earlier, people felt Harry was too simple, or common or more of a nickname.

And of the alternatives, when I started reading fanfic, there was Harrison and Harold, both of which kind of paled in comparison with Hadrian.

It's a Roman name, it's the name of an emperor, and it attached a certain level of prestige to the character when they used it. Plus it has the added advantage of being old, as in not an old man name, but an old name which purebloods are likely to use.

However like the general trope, it has been overused and now it's kind of lame, but I'm pretty sure it's attractive for people who are just getting into fanfic now.

At this point I'm not in favour of name changes in general but few authors agree with me so I just ignore it and go. However if I read a fic where he has more than 4 names, I drop it.

*** I don't get the dislike of ordinary common name.

As if a name means anything when it comes to a person.

Some extremely obscure authors wrote a thing about it in a play that absolutely no one had ever read, seen or even heard about. And absolutely no stories had been inspired by said play.

So, I guess I'm not that surprised that people didn't learn that a name is just a name and that....hm say a rose would smell as sweet by any other name. (Rose is an example taken totally and completely randomly, of course).

**** Nothing wrong in that at all. In my own fic I've just left his name as Harry.

The people who opt for Hadrian etc etc. generally also use names like Nightshade, Drake or use Greek words that mean light, justice, darkness, death etc for weapons.

Nothing wrong in either. It's just preferences of the author, which is cool, cause again, fanfic.
