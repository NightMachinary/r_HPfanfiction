The room of requirement is normally forgotten apart from being used as the room of hidden things and a basic classroom for the DA, so are there any stories were they munchkin the Room of requirement for all its worth?

Like useing it to contact sirius in fifth year instead of breaking into umbridges office and useing it to magicaly enhance there learning and all round abuseing the room for all its worth, instead of forgetting it outside of the DA meeting.

I understand why they didn't use the RoR more in canon but the plot induced stupidity is still annoying, like why did Harry not try to use it to at least help him learn Occlumemcy.


** its used as a trainingsroom in the beginning of linkffn(2488754), i dont really enjoy it though

*** This is one of those fics that starts incredibly rough but really improves to good levels after about 8 chapters. Worth a read to see the beginning of a lot of tropes in the fandom if nothing else.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.
