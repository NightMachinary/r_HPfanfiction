It'd be cool to see a fic where Harry - or someone else - travels back in time, but their actions alter the timeline and their future knowledge becomes much less applicable. Thanks


** "But, but Daphne Greengrass in the future became a Death Eater! She tortured your sister to death!"

Ron looked over at Harry and Daphne, the latter trying her best to excavate his tonsils with her tongue. He looked away and at Hermione, who was still goggling and spluttering at the sight.

He sighed. "Probably a case of being spurned causing bitterness? I dunno."

"How can you be okay with this! She tortured, mutilated, and murdered your siater!"

Ron looked at her flatly. "No, She hasn't done any of those things, and I'm pretty sure my sister is alive and well and snogging that prat two seats behind you."

Hermione whipped her head around to see, yes, a very much alive Ginny Weasley, not Ginny Potter, was snogging Dean Thomas not two seats from her right.

"But... but--!"

"I'm pretty sure I'll be named a godfather and you a godmother at this rate," Ron said dryly, shaking his head at how quickly intimate Harry and his new beau had become.

Turns out Harry loved physical affection and touching.

"But..." Hermione said, her voice growing weaker as the display continued. "I... uh..."

"Oi! Hands above the waist, Thomas!"

Wait really? I usually don't mind kb0 but Harry complains about someone saving him time, pain, death and misery? He complains that someone else chose to kill Voldemort?

Or did she manipulate him into doing things? I could see him being mad at being manipulated, just not Voldemort being taken care of removing his choices...?

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  Hermione thought the war was well over. She divorced, changed careers, moved on with her life... Until a workplace accident sent her back to the heat of things. Despite knowing better, she couldn't stop herself from breaking her own rules.
