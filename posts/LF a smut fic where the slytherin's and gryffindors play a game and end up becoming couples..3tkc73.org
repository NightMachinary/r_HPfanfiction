I believe it was over 200,000 words and was on fanfiction.net. The pairings I can remember were: HarryxTracy GinnyxBlaise and HermoniexDraco? There were others. they would go into private rooms with each other then be called back into a main room at the end of a specific amount of time.

thanks

EDIT: Randomly found it when I wasn't looking for it. Called Eros and Psyche.
