I'm looking for recs similar to NoFP. I've already read Backward With Purpose. So what's your favorite in the same vein?


** If you're looking for the comedy version of those, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again]] is a great read.

** If we're talking time travel fics in general, I would have to say Delende Est would be my go to fic. I've read it a number of times, and it's perfect until about three quarters of the way through, and even then it's far from bad, it just lags a bit for a while. The sequel, Parabellum is coming along fairly well, but it isn't quite the same lightning strike that DE was.

** "The End and the Beginning" its a Harmony fic and MuggleDad says outright in the authors notes that NoFP inspired it. I think it's one of the better written ones out there, MuggleDad has a gift (in my view) of capturing emotions of characters and making you feel at home.
