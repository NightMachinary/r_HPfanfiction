Ones without too much bashing, and without Harry getting abused.

I like those too so if there are especially good ones can you list them as well?

I really like the Harry isn't BWL or gets set aside for his brother type of fics.


** Linkffn(5353809) is a really well known one with not much bashing.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

*** This story is amaaaazing but there is a lot of James & Lily bashing, which might not be what OP wants. They super suck in this story though so it's deserved!

Also there is definitely Dursley abuse (though it's explained in the most recent chapters).

  Everybody has a Wrong Boy Who Lived story in them, and everybody has a Slytherin!Harry story. This is mine for both. AU, currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NOTE: There will be NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year.

** linkffn(AntiHyphen) is pretty much the only not-BWL story aside from Santi's that I've liked. Most not or wrong BWL stories tend to have way too much abuse and or way too powerful a Harry.

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance, hiatus

  Ellie Potter was never the boy who lived, she just happened to be in the same room at the same time, and yet she can't help but grow and notice that it is never Harry Potter who must fight his own demons. Side fic/Spin off to "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus"

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.
