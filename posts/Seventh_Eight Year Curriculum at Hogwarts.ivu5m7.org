What do you think Hogwarts students would study in their seventh (or possibly eight) year? What would they learn in Charms, Transfiguration, DADA, Potions and Herbology? I am writing an Eight Year!AU fanfiction and I'm not really sure what to talk about when it comes to the classes.

We know that at the beginning of the sixth year, students chose the classes they wanted to take, based on their marks from OWLs. The curriculum was NEWT--level, so they studied more difficult things than before; practiced non--verbal spells in nearly every class where wands are used (DADA, Transfiguration, Charms), brewed advanced potions and worked with more dangerous plants. I also think it was mentioned in The Order of Phoenix that the Protean Charm is a NEWT--level thing, but I don't think they studied it in The Half--Blood Prince.

Also, if the students that didn't go to Hogwarts in The Deadly Hollows and the eight year was not a “repeating” year to them, would they have more problems with for example non--verbal spells than others, who practiced it previous year already?


** I don't think there is any established curriculum, but in analogy to studies at university, I think it would be a neat idea that newt students work on a single project in every class for the last year.
