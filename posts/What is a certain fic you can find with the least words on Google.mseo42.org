I searched; scarf, Harry Potter, fanfiction, ginny, hadrian and got strange reflections by lequin (the fic I was looking for. And was wondering if anyone else got super lucky on their first Google attempt.


** After a quick test, it seems that "Fanfic + Ebony" are enough to get "/My Immortal/" as the first result (the fandom does not even need to be precised).

Truly a masterpiece that deserve to be easily found.

** Searching the word

“Fericiousal”

Leads to chapter one of “Harry Potter and the lightning child” by justbored21 on Ff.net

So I think this is the winner
