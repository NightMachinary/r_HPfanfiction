What harry potter fact sounds like fanon, but is actually canon?


** Ron Weasley's pet rat is actually the guy who betrayed Harry's parents and has lived in the same dorm for 3 years.

The owner of the Hogs Head is actually Dumbledores Brother - and hear me out - he has a portrait and behind that portrait a secret passage leads to the Room of Requirement

** There were people living (even without the Philosopher's Stone) well over even the magical-extended life span: Armando Dippet was apparently [[https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/a/a4/Armando_Dippet_-_HPLE-PA.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160807183131][really born]] in 1637 and died 1992. I couldn't believe it.

Hmm, now writing this, it came to me that he died in the same year Flamels were supposed to die. Coincidence? I don't think so.

And yes, he was alive during the First Wizarding War (even in the first year of Harry Hogwarts' years) and we don't know anything about his life post-Hogwarts. It is a shame, there are no stories about it.

*** There was also an old woman when Harry took his exam, don't remember her name, and Dumbledore mentioned he remembers her from /his own exams/ and she looked already that old back then.

Honestly, besides Horcruxes, the possibility of someone becoming a lych doesn't seem so far-stretched to me.

**** [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Griselda_Marchbanks]] ... but yes, she was long-lived, but I don't think she was living beyond what I called the magically-extended life span.

*** Dippet's lifespan is movie canon, and marginal at that, but I like it so much I'm keeping it.

**** Yes, but she didn't brag that he gave it to anybody, and even less specifically to Arthur:

#+begin_quote
  They headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley was reading the front page of the Daily Prophet with a furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she'd made as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly. (HPPoA, chapter 5, “The Dementor”)

***** We don't hear that she gave it to Arthur though, or anyone for that matter.

Still, I hadn't recalled that, but it really gels with this wild theory I have that Molly Weasley is low-key a monster.

*** I feel that this is up to interpretation. The wizarding world being what it is, I wouldn't be surprised if she had, although I doubt with malicious intent. However it could equally been, for example a dare with her other dorm mates. They would each take a few minutes worth of potion keyed to someone who wasn't in the room, and then when it had worn off they laughed about how stupid it made them look. You could have something similar done formally if you want to make the teachers responsible. A one off lesson to help recognise if you or your friends are being potioned to help protect each other. I feel that would make a great (and educational) story to tell your children.
