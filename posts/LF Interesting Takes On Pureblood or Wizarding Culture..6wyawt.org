  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

***** Canon (7th book) seems to imply that Hogwarts is the only option in Britain. At least Remus makes it sound like that, when the mandatory attendance law is discussed.

As for Pottermore - /Mahoutokoro/ never happened. I mean, Beauxbatons is bad enough, but that...

** In my story "Patron", I did make up a pureblood culture that wasn't - as in so many other stories - "old England with a bit of magic added", but the result of 300 years of spent developing apart from muggles. The wizards are in parts far more progressive than muggles (they consider them prudes, for example), and in other parts far more archaic, but in all aspeccts far more magical than canon. They use magic all the time in daily life, for convenience and comfort, and when they talk about "robes", it can mean anything, from muggle-style robes (but laced with all sorts of enchantments) to clothes made from illusionary fire (or actual fire with a flame-freezing charm). And in a departure from other tropes, they may have archaic laws still in effect, but their enforcement is hampered or prevented by social pressure and custom. And finally, there's not one monolithic culture, but a mainstream one, with a few subcultures - like a sect who thinks Magic shouldn't be used for trivial things, and a sect who takes the religion (cobbled together from 'ancient sources' after the SoS, which means, mainly made up) far more seriously than the mainstream wizards. That's just Britain, though - France has a different culture, as does Bulgaria, Turkey, the Balkans, Jamaica, or Scandinavia. Muggle culture is, with few exceptions, seen as a fad - a concert with Magic used by the performers is simply a class above a muggle concert, books are books, muggle night clubs simply a safer and inferiour alternative to wizard clubs during a war.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** /A relevant comment in this thread was deleted. You can read it below./

linkffn(Dodging Prison and Dodging Prison) has a fantastic AU wizarding culture. It uses canon knowledge everywhere, but the author expands on it significantly to make it more "believable".

F.e. there is something called the "polyjuice defense" in that fic:

> "It's a legal defence. Because polyjuice isn't illegal and is readily accessible for the right price, it's impossible to convict someone of a crime with eye-witness testimony alone, unless you can catch the person red handed and then hold them under surveillance for an hour to make sure they're not under polyjuice."

Or how the wizarding children spend their holidays:

>Close to three dozen wizards and witches zipped about above them on broomsticks --- some of them looked younger than they were. [[https://www.resavr.com/comment/lf-interesting-takes-on-9468574][[Continued...]]]
