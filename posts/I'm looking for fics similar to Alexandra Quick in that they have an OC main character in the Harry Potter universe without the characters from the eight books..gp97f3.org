I want to read school fics set in the HP universe but not those involving the Marauder's or Harry's schoolmates. It could be set in Hogwarts or Ilvermony (if long and we'll written I would be very interested in this) or a non cabin school.


** Currently working on one of these. I've yet to post the first chapter, but I have the first 50,000ish words written. I like to write a bunch before I post anything haha, helps me go back and edit for consistency.

Basic plot is the late Middle Ages, before the statute of secrecy, poor peasant girl is a muggle born who gets the opportunity to go to Hogwarts, but has to find a way to afford her supplies. Backdrop in the muggle world is the war of the roses. As she grows up she's forced to take a side in the war. I'm planning a 2 or 3 part series hopefully.

** Most of these will be next-gen; I don't know why there are so few OC stories set before the Marauders' time. Keep in mind that aside from AQ, next-gen stories with the canon kids tend to be better than those featuring OCs. A lot of these are a little rough in terms of writing.

linkffn(Muggle at Large) - weird but it was entertaining

linkffn(Briallen Bevin and the Snatcher's Cave) - a pretty standard American school fic, but not as good as AQ

linkffn(Lion, Eagle, Badger, Snake) - very good. Probably some of the most memorable Quidditch writing in all of fanfic.

linkffn(The Belmont Legacy) - can't remember if this has canon next-gen characters, but I think it doesn't. Very good.

linkffn(Nimbus Albacore: The Curse of Blood) - I think this is all OC, main character is Filch's grandson.

linkffn(The Divide by Beedle) - not sure if this has canon next-gen characters, not that great but a light read.

linkffn(Hide My Name With Fear) - I don't even remember reading this but I have it decently rated, set at Hogwarts well into the future.

That's all I've finished in this category that's worth recommending, hope you enjoy some of them!

  A muggle scientist stumbles upon the Wizarding World and refuses to let the discovery go. Technology meets magic in a dangerous adventure through the Magical Americas. She just might reinvent what it means to be magical... that is, if she doesn't get caught first.

#+begin_quote
  Slytherin House isn't what it used to be. There are barely enough children to fill a classroom, let alone a House Table, and the Quidditch captain is a muggle-born fourth year. For a new generation starting at Hogwarts as the war drifts into memory, there's far more to learn about the four Houses than they could ever have imagined (prequel to Snake Bites).

Two students from either side of a war are driven together by events that will change Britain, magical and non-magical, forever.
