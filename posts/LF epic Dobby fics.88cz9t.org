I remember reading several different fics that i cant remember the names of, where Dobby decides to help Harry win the war by robbing the DeathEaters blind, i think i even remember one where Dobby decided to help Harry by slipping voldy a draught of living death, then putting him in a stone coffin, and dumping him in the ocean. So any fics where Dobby is just being awesome and doing epic, awesome stuff for his favorite wizard? Link your favourites:)


** There is one where he builds WW2-era planes and uses them against Death Eaters. linkffn(4571312)

  There's only so far you can push anyone before they'll push back, and Harry's been pushed too far. Between that and Dobby's form of mad proving contagious, things are about to get violent. ABANDONED.

** I think I remember one where he time travelled into the past and kidnapped baby Harry from the doorstep of the dursleys. As years go, they keep running from the order as they keep tring to find baby harry. It might have been deleted though. It was a short fic and it was close to ten years since I read this.
