** So, yesterday, I [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4j7ex5/how_many_fanfiction_tabs_do_you_currently_have/d34anj1][posted]] about how I use an Excel sheet to keep track of the stories I plan to read (or re-read). A few people asked to share the list, so I organized it to make it more readable. Then, I realized that I might as well just post it on the subreddit, since many users seem to be constantly looking for more fics to read.

The Reading List is divided into five main parts. The first part consists of stories written by people in the fandom that I consider my friends. The second part is what used to be my old Favorites list on my FFN account, which I plan on re-reading sometime in the future. The last three parts are general stories that I have yet read, divided into high, medium, or low priority. The priority is not an indicator of a story's literary quality. Rather, it shows stories that have been recommend by people I know or those that I found to be more intriguing.

The list is still incomplete, with some major work left to be done. The “Oneshot” and “Other Fandoms” lists will be completed once my exams are over. Also, I plan on constantly updating it with new stories that seem interesting or are recommended. Finally, I will create a separate list where I read, rate, and sort the stories on my Reading List. That way, I would be able to remove old stories and add new ones without “losing” any of them in the process. A lot of the stories on the list are old/well-known and there aren't many new fics yet. Still, some people might find it useful, which is why I'm posting it here.

Have fun reading, everyone!

*** Actually, I created something kinda similar to this for all the movies I own. Been thinking about converting it to a version for fanfics. However, my Excel file has the added functionality of randomly choosing any movie if I just want to watch something and can't decide what. Would be pretty easy to convert that to a fanfic set up, I think. If anyone is interested, I could hook you up with the movie spreadsheet if you want to tinker.

**** That's awesome! I'd love to see that. Would be damn convenient, especially since I haven't watched too many movies.

***** PM me an email address, and I'll send it to you. Works pretty simple. Add movie and if it has been watched, press button. Button updates a random cell, so the spreadsheet as a whole updates, and a random movie is chosen. If you wanted to convert it to fanfic, it would really just be a few text changes, really.

** I approve of any and all spreadsheets.

Though I do have to say, you really need to read The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond, if just for the brilliance of the Dumbledore.

Anyways, if anyone wants to rec stories that they've enjoyed, feel free.

**** I think I saw it under low? Which is why I mentioned it. The soul bond turns people away from it, I think. But it is the only fic where it isn't all happy go lucky, everything is right with the world soul bond garbage. So if something like that keeps you (in the more general sense here) from reading this fic, dive in anyways. And if you think it sucks, feel free to blame me for recommending it, haha.

***** Obligatory link to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love]] for mentioning soul bonds in which everything doesn't go smoothly.

**** If you're into Hermione/x you should check out Shaya's fic recommendation [[http://shayalonnie.weebly.com/fic-rec-list.html][here]] I usually will pick by pairings and honestly some of my guilty pleasures are Hermione/Severus Snape or Hermione/Tom/Voldemort.

That's just a general outline. There are some that are definitely more standouts than others though.
