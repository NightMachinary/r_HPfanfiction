House elves can teleport to any location without alerting any wards. Dobby was able to get in Hogwarts, a school that is in a way a fortress, he also got in Malfoy Manson, a place most likely was laced with traps. He also could teleport two or three people with him. What's your opinion?


** Pretty sure wards are fanon
