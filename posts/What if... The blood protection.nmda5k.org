what if the blood wards were really powerful and everything and everyone who did harm to Harry suffered from it? like a karma curse. It could be some disaster or the exact same thing happened to the agressor

Starve harry? You gonna feel his hunger Beat him up? You feel his pain too Ak him? The curse comes right back to you

And it could be positive too everytime madame Pomfrey fix him up she feels better younger Things like that.


** That could lead to some unpleasant positive feedback loops. They mistreat Harry, bad things happen to them, they blame Harry and abuse him even more, repeat. By the end of it you have one barely alive Harry Potter and a set of Dursleys who died in a very unfortunate fire.

The protections would have to very direct in causing revenge to prevent this. They would need some degree of sentience, probably.

** Oh my, this has some... interesting consequences.

Dumbledore, Hagrid and McGonagall placed him at the Dursleys. They should feel something too. Maybe not the full brunt of it, but enough to give them some pain over the years.

Pettigrew? oooooh boy, he would be suffering. Meanwhile, all of the people in power who was behind throwing Sirius in Azkaban without trial and/or want to keep him there are suffering.

Voldemort? Yeah, he's slowly suffering the whole time. Instead of trying to come back to life, he's trying to convince his followers to put him out of his misery. Really hard to do when you have a bunch of horcruxes and one incomplete one you didn't know about.

You can call it Harry Potter and the Deus ex Machina.

****** "Harry..." the matron said with shiny anime eyes.

"Madam..." Harry sighed like a love-sick puppy.

"Call me Poppy."

"Poppy... my love. I just realized that Poppy Potter has a ring to it."
