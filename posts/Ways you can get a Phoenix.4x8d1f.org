I've came across three ways Harry has gotten a phoenix in fics I have read.

1. Harry has a pure heart, so obviously a Phoenix would immediately bond with him.

2. A baby phoenix is born, and Harry is the first thing it sees. The phoenix bonds with Harry because she saw him first.

3. Dumbledore gives a hatchling from Fawkes to Harry as a present, and the phoenix likes Harry and eventually bonds with him.

Anyone have other ways they've seen Harry or somebody else bond with a Phoenix?


** My favorite is that the birth of a phoenix is when great evil is bested by a heart of pure intent. Dumbledore got Fawkes when he defeated Grindelwald in the legendary duel. They are apparitions of righteous, purifying flame and guide those who are champions of nature's justice.

*** I remember reading a fic where Dumbledore and Ollivander were traveling, and they saw a bunch of criminals keeping a few phoenixes hostage. Dumbledore and Ollivander drove the criminals off and Fawkes, from then until Dumbledore's death, followed Dumbledore around. Dumbledore in the fic said that Fawkes could leave him whenever he wanted.

But concerning the method you have, how would Dumbledore obtain the egg? Or did Fawkes just fireflash to where Dumbledore was after he defeated Grindelwald?

**** Well, a phoenix is one of the many representations of eternity and the divinity of the sun; heat and flames. It represents eternal cycles and the immortality of life itself.

It could be argued that a phoenix just enters reality whenever it sees fit and however it sees fit.

Maybe Fawkes came flying from the ashes of battle to cry onto a exhausted Dumbledore and to give the pure heart the power to let mercy guide his doing. Maybe Grindelwald only sits in Nurmengard because Fawkes calmed Dumbledore and held him off a path of blood-stained vengeance.

I always liked the thought that phoenix are not immortal, but apparitions of eternity - of something far greater than mortal life. They do not die and they are not born, they just /are/.

**** Well, I think the mythology behind them is leading a lot of people to interpret them that way.

Roman and hellenian authors have written them as being made/birthed from the ashes of Osiris.

In catholic symbolism the phoenix was a symbol for eternity and the everburning flame of god.

Not this fandom, mythology itself is hell bent on making them, maybe not gods, but definitely at home in the realm of the divine.

You don't see people feeding lions tea and crumpets because they symbolise nobility do you?

You don't see foxes training spies at MI6 because they symbolise cunning do you?

So /why/ is the fandom up in its arse about phoenixes?

There is no mention in canon of Dumbledore getting any extra street cred or political power or popularity /because/ he has a phoenix. Its just something the fandom cooked up. Heck even the belief that Dumbles is the only one who has a phoenix is totally fanon.

There's a Quidditch team that owns a phoenix called Sally for Christ's sake. Ollivander must own an entire flock for those wands he keeps making. He must pluck them clean every day. How rare can they be!

Maybe they're too high mantainence and that's why they're not more common pets. Maybe they need to eat apples dipped in liquid gold. Maybe that's why only rich as shit people can afford them.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not against creative license or fanlore or anything. But it just annoys me when people can't tell the difference between fanon and canon, and argue like chickens all over it.

****** It's not just symbolism. I don't have time for a debate right now, but unlike regular animals that symbolise values in mythology, phoenixes are themselves mythology. Like dragons or unicorns they are in fantasy stories as manifest supernatural beings. Of course a creative author can subvert that trope and make phoenixes ordinary birds (low fantasy often turns myth into beasts, as Harry Potter did with dragons), but Rowling didn't do that, because /when a phoenix gets sad, it can stopper death/.

Unlike dragons, which are in universe but lizards that can spitfire and which are imbued in fanon with supernatural properties, phoenixes are supernatural even in canon.

** First things first, is that I don't think Phoenix's are inherently "good" creatures or however you want to quantify it. They are magical creatures, and simply exist outside the realms of human morality. They can, however, have their own characteristics which are likely influenced by their owners.

Secondly, I think my favorite instance of Harry getting a phoenix is from the fic "Harry Potter and Broken Wands". It's a terrible fic by all measures, but I like how phoenixes were "forged" in it. Or at least, I like the concept behind it even if the execution was bad.

Yeah to be honest, if Phoenixes inherently pick good people, you have to explain two things: (1) why does your universe have an objective "good" (and if so why does it overlap with the morality of 1990s Western European society), and (2) if someone is marked as objectively good, how can there be people who openly disagree with them.

I'd love to see a fic grapple these questions (maybe morality is shaped by some deity), but I haven't really seen any that do so.

Grindelwald, like many other horrible people, possessed an objective desire to do good. His ultimate goals were altruistic. He did not go about them particularly well ... but if an objective desire to do good is the only thing that matters, why didn't he attract a phoenix? He was flawed, sure, but not necessarily more so than Dumbledore.

I am arguing that an objective desire to do good is essentially meaningless, contrary to your claim that it is both clear and how phoenixes choose their partners.

Adding to my previous point, Grindelwald's desire to do good was not only flawed due to his own desires to see /himself/ at the top, which meant that he wanted to do good for selfish reasons, and not for altruistic ones.

Also, "Desire to do good" is never meaningless. "Good" itself might be meaningless, but the selfless desire to do so is never meaningless.

If good is meaningless, then so is the desire to do so. You might as well say the desire to do /thrp/. It tells you /nothing/ about an individual's motivations or behavior, just about how they justify the things they do. And is that really a criteria which a phoenix would use, or which would lead to them being perceived as somehow linked with goodness?

See, now you're getting into objective morality. Grindelwald wanted to do good; his ultimate aim was to demolish the statute of secrecy and improve the world - he even called it "The Greater Good". Check on [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald][the wiki]]. Maybe he wanted to be at the top, but why is that flawed or evil? Or, more importantly, why is that flawed or evil in a system without objective morality?

Once you open the doors to subjective morality, everything else comes crashing down. Why do genocidal tendencies mean that he wasn't trying to do good? (Not that he actually had those - he allied with Hitler, sure, but there's no indication that he himself was genocidal, and his motivations were to protect against cruelty and xenophobia).

#+begin_quote
  I'm saying that he didn't encounter a phoenix, and hence he didn't own a phoenix.

And I'm saying that if he had encountered a phoenix, and phoenixes use the criteria you've proposed, he would have had a phoenix. And that, friend, tells me that your idea has flaws, because the myth that phoenixes are good would fall apart pretty quickly in such a world.

No its not. In a system of objective morality, good and evil collapse as concepts, since the inner moral compass is different for every person. But a person's desire to do something that he himself perceives as good, is not meaningless. Its still quantifiable.

And you've not even considered a phoenix's own internal compass of good and evil. Phoenixes are by nature peaceful creatures, and hence will always prefer people who are peaceful, since their own internal moral compass tells them that peace is good. That's yet another reason Grindelwald would never get a phoenix.

This entire argument was based upon a belief system that the thread said. You wanna know my own personal views on phoenixes? The one that perfectly explains Sparky? Here it is.

I personally see phoenixes as average dumb birds that can teleport around, deliver letters, obey simple commands and understand some human language simply because they've lived too long. I don't understand why the fandom is intent on turning them into gods.

So I reckon Dumbledore got one by travelling to a mountaintop(which is a phoenix's natural habitat) and fed one of them a few apples laced with cocaine.

Sure, you can quantify how closely someone sticks to their personal moral compass. But it's useless to do so - it tells you nothing about who a character is, what their motivations are, or how they will behave. You can substitute "good" for any meaningless word and get the exact same information.

***** That doesn't work well to me. The desire to do good is fairly common, phoenixes are not.

I'm not sure if it's canon (I think so, but feel free to correct me), but i think it was stated somewhere that Dumbledore was the only wizard owning a phoenix. Which would mean that either Dumble was the only wizard willing to do good, or that he was the only one willing to fight for it. I understand better, then, why the good side was losing to Voldemort in the first war.

Even if it's linked to the desire to do good (which doesn't sit that well with me, I see a pheonix as an elementary force that doesn't care much for good or evil) it just can't be the only prerequisite.

That's my point. Phoenixes don't just come around willy nilly. They're pretty dang rare. Dumbledore encountered one, and he was chosen, since he had a strong desire to do good.

Also, desire to do good is nowhere /near/ common. People want good things to happen, but rarely do you see people who're willing to /work/ to do good things, without any self serving interests.

How you see phoenixes is not something I can change. I personally see phoenixes as dumb birds that can teleport around, deliver letters, obey simple commands and understand some human language. I frankly don't understand why the fandom is hell bent on turning them into gods.

I can only argue the point in the boundaries of the Harry potter universe, where phoenixes, much like unicorns, have intent sensing abilities, and they reside on top of extremely high mountains hidden in the clouds, and are herbivores. It makes sense that you won't see much of them in Britain, since most of Britain's mountains aren't very tall at all.

The topographical barriers might be why you don't see many phoenixes in Britain. It also must be incredibly hard to get /near/ one of those little buggers. They'd just flame away the moment they notice you.

That's a possibility yes. There's indeed another prerequisite, you have to find one of those. You could also have to make one of those, or they could come to you if you met some prerequisites.

"Also, desire to do good is nowhere near common. People want good things to happen, but rarely do you see people who're willing to work to do good things, without any self serving interests."

There are still a lot of people that are like that. The thing is, i'm not sure that Dumbledore is such a saint. Don't get me wrong, I don't think canon Dumbledore is evil, he seems to genuinely care for Harry and his other charges, he's willing tu put his life at stakes but still...

"Its not canon."

Then I stand corrected.

"How you see phoenixes is not something I can change. I personally see phoenixes as dumb birds that can teleport around, deliver letters, obey simple commands and understand some human language. I frankly don't understand why the fandom is hell bent on turning them into gods."

I didn't talk about phoenixes being some kind of gods.

"I can only argue the point in the boundaries of the Harry potter universe, where phoenixes, much like unicorns, have intent sensing abilities, and they reside on top of extremely high mountains hidden in the clouds, and are herbivores. It makes sense that you won't see much of them in Britain, since most of Britain's mountains aren't very tall at all."

What we know about phoenixes we know from dumbledore, talking to a kid. It could be a simplification of the truth or even a simple belief. The thing is, that doesn't make much sense to me. But still, I'll give you that point, it's indeed canon. I don't remember Unicorns to have intent sensing in canon though.

Honestly with the kind of abilities that Phoenixes have (Fawkes can apparate inside Hogwarts, have powerful healing and support abilities), I think that a lot of wizards would try and find a pheonix if they were just living in the montain. They would probably confund themselves to meet the prerequisite to bind the animal. To people that can fly, apparate, and have access to the bubblehead charme, high montains are really not much. Even if they lived at the top of the K2, they wouldn't be so difficult to reach for a motivated wizard.

They show up when someone has the desire to fight or destroy some great darkness, but lack the ability, and give them the choice to go do it right then or never have a Phoenix companion. The only thing is, choosing the Phoenix is no guarantee that the task will succeed, or that the champion will survive the task.
