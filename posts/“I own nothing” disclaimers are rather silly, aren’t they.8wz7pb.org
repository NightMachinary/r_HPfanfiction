** I stopped doing them years ago, I think only my first 2 or 3 stories had them. I was quickly wizened up on the fact that they're pointless.

** I roll my eyes every time I see them. No one thinks some random fanfic author is the actual book author/IP owner, and a disclaimer won't protect you from shit if the author/IP owner takes issue with your writing. Just stop, people!

** Oh you sweet, sweet summer child.

Yes, we know we don't own anything. You know we don't own anything. But back in the days when fanfiction was far, far less normalised and you could literally get Cease and Desist letters from authors (hi anne rice, fuck you) because you wrote fanfiction, disclaimers were de rigueur because 'please don't sue me' was an actual plea.

No they're not strictly necessary now and their utility against legal action has always been questionable at best but they're a longstanding part of fandom history and you will pry my disclaimers from my cold, dead, fucking fingers.

**** In 2000, Rice posted to her website a message banning all fanfic: “I do not allow fanfiction. The characters are copyrighted. It upsets me terribly to even think about fan fiction with my characters,” She wrote. “I advise my readers to write your own original stories with your own characters. It is absolutely essential that you respect my wishes.”

EDIT: It suddenly occurred to me that you may know this, and you were just wondering if this person was given a cease-and-desist personally.

**** Its a tradition that has stayed with fanfiction until rather recently because back in the 90s early 2000s you actually could get sued by the author. People post authors notes now because its tradition instead of needing to do it and it is dying out. Alot of new authors do not do it while older ones like myself do do it out of habit.

But worm is something you only know about if you are into free online published works, there is little contact to the mainstream.
