** There's a couple that come to mind:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4113087/1/A-Different-Fate][A Different Fate]] - This is short (a drabble collection) but complete, really well written, but Harry is severely developmentally impaired. I don't remember if his condition is ever labeled anything specific. Petunia winds up with Remus here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4923158/1/3-Slytherin-Marauders][3 Slytherin Marauders]] - This one isn't as well written, but very long and still ongoing. Snape winds up raising Harry more than Petunia does, but she's still there, and ends up with (believe it or not) Lucius Malfoy.

*** I just read A Different Fate - thank you for suggesting it. It made me tear up quite a bit and it was a great satisfying short read.

*** Yeah. I read maybe 60-70 chapters of it. Started out OK, grew steadily worse as it progressed. Miniature talking dragons? It's something I would have liked at 13. Very "young."

**** Agreed, I'm about halfway through and the author has started saying "I swear Severitus will start eventually!" and it's at 112 chapters. I generally read another chapter of it when nothing else has updated or I have finished another major one. Also does a TON of telling rather than showing, which can work and did work when it just seemed like the author was trying to catch us up, but it's clearly their writing style itself.

** I wonder how she would meet the wizard and when. It could be one of Lily or James' friends. So, possibly Remus, Sirius, Peter, or Severus. Or a random/unknown wizard. This is an interesting thought, I hope someone has examples!

**** I immediately jumped to Snape too. I wonder if he still would have liked Lily at some point. That could make Snape/Petunia's relationship interesting. It seems like it could cause some friction to be raising Harry.

***** I don't know sounds weird and creepy to me because it seems like Snape would be settling for 2nd best with petunia. Kind of like petyr baelish in GoT. I'd rather it be someone like Regulus. Or even an OC.

****** Well, maybe he wouldn't have ever liked Lily at all. We don't know how competent a witch Petunia could have been so maybe she wouldn't have been his second choice.

Ha! What if Petunia cougared up and married Gilderoy Lockhart? He finds a way to wiggle into Harry's life and plant himself front and center in the spotlight!

***** Snape is evil and never came close to redemption imo. Just a creepy, creepy, emotionally stunted, horrible human being that happened to be in the right place at the right time to do something morally ambiguous rather than bad. Definitely deserves to be name inspiration for the target of much of his school bullying's child.
