This is one of those theories that's around a lot, especially in fanon where Draco is good and usually paired with either Harry or Hermione, but it does seem to have some backing. What sort of caring father encourages or even allows his son to become a member of a magical terrorist organization where the leader regularly tortures his inferiors?

Then again, I haven't read the books or seen the movies in a few years, so there's probably a lot I'm forgetting for both sides of the argument. What are your opinions about this, and is there any actual textual evidence for it?


** Draco was spoiled as fuck. Although i suppose teaching your son to be a racist could be seen as abuse. Also when Draco joined the Death Eaters it was done as a punishment for Lucius losing one of Voldemorts horcruxes, so Lucius had no say on the matter.

I'm pretty sure Draco was pretty giddy at first being a death eater, only having second doubts not because he realized Death eater agenda was evil, but because Voldemort gave him an impossible task just to punish his family without alienating his other followers. So him being 'good' is definitely pure fanon. Also Voldemort cruciating his minions for minor failures is fanon.

** I honestly don't think Lucius wanted Voldemort to come back. Once he did come back, Lucius reaffirmed his loyalty only out of necessity.

Draco being used by Voldemort to kill Dumbledore during the sixth book was a form of punishment for his father. Therefore I wouldn't say Lucius wanted Draco to become a death eater. The books indicated he genuinely cares about his son, one of his redeeming qualities.

*** It was ol' Lucius free choice to join the Death Eaters, and, as we know, the return of his Dark Lord has been quite obvious for his followers in GoF. Lucius was one of the first to stand on the side of his Dark Lord again. I'm always amazed that Lucius incompetence, the reason he fell out of his Dark Lord favour, ensured impunity to the Malfoys after Voldemort's defeat, just as after the first war.

I think Draco himself wanted to become a Death Eater. At the beginning of HBP, he was proud that his Dark Lord has given him an important job. It was always obvious in the books how proud he was of his Dark Lord, well ... until he realized he was incapable of the job he was given. Well, in the books it was quite obvious that he was a coward.

Well, usually, I don't really care about Malfoy. However, I'm allergic to redeemed Malfoys. It's a bit too OOC.

**** Oh, I don't think Lucius was a good person, he certainly believed in pure-blood supremity. These views were passed on to Draco too and maybe initially he was excited at the prospect of joining the death eaters.

While I'm sure Lucius freely joined the death eaters before 1981, when Voldemort was first defeated Lucius tried to move on. He got into wizarding politics, began raising a son, claimed the imperius curse, made no effort to seek out Voldemort and gave away the diary for his own motives. Voldemort's return basically ruined his life as he once again had to serve him and this time his wife and son got involved.

When the dark mark appeared in GOF, the masked death eaters ran away.

***** Are you sure 'he had to'? He voluntarily was one of the first at the graveyard. He didn't have to go. There were quite a few of his followers missing when Voldemort summoned them to the graveyard. It is the excuse of all war criminals that they were forced and followed orders. The Malfoys are no exception, even though they have voluntarily followed Voldemort right from the very beginning.

** I'd just like to point out that from the Malfoys' perspective, the Death Eaters were a /revolutionary/ movement, not a terrorist one. Lucius was brought up with pureblood ideals -- much like people in the antebellum american south were, in regards to slavery -- and he instilled those values into Draco.

Niether Draco nor Lucius really had a much of a choice when it came to their bigotry; they simply conformed to the societal values surrounding them.

I always thought that there was such a brilliant opportunity in canon to show how such ignorance could be overcome; how Draco might have transformed to see past his hate and play a more redeemed role, but alas...

Thankfully, that's why we have fanfiction!

thats fanon, also one of the more stupid pieces of fanon.

we have no evidence that Voldemort regulary tortures Death Eaters. We have only see him do it three times and all of them were for serious fuck ups. Considering Harry was able to see what he was doing when he was really angry for three years that is very little.

And we have no reason to assume that he was abusive, Pottermore even makes this more unlikely. Draco loved his father and his father aided Draco when ever he could.

** Lucius undoubtedly was abusive, but never to his son. He has always spoiled and petted his son, e.g. when he bought the brooms for him and his team, or when he tried to execute Buckbeak because he had hurt his darling son. It was his goal for his son to get an influential position at the side of his beloved Dark Lord.

I think all attempts to portray Malfoy Jr as a maltreated son are only intended to construct an OOC plot for ferret!boy. In fact, Malfoy Jr still fought for his Dark Lord when his father had already fallen out of favour due to his incompetence. Remember the skirmish in the Room of Requirement during the Final Battle where Malfoy Jr ordered his minions to kill Harry.

**** As far as I know, nothing has ever been said about it, but may be you're right, and he really believed that he was dead. However, does it really matter? He was one of the first to stand at the side of his Dark Lord again, and Draco was proud of it. This was more than obvious in the books.

I never believed of redeemed Malfoys, of course, as true Slytherin they turned their sails back into the wind after Voldemort's defeat and were left unpunished, just like after the first war.

***** I was never suggesting that they were good people, but a lot of fanfic writers seem to believe that he was preparing for Voldemort's return ever since 1981.

I mean, Malfoy was pretty powerful in the early 90's, arguably more powerful than during the war, having the minister at his beck and call and everything. He had no reason to hope for Voldemort's return, and very little to gain from it.

** I don't think he was particularly abusive.

He didn't seem very patient with Draco though, consider his reaction to Draco complaining about Hermione and Harry in Borgin and Burke's. I think that's sort of where the abused!Draco thing originated, too.

Maybe he just gave Draco what he wanted so that the boy would shut up.

** I don't really agree with people saying "Draco was spoilt, therefore Lucius never hit him". There are lots of rich parents who buy their kids all manner of needless shit in place of actually parenting them, and when the kid does something wrong, they turn to physical abuse, again, rather than actually parenting them.

When it comes to wealthy parents, I'd say being the type of parents who give their kids anything is a symptom of not thinking about how their own actions will affect their child's development. That mindset makes abuse more likely, not less.
