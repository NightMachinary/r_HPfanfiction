I was curious since I've seen fics where he always calls them dunderheads, even in his head


** Yes, it's in the last line of his infamous speech in PS.

  “You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making,” he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word --- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. “As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the sens es. ... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death --- /if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach/.”

*** I love 'reading the books'. Everyone comments it's actually a great little speech until that last line.

**** Lmfao always in every iteration. And really it is. Almost makes you want to brew potions until the very last moment.

*** Does he call them dunderheads multiple times though or just once?

***** Just searched my copy of the text and only other use is in that same chapter where Hermione “desperately wanted to prove she wasn't a dunderhead”

** I am not 100% sure but I think it's twice - in PS and the second time during the OWL year. While inappropriate he doesn't do it to an extent he does it in most fanfictions. It's a little bit like Rons "slimy Slytherins" - he once calls Malfoy slimy but in fanfiction it nearly became his favorite slander.
