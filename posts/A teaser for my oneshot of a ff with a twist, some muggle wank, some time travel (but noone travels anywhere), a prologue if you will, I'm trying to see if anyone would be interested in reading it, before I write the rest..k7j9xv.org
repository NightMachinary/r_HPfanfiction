Middle of nowhere, Scotish highlands, few minutes before sunrise, 7th of June 1994.

A soft pulsing chime signaled that the key was left in the ignition with at least one of the green Saab's doors open, in vain trying to remind the missing occupants to take the key with them if they planned to leave the car.

Bright light illuminated the surrounding woods from all directions out of almost completely exposed bulbs in the car's head and rear lights. The rears which once had been done in a tasteful mix of black and red tones, as of now were scorched black by flame that melted the space between them destroying both the glass and the trunk lid itself, magically what little of them that were left in place was melted; steel and glass alike.

The only red colour still present on the car were the smears on the upholstery visible through numerous holes on its left side, as well as the warning lights on the dashboard currently showing issues with all of the car's diagnostic sensors.

Curiously the only warning light currently not present on the gauge cluster was the airbag light. Even though on the right side of the car there was clear evidence of an impact big enough that it ought to have deployed them, however it didn't.

It was impossible as the car had no airbag in the steering wheel, and as the product of the pan european project Prometheus it was designed with fly-by-wire controls in an effort to eliminate the potential hazard of a steering wheel in the event of a crash. The wheel was replaced with a joystick mounted to the center console which allowed for digital control of the car, and even with proper equipment... to control the car remotely.

Thus enabling the twenty thousand pounds car, turned million pounds car to drive with a billion pounds worth signal transmitter, or a network of such. And why would someone have a need for such a car? Well, the need for such a car came because the owner didn't have a driving license and he wanted to go places... And because the only chauffeur he could trust was someone who already had a set of transmitters worth billions of pounds at hand, which were already beaming a signal backwards in time and it came right through Harry Potter's glasses.

It also wasn't as if Harry had to pay for the R&D and the car himself, all he had to do was to outbid a museum of Saabs, and museums never had much cash, but right after a global economic recession that followed the fall of the soviet block? With the right information and enough preparation it was child's play.

Thanks to the new friend that appeared out of nowhere right before going to Hogwarts, ever since then Harry always had the right information, thus bada bim bada boom he had a new vroom vroom...

Or at least he had had one until the events of tonight and the breakneck chase that followed them.

In this ff the premise is that: Harry doesn't end up trusting either Sirius, or Peter (also no Remus or Snape) and since he has a mysterious friend helping him out for some time he has the means to put the situation on hold and see what happens, or so he thinks. After the scene (not written yet) in the shrieking shack the golden trio try to follow canon but instead of saving Buckbeak and breaking Sirius out, they flee Hogwarts with Peter and Sirius in tow without the help of a time turner (they don't exist in my ff) and a chase begins.
