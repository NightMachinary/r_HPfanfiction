** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9098588/1/][Eccentric Order]] by itstraa fits the bill. It's a slow-burning DM/HG romance that begins when Hermione catches Draco working on the cabinet in the Room of Requirements. I like that, unlike much of DM/HG fanfic, it is respectful to both characters. Unfortunately, it hasn't updated in a long time.
