Just some powerful Snape!


** [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwfE6l6RtZAsd2xYdHliN0NrN0E][Soul Play]] by snapesforte, Snape/Narcissa endgame, comes to mind.

If the criterion is power, I don't have many bookmarked because my favorites tend to portray Snape as a character just as caught up in war and personal fate as most other relevant figures. Talented, yes, but not unusually strong except in terms of willpower or malice.

** linkffn(the best revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville) and its sequel have really good characterization of Snape. He's paired with a (sort of) OC as the story progresses. It doesn't show him as raw-powerful I don't think, more so clever when it comes to countering Voldemort and other issues.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

*** This is a fantastic first war Snape piece. I don't know how I missed it considering I'd already favourited one of the author's other stories. Thanks for the rec.
