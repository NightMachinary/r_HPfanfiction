Something along the lines of the talk between Harrry and Hermione to just turn their backs and leave all that bs behind.

Can be a direct consequence of that scene (id like that!) or something completely different - but with the runaway/hiding away aspect.

H/Hr pairing would be appreciated (i dont really like other pairings that much besides harry/daphne) but not must have.

Either way, feel free to suggest anything in that direction (feel free to disregard the pairings as i said ;) )

** linkffn(8257400) doesn't have them running away together but does have Harry getting the hell out of Britain. It's not H/Hr but they reconnect and are friends at the end. I love this story's portrayal of what would really happen if Voldy took over Britain but couldn't conquer the world. It may not be the most realistic but I love how it's handled. I also love Harry's rants at Dumbledore. Even if it's not exactly what you're looking for I suggest reading it.
