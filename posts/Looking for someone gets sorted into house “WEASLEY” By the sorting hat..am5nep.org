*** That was my first thought, but the hat sorts him into Gryffindor, and no mention is made of Ron or Ginny's sorting. I /know/ I've read a doc where it was a literal sort to Weasley tho... Thank you for answering so quickly tho üòä

**** No, no, it happens later in the story. /Harry/ is Gryffindor, but later, when things have gotten even crazier than at the beginning of the fix, Luna-with-red-hair gets sorted into WEASLEY despite McGonagall's protests.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.
