Saw that other thread about Snape, and it just got me really craving some time travel redemption... Unfortunately only saw about two in that other thread, so here this one is!

Haven't read any before, hit me with your best shot. Any pairing is fine, not too picky, as long as you thought it was good- or, alternatively, didn't think it was good but still enjoyed it.

Thanks!


** linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) is a regularly updating Snape is sent back in time fic. It is well written and has very interesting dialogue between Snape and Dumbledore.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

  Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters. AU Sequel posted: The Moment It Ended.

** linkffn(The Moment It Began) is one of the better ones. It's a Snape/Lily and quite well-written. Its main flaw is that the action is /slowwwwwww/.
