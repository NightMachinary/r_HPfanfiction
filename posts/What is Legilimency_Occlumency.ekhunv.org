I thouggt it was like entering someones mind and seekng what there thoughts are, you can't stroll through and read all there minds but you could ask them something and see what they actively think. Harry is told to just clear his mind which means the defense is to not react to an attackers triggers and not think about what they want you to.

Fanon seems to like making hige mind palaces that take weeks to build through meditation and sort a persons memories perfectly.

So what is the mind arts actually?


** Its one of those things where its never made explicit in the books, so we don't know the exact answer.

I can get behind the fanon thing of mind palaces, walls, and shields etc. Its pretty cool. And really I'll read any concept thats written well, and cool concepts are easier to write well.

The other option is that occlumency is simply having control over what you're thinking about in that moment. Beginners start with thinking of nothing, experts can think of outright lies. Perhaps part of training is to learn to recognise on a subconscious level when your mind is being attacked and developing near automated reflexes to start blanking your mind in response.

** We know very little about what successful Occlumency training looks like in canon---since Harry's improvised version only worked against Voldemort and Voldemort's specific weakness---and we have no idea what successful Legilimency looks like from the point of view of the Legilimens. So all this is headcanon.

The way I see it, the Legilimens spell, cast with a wand, creates a magical channel between the caster and the target, one that's mostly, though not completely, under the control of the caster. Through this channel, the Legilimens can inject qualia (thoughts, feelings, mental images, etc.) into the target's mind and read the reaction. That's only the beginning, however, because the Legilimens then needs to correctly interpret what they are reading and follow-up with whatever is needed. Most people have enough trouble consciously considering what's going on in their own heads, and interpreting what's going on in other people's heads, and influencing it with any level of accuracy and predictability, requires prodigious levels of general intelligence and working memory, not to mention a lot of practice.

Occlumency, then, is the skill of identifying, dissociating from, and ignoring the injected qualia (i.e., closing one's mind) so that the Legilimens gets nothing, and more advanced Occlumency involves forging responses, perhaps through a form of controlled schizophrenia or dissociative identity disorder.

A hostile Legilimens trying to break through---assuming they don't care about being noticed and the target doesn't have a way of breaking the connection---will be looking to find qualia that the Occlumens can't dissociate from or ignore. Once the Legilimens finds one that elicits an uncontrolled response (as far as the Legilimens can tell), they can push on that, keeping the Occlumens off-balance and sending qualia that get the wanted information and other results. The difficulty of learning Occlumency then stems from the fact that the qualia that can be injected are limited only by the imagination, the experience, and the personal squeamishness of the Legilimens. (It's worth keeping in mind that the Legilimens has to, in some sense, experience everything they are sending, and so, say, sending extreme pain hurts both sides about equally.)

Now, that means that unlike the Levitation Charm or riding a bike, Occlumency is not discrete skill that one learns and moves on. Rather, it is something that one /becomes/. To successfully resist an all-out attack by a skilled Legilimens, one must /be/ the sort of person who can, say, experience seeing, touching, and smelling a mutilated corpse of one's own best friend, sibling, or child (or worse)---and shrug.

That, in turn, means that Occlumency training is inherently a painful and dangerous process. The instructor must necessarily expose the student to painful, disgusting, and disturbing qualia, because any attack that the student hasn't already experienced and learned to shrug off is one that may surprise them in the future. In other words, if it doesn't hurt, you're doing it wrong. Becoming an Occlumens is therefore inherently traumatic and can cause personality changes, often for the worse.

Lastly, eye contact creates a weaker, noisier channel, one which only someone who is highly skilled in both Legilimency and Occlumency could read and interpret: Occlumency is necessary to distinguish the weak "signal" of the incoming foreign thoughts from the "noise" of one's own mind, while skill in Legilimency is needed to make sense of the very noisy "signal". That would be the "wandless" version of Legilimency, which isn't a discrete spell at all, as much as it is the ability to receive and interpret stray foreign thoughts. A mind artist of sufficient skill (e.g., Voldemort) might be able to sense and "denoise" thoughts and feelings even without eye contact.

This headcanon explains a number of canon observations:

- Legilimency is *hard*, and learning the spell is just the start. Most of the time, there are much easier ways to extract information. Therefore, even people who could use it don't bother to learn it. This explains why very few people practice it.

  - It explains why Snape angrily dismisses the analogy of reading a mind like a book: even figuring out how to probe, to say nothing of how to interpret the response, is difficult.

- Becoming an Occlumens has a price, and rarity of good Legilimences means that even people with secrets to keep are fine without Occlumency.

  - None of the Occlumenses we know in canon are exemplars of mental health.

- The best Occlumency instructors are sadists and psychopaths who are on your side.

  - As it applies to Harry's situation, it explains why for all of Harry's complaining, nobody---not Hermione, not Sirius, not Dumbledore---questioned Snape's methods. Harry's difficulties controlling his emotions---"wearing his feelings on his sleeve"---give him a powerful Patronus, but it also makes it difficult for him to achieve the dissociation needed to "close his mind".
  - As it applies to Draco's situation, it explains why Bellatrix (at least according to Snape) was able to teach Draco Occlumency, but why she didn't even try to use Legilimency on Hermione in DH: she has the sadism to use Legilimency to torture someone until they learn to dissociate, but she doesn't have the skill to interpret what she gets back to extract useful information. [1]

Lastly, my other Occlumency-related headcanon is that the Memory Charm has two targeting modes: recent memories (e.g., last 10 minutes), which does not require Legilimency; and specific memories, which one needs to bring up using Legilimency, which makes it very difficult to Obliviate a skilled Occlumens without them noticing.

[1] There are, as always, alternative explanations. Bellatrix's sadism might have clouded her judgement: Legitimency would have been more reliable, but Cruciating the Mudblood was just too tempting. Or, Hermione might have picked up Occlumency off-screen.

**** The closest I know is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi), though his version of Occlumency isn't nearly as painful to learn. Similarly with linkffn(Ill Met by Moonlight by Thomas M Riddle) (which is a sequel, so read linkffn(A Pound of Flesh by Thomas M Riddle) first). More generally, I can't think of any fics in which Occlumency training is shown to be as difficult as it was portrayed in canon, and I don't think any fics attach personality changes to Occlumency.

Usually, it's explained away in one of several ways:

1. Dumbledore- and Snape-bashing: this form of training was not effective in the first place, and may have, in fact, sabotaged Harry.
2. Urgency: it was the fastest way to learn, but there are other, relatively painless and often better ways, that just take longer.
3. Ignoring the difficulty: that part of canon is just ignored.

â€‹

I had a fic outlined that involved Hermione learning it. She got the theory from a book, but she didn't have an instructor she trusted. So, she basically found some admittedly contrived magic (involving mirrors) that created an ephemeral copy of herself that could interact with her to some extent and spent several months frying her own brain. And, yes, that did mess her up: she basically had to relearn how to have emotions again.

**** You could be right---it's been a while. I don't have much time to search through OotP at the moment. Are you sure Harry didn't talk to Sirius and/or Remus about it? I seem to recall basically everyone urging Harry to go back to Snape for the lessons.

I do remeber that Dumbledore regretted it, but I think that was more about Snape throwing Harry out after Harry saw Snape's memory, not Snape sabotaging Harry.

Anyway, if I had misremembered, then I'll go back and edit the post. There are other arguments that Snape's tutelage was genuine:

- No matter how much he loathed it, keeping Harry alive was Snape's greatest motivation, so if his training was suboptimal, it wasn't intentionally so.
- IIRC, JKR's said that Harry's personality was a part of what hurt his Occlumency---which suggests that Snape's methods were valid.
- If you are right and Harry told nobody, Snape had no way of knowing that Harry /wouldn't/ tell anybody.

*** This is basically my headcanon as well, allthough I wouldn't have written it nearly as well.

Allthough I always figured Occlumency didn't need quite /that/ level of emotional disconnect, but merely the ability to emotionally compartmentalize and strong willpower. Harry and Snape both have the latter, but Harry does not have the former, explaining why he was never able to properly master the art. Snape, meanwhile, has done this since he was a kid (my headcanon has him start this as a way to "cope" with his upbringing at home, starting to learn actual Occlumency in his 6th year) and it comes instinctively to him, which explains why he was a very poor teacher -- he simply didn't understand why Harry couldn't just do it.

*** I honestly think it was sabotage on Snape's part.

In books there were only two shown instances of successful resisting something that can be even remotely a Legilimency attack. Both of them done by Harry against Voldemort in instances where he had just lost someone he cared for (Sirius and Dobby) and was filled with grief.. This can be considered as not valid as they are connected through soul; so for all we know it's literally impossible to block each other and the most they could do is cloud their mind with so much emotion that the other doesn't want access it at all.

I think there was also Draco successfully resisting Snape and possibly Slughorn resisting Dumbledore. I think Quirrelmort wasn't able to get into Hagrid's mind as well.

However in movies there is an instant in OoTP where Harry deflects Snape's spell with a Protego. This is what is the best and most clear cut case we get through the entire series. Snape is enraged by what Harry did and was able break the Legilimency attack. This suggests that resisting it requires overwhelming emotions. This would also explain the instances Harry resisted Voldemort.

Harry was also able to cast Patronus while reliving events that caused him the most despair. Take that for what you will. I think we just don't know enough about it and some of the facts we know are contradicting so it's impossible to say for sure.

**** Like I wrote above, it's deep in headcanon territory. I like it, because it satisfies what I consider criteria for good headcanon:

- Consistent with canon exposition /and/ characters' actions.
- Is well balanced and does not break the setting.
- Consistent with the spirit of the setting: both Legilimency and Occlumency being somewhat unsavoury arts---the art of espionage and interrogation and an art of concealment and deception---it is in the spirit of the setting that both extract a price.

In my headcanon, strong emotion can certainly derail Legilimency by forcing the Legilimens to experience the same emotion (that might be painful to them) and also by preventing the Legilimens from getting at the information they want by bringing up the needed thoughts.

The problem is that, firstly the defender must actually feel said emotion and without Occlumency, they can't really decouple emotions from thoughts and actions, so they might end up doing something stupid as a result; secondly, actually feeling strong emotions is draining, and the Legilimens merely needs to wait the target out: the target must succeed continuously, whereas the Legilimens only needs to take advantage of one lapse; and thirdly, a skilled Legilimens may be able to hijack the emotion for their own purpose.

I am not sure what the Shield Charm tells us. It makes sense that the Legilimency spell could be blocked like most spells---and it makes sense that eye-contact Legilimency can't unless the shield is opaque.

***** You have a point. I just thought that since every instant of successfully resisting Legilimency attack happened when the Occlumens was feeling overwhelming emotion (grief and loss in Harry's case, probably anger and grief and loss in Snape's case and fear and panic in Draco's case) they must be essential for defending.

What you have said certainly makes more sense with all the lore surrounding the mind arts. If only we had a more clear cut example from canon.

I looked through canon and the instant with least amount of variables (connected through soul or your own spell reflected on you) was the Snape vs Draco scene from HBP.

Snape corners Draco and starts asking about Voldemort's orders; tells him he made a unbreakable vow with his mother to help him finish his mission. Draco refuses to tell him and Snape attempts to use Legilimency, Draco resists it and tells him about Bellatrix.

Your version also explains why Harry complained about having worse visions after lessons with Snape. If Occlumency is truly that traumatic it must leave Harry exhausted and weak after suchlessons.

What this doesn't explain is how were they supposed to help Harry against the visions. Harry got them when he was asleep. It should be impossible even with magic to do that sort of complex magic while you are at best semi conscious.

It would take utmost focus and be nigh impossible to stop one's mind to react to stimuli. Body I can understand but mind is another thing entirely. It would be like those mind tricks that ask you not to think about something and immediately it's picture pops up in mind.

I think instead of not reacting to stimuli a more plausible defense would not registering the stimuli in the first place. Like being so focused at something that even though your body knows a stimuli has taken place, it doesn't penetrate your mind.

Like trying to solve a difficult problem that requires all your attention and not hearing your friend call you who is sitting besides you. You should have clearly heard him call but it just doesn't register. Doing something that takes all your attention or focus like listening to music, reading an enjoyable book or anything that puts you in a trance like state in which you don't notice a stimuli would be more plausible than clearing your mind through meditation as many fics like to do.

So a better way to defend a Legilimency attack would be think of only one thing with all your focus. That should give you a better chance than trying not to react to a stimuli. It will still be very difficult to do in most situations but still very much possible.

Huh now that I think about it how was Voldemort even able to send Harry visions of DOM. Harry was asleep so external stimuli shouldn't be effective as many heavy sleepers will tell you. And since Harry has never seen it his mind should not be able to conjour up a image of it . More and more questions to think about.

I am really glad to have had this conversation. It gave me some new ideas that I might use in a fic. It might have been a bit rambly but I got many of my ideas while I was writing it. Anyway I am really glad to have had this conversation. If you want to continue brainstorming things and discussing ideas I will be glad.

****** Harry's approach worked because being in Harry's mind hurt Voldemort. It wouldn't work against anyone else, and it didn't work against Snape in particular.

Draco's approach worked because he actually learned Occlumency properly (i.e., dissociation, a form of controlled schizophrenia, etc., if my headcanon is correct); I am not getting a particularly strong sense of fear or panic in Draco's conversation with Snape.

When is Snape shown using Occlumency?

â€‹

Focusing on a particular thought and distracting oneself may well be one of the techniques involved in Occlumency, but in and of itself, it would have the same downsides as strong emotion. Staying focused on one thing for more than a few minutes is hard, especially with the Legilimens throwing all kinds of distractions at you that may have a stronger emotional content than whatever you are trying to focus on, and that is not limited to just sound, or for that matter is not limited to the five senses.

Interesting thoughts about what Voldemort was able to send to Harry. Can you remind me whether Harry only experienced visions when asleep, or did he have some while awake?

What sort of fic are you planning?

** Legilimency: entering someone's mind to see memories and feel feelings and interpret them from there. A skilled legilimens might be able to influence emotions so that they can get to a particular memory (I'm not sure)

Occlumency: steering an invader away from certain thoughts or emotions. A skilled one might be able to create false memories (I'm not sure)

Seeing as Harry was told to practice, meditation might be legit. Not to build landscapes, but to calm his mind.

** TL;DR:

Occlumency is the art of sorting, organising and protecting your mind. This result is faster learning and easier recall of memories/info, in addition to protection from legilimency.

Legilimency is the art of invading a person's mind and extract information. This can be knowledge, memories.
