** There's Like A Redheaded Stepchild, where Harry has red hair and people keep confusing him for a Weasley... The Weasleys and Harry alike just shrug and go with it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

Does Like A Redheaded Stepchild get better? I couldn't keep reading it because of excessive exclamation points and poor writing style, but I wish it didn't bother me so much because I like the premise.

**** I think it stays at pretty much the same level throughout. If you don't like the first few chapters, I don't think the rest of the fic's going to change your mind.
