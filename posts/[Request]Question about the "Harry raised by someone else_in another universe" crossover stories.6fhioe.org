I'm certain you've read your share of the crossover stories that have Harry being raised in another universe, or by someone else, until Dumbledore tracks him down, or the Goblet of Fire summons him, at which point Harry and his new family usually teach Wizarding Britain a lesson and solve their problems for them with their awesome Ninja/Sorcery/whatever skills. Complimentary Dumbledore punishment included as often as not.

Now, has there ever been a story where Harry gets thrown into another world/universe/whatever, and raised there, then Dumbledore finally tracks him down, and leads the order there to recover the Boy-Who-Lived, and then quickly solves whatever problem Harry and his adoptive family and friends are having, because HP magic is just that OP compared to most other magic in fiction?


** This is a great idea, and I'd love to read one like this. Sadly I don't know of any.

There are so much possibilities - HP magic could even outperform a lot of other universes magic (Avatar, Eragon, ...), yet not be totally OP do that you can actually make it a little fun.

I spent the past 15 minutes daydreaming of how the character interaction with "Avatar: The last Airbender" could work, and it is great. For those who know the series: Just think of Dumbledore / Aang interaction, and better yet: Dumbledore / Uncle Iroh. Both with aspirations of greatness and a wish for the "greater good" in their youths, both disillusioned after losing a loved one, both now firmly on the "light" side, and trying to mentor a young person. Both of them seem to enjoy some sweet things in life (tea, sweets), yet Iroh seems mostly relaxed while Dumbledore seems rather tense in many cases.

I can imagine how cool this can be. If I ever finish a story, it might be this. I so hope that someone finds something.

*** A lot of other fiction tends to have strong fighting-based magic systems (Star Wars, Naruto, I guess Twilight too) but the Harry Potter magic system is very good all around. For example, in a fight between a wizard and a Jedi, the Jedi would probably win due to battle precognition (ie they could dodge any spell thrown at them). However, Jedi can't apparate or transfigure or cast protective charms. So, while ________ might win in a fight, HP is better overall.

**** I really think you're making Jedi much weaker than they actually are. They're much faster than wizards, they have incredible skills, and the force that they use is instantaneous and can only be blocked by another force user. Jedi can also use force speed and force barrier, both of which have the same effects as apparating or protective charms.

***** If you can effectively replace a man's memories and personality, or compell them to act like your puppet, combined with invisibility and anti-muggle wards and unplottable locations, as well as Apparition, you have instant win buttons for many types of conflicts. Most medieval fantasy with rare/weaker magic can't handle a HP wizard. Most modern settings can't handle one either.

***** I must disagree. Jedi have shown mild kinectomantic abilities, but nothing that drastically outstrips the normal human reaction time. A highly trained human was able to engage a Jedi in hand-to-hand combat at least once, and emerge relatively unscathed.

The precognitive abilities of Jedi are greatly exaggerated. At best, they have a mild battle precognition, and they are still hampered by the constraints of their physical reaction times. If their precognitive abilities were as strong as they are often wanked up to be, they could have won the Clone Wars by themselves. Oh, and survived Order 66 (the argument that Palpatine was blocking their visions is irrelevant; that pertained only to the balance of the force, and events on the galactic scale).

Force barriers can only withstand a few attacks before collapsing, unlike the Protego spell, which offers (in theory) limitless protection. Force speed doesn't make you Flash-fast, either, and from what we've seen in canon, it can only be used in short bursts in straight lines.

***** Uh... that's what I'm saying. A jedi would definitely win in a fight against a wizard. Wizards can just do non-fighting stuff that jedi can't like brainwashing or transfiguration or whatever.

**** Jedi have force walls that protect against force based attacks. Its why you see Yoda being zapped by lightning and then getting back up.

** if we consider "magic" a simple energy manipulation then no its not even close to be op.

in nasuverse we have true magic, the 1st can create everything out of nothing, the 2nd can manipulate time and space including using the energy of the user alternate selves, the 3rd deal with the manipulation of souls.

narutoverse we have seals so powerful they can raise the dead and summon a death god, we have eyes so powerful they can turn illusion to reality and reality to illusion as well as raising the dead and creating things out of nothing.

while hpverse magic is strong its probebly not even in the top 10 of bullshit powers.

wont even start on marvel/dc verse.

*** HP Magic can create things out of nothing easily. It's called conjuration, and is a basic subject. And it doesn't matter that much compared to the ability to turn an enemy into an ally with a single spell.

**** first of all conjuring is using energy to create matter, its not out of nothing while other abilities allow you to actually create energy.

illusions and mind control isnt that uncommon in other fictions

***** Since HP wizards have, for all practical purposes, unlimited energy to use, the difference between conjuring and creating something out of nothing is meaningless.

Mind Control to the degree that is casually used in HP - as Hermione demonstrated - is not really that common. It's often limited to a few special people, not everyone with a wand.
