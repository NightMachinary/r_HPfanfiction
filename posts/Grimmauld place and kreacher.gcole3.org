  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

*** The descriptions look somewhat interesting, but I'm a little concerned about the ratings. The first story in the series has a warning listed for Rape/Non-con and that's the one with a /T/ rating; the others are M and simply don't provide warnings at all. Can you expand on this?

**** What do you mean? Inner Demons are rated mature, because there is quite a lot violence, swearing all the time, attempted suicide, PTSD, and quite a lot of sex (all because of the story, none useless smut). That story is written by serendipity_50 and I have nothing to do with it, including its marking.

My story is just basically Harry talking with Kreacher, there is no action, anything, so it is available for the general audience.

****** The main plot of linkao3(Starting Over by serendipity_50) is the attempted rape of Ginny by Fenrir Greyback. I emphasize *attempted* and there is not much unsuitable described, so it is probably still T (or PG-13, is that a rough equivalent?), but yes it is about the rape, so it deserves the tagging.

Why the author of Inner Demons decided not to mark the story I have no clue. But it is a way more gore than the first one. The main plotline is centred around Ginny's struggles with PTSD, which includes attempted suicide (or perhaps it was an accident, but it is really cutting it close), a lot of standard adventure violence, but also one horribly cursed and tortured child (that made me not sleep for couple of nights), some families burned up alive (in distance, no detailed description), another attempted rape (which really goes nowhere, Ginny is just pinned against the wall fully clothed before the violator is beaten down by Harry), and Harry and Ginny are in some parts of the story so screwed up they are able to communicate mostly only through sex, so there are some rather graphic scenes (it is all lilly-vanilla heterosexual consensual sex, but some detailed descriptions of human anatomy in action are included). So, yes it is definitively M (or R, if that's the equivalent), and it should probably deserve appropriate labels, but as that label says “Creator *Chose* Not To Use Archive Warnings”.

  PLEASE NOTE: The warnings on this story are strictly precautionary in case of triggers. The violence is not exceedingly graphic and the rape/non-con is attempted only; both occur in later chapters.Harry and Ginny lived happily ever after...eventually. After the war, things didn't go as easily as they should have.
