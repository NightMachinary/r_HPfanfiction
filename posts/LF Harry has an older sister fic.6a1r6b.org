*** Really, an SI? I might be unfairly prejudiced towards these, so mind giving a quick rundown of why this is good? The start seems fairly standard, and uninspiring, for the... genre.

**** It's really nice to read about someone solving things through social solutions- actual ones, not the contrived ~POLITICS~ and sovereign citizen-esque law solutions bandied about in innumerable Slytherin stories (though this story does unfortunately use those too; LORD POTTER-style worldbuilding is a thing here). Also nice to read about someone that's actually a kind person. Fanfics where kindness is treated as a good thing are few and far between, and HP fanfics in particular are especially prone to the opposite trend.

Implausible competence. They develop a new form of Occlumency as, what, six-year-olds? with only a basic understanding of how occlumency works and no theoretical backing, just by imagining how they'd like to be able to protect their minds. Similarly, Harry is considered a prodigy because Heather's been teaching him advanced material since they were children. I admit I'm not an expert on the subject, but I harbor strong doubts education-from-infancy efforts in the real world turn out prodigy-level children.

The Potters never meaningfully lose, and once the Childhood arc is over with, they don't even meet any obstacles they really struggle against. There's a lot of noise about how Heather's bleeding heart makes things difficult for her, but it never actually does; the woefully underqualified teenager she hires as an assistant never actually messes up her job, she still gets Petunia to stop providing only Lava soap and give her a stipend, nobody asks questions when she helps Gringotts stop Quirrell even though they know she's lying about the source of her knowledge, and so forth. Heather also doesn't have any negative personality traits, or if she does they're noble hero-like traits like a tendency to overwork herself. Basically, what I mean to say is that she's a Mary Sue, if one with strong characterization outside of her Mary Sue Role. It doesn't hurt the story too much, though, due to the story's slice-of-life focus and the strength of its supporting cast.

Extremely good characterization of supporting characters, most visibly in the Childhood arc, though in the Hogwarts-preparation arc the new characters (once their backstory has been given to the reader) are more like things for Heather to save and be praised by than characters in their own right. Like, the Hogwarts preparation arc in general was really bad about this (and in general), to the point where I almost dropped the story- seriously, everything to come out of that arc, characters and events alike, is a massive albatross around the fic's neck. The fic returns to its typical quality of characterization starting in the Hogwarts Express chapter; Ron and Hermione are absolutely fucking adorable. And the author refrains from making a "Ron's a glutton" joke when they start talking about delicious food! Avoiding pointless cliches is always a plus. That said, one big problem with this fic is the inability to maintain this good characterization; the author very frequently introduces these very relatable characters in interesting and flavorful ways, then five chapters later gives them... maybe a single line devoid of unique characterization while moving on to new, interesting characters that will then again be bussed in favor of the new new hotness five more chapters later.

A bit too much social justice soapboxing. Not in the sense that "Heather shouldn't solve problems from her social justice mindset", because that's characterization (and quite good characterization at that, the author pulls it off well), more in the sense that a disproportionate number of the obstacles in her way are things social justice and feminism in particular takes a position on. Though looking through the story again it only actually happens three times or so? So maybe it only feels like more of a problem than it actually is.

The reimagining of parts of HP canon in more consistent and realistic ways works well; they're certainly a sight better than certain unnamed other fics that tried the same.

I appreciate the fact that women exist in this story. Like, actual non-canon adult female characters, in an HP fanfic, that don't exist solely to be the wife of the interesting character. I hadn't noticed just how rare they were until this story included some. Though sometimes the women-actually-do-things-in-an-HP-fanfic-for-once motif gets taken too far; for example, only Molly Weasley goes on the warpath when Pettigrew's discovered, instead of both Weasley parents. Arthur gets angrier than Molly when given enough motivation, as the Twins found out with their unbreakable vow prank in canon, so you'd expect him to be there too.

In summary, the fic has clear flaws, but the choice of genre and plot mitigates them to an extent, and the fic really, really shines elsewhere. It has excellent slice-of-life moments and where its characterization is good, it's the best I've seen in a fanfic the past month.

***** If you haven't read many adult female OCs, you should read linkffn(7247199). The main character is a muggle woman who adopts Harry after finding him crawling across the road that November night and her subsequent interactions with the magical world show a lot of common sense and nerve. Natasja is tough but human, and the family that develops is charming. A few characters get lightly bashed, and it balances between a crack fic and an action fic. It's not perfect, but I liked it. 31k and complete.

**** I would say this is a slight higher quality than the general self insert because it isn't strictly just a fix it fiction. There are some neat concepts explored about what a more realistic harry potter would look like.

It does, unfortunately, suffer from Lord Potter syndrome and while I am enjoying reading it (SI are a guilty pleasure of mone) there isn't a lot of plot pacing to drive the story as of yet, just minor events that are resolved either in the chapter they are introduced in, or the next.

Well...

That's worth a glance, at least. BRB.

EDIT: I actually didn't like the reference that much. It was... a bit much, even if a few of us think about it internally. Maybe I just dislike real-world modern politics in stories?

The story seems alright so far, though.

******* Sure. I'm on chapter 5, now, and it's actually rather decent.

I can /feel/ the undertones of preachy-SJW in the main character, though, and I'm hoping it won't be a major theme. Without giving my opinion on the matter one way or another, I read fanfiction to escape the bullshit going on IRL.

Essentially, the author inserts themselves into the fictional universe. This has really caught on in a lot of fandoms recently.

**** Heather and Petunia fight over little stuff, but Heather is emotionally aware of the abuse while being a generally empathetic person to Petunia so their relationship is unique. It starts getting into Lord Potter/Lady Black shite in first year but I really liked the scheming to get around the domestic abuse aspect before then.

It's also competently written and has interesting OCs which is unusual for a self insert fic.

*** I commented on this post a few hours ago, but I'm hoping now that I've read further into the story (I'm on chapter 13), I can provide a second opinion.

It's /really/ fucking good. Like, stupidly. Probably one of the best SIs I've ever read, and they're not even to /Hogwarts yet/.

** linkffn(Red Sorrow) Harry has a half sister who was adopted by Snape when she was young (although she is also his actual daughter even though she doesn't know it in the beginning). Both have been marked by Voldemort but grew up separately. Sometimes can be quite angsty and focuses a lot on Snape and his daughter relationship, but I enjoyed it.

  AU. Harry Potter was not the only one marked that fateful Halloween, and Severus Snape is given redemption in a form he least expected. A Sibling!Addition story beginning pre Philosopher's Stone through Prisoner of Azkaban. Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix will continue in a separate installment.
