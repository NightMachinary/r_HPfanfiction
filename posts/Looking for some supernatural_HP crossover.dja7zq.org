No slash please. Preferably with harry as the main guy along with the Winchesters, just like in illusions

#+begin_quote
  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.
