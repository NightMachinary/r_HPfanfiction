There's another fix I remember with some sort of Hermione time travel and she requests that she and Harry not have play dates to avoid them imprinting on each other as siblings. Might be the same one.


** Linkffn(a little child shall lead them) Is the one with no play dates:)

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.
