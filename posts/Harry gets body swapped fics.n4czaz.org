So I read a crack fic a while back about soulmates and how they switch bodies and thats how they know who theirs is. And it was Harry and Tom and they had to fake being each other for a day. I liked the idea. I'm not normally a fan of crack fics but I liked it and now I want something similar but longer and hopefully less silly and more drama and angst. It doesn't have to be soul mates or even Harry and Tom. But I really like the idea of Harry being stuck in a death eaters body trapped hanging around Malfoy manor so something haha. Or Harry and one of the Slytherins at school, or omg could you imagine him trapped as Snape?!? I prefer slash fics but gen is okay. I'm a dark and twisted over funny and romance kinda person so I'd much rather read a story where this swap has a lasting effect on Harry, maybe him changing his loyalties or falling in love with a bad guy. Hope you guys know some. Thanks.


** What was the fic you read with Harry and Tom because that sounds good
