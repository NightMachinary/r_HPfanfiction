So, got this idea, the order/Voldemort/Harry/Ministry/Whoever get the standard super plot-device ritual to call help from another world. Use it without consulting with saner people first and instead of the slightly disgruntled hero they were expecting they get someone or something that ends being an even worse problem than the one they were supposed to combat.

It was always something that bothered me, just why a supposedly smart character as Dumbledore would do something so potentially disastrous as this. Calling someone in this fashion would be akin to bringing someone random to your house to deal with a cockroach infestation. Sure, there is a chance that you get lucky and gets someone with experience in pest-control, but you can also pull some mass murder that will kill you, your family, steal everything you own and then go on his merry way without sparing a thought to the cockroaches. The difference is that with using the entire infinite multiverse as a pool to take from you would have even more options of how to get a disaster.

Starting with the most simple the summoners could call someone from an specie that is just too big to fit inside their city, or Hell, maybe someone larger than the entire planet, you are dealing with infinite possibilities here, if it is at all possible by the rules of any possible alternative reality then it is definitely a possibility worth considering.

They could bring someone or something that will wipe out the planet instantly, which technically fits in the “kill Voldemort” criteria (maybe the planet destroying ray from the Death Star instead of a person?).

You could get someone with a moral and logical thought process so alien to you as to make it a painful experience trying to understand it (f ex.: someone who thinks nothing of mass murder acts, thinks it is a personal insult against them if other people have a right ear in a space over a mile radius from them and thinks that impregnating someone just to eat the meat from the baby the instant it is born is a valid and mild counter-argument).

It could end with some history divergence that causes no end of troubles (the person speaks a language that was never invented in their reality, they call a previous Dark Lord long dead at their time, the cultural evolution of the summoned person's world leads them to a set of beliefs that all sides consider monstrous...)

They could call Yog-Sothoth or Nyarlathotep to their world (very bad idea all around).

They could get the more boring kind of villain that will stealthily infiltrate and take over the world themselves (Darth Sidious for example)

Or they could end with someone simply incompatible with their reality, which would result in either: their powers are rendered null, they explode or the reality explodes.

Really, there are so many ways for it to go horribly wrong, I am actually kind of surprised we don't see many more stories with this.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** It was once again Hallows Eve at Hogwarts, with funky enchanted pumpkins, ghosts more active than usual and of course the Halloween feast. Traditionalist students might grumble, but the promise of good food and delayed curfew sufficed to keep their complaints down and hidden in the background noise. One thing was visibly missing, though. Or rather one person. The Headmaster.

Albus Dumbledore was attending a much smaller gathering, with only a few of the Order of Phoenix present. The atmosphere was also much less festive. Tension hung in the air as the small group of witches and wizards gathered around a summoning array etched into the stone floor of one of unused chambers of Hogwarts castle.

Voldemort had struck like a snake he was, and before anyone knew, his conflict with Harry Potter was over. Free of any curses or hexes, a signed Contract of Truce was delivered to young Harry through the owl post, even as one of his friends went missing... Disaster! The girl was later released unharmed, but even as Harry Potter was safe from the Dark Lord Voldemort for the next decade, the master of Death Eaters could move without opposition from his prophesied nemesis. By the time the allotted time was over, would there be anyone to stand against him?

Albus Dumbledore sighed, shaking his head. He could not even truly blame the boy, as much he wished otherwise. It was much to ask someone, to abandon one's friend to a horrible fate.

It still left the Light without its Champion, and it left them standing in circle, about to perform a desperate summoning to hopefully acquire one. A Harry Potter, willing and able to end the threat of Voldemort, who had already succeeded in the task once.

"Let us begin" he said, feeling every bit of his age as the chants and the circle pulled hard at what magic was around and lit up with an eldritch glow, pulsing with power, and finally, with a bright flash, breaching the dimensional boundaries and pulling forth their promised hero...

The figure lying in the circle could be mistaken for a corpse, even as it was undoubtedly a Harry Potter. Gaunt, thin... Yellow skin pulled over the bones, graying hair with more than a few bald spots... The eyes, which on the home version resembled a pair of pure emeralds, shone like a pair of Killing Curses, sending a wave of unease through the room.

"What..?" The the summoned man rasped trying to get onto his feet, only to fall back down as his strength failed him.

He was given his explanation... And then they heard him laugh. Yes, the dark Lord had been beaten... But it was not before he conquered a large part of the world and performed purges of those he felt unworthy. He fell, because he would not stop hounding a scattered group of survivors, and it is the cornered animal that is at its most dangerous.

It was not a victory. By the time it happened, the magical communities were beyond salvage.. So they hadn't tried to salvage them. The curse was designed to taint the blood, the air and the very magic... And rip it out of anything living in the most brutal manner the haunted Remnants were able to imagine... And after witnessing the uncountable atrocities... They were inspired.

Harry Potter was the one who first volunteered to carry the curse and spread it. Once infected, there was no cure, but he had been a powerful wizard. Even as his magic was being ripped out, he had enough strength to perform a few dozen apparitions, ensuring the global distribution and making magic of his world an unachievable fairytale...

He had been ready to die, bereft of magic and feeling the effects of the hexes, curses and poisons he was hit with during his last mission when he was pulled to a new world, where the Voldemort situation was still solvable by conventional means. To a place built on a convergence of several magic currents... and a school of the next generation of magical. Even if the place was chosen more carefully, more precautions taken - the doom would still come. The curse had been delivered to new targets and it would take its due.

Even as shock stopped Dumbledore's old heart, his ears were filled with screams of those whom would pay the toll for his folly. But it would not be his concern anymore. The dead had few of those.

*** Amazing! Now that is what I'm talking about! I hadn't even considered a transmittable curse or illness (though in hindsight a sickness that would only be treatable in it's home dimension would actually be a serious concern, real countries are worried by it, even more so currently), excellent writing.
