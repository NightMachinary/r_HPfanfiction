  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

** the instances following off the top of my head, variously in HPMOR and fics thereof (don't recall which in where):

- Fiendfyre requiring permanent loss of a drop of the caster's blood to cast
- Unbreakable Vow permanently takes a portion of the Bonder's magical strength, proportional to the number and length of clauses
- Philosopher's Stone requires permanent sacrifice of most of one's life-force. If the attempted creator is not sufficiently young, the ritual fails and the creator dies.
- Dementor is created by ritual which involves sacrificing part of the caster's life, if the caster is too old, they die.
- (a) resurrection ritual that permanently takes part of the caster's life and magic
- Fidelius: The land gives up its accessibility, the Secret-Keeper gives up his/her safety (protective and hiding spells are less effective), and the Land-owner gives up control (over the Secret). (temporary thought).
