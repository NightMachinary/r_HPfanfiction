Can someone reccomend something similar to Butterfly Heart? I liked the creepiness of Tom manipulating Harry a lot. I've already read the other fics by the same author. Thank you.

Here is a link

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172646/1/Butterfly-Heart]]\\
It is about a world where Tom is a serial killer and a psychiatrist. Harry is investigating to find the serial killer. He starts to get creeped out and very anxious because he is worried he will become evil. Hermione asks him to go to the psychiatrist (Who is secretly the murderer), to get better. Tom's aim is to make Harry so very dependant on him that even if he finds out that he is the serial killer, he will be too dependant on him to tell anyone.


** Link? Summary? And the most important, what did you like in the story? In what sense do you want the recommended stories to be similar? Nobody can read your mind (unless you are superb in Legilimency)

Maybe I won't be able to recommend you a story but somebody else might be able to. Please put these points in your description.

** Here are a few other fics which focus on an unhealthily possessive/manipulative relationship between Harry and Tom Riddle (or Voldemort).

  'He prays for the Defense curse to work this year.'That one where a sixteen-year old Tom Riddle escapes his paper prison and takes Harry with him, only reappearing three years later.

  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.

  Voldemort discovers his human horcrux and takes control of wizarding Britain. Harry is allowed to live though it's a knife-edged journey. Attending a darker version of Hogwarts, he struggles with a strange connection to Dark Marks and Tom Riddle whispering inside his head. AU dystopia. Story is mostly gen, though praised for its platonic intimacy between the two arch-enemies.
