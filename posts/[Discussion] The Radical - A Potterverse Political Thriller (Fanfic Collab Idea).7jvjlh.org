  /'It is that rainy Wednesday morning in 1996, when the Prime Minister - that beleaguered, clueless man who leads Muggle Britain's government - receives a surprise visit from Wizarding Britain's Ministers of Magic, Cornelius Fudge and Rufus Scrimgeour. Gravely, they inform him of the real reason behind the collapse of Brockdale Bridge, the mysterious murders of Amelia Bones and Emmeline Vance, and the distinct possibility of a looming Great Wizarding War./ /The Prime Minister does not take it well - he never has been a man of strong nerves. After the news are read out to him, he shuffles out of his office in 10 Downing Street, sinks onto his knees and collapses on the pavement./

  /He has just suffered a fateful stroke. Lulled into a permanent sleep that not even the strongest of magic could rouse him from, Scrimgeour and his agent Kingsley Shacklebolt scramble to seek out a viable replacement - a Muggle to take charge of the panicking Muggle crowds once the Death Eaters make their move - and induct him into the secrets of the Wizarding World./

  Little do they know that one man is already waiting in the wings. His name is Bill Howland, First Secretary of State, and next in line of governmental succession. He, too, does not take the news of the Wizarding World exceptionally well. But unlike his predecessor, he is a man of steel nerves. He is a man of great resolve. And he is a man who always has a trick up his sleeve.

  But more importanly, he is probably also clinically insane.'

Hello there!

As you can see, I wanted to try something that might not have been done a great many times; Take a look at the Wizarding World through the lenses of a Muggle. But not just any Muggle: The Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, perhaps the single most powerful Muggle in all of Europe. I wanted to write not a fantasy or adventure story first and foremost, but give the Potterverse a political thriller spin.

To put not too fine a point on it: This might just be *Harry Potter meets House of Cards* (the original *HoC*, that is).

To start, I will have to admit that I - like the story itself - am in more than one way a Muggle; While I have been writing fanfics for various universes on and off for years, I've only been acquainted with the Potterverse through the movies. At no point did I have the opportunity to read the original stories. On my lonely own, I could never hope to write a decent, half-way canonical story set in this universe without blundering due to my regretful ignorance of the subject material. Despite this, the mythology and world-building behind Harry Potter really struck a chord with me. The way the Wizarding World chooses (or rather, doesn't choose) to interact with the Muggle world has always been a great point of contention.

Which is the reason why I'm looking for *you*!

Yes *you*, talented, well-informed Potterhead who could sound off the 10 most important magical spells of the Wizarding World in his sleep!

Have you ever wished to write an epic Harry Potter tale about conflict, morality and intrigue? Have always been interested in exploring the Wizarding World from an outside perspective and eager to give the whole affair a darker, more mature, pragmatic spin?

Then perhaps *you* are the man I would love to collaborate with!

But what say you?

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. Now complete, sequel coming soon.

** What exactly are you aiming to write, or more specifically what do you envision as the main conflict? Will it be the PM vs "Backward magical society" or PM trying to shield his citizens during Voldemort's reign of terror? Do you intend to include the Muggleborns being sent to Azkaban, turning the prison into Voldemort's concentration camp?

Tom Clancy's early works (Hunt for Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin) would be another good inspiration if you are familiar with these books. They also deal with an unknown danger that is slowly revealed through intelligence gathering and political intrigue and these are some of the ways the PM would work, trying to find out just what he is up against.

While I have no time to write a collaborative story I would be happy to assist you with questions regarding canon, provide feedback to your plot and discuss ideas with you.

PS: The whole minister meeting was is 96. 97 was Voldemort's takeover.

*** I was going for several conflicts, namely of the PM looking for a way to both ward off the Death Eaters while simultaneously undermining the Wizarding Community to rob them of their sway over the Muggle population. All while trying to make a name for himself on both sides of the magical divide, of course.

Anyway, I appreciate the offer. I was indeed considering giving the story some major spy elements, so a Tom Clancy spirit wouldn't go amiss here.

**** One of the biggest assets would be the rejected Muggleborns who could work for the MI5, gathering intelligence in the magical world (at least pre-takeover) and later still do magic (warding government buildings, magical first aid).

Depending on how close you want to stick to canon (and staying 100% true is not something I would recommend) you could have Ted Tonks escape Voldemort's Gestapo and work for the PM, with his wife Andromeda, who was raised as a pureblood and has a lot of insider knowledge, following later on.

An active involvement from the PM in the final battle would be another thing to consider. Due to the wards, you can't exactly deploy the 22nd Special Air Service Regiment to Hogwarts, but teaching a dozen Muggleborns how to set up several .50 cal on the Astronomy tower and getting a team with LAW-80s there would go a long way to take out Voldemort's meatshields from 500 yards of relative security (try aiming with a wand across that distance).

****** It depends on the wards. There's one which makes the building look like a ruin IIRC, making any on-sight military operation impossible (you don't see walls, doors, windows and so on). Airstrikes and artillery would still work but maybe Hogwarts is not the best place for that (You could still level Death Eater Manors that way while telling the pilots it's just an exercise, attacking a random ruin).

One Ward disguises the magical hospital as out of commission shop. It would be nearly impossible to work around that kind of stuff or really easy, depending on if it is a simple illusion that stops when you get through or a portal that requires magic to pass.

There's another one which hides the Leaky Cauldron, making it unappealing for non-magicals so they don't even enter the place. I see no obvious loophole.

The Fidelius charm is perhaps the most tricky one. It hides a thing and only the secret keeper can disclose it. We don't know what happens if you tear down the walls neighbouring such a place. Do you go from House Number 11 to 13, do you end up in nothingness, do you work around the secret and what is happening inside the hidden space. Depending on the workings it would also make any action against that place impossible. There's no canon explanation so you as a writer have to make that call.

You can make stuff unplottable but in theory you can spot the blank spaces on the map and just tell your people to go to a point south of it and then walk/drive/fly north

****** It seems you really want this type of story: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978). Chapters 5 and 6 are exactly about how UK Muggle government employed Muggleborns to penetrate Wizard defenses and destroy Voldemort. Very fun read, and its author is one of the best in the fandom.

  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.

** I really like the idea of this story. Your semi-intro was also intriguing and I'd likely pick up a story like this, if I hadn't seen this thread, first.

It's nothing against you personally, but it sounds like you're trying to get a beta-reader for a story that hasn't been written. There's nothing down. Nothing for me to follow.

This isn't really even a discussion thread, unless the discussion is about whether or not Harry Potter meets House of Cards is an interesting concept (hint - it totally is).

I suppose what I'm really saying is: you've given us nothing to do and, even if you had, no reason to think you'd finish it. Please absolutely come back when you have something real and don't mistake my post or the lack of response to your thread as disinterest in the idea itself.

And of course, a 'Proposal' flair would have suited the purpose much better.

I'm glad, however, that the idea is getting the reception it gets. Speaking from personal experience, I know how easily certain story concepts can earn oppressive silence - if not outright vocal rebuke - from long-time fans, so I think a little water-dipping was well warranted.
