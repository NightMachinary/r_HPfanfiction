I was wondering if any fics existed where nobody knows that Harry is the Boy Who Lived, for whatever reason?

I really like it when characters are famous or powerful and nobody else knows (or not very many people, at least), so I'd love anything like that, just secretly being the Boy Who Lived is what I'm craving at the moment.


** Powerful? Sure. But how can you be famous, if nobody knows? ü§î

** Like a superheroes alterego? Everyone knows there's a Batman, but nobody knows who he is? That would be tricky, you'd have to change a lot. Like if you said Voldemort was killed by a toddler, people would be scrutinizing attacks that happened around then. Two parents dying while a toddler lived around the time of the defeat would instantly raise a red flag, so the Ministry would have to be involved in the name suppression....and we know how secure they are. Then once Hogwarts age comes, you'd have to spread a story that he's off training overseas, and isn't attending school.

** I think what OP means is, the identity of "Harry Potter" is what's famous, but the actual person /named/ Harry Potter is an unknown. Like, how people picture "Harry Potter" would be /completely/ different to what Harry Potter is.

Best example would be any fic that changes how Harry looks (whether by birth or by some spell/potion/metamorph power later on in the story), but keeps the public identity of him looking like James Potter with Lily's eyes.

**** I know linkffn(Son of Potter, Daughter of Black) and Linkffn(To Reach Without) both do this.

The former has a bit of that inheritance malarkey all the "Hadrian" fics like to do, but imo it doesn't crap itself when it does it. The latter gets a /lot/ of world and character establishment, as what seems to be the norm for inwardtransience fics.

  Harry felt he had lost his chance at family after watching Sirius fly away only for his godfather to show up during the summer. Sirius teaches Harry what he needs to know, helping him become the true Lord Potter. Then the Tri-Wiz comes and the deepest, darkest secret of the Marauders is revealed - Harry was born the daughter of Lily and Sirius. Eventual Fem!HarryxTonks

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

** There's quite a few fics where Harry uses a different name and disguise to live as a normal student.

In linkffn(Harry McGonagall) it's in the title.

In linkffn(Luna's Hubby) he's Harry Lovegood in a very unusual relationship with Luna.

In linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) he's Harry Evans for a while (although only before Hogwarts).

** I'm actually toying with a story idea that has something like this as a by-product of the main plot; where Lily survives Voldemort's attack on the Potter's home and takes baby Harry into hiding outside of Wizarding Britain, because in grief induced madness and paranoia, she doesn't know who among her friends and acquaintances she can trust. The story would then focus on her raising her son as a single parent and widow, while trying to keep herself and Harry hidden from the Wizarding World at large.
