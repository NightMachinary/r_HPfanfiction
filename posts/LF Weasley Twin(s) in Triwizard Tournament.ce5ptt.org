Wherein Fred or George (or both) get chosen (though I highly wonder how they'd both get chosen but oh well.) I just would love to read that.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

** Couple options. They could get chosen like Fitzsimmons from Agents of SHIELD, with the twins entering as FredandGeorge.

Or, they sign their entries Gred and Forge, the Goblet gets confused and picks them both.
