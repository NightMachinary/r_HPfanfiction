Recently i have been on a streak of reading stories where the characters read the harry potter books and i'm just wondering if anyone has ever written a story where instead of directly reading the books the characters read a slightly AU or even vastly different harry potter story.

(I'm not overly bothered if they're bad)

Unfortunately it's abandoned at chapter 3... I would have loved to read a full version.
