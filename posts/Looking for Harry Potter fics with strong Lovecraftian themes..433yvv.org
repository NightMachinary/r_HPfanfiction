Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool has elements of this but I'm looking for more. I really like Lovecraft and so would love Lovecraftian Harry Potter.

Thank You.


** Something worth considering is that as far as Muggles are concerned, wizards /are/ sanity-destroying eldrich entities. I don't remember if it was an actual fic, but someone suggested that wizards could be descended from Lovecraftian creatures. One wonders if the more poweful (whatever that means) Muggleborns like Lily and Hermione might have something more recent...

And, to wizards, many of the horrors that terrified Lovecraft's protagonists would be mere nuisances. And so, a while ago, I wrote a passage wherein shortly after Voldemort's defeat, Hermione applies for a job at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures to finally do something about House-Elf treatment, but gets offered a slightly different tasking...

--------------

Hermione walked into the Department Head's office with the assurance of a job candidate who knows that she is guaranteed to be hired. The purging of Muggleborn employees during the Thicknesse administration and of Death Eater Walden Macnair and his band of butchers during the Shacklebolt administration had left the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures profoundly short-staffed, and even without her own role in the defeat of Voldemort and the attendant fame, she knew that her resume was second to none. The hardest part had been toning down the rhetoric on house-elf rights in her (admittedly overly long) cover letter.

The department head --- an elderly wizard, a recent Shacklebolt promotee to replace Macnair --- looked uncomfortable at best in his new position, as he began rather haltingly, "Miss Granger, I won't be giving away much by telling you that you are an exceptional candidate, and we would be happy to have you as an employee. But, well, I see on your cover letter that you are most interested in the treatment of house-elves..."

Hermione was not sure liked where this was going. "I am, Sir. In fact, my hope is to be involved in the drafting of the new regulations as ordered by Minister Shacklebolt."

"You are very well-informed, Miss Granger, and I am certain that you would be highly successful at this task. However, I believe that you may be better suited for a different posting in our department..."

Purebloods being obsequious to her, while not quite giving her what she wanted, was something she had encountered a lot since Voldemort's defeat. The annoyance must have shown in her body language, because the manager raised his hands in a placating gesture. "Please, hear me out. You may have, perhaps, heard of our Task Force on That Which Man Was Not Meant To Know?"

Hermione shook her head. "No, Sir, I am not familiar with that."

"Well, it's something that's not particularly secret, but not something we talk about either --- not so much Unspeakable as Would-Really-Rather-Not-Speakable and You-Really-Don't-Want-To-Knowable. It's a task force in our department that deals with creatures left behind by ancient civilizations, cults seeking to summon or resurrect eldrich horrors whose mere sight shatters sanity, and similar nuisances."

Hermione frowned. "Shouldn't matters like that be handled by the Aurors or the Unspakables?"

"A very astute suggestion, Miss Granger, and one that we at DRCMC have made many times. However, as you might guess, Auror Office and the Department of Mysteries have a bit more prestige that we do. Every time it's come up, the Aurors insist that they have their hands full with Dark Wizards, and, well, the cultists in question tend to be Muggles. Obliviators refuse to get involved until the scene is secure, but Hitwizards aren't qualified to secure it. The Unspeakables, they hate the field work involved, and consider what they call 'exorcism' beneath them. The policymakers, thus, see that it involves Magical Creatures of some sort, and leave it on our humble doorstep, so to speak. Anyway, whether we like it or not, we do have to staff the task force, and, I feel that your talents would be best used there."

"But Sir, I haven't even read about any of these cults or eldrich horrors," Hermione admitted with some reluctance.

"Nor would we expect you to have; the information is shared on the Crazy-Enough-to-Want-to-Know basis. Still, I have here a list of qualifications from the last head of the task force --- the position was recently, and regrettably, vacated."

"Voldemort?" The department head shuddered at Hermione's casual use of the name.

"No, it says here, 'Workplace accident'. Anyway, beyond a NEWT in Care of Magical Creatures to work here, of course, the task force needs a NEWT in Astronomy, because it's helpful to know 'when the stars are right', whatever that means; a NEWT in Ancient Runes to 'investigate cultic rituals and shrines and ruins of ancient civilizations'; and it also recommends at least an OWL in Defense Against the Dark Arts, though he crossed out 'Dark' and tried to write in something else, here, for some reason."

Hermione looked. It was an odd variant of Nacaal, but...

"In addition," the manager continued undaunted, "The task force also wants someone who can cast a corporeal Patronus, because it seems to 'provide some solace in this otherwise bleak and hopeless reality', and you seem to have that covered. The qualifications sheet asks for facility with field application of Memory Charms, though it's listed under First Aid skills, for some reason... Anyway, your Other Skills list says that you have some experience with that."

Hermione nodded, and the department head continued. "Now, then, basic Occlumency, that's not on your resume."

"I am familiar with the concept, Sir, but I didn't know anyone who could teach me properly."

"Yes, and I've signed you up for the quarterly workshop that the Unspeakables offer. It starts in two weeks. So, are you interested?"

"What about the house-elf regulations position?"

The DRCMC head gave a tired sigh, and took a moment to rub his eyes, before leaning forward and lowering his voice. "Miss Granger, if you take the position on the task force, then I will hire someone --- anyone you want --- to write the regulation. Find me someone, and I'll hire him. A Muggle, if that's what you want. Two people, if that's what it takes to write the regulations you want to see. We need to staff the task force properly, and it's very hard to find people both qualified and willing."

--------------

It still needs a plot, but some things that could happen:

- Once she gets there, Hermione finds that Luna has also joined the task force. (Since Hermione came back to Hogwarts to finish her NEWTs, she and Luna would graduate at the same time.) Together, they embark on a jaunt through the Lovecraft mythos that's part adventure/mystery, part buddy-cop comedy. They would complement each other well: there would be some instances when Luna's imaginativeness and intuition save the day, and some instances where it leads them to discover some creatures that they wish they hadn't, and it is Hermione's breadth of knowledge, technical skill, and planning that prevents disaster.
- One of her first assignments might lead her to find a whole colony of free house-elves who are happy about it. At first, she is happy to be vindicated: that serving is /not/, in fact, in the elves' nature, but is a product of brainwashing that can be undone. However, it turns out that house-elves' compulsion to serve and to clean was not created by wizards, but merely channeled by them: that house-elves in their natural state will seek to impose their notion of orderliness on the world --- a notion that might not include life as we know it.
- It could be a ploy hatched by some surviving pureblood supremacists to catch two snitches with one hand: appease some sacrifice-demanding eldrich entity for a few more years, while getting rid of Potter's pesky mudblood sidekick. The ploy would test the limits of her knowledge, magical skill, and her very sanity.
- This could be one of the few scenarios where Arithmancy and Ancient Runes in their canon meanings --- numerology/divination with numbers and dead languages --- would actually be indispensable.

*** That sounds brilliant. I love it. A possible plot could be that there was a Muggle who saw a battle against the Death Eaters and with the Ministry in shambles at the time he went unobliviated. He starts to really fixate on the things he saw and delved into Muggle understandings of magic. He's really obsessed by this point and eventually comes across an old book that draws him to it. As he begins to read it he is disgusted and dumps the book in his library, but the seed has already been planted in his mind. He keeps looking for a way to defeat magic users but is unsuccessful, eventually a mix of fear and obsession drive him to open the book once more and he delves deeply into the terrible unknowns. He later finds a support group of people who have seen the magic users. By this time he and the book are inseparable, and he comes before the support group. These people are already slightly unhinged at witnessing the magic first hand and without knowledge and so after a bit of convincing agree to whatever means necessary.

Bing bang boom, you have a cult who's out to destroy magic users. You could have Hermione and Luna take down a few small cults and then they get put on this case. After a few Wizarding deaths the Auror gets put on this case with Hermione and Luna helping them because A) it's their case and job, and B) they are War heroes.

Just a thought don't know how helpful it is to you.

**** A Lovecraftian horror from the point of view of a Muggle interacting with eldrich abominations that are wizards? That works too, especially if said Muggle ends up summoning even worse abominations into the world in trying to counter those wizards.

I don't have any plans to actually write any follow-ups to this snippet, but if someone wants to adopt it, feel free.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.
