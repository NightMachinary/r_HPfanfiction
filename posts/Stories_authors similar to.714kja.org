I've now read almost every story by maisey2k10 and I seriously loved them! They have me giggling and laughing out loud, crying and feeling sad for the characters. My favorite were linkffn(12171387) linkffn(11938186) linkffn(11600583) The long stories where able to keep my attention throughout the whole story, when I usually get bored around 200k wording.

So I'm looking for stories/authors like this. A powerful Hermione (or others) with romance in them. As stories where they still kill voldemort. Soul Bonded was hilarious in places, and I love the sibling bond between Harry and Hermione, and Hermione being distantly related to Voldemort.

It's hard to explain what I'm looking for, but if you've read the stories and loved them you know what I'm talking about!

Thank you
