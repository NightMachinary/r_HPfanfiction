yeah, i would like to know Fics that have Ginny as the Mainprotagonist and her being part of something bigger. For instance, being a secret Agent of an Organization....actually i would like that idea. So this Group may have access to high developed Magic equipment, so she can travel throug time and Dimensions to either Fight evil or just observate.

Im afraid, this Request might get a bit to detailed, but it doesnt have to fit all, that i will write now as my main Request is in the title alone.

The Travel could or could not have affecting her personal timeline, means: she is "split". Lets say, the Canon Ginny isnt the original one, but a abandoned part of the original one.

Through time and Dimension travel, she might have meet several Partners and even have Lovers (males and Females).

Possibly (but not necessary) Ginevra isnt even her Real name, but either her Canon one (so the name ONE of her Splits is having) or a Codename.

​

I think, it would be interesting if Canon Harry and THIS Ginny would meet at some point and maybe even sleep with each other. Well, to do this, they must have some sort of connection and maybe the other Ginny has a totally different Personality than his.

​

Now, the idea with Ginny having several Lovers through Time and Dimension is exciting me and i would like to know, Fics with this, but its no Prime request if it would decrease the Fics that i would like to know. Who the Partners be doesnt matter. She could have a Lover in a Dimension, that she despises in the Canon one, because other Personalities.

​

So, i guess that was all, that i can think of. If there are no Fics with that Criteria (as i mentioned above, it would be good enough if my Title Request would fit, but the others as additional Points would be great too), then you can feel free to use this as a Plot bunny. It was my Pleasure.
