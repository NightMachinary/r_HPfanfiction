*** The scar doesn't burn when Harry's around Voldemort because he has Voldemort's soul in it, that's ridiculous why would Voldemort's soul warn of itself? No, the scar burns because Lily is internally screaming that Harry needs to run away from the danger.

*** James.

She had seen the prophecies, and saw the likely outcomes. To set up a desperate gambit of this sort required a will of someone dedicated to a greater cause. James would not survive the war, or even the year. If he were to die, let it count for something.

And so, Lily sent the Cloak away, secured them alone, away from casual interference, and committed herself, her /entire family/, to lay the most daring trap she could devise.

Because in a war over ideology, the most-committed wins.

**** The sacrifice of one form of attachment for another... That could be one way to look at the Horcrux creation ritual.

Voldemort felt very little or no link to any of the people he killed making Horcruxes, and the more he made the less human he appeared, so you could say he was sacrificing his attachment to humanity in order to attach his soul to the material world/plane whatever. I guess the cumulative effect could have impacted other thing besides empathy like sanity and whatnot.

Lily in sacrificing James, whom she loves would be able to maintain her empathy and sanity, and still be attached to the mortal plane. The strength of the attachment sacrificed might even affect the quality of the Horcrux created and how well it defends itself.

One issue that could crop up is the whole re-absorbing the soul piece if you feel remorse thing. If she ever gets a body, she might re-absorb the Horcrux in Harry by accident (regretting that she, Harry and James never got to be one big happy family and poof, it's gone)

***** Now I'm thinking of a crossover with MCU where Lily finds her way to Vormir in 1980, sacrifices James to get the Soul stone and uses it to modify Harry into a form powerful enough to contain it. In other words, Harry == Adam Warlock.

***** "Mother and father never really understood, but they could pretend. Petunia had been so excited, wanted to go to Hogwarts, she even wrote to the Headmaster... And so did mum and daddy. They convinced him not to let her learn the non wand based magics. Pet always blamed us, witches and wizards, but it was our own parents all along. They HURT her, my sister... and I couldn't forgive that... So I staged a break in. Made it look like a home invasion to the bobbies and a Death Eater attack to the Aurors. Nobody would suspect Lily Potter, who was in hiding with her husband and newborne son... But their deaths meant Harry would ALWAYS live, with his mother there to help him..."

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/][Death of Today]] also posseses a variant of that. In this fic, Harry isn't the boy who lived but Lily's protection consists of a horcrux tied to Harry.

I this fic Harry (Izar) is a product of an affair between Lily and Regulus Black - Lily seduced him in order to get intel for the Order of the Phoenix and gives Harry up to an orphanage.

Basically her Horcrux protects Harry from being possessed at one point.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5490079/1/The-Little-Veela-that-Could][The Little Veela That Could]] has a variant of the horcrux as a core concept of the story, in this case the concept of a "light horcrux" where a love sacrifice can create a kind of soul link/mix between two people; the attempted scarcrux prevented Harry from being able to play host to Lily's spirit however as they kinda destroyed each other. This is mostly background though as the main story is Harry takes a spear through the heart when a crazed merman tries to kill Gabrielle at the end of the second task, and his death turns her into his light horcrux, and then it turns out that Veela who bond like that before they hit puberty become obscenely OP super-halo-power love-triggered angels instead of fireball-tossing anger-triggered birds (but everyone had forgotten as the last instance was millennia ago), and they even meet Lucifer (who isn't evil). Yeah it kinda goes nuts lol, and even pokes fun at itself in the epilogue's omake.

** Actually my favorite theory by far (not sure if I picked it up somewhere or this is an original thought) is that he survived because he's the master of death. And how could he become the MoD in the first place if he were to die as a baby? Basically it's one of those HP time travel concepts. Harry survives the encounter with the horde of dementors in book 3 because his future self dealt with them. And he survived Voldemorts AK as a baby because he's the master of death (in the future). But does death really limit itself to time?

But obviously Lily sacrificing her life through a magical ritual for her baby is far more beautiful/poetic.
