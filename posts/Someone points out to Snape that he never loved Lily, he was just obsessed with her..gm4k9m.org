Doesn't really matter who, but I'd prefer it to be Dumbledore.


** Not quite but "consequence for cause" by Cambangst touches on this

The following is an excerpt that I consider to be the essence of the fic

SPOILERS AHEAD

Snape stomped across the room and stopped in front of Dumbledore's desk. "Potter and I loathe one another. That is never going to change. If the boy must be educated, why not set the task to Lupin or Moody? Someone he does not despise."

Something in the room changed. A palpable energy charged the air, like the hum of electricity before a lightning strike. In spite of his anger, Snape took half a step back.

"Why do you suppose he hates you so, Severus?" Dumbledore's voice was soft. Dangerous. Like the whisper of an assassin's blade.

Snape threw up his arms in frustration. "We both know very well why he's been made to hate me. The Dark Lord can never suspect the truth, otherwise your plans would be ruined. This is the role you've cast for me, Dumbledore."

The old man's expression remained impassive. "What you're describing, Severus, is a consequence, not a cause. You're more than clever enough to understand the difference. Why does Potter hate you?"

Snape spun around like a petulant youngster, no longer able to stomach the hard blue eyes that saw through him. "He blames me for the death of his parents."

"Shouldn't he?"

The younger man turned back to face the Headmaster, eyes blazing with anger. "That was your failing, Dumbledore. Not mine, yours!" His voice rose to a shout. "I gave you everything. Told you everything. Swore my life to you! On one condition." He pounded his fist against the great, wooden desk. "One condition only! That you would keep them safe!"

Dumbledore continued to regard him with a cold, steely calm. "Keep her safe," he quietly corrected. "You asked me to keep her safe. And once again, you confuse consequence for cause. Why did she require my protection? What compelled you to swear your life to me?" Snape's eyes fell to the floor. After several moments of painful silence, the Headmaster continued. "There's something I want you to know, Severus. I never told her how the Dark Lord came to know of the prophecy." The former Potions Master's head snapped back up, genuine shock filling his normally stony face. "I thought she'd already suffered more than enough anguish on your account."

The old man rose to his feet. His blue eyes burned with barely contained fury. "Lily Potter never knew that the boy she befriended as a little girl was the one who betrayed her to the Dark Lord." Snape fell back several steps, looking stricken, until he bumped into an overstuffed armchair and barely caught himself before he crashed to the floor. "Lily Potter died without knowing that boy tried to sacrifice her family to the Dark Lord in return for her life." Dumbledore slowly made his way around the desk. The air around him crackled with magic. "And Lily Potter rests peacefully without knowing how shamefully that boy has treated her son."

The Headmaster came to a stop in front of Snape, staring down at him with an expression of pure disgust. "Lily Potter will never have to carry those burdens. But you know how she would have felt about those things, Severus. How she would have felt about you. You know it every time you see her eyes, filled with hatred, on the face of her son. And so long as I'm alive, that is a burden you will never escape." He towered over Snape's cowering form for a few moments longer, eyes boring into the younger man, before turning away to face the window. "You have much to do tomorrow. Leave me. Go back to your dungeons. Sleep, if you're able."

Neither man spoke another word as Severus Snape hurried out of the Headmaster's office.

*** Oh, boy. I was confused as to whether this was from the source material or if this was a fic. When I realized that it was a fanfic, I thought, "/My God, that's some superb writing/."

I just was wondering. The reason I thought it might be from the book was because of the quote, "You have much to do tomorrow. Leave me. Go back to your dungeons. Sleep, if you're able." Seriously, if that's a fanfic, that is /so good/.

  "It will be repeated anywhere we damn well please and as loudly as we choose," the goblin in black barked back at him. "It's not like anyone would believe it, even if we did. '/Master, could you please try not killing this one, I'd like to keep her as a pet. Kill the kid though,/' is hardly an expression of love. Now get out," he dismissed the human with a wave.

  The presence of armed guards and him having no wand probably had more to do with his quick exit than anything else.

  Severus Snape had loved Lily Evans? Who cares?

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.

** This is not exactly what you asked for, but he gets dressed down by Dumbledore after Harry dismantles him both in a duel and verbally.

I told you Severus." Albus Dumbledore said as he approached the bed of his Defense teacher. "I told you at the beginning of the year. I told you when I announced that he would be coming to Hogwarts. I have told you and told you and told you every time we have spoken and you prattled on and on about Harry Potter's supposed arrogance and lack of respect. So I must ask why you chose to provoke him in your class?"

"Did you hear him?" Snape asked, his anger rising now that the headmaster was there. "Did you hear that brat threaten me?"

"I heard everything." Dumbledore nodded. "Though he spoke softly I managed to hear everything that was said."

"And what do you mean to do about it? He threatened me. He very nearly killed me in front of my students!"

"In a duel you instigated, and only after you tried to use a very dark spell upon him."

Dumbledore's normally kind nature turned sour. "I can not understand it, Severus. I wish for you to explain to me just what you were thinking using such a spell in a classroom and on a student, no less. You are lucky to still be breathing. If Mister Thomas hadn't gotten so afraid and come to find me, I daresay you might not be sitting here now, and Harry would have been well within his right to have ended your life."

"He's as arrogant as..."

"No he is not!" Albus snapped, making Snape cringe. Albus Dumbledore hardly ever raised his voice, but when he did, it never failed to make anyone feel like a small petulant child.

"I have tried time and time again to get you to let go of your hatred of James Potter. I have begged and pleaded with you to treat your all of your students as equals and teach them to the best of your abilities. Yet every year I am disappointed to learn how you discourage and humiliate the young minds in your charge. I now realize that it was me who failed those students. For fifteen years, i have failed the children whom you taught."

"What are you talking about?" Snape asked, looking very confused.

"Your dismissal." Dumbledore grimaced. Snape rose up again, gaping like a fish as he stared at the man whom he'd looked up to, and had sworn loyalty to fifteen years ago.

"What?" Snape gasped.

"Why do you think I finally allowed you the post which you have so long coveted?" Dumbledore asked, folding his hands and sitting down on the bed next to Snape, heaving a sigh when he settled down. "You are aware as I am that the post is cursed. We've not had a teacher remain for more than a year for some time now."

"Wait a minute... You allowed me to have the post because you were sick of me?" Snape sat up suddenly, regretting it at once as every nerve in his chest screamed out.

"I did." Albus admitted. Snape bristled at the Headmaster's admission.

"Why?"

"I think it should be more than obvious. You refuse to teach. You insult and torment every student not in Slytherin. Your favoritism of your own house is only outshined by your reprehensible teaching methods. If I hadn't felt the responsibility for your safety all these years, I would have sacked you ten years ago. I have defended you to the other teachers, and to the school governors, always hoping I would be able to get through to you. Every year I am forced to sit down with you and all but beg you to treat each and every student in a fair and unbiased manner. To give them your wealth of knowledge, and every year, you have spat in my face with your behavior." Dumbledore said sadly.

Snape could only stare in abject horror at what the Headmaster had said. Dumbledore rose to his feet now, and stared at his defense teacher.

"I gave you the post of Defense teacher because I knew that somehow, the curse would set you up so that you would not return. Though it was my hope that you would leave unharmed. You came very close to death, Severus. Were it not for several very frightened students... Gryffindor students, you surely would have. At the end of the year, I am terminating your employment here at Hogwarts. Should you choose to no longer be

** Can't resist a bit of self-promotion:

#+begin_quote
  "Potter," Severus spat with a hateful sneer, "it always comes back to precious, perfect, /Potter/. Just like his father, he struts around the castle, expecting us all to bow down before his greatness. Everyone else is so desperate to lionize the arrogant brat; well I'd rather make sure the little /hero/ doesn't get a swelled head."

  The Headmaster's frown deepened. "I do not know which student /you/ have been watching, Severus, but in my observations there seems to be very little of James in Harry. I have seen far more of Lily - you /do/ recall the woman you professed to love, and upon whose grave you swore to protect her son? - and occasional glimpses of Fleamont or Euphemia. No, if any child in this class behaves in a way resembling your schoolyard nemesis, it is not Harry Potter." At this, he turned to the floating liver. "The closest analog to a young James Potter is, I would say, in the house of snakes. I seem to recall a report from Horace in 1971 about giving detention to a pair of Gryffindor first-years for attempting to throw rat livers into the potions of a particular Slytherin classmate. Judging by your face, you remember the incident as well."

  It was clear that the potions master was still busy swimming an Egyptian river; a more forceful approach would be required. "Rather than overcoming the trials of your youth, it would appear that you have embraced them, allowing your hatred to fester and turn you into a bully. Worse, you are a grown man bullying /children/." Albus steeled himself, hating the wound he knew his next words would inflict, but feeling it was at this point the only hope of making the man see sense. "Just like your father."

** Ive thought this so much. Glad someone brought it up. Snape would have not just protected harry but would have done everything in his power for him to make up for what he did to his mother. By caring for something she loved more then herself he would have proved his love and remorse. Instead hes petty, jealous, spiteful. I believe he lost the ability to love truly by using the dark arts. And his love turned into obsession. So any fanfic that addresses this would be cool.
