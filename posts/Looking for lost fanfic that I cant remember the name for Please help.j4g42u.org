:END:
Please help me look for a fanfic that I have been trying to look for for the past couple of days. I cant remember the name or the author. I dont really remember much of the plot but I do remember some scenes.

It is a Harry/Hermione pairing. I think it might have been a soul bond fic. They get married in a ritual in a cave. I believe Andromeda and McGonagall were there as well as Hermiones parents. There's some Weasley bashing. Ginny breaks in their house and ruins Hermiones wedding dress at some point. They're friends with Neville and get a long with the Malfoys(? This is questionable). There's strong house magic/bond. I think theyre living in Scotland with Harry taking up his lordship in the Wizengamot.

This is all I can remember of the story. PLEASE IF SOMEONE KNOWS ANYTHING HELP. I've been staying up at night trying to figure it out.
