:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I tried to find the Fic unfortunately without success maybe you can help me . This fic deviates from the stanadrt TT fic in several points. 1. I do not know how far back Harry will be transported, but it was several centuries. There is already Beauxbatons, which Harry visits . He wanted to get to know another school because of that he goes there. Not sure but there he gets a master in runes.

2.He stays in France, buys land, they trie to force him into the army, it was bevor the state of secrets. Harry successfully opposes it.

3.He opens an account at the Goblinbank in France. He has a relatively good relationship with the Goblins.

4.He tries several years to find a way back to the future without success. Harry then moves into stasis until the point of Time Travel.

1. Dumbeldoor is his enemy, as is Snape. He uses Snape lifedept to lure Dumbeldoor into a trap.

Sorry Englisch is not my first language.üòÅ
