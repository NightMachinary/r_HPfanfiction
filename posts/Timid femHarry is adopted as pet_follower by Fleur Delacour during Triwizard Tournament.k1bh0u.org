Other students are isolating Harry due to being the 4th champion.

Teachers do not think it is proper for Fleur to have Harry as a pet/follower.

You mean the adults don't approve of a legal adult treating a 14-year-old human girl like a pet? Weird.

** Harriet Potter had not heard much about Beauxbaton's new champion, at least nothing of importance. Her expectations weren't very high. I mean, a french Veela, used to everyone falling over for her? Beautiful, magically strong and probably rich?

Yeah, she was going to be a bitch. So when they finally crossed paths for the first time, she expected a bit of staring, followed by instantaneous dismissal. Maybe a sneer or an insult knowing her usual luck.

The Staring was there, the squeal was unexpected, the hug was completely out of the left field.

â€‹

Fleur Delacour had heard about the girl who lived, and she wasn't expecting much. She definitively wasn't expecting this adorable looking little gal. Fleur didn't expect shyness, her stunning green eyes, her loneliness, her unbearably Small and cute appearance. Now, with Harry trapped in her arms, one hand running through her hair (So Fluffy!) Fleur decided that she was going to keep her. She didn't seem to have friends here, and maybe Madame Maxime wouldn't notice if there was an extra student on the return trip?

  AU 4th year. Hope is strong with plenty of secrets, especial the one hidden because 'reasons' okay? However, it shows the light for the corruption it holds. And a beautiful Veela sees our heroes secrets unravelled joyfully within her arms. And the dark is shown to have been made to give the light power and reason. But Hope will stand strong and change the world.
