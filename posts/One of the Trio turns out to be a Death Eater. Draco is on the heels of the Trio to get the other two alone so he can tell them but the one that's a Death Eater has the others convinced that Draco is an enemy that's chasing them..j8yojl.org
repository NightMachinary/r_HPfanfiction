** "I'm telling you,Potter's a Death Eater" sputtered Malfoy

"Oh fuck off ya donkey faced nonce" retorted Ron hotly

"It's true,why else do you think he's spending so much time with Greengrass. Her parents are in the inner circle." insisted Draco

"We.. thought they were a GREY type" said Hermione quietly

"That's not a thing. The Greengrasses are insane,they've convinced Harry that Weas-Ron and his sister are being paid by Dumbldore to be his friend. Imperiused a ton of goblins to pull it off,had them say Harry was the heir to all four founders or somerhing ludicrous to that extent"

"And he believed them" sputtered Hermione

"I'm fairly sure Greengrass slipped him a love potion at the Opening Feast this year,did he even know who she was before that ?"

"No..." said Ron after thinking it over

"The potions have made him mad as a hatter,he wants Ron and his whole family to be enslaved in the Gringotts mines even though that is LIKE ultra-illegal."

Draco turned to Hermione "And he wants to force into this HAREM he's building,along with every other girl in this castle"

Hermione snarled at the thought

"I suppose we should have seen this coming when he smacked me for not calling him Hadrian" said Ron sadly
