Tom Marvolo Riddle, a genius graduate from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, has come exceptionally close to unraveling the most dangerous secret of the Wizarding World. His journey across the world in pursuit of power, immortality and many things more has brought back something that is lost in the flow of time, not that he truly understood its true power at that point. That, however, doesn't mean Riddle didn't waste its potential. For years, the population in Britain, both magical and Muggles, were terrorized by the seemingly */omnipresence/* of the power-hungry Lord Voldermort, until that fateful night in 1981, when Riddle's Killing Curse backfired upon hitting the last living member of the Potter family. Later on, Albus Dumbledoor would suspect that the soul shard of Voldermort had latched onto young Harry, making him another Horcrux of the Dark Lord. What Albus didn't know, however, is that the shard wasn't the only thing that merged with Harry Potter that night. When Tom Riddle's body became nothing more than dust, a certain stone that has been granting him immense power also integrate itself into the only close living being. On that fateful night, Harry Potter gained the might of the Space Stone.

Featuring:

- A Time Stone in possession of one Nicolas Flamel, who was using it to maintain immortality.

- A Power Stone lied within the elder wood of the Deathstick, not that anyone would dare break the wand in order to obtain it.

- A Mind Stone broken into two, one half the brightest jewel on the lost diadem of Ravenclaw, said to enhance one's mind to the limit; the other the gemstone on the Sword of Gryffindor, manipulated the mind of others to follow the owner, speculated to be the cause behind why Godric himself was considered to be unmatched on the battlefield.

- A Reality Stone, its true power long lost to history, and its known name? Nothing else than the Resurrection Stone.

- A Soul Stone lied deep within the Azkaban Prison, cursing whoever dare to claim its power to lost their soul to the stone, condemning them forever trying to regain the mortal life once more by stealing the souls of others unfortunate to cross their path.


** Hmmm... Seems fun.\\
So what I'd like to know how the Azkaban stone came to be in that state? Did someone hook it up to an enchantment that causes the effect, or set the stone itself to do that and became its first victim, the stone continuing the actions in absence of new orders, or maybe something else?

One thing I don't think could happen is for any of the Stones to be permanently without a wielder. Sure, there have been quiet periods in their history, but like attracts like and the stones itself are an administrative tool of the universe, unbreakable and wanting to be used. So, no matter how improbable, there would have to be a possible way to retrieve the Soul Stone.

*** Well first, it's just a prompt so certain facts can be twisted to "fit" the stones into the HP world, so to speak. And to answer your question, yes, perhaps the Soul Stone is in a different reality of sort, and to access it you have to go through a soulgate or something like that (the veil in the ministry comes to mind) and if you aren't ready to bear the burden then you immediately become a Dementor. I must confess that the idea comes from the similarity betwenn Red Skull and the Dementors though.

**** Why not just have the soul stone be powering the Veil? The ministry just thinks it's a enchanted item that kills people. The Space stone could be in the DOM as the foundation for portkey and Apperation development.

****** Perhaps. If I was slightly better at writing I'd probably make one of those comment-fics but I'm utter trash at it.

** I was playing with Funko pops today with my daughter and had Thanos arrive at Hagrid's hut and demand the Whereabouts of Albus Dumbledore the possessor of the power Stone. Wonderful prompt that sparks fun imagination
