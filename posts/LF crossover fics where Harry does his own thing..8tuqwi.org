What I mean is when Harry goes to the new world, states, parallel world etc. (When he leaves the magical world behind), he doesn't suddenly meet with the canon characters of the other part of the crossover. For example, if it is Avengers/HP crossover, he doesn't meet with the Avengers, shield, etc. does not join them, and/or shield doesn't keep the tabs on him(Or maybe they aren't even aware of him.) If it is DC, he doesn't join any hero/villain organization(Justice league, young Justice team, teen titans, The Light, League of assassins etc...)

Bonus points if Harry is too OP for the setting and the bad guys don't suddenly get a weakness out of him by Author Fiat. I recently read a BTVS/HP crossover and while Harry was inspecting the demonic wards over that demon lawyer building he gets found out and while trying to hurry away with the apparition he lefts behind few strands of hair. Just because Harry was literally too OP for the setting the author introduced a weakness that the demons could use.

Harry in LoTR. He's no OP, besides not really being able to die, but in the worst sort of way. No shortcuts for Harry, no wand means no wanded magic, he doesn't magically learn how to do all the fun stuff without a wand.

Really great crossover.

*** Can you read this without being a fan of LoTR, only knowing a bit from the movies and having read the trilogy ?

**** It definitely dives deep into the lore of Middle Earth, but I think you could enjoy it without that deep of knowledge.

***** Agreed.

It's a bit interesting, on one hand it starts a thousand years in the past so knowing the lore is great so you have a better idea of the setting and what's going on, but at the same time, because it's a thousand years ago, there isn't that much important LOTR trilogy stuff that's already going on so you can dive in with just a basic understanding and learn as you go.

That, and the fact that it's written well enough you don't /need/ a deep dive into the lore/appendixes/other books. At least that's how it felt to me.

**** I've only seen the movies a few times each and read the Hobbit and I liked the story a lot.

Edit: my main complaint with it is that it literally ends (for now) at the most interesting/important part in the story so far

**** Dont know anything about Lotr except what I remember from the movies back when they came out.\\
It was a decent read. Even if you dont like the Lotr-Universe, it still is entertaining.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.
