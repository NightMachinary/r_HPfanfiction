I can't find many. Complete is preferable.


** I only know Drarry fanfics where Draco is a Veela, but here are some of my favourites:

- Soup-pocalypse and The Great Curry Cataclysm by SquadofCats linkao3( [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16036310/chapters/37431866]] )

- In His Nature by create_serenity linkao3( [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3513911]] )

- My Name Was Safest in Your Mouth by alpha_exodus linkao3( [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12824382]] )

- The Arrangement by create_serenity linkao3( [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3730711]] )

- Too Cold Outside (For Angels to Fly) by gracerene linkao3( [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21602251/chapters/51509422]] )

  Eleven years after the war, Draco Malfoy leads a quiet, boring, and perfectly respectable life, thanks very much. Or, at least he does, until a sudden and very unexpected veela awakening causes him to throw soup all over Harry Potter in the middle of the Ministry cafeteria.

  Harry agreed to have sex with Draco once a month in order to keep him alive, what he didn't agree to was Draco popping up all over the place and disrupting his life in more ways than one.

#+begin_quote
  Harry didn't ask for Malfoy to walk into his shop after so many years. But one event leads to another, and soon they're scrambling to help Hermione find the solution to one of the most insidious viruses the wizarding world has ever seen. To make matters worse, Malfoy's hiding something, and Harry really wants to kiss him---except Malfoy doesn't date. Ever.

#+begin_quote
  The arrangement was very simple really, and very convenient. Draco just hadn't expected it to result in this mess.Written for the do_me_veela prompt: Harry and Draco help each other out during dry spells when no one else is around that they can have sex with. They unintentionally bond and well, it's all Potter's fault.
