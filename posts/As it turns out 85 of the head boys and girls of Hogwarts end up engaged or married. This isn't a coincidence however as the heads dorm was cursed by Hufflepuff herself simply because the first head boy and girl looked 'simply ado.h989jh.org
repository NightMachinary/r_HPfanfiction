- One, Pansy's not a racist asshole towards Harry, so we don't have as many instances of her yelling insults about his blood as we do with Draco and Hermione, where Draco keeps dropping slurs at her.
- Two, Pansy's just not around as much, so there's less negative stuff with her from canon. There's just less specific examples of her being a shit. Hell, in DH her most shitty thing is...being a 17 year old who doesn't want to die. I know we're supposed to hate her for that but...eh?

******** In my opinion a lot of the Draco romance just seems to be projection. Hermione though is just a character I've never really liked, in canon at least. My biggest problem with the whole redemption stuff for Draco is that it was unlike Snape where Draco was basically taught it, and even then it wasn't much his fault as he didnt know what else to think. That's my whole problem with a lot of redemption arcs in fanfiction, is that it either doesn't address this, or does it terrible in my opinion.

oh wait "good teacher" i can see where this theory might fall apart in fanon.

Firstly, Heads dorm makes sense. While we don't know exactly what the Head Boy and Head Girl /did/ (at least, I don't remember a book saying what they did or even mentioning who had the roles after Percy left) if we assume that they're above Prefects but below Professors it makes sense that you'd want them staying somewhere outside of the House dorms. Both for the appearance of neutrality and so the Prefects of other Houses could speak to them.

And also, having it be Helga Hufflepuff who did the curse avoids any of the weird Professor manipulation undertones of some of these fics by having them be as exasperated as any of them.

Head Boy and Girl just seem to be ultra-prefects, and prefects don't get a dorm to themselves, they're there to lead the student population and they need to be among them to do that, not set apart in a show of "muh authoritah!" There was no mention of Percy living elsewhere, he was still hanging out in the Gryffindor common room.

The Head dorm room concept is just some fanfic nonsense for romance and reluctant romance fics. No teacher or headmaster would think it was a good idea. It requires a LOT of suspension of disbelief, and I've yet to read a good fic that featured one.

** I wonder if the 15% of the time that it doesn't work is because one or both of the heads a) are gay/lesbian, b) are asexual/neutered, c) have a non-human heritage that makes them only compatible to someone else who also has that same heritage, d) a set soulmate(s), e) couldn't get engaged because they were already engaged before they became a head, or f) died before they could.

******** I can also see this going the other way, though. Politics is largely about image (especially election based politics, like becoming minister) and although it's important to be seen as competent and capable, there's also an element of relatable/embodying the values that you want to represent. It's not impossible that Percy, living in a generally conservative society like the Wizarding World, would think "I need a serious relationship, leading to a wife and a couple kids, to be seen the way I want to be in order to further my campaign/career." It's also true that for a long time, men with families were more likely to be promoted because they were seen as needing the money more

*********** Okay, but even if 5% is gay, you only need 1 out of 2 of the students to be gay. So it's not 15% of head students, it's 15% of pairs have at least one gay head student. Only one needs to be gay for the curse to fail. So that's needing half as many to be gay. So about 7.5%. Still perhaps a bit disproportionate to the general population, but not overly so and maybe other factors influence the behaviour of gay students at Hogwarts, leading them to act in a way that makes them more likely to be chosen as head boy or girl.

************ It would be true if the curse only worked one time or two (ok even 10 times, why not) but this curse has been around since the time of the founders, as per OP, so more than a thousand years. If one of the students being gay was the only reason for the curse to fail, after so many instances, probabilities tell us that the failure rate should be close to the part of the population who is gay (see the law of huge numbers). So if 5% of the population is gay, it represents around 5 of the 15% failure rate, which still leaves around 2/3 of it unacounted for. The idea that magic cannot make people fall in love, and thus the curse only creates the conditions to make it happen is a far better explaination. First of all because if magic was able to make people fall in love, I don't see why it would care if you're gay or not, It should make you fall in love anyway. The absurdly high 85% success rate is then a testament to how powerful a witch Hufflepuff was. Or, again, you could have more gay in the magical world, but having multiple causes instead seems more interresting.

But they do have the prefects bathroom, so they could have other things. Like a study room, or an office for the the Headboy and girl and if it was cursed it might do cool things like the room of requirements so they would use it all the time. Like your studying hard and a snack appears when you get hungry. Only eventually the room sneaks stuff in for it's agenda. (Evil laugh)

** Interesting. I'll have a little prompt, if I'm allowed.

So, this Harry hasn't let Ron's bad habits infect him. He's found that he was best at defense against the dark arts. While studying it, he stumbles upon curse breaking, and finds that he likes solving the mysteries that are curses and wards, he finds it simulating. Soon, he becomes passionate about it.

Arrives year 7. Voldemort, aware of the curse on the head boy and girl, decide to meddle again. He'll have Harry made head boy, and the daughter of a sympathizer made head girl, this way, it will be easy for him to deal with Harry.

As he realizes having the daughter of one of his close subordinates do it would be too obvious, he uses blackmail or other methods to use Daphne Greengrass instead.

So we have Harry, who decided to break this curse but has to balance it with his new duties as head boy, and Daphne, trying to escape the clutches of Voldemort and keep her neutrality. Draco is ordered to keep an eye on Daphne. Then Daphne's friends decide to "protect" her from harry, and Ginny starts becoming jealous.

So now everything's in place for Harry's, Daphne's and Voldemort's plots to clash horribly with each other, while Dumbledore's meddling and Draco's nonsense only make things worse.

Amongst all that, Harry still has to keep up in the competition with his rival from first year, one Hermione Granger.
