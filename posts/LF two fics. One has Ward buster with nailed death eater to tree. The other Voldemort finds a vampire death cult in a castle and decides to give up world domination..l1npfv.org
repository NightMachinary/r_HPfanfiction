** I am certain that I read that first fic years ago, but I don't know what it could be. My instinct is to say might have been nonjon's /A Black Comedy/, but my quick searches can't find a scene like that in there, so probably not.

*** Really don't feel like going through Black Comedy again. But I suppose I should to see anyways.
