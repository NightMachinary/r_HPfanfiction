  ::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. (Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.)

** YMMV, but linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8215565/1/Knowledge-is-Useful-But-Power-is-Power]]) fits the bill pretty much to a tee. Plus, it's technically well-written.

Whether one would consider it /good/ writing or not, well, that's a bit more open to debate.

  Harry and Hermione are gifted a handwritten book at the beginning of Fourth Year. A book that reveals horrible truths about the world they live in. Prepare for a tougher Harry and a battle focused on the Ministry.

*** It's dystopian-themed, and it felt like the author went a bit too far with the 'sentient Magic' aspect , but other than that, it is definitely an interesting read.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
