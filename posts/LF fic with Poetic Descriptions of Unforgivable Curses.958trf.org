I read this Harry Potter fanfic a while back, with the following scene:

It's fourth year DADA class, with [fake] Mad-Eye Moody teaching; it's the class on the Unforgivable Curses. After the curses are all named, Moody demands that someone describe the Unforgivable curses using something other than textbook definitions---from personal experience, although he doesn't explicitly say so.

And descriptions for all three curses are given: the Imperio (wanting something so badly that every minute you don't have it feels like dying), the Cruciatus (really graphic description), and the Avada Kedavra (something strangely poetic).

If I remember right, Harry gave the descriptions for all three curses? And the entire class stared at him in horror, pfft.

Anyways, if anyone knows what story this is, please let me know! I've been trying to find it but I've been having no luck.


** Gather 'round children to hear of the Curses

That command us and hurt us and put us in hearses.

The average Death Eater thinks they're all good fun

But the Ministry says they're Unforgivable, each one

"Imperio!" will put someone in your power

To do your evil bidding hour after hour.

It's strongest against those who have a weak mind

For instance, a Hufflepuff (they work best, I find)

"Crucio!" is the Cruciatus Curse

If you're under this, it's really the worst

This curse causes the most extreme pain

(Bella loves to cast it again and again)

"Avada Kedavra!" will knock most people dead

Even if it only hits a finger or a head,

A nose or their toes, an arm or an ear,

A flash of acid green says this curse is near

The use of these Curses will put you into jail

With dementors and madness and no chance for bail

Unless used against Voldy and his friends

And hopefully bring the war to a quicker end

^{Or was that not what you meant?}

*** I am impressed.

(Have you published that? You could. You should.)

(But sadly no, not what I'm looking for, pfft. I'm looking for a specific fanfic, not a poem, though like I said yours is very good!)

** >>If I remember right, Harry gave the descriptions for all three curses? And the entire class stared at him in horror, pfft.

But, canon Harry doesn't know these curses at this point. So, what you're looking for, is mostly tagged under Dark!Harry , Indy!Harry, Grey!Harry or Harry travels back in time, kind of fics. Hope you can narrow it down with this.

*** Yeah, C'est la Vie (by cwyscross) is a really good fic, and one of my personal favorites! But no, it doesn't have this scene in it... not the fic I'm looking for. (Which makes sense, as C'est la Vie is a more lighthearted fic.)

At least I know I'm not alone in my searching, pfft.
