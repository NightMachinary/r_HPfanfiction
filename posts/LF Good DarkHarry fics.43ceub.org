Preferably complete, no slash. Thanks for the suggestions!


** Do you mean where Harry is good, but dark? or the story is good, but with a dark Harry?

linkffn(9057950) Good story, bad Harry.

linkffn(5353809) Good story, and Harry. Also Dark Prince is pretty good too, as linked by InquisitorCOC

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** Methods of Rationality by Less Wrong or Blindness by AngelaStarCat. Whilst not fully focussed on making Harry "dark". As "rational" fics, Harry constantly makes decisions that are considered dark by other "good" characters purely because its a logical or scientific decision to make.

Out of the two, Blindness is easier reading and the concept of blind Harry is also incredibly fascinating.
