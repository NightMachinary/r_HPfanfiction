** Twist? I don't think there's a twist lol. It's a story about how she grows and learns to accept who she is.

*** Yes, twist perhaps not the best wording. I meant specifically the meaning behind the tagline

#+begin_quote
  Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.
#+end_quote

Is there a particular exact reason? Or is it just that she finds she has Slytherin traits (in which case, duh.)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That would fit the second of my guesses, which is what I suspected and half the reason I dropped the fic.

** The twist is that the sisterhood behind The Parlour gets tantalising hints about being ancient remnants of witches subjugated by wand wielding men, then that plot point is quickly discarded as too ambitious I guess.

I liked it a lot though. It showed Ginny as being definitely Slytherin but still a child (while considering herself oh so grown up!). Incredibly difficult balance to pull off IMHO and this author did it well.

** It's more of a character study of Ginny. You read it for the characterisation not so much for the plot (which is just the canon plot from a different perspective).

*** personally these are my favorite types of fics, especially when they dive deep into a side character who didn't get as much page time as they should've. Truth is for most non-Harry characters, there probably is not enough plot stuff to carry a fic. So you need to make it about the character and how they react and internalize the events of the series. The Changeling succeeds so well in this because it puts Ginny is a role that better suits her to truly explore her depth. I love Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince, but there are times when I am reminded that while Harry is dealing with truly terrible and dangerous things, Ginny is mostly fretting about typical teenager drama. Which is ultimately how it should be, but it perhaps lowers the stakes too much in contrast to Harry's POV. The Changeling figures out a way to keep the stakes equally high for Ginny.

**** I was enjoying it for a while, but I think I was frustrated by that description tagline. It put me into the mindset that there was going to be an event taking place that only she could perform/solve due to her Slytherin sorting. As time went on I realized that it wasn't the fic I thought it to be.

**** I agree, it was very interesting and engaging. I particularly enjoyed how this fic explores Ginny's ruthlessness (which is hinted in the canon characterisation of Ginny) as an expression of loyalty and resistance.

I started reading hoping for some sort of OP!Slytherin!Ginny who ends up just curbstomping Voldemort (sometimes I just enjoy reading Mary Sue characters :P), and came out very pleasantly surprised.

Do you have any recommendations about fics like this that explore other characters beside the main three?

That was the impression I had going into it, and dropped it after realizing that was probably not going to be the case. Also, the super secret girls club she was sorta in stank too much of the tropes of yore, where these /kids/ have the political minds and machinations of adults with decades of experience.

****** Yeah, it kinda has that feeling but it is much milder, in my opinion. It isn't really focused in politics; in a sense, it is the opposite because the purpose of the group is precisely to protect those whose ambitions are not political. It kind of subverts this idea that ambition = politics.

**** Ginny comes from a family of Gryffindors, and everybody expected Ginny to be sorted into Gryffindor as well. Therefore, this fic discusses and explores those traits for which she was sorted into Slytherin, and how she comes to accept that side of her.
