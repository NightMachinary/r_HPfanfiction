I hate Draco Malfoy! But don't know why. I have read many stories for the past few years but I never liked him. maybe due to my selection of stories . I have read some stories where he is a major character and I still hate the Malfoy. I know it's not a thing but maybe I should read some more. Hate without a reason is just stupid. If any of you are in the same boat feel free to comment


** He's a bigoted, up his own ass little fuck without even the spine to actually stick by the convictions he lives by.

He plays baby death eater until it gets scary. He doesn't sell out Harry and co. at home, but absolutely tries to double back at Hogwarts and rejoin the Death Eaters, telling them he knows where Harry is.

The problem with Draco is that he's exactly like his family and Snape: a bigoted little coward. That the Malfoys survive the war long enough for another generation is a grievous insult to everyone that died to kill Voldemort.

*** I agree, its just like Harry naming is child after Snape is a grievous insult to his parents and their memories, lets just Name my child after one of the people responsible for my parents murder.

** I hate him because he's a piece of shit. Or well from Harry's POV which is the only one we get. At some point JK said she wanted to write a chapter from Draco's perspective (talking to Theodor Nott I think) to show how she imagined him in his day to day life. I'm not sure if that would have put in a better or worse light. From the short interaction that polyjuiced Harry and Ron have with him, he still seems like a piece of shit.

** I think that Draco malfoy screwed us out of a worthy slytherin house. When speaking of the house of the cunning and ambitious, it's most recognized member is a pitiful, cowardly, backstabbing kid. Malfoy thrives on his house by riding his father's name and contacts. His head of house is his own godfather, who follows his petty ways.

He only survives his own stupidity because hogwarts doesn't care about it's students and bullying is a concept that only muggles have.

He is the least slytherin to have ever slytherined. And basically the only one we get

*** To be fair, the godfather thing is fanon.

But yes, Draco is definitely /not/ a good representation of Slytherin. It's why I like fanfics where other characters step up, or Harry lets himself be sorted into Slytherin.

**** Wait. So When Narcissa got Snape to swear an unbreakable vow to help draco, why did she actually expect him to agree? I didn't remember that the godfather thing was just fanon, but I can see how it came to be...

*** Rowling didn't try to be fair to Slytherin, they were always the bad house to her. So she put the bad character who had the bad personality to do the bad plot things into the bad house. Slytherins valuing power and ambition is really saying that a good person should not value those things, rather than them being a worthwhile quarter of the population. Harry's crisis with the Sorting hat was to ensure that all the bad people were culpable for their actions. Harry was “tempted” by the hats offer of real friends but chose to do the good thing instead. A lot more Christian themes than Rowling would admit.

I myself disagree with that worldview in a lot of ways, part for how it is harmful and part for how it doesn't make the story fun. And I really like the fanon interpretations that give it all more depth.

**** To be fair, I would totally be suspicious of Slytherin if the books were real. All of the other houses' traits seem fine (curiosity, bravery, patience, etc.), but Slytherin's traits are literally ambition, ruthlessness, and self preservation. I would not trust any eleven year old who valued those traits above the rest.

** I don't hate Draco for spouting the crap he'd been raised with. You don't hate someone because their family is jewish or christian or muslim - it's what they were raised in and they don't know anything else. No, I don't hate Draco for being an elitist snob.

I hate Draco for being a spineless braggart.

It takes a special kind of cowardice to be fine with hexing someone in the back, and then run crying to mummy and daddy when it doesn't go exactly the way you want. To whinge and moan and make a mountain out of a molehill to garner attention and sympathy, and then think when people do finally pay attention that it's your due because you're superior, instead of because you just blubbed pathetically.

He's written as the worst, most disgusting of archetypes. He does grow some over the course of the books, but he never really grows UP. He's always the spineless blubbering idiot who brings his own punishment down on himself and blames it on everyone and everything else.

That's why I hate Draco. Reminds me of kids I used to know.

** Draco is a child in the books. Hating Draco is a bit like hating some kid from high school when you're 35. I mean.. you can keep hating them but why bother.

Draco grows up to be one of the most well-adjusted adults in Cursed Child. He loves his son, wants to make things better for his son, wants to protect his son's friendship with Harry Potter's son etc. Cursed Child talks about how lonely he is, his wife dying of the curse, everyone believing he is evil etc. So he does get punished if that makes it any better for you.

*** I mean, this is the same kid from school who consitantly tried to get you into trouble and lead bullying campaigns the entire time, openly wished a good number of his fellow students dead (book 2), got an intelligent animal (nearly) executed out of spite (book 3), helped teachers torture students (book 5 and probably 7) and made several attempts on the life of the headmaster, nearly killing two of your friends in the process before letting a group of serial killers into a school (book 6, possibly extenuating circumstances).

You keep hating them because otherwise you are giving this shit a free pass.

**** You can also just move on with life. I mean JK made the choice to make him a decent person in Cursed Child.

It's kinda nice because there isn't much growth in Harry Potter, half the characters didn't get a chance to grow into better people but Draco did.

*** That's what growing up is all about. I'm still not much of a fan, but Draco displays a level of maturity that his father never achieved. I support he inherited his levelheadedness from his mum.
