I have a story I am starting about an AU confident/sarcastic/hard working/ easy going (not lazy, but doesn't let things bother him too much)/ smart (not a brilliant genius, but more like has a quirky fascination with magic) Harry who has an insanely loyal best friend who joins in both the crazy adventures and teenage drama. Trying to basically decide if the fic would be better with Neville or Ron . What would you prefer reading and why? (These are just two characters I narrowed down. Please feel free to leave another character and why you'd choose them. I welcome all input) Thanks!


** Depends on if you intend to write Harry in-character or not. If you are, Ron definitely. Nothing against Neville, who'd be a great friend, but I don't see them matching so well that they would become best friends.

** Neville is cool but not the best companion early on. Go for Ron. If you don't want Ron, go for Dean, or Seamus...

** Ron. Neville's just too nervy early on.

** I usually choose Neville mainly because I can relate to him about twenty times better than Ron

** I would love to read Seamus as the best friend tbh. He is an interesting character in the first book. Blasting feathers and goblets with his spellwork. And he is Irish to boot.

** Ron but maybe Dean to switch it up a bit? I mean Dean was an amazing friend in the first book.

** As far as adventures and shenanigans go, Ron would certainly be a better fit that Neville, especially when they are younger. I mean in Canon Ron stole his dad's car twice, when he was twelve years old, where as I don't think Neville would ever dream of doing something like that until he is much older.

** Why does it have to be Ron or Neville? There are plenty of other male characters in other houses. To answer the question though, I would say Neville simply because I loathe Ron. I love to murder Ron in creative ways.
