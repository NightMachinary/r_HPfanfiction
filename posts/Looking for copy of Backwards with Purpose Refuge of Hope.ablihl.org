Just tore through /Always and Always/, as well as /The Book of Albus/. The tvtropes page says there's a third book, /Refuge of Hope/. However, it's not available on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], and I think, after some more searching, I found a reddit post that says that the author deleted some of her stories. Would anybody be willing to link me a download of the third story? Thanks a billion.


** It's been combined into one book. Just look at the later chapters.

*** Ah, so the outtakes from Always and Always and the final few chapters of Book of Albus are what the third book would have been?

**** Yeah it's sandwiches between the book itself and the outtakes. If 1 and 2 are still separate it's at the end of 2

****** [[/u/deadwoodpecker][u/deadwoodpecker]]

For my money the best time travel story out there because of the depth and twists forced upon the characters. The phrase “there's no such thing as a free lunch” fully applies to this story.

** That's such a great story. I'm sorry you'll never be able to re-read it for the first time, again.

*** Thanks for the confirmation and taking the time to read this post! I really enjoyed reading these two stories of yours; the plot is super coherent (and still mind-bendy), and the characters' struggles really feel weighty.
