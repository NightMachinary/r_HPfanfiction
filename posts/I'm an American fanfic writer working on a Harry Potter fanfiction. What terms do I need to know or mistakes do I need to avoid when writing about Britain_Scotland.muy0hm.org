** Pancakes. We don't eat pancakes for breakfast unless we are in an American themed restaurant. Ditto waffles. Our waffles are potato waffles and they come out of the freezer and go in the oven to be had with fish fingers and beans. Wizards probably dont have them, they're a Muggle convenience food. Our pancakes are more like the French crêpe, and we eat them as a dessert option (and sometimes just as an evening meal on Shrove Tuesday) usually with lemon and sugar. We can get maple syrup now but it was really uncommon in the 90s.

Not all rich people are posh, not all posh people are rich, and even the wealthiest aren't usually hereditary aristocracy. The Weasleys are more likely to be titled than the Malfoys tbh- flashing the cash and the influence is considered gauche.

We don't wear "khakis." What you guys call khakis, we call chinos. Most people wouldn't put a young child in them- they're for posh people, social climbers and people who live in the Home Counties. We wear jeans, and kids seem to wear a lot of cords (for reasons I cannot fathom a huge amount of children's clothing is couduroy).

"Pudding" generically means dessert. What you guys call pudding we'd call a mousse- it's not quite the same but we (sadly) don't really have what you call pudding. A pudding here can also be a specific type of dessert, a sort of steamed cake with syrup or fruit. Goes with custard.

Mexican food wasn't a thing here at the time the books were set and tbh, having eaten it in San Diego, what we have even now is pants.

Speaking of pants- unless one is from specific parts of Manchester and Lancashire, "pants" are underwear. Trousers are trousers, and pants go under them. Women don't call our pants "panties" because we are grownups- the term in most of the UK is "knickers." "Pants" can also, as I previously demonstrated, mean "rubbish," as in "the Chudley Cannons were pants, not that Ron would ever admit it."

We don't have air conditioning- we don't need it. Our weather isn't extreme. It rarely snows in most of the UK and when it does it doesn't settle. Our climate is mildly cold and very wet. It rains in the winter so the snow doesn't settle. It rains in the summer. Spring? Yeah we invented April showers. Autumn (not Fall, ever), yep still raining. The terms most applied to British weather are "chilly" and "damp." One bit of sunshine and everyone is outside, we never know how long it will last.

No one calls anyone an "old coot." Dumbledore is more likely to be referred to as "that daft old bugger."

On which note- insulting someone is a sign of friendship. The ruder we are to each other, the more we like each other. If a British person is being icily polite to you, they absolutely hate you. If they're calling you a "daft c*nt," you're their best mate. If a Scotsman ever calls you "pal," run. Run like the wind. You're about to be punched.

Only regulars in a pub sit at the bar. Everyone else sits at tables. Bottles of beer are for BBQs and watching the football at home- in a pub if you're having beer you're having a pint. We drink all the time. Sunday lunch? Glass of wine. Saturday night? Glass of wine. After work? W I N E. Four pints is a light after work drink. We have 16 year olds that could drink grown American adults under the table.

Scottish people /do not, ever ever ever/ say "och aye the noo." Och aye is fine, the noo is fine, but I have no idea why they get put together as some sort of Scots saying. "Och aye" means "oh yes" and "the noo" means "the now", ie "right now"/"at once." No one would say "oh yes right now" as some sort of random saying. So have McGonagall say "och aye, they're silly buggers alright those Weasley twins," or have her say "I'm coming the noo, can't have any other bairns [Scots for children] getting hurt." Don't overdo the Scottish words- my dad's Scottish and him and his sisters speak in regular words that all English speakers would understand for the most part.

And, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD NO ONE HAS CREAM IN TEA. We have milk in tea, or lemon juice in some types such as Earl Grey. Cream in coffee was fashionable in the 90s for some reason but no. Milk. I think where you guys have got confused is with the term "cream tea"- that's a fancy meal of little sandwiches, tiny cakes and the key element- scones that come with jam and /cream./ It's served with a pot of tea, hence the term "cream tea" but no one in their right mind would actually put cream in tea. We also don't really have it iced. It's served hot, with milk. Also, at the time of the books, no one would have had a coffee machine. Coffee was instant, and served after dinner. Tea is drunk throughout the day.

There's also a huge class element to how tea is served. Working men have it in big mugs, brewed really strong with lots of sugar, which is measured in teaspoonfuls. You put the teabag in the mug, pour on boiling water, let it stand until it's the colour of treacle and then add milk and sugar. Upper class ladies "having tea" together have loose tea from a teapot, brewed for anywhere between 3-5 minutes and poured into dainty cups through a tea strainer. The milk goes in first if you're using a china cup (out of necessity- they crack with heat and the cool milk mitigates the boiling hot tea) but every other time it goes in last. They may have sugar and if so it is in sugar lumps, served with silver tongs. More than two is considered common. Middle class people don't tend to take sugar, will generally use the mug method (but not brewed so strongly) but will have a teapot for special occasions or fancy company- and they'll just put the teabags in the teapot (one per head plus one for the pot). Water is boiled in a kettle, then poured into the pot whether you're using loose or bagged tea. You don't boil tea, you boil water then add it to the dried tea.

I think that's enough for now, I've probably overwhelmed you! Give me a shout if you want your thing properly Britpicked though. I enjoy doing them!

*** If I could upvote this another 50 times I would. I very much appreciate the time and effort putting into describing the social intricacies of tea - if I I have to read one more fic where someone serves their English breakfast tea with LEMON and NO MILK I will be absolutely apoplectic. I may even go as far as to purse my lips and tut in disapproval.

I would add to this that we only have finals at university, which doesn't seem to exist in HP-verse. We have end-of-year exams. OWLs and NEWTs are also externally set exams so no extra credit or anything like that.

***** Yessssss this is a pet peeve of mine!!

One that I've started noticing as my level of pedantry skyrockets is "grade." We only use grade in the context of the letter achieved in an exam (e.g Harry achieved a grade O in his DADA OWL). We would say that a teacher marks a paper and a student in a year of school (e.g. fifth year); we wouldn't use "grade" for either of those.

**** Yep, some more education stuff: OWLS are the equivalent to GCSEs and NEWTS are the equivalent to A-levels. There is an external exam board marking and regulating them, which is partly to standardise exams across all schools and partly so teacher bias won't make a difference, so that could be something to suggest that there's more than one English magic school (or at the very least some home schoolers).

Also, end of year grades don't matter. Like, at all. In normal schools teachers would decide who goes into which ‘set' based on them but as there's an appalling lack of teachers and no OFSTED (school inspection board) it seems Hogwarts does not have sets, so if you suck at a subject then that's just too bad. If you're advanced then that's also too bad. Also, extra credit is not a thing, it does not exist. That's because homework does not go towards your end of year exam result. Asking for extra homework is mental and something no British student would consider, ever, and also something no teacher wants to give as it means extra marking for them.

Boarding schools tend to have ‘study hall' which is a time after lessons (an hour or so) where students have to spend the time studying. It seems Hogwarts does not do that but if anyone wants to include it in a fic that would be cool.

I also think it's very unrealistic that there was no unofficial smoking spot at Hogwarts. In any other British school there'd be a place where teachers wouldn't check- or if they do it's really easy to see them coming- generally behind the bike sheds or behind the sports hall, that the chav kids smoke at. I choose to believe that there was and Harry was too oblivious to notice.

Also appreciate the acknowledgement that cream in coffee was a 90s fad. The farther away from the 90s we get the more I think we lose some of the details that help immersion. Sometimes I see today's pop music referenced in series-years fics and just... Sigh. The actual music of the 90s can take me back in ways that other details can't, and seeing newer pop hits in a story set in 1998 is very jarring to me.

Ok now I feel /old/. Don't mind me as I fire up 90s playlists on Spotify ;)

Everyone was obsessed with doctor who and referenced it constantly (we don't do that); everyone was a royalist (we aren't); the prime minister had extreme powers (no, just no); the weather was always wrong, or described with the wrong words (we have 50 words for rain, a drizzle isn't rain!); Snow, like they seem to think all of the UK is plunged into snow for 3 months?

** Pretty much everyone has covered words at this point, so I figured I'd try hit the cultural end of things. There are a few things that tend to out writers as American.

Religion - Not a lot of Hellfire and Brimstone Baptists in the UK. Our closest equivalent is Catholicism (which tends to be more "You're all sinners, pray for redemption!") and our other main faiths are Church of England and Protestantism (which are both a tad more 'chill' than Catholicism). Even when we were more Religious (which we would've been, back in the 70s, 80s, and early 90s), it was still more of a 'High Holidays only' sort of faith - attend on Easter and Christmas, that sort of thing.

Money - (Most) nobody praises the almighty dollar (or pound) or big business or likes de-regulation here. I don't think I've ever actually had or overheard a conversation about taxation. Any fic that features venture capitalism or talks about turning everything into a business ("I'm going to buy St Mungos and run it like a business!") or the like will out you as an American near-immediately. We also don't really have 'small family banks' like America seems to - we pretty much have several big banks (Barclays, HSBC, RBS, etc) and that's about it.

Guns - Incessant comparisons of wands to guns, and remarks on how 'Colt made everyone equal' or how great it is that everyone is armed ABSOLUTELY come off as a big indicator of an American. Most people in Britain have never actually seen a gun and honestly couldn't care less about the things.

Mockery and Sarcasm - Generally, we're a lot less reverent about things here. If it exists, it's fair game to take the piss out of it. That includes parents, authority, religion, money, guns, and absolutely everything else. There's very little that's sacrosanct here, including ourselves.

Institutional Irony - This is the best way to sound culturally British. Everything here is pomp and circumstance, done ironically. We're not a sincere society. If you want people to stand for the national anthem, make them sigh and roll their eyes at the injustice of having to stand up. That kind of thing.

IDK, I feel like Vernon's social circle would be full of these ideas, definitely people who would want deregulation so they could make their drills or whatever else his mates sell for cheaper and sell them for more profit. A big part of the Leave campaign was based around deregulation and they won so it must have some resonance with the public, plus all of Harry's life up to but not including DH would have been under Thatcher or Major and deregulation was a huge part of Thatcherism. Uncle Vernon is definitely a pro business Tory!

I've heard a ton of people discuss tax, but I work in politics so maybe that's skewed my sample of people and what they find interesting!

I feel like there's definitely people out there in Britain who would /want/ to buy hospitals and run them as business but thankfully our system stops that kind of privatisation of existing state assets. It's important to note that private hospitals do exist, as do "private banks" which only work with high value individuals and in all honesty Gringotts even in canon feels more like Coutts than TSB, but given the entire wizarding world banks there we have to assume it's a regular high street type bank.

  Guns - Incessant comparisons of wands to guns, and remarks on how 'Colt made everyone equal' or how great it is that everyone is armed ABSOLUTELY come off as a big indicator of an American. Most people in Britain have never actually seen a gun and honestly couldn't care less about the things.
#+end_quote

Agree with most of this, no one would say Colt made us equal and the majority of Brits wouldn't have a clue what that means and we just don't love guns the way America does. But the comparison of wands to guns is canon, the Prophet does it in PoA. Most people in Britain don't have a gun, that's true, but we all know what they are and what they do so it's a legitimate comparison- a wand in the wrong hands is as much a deadly weapon as a gun. Plus don't forget that handguns were only banned in the UK in 1996 so for the majority of the canon timeline guns were more commonplace than they are now- Vernon has one in the first book and that would have been perfectly legal in 1991.

Singapore on Thames. Damn, I haven't heard about that in a few years. If memory serves, even the guy who proposed that saw it as a secondary option to take up as a back-up plan for a way to shore up a weakened economy should Brexit have turned out badly. And just because our politicians have suggested it as a possibility, doesn't mean people have requested it. Recent polls have shown a significant majority of YPs polled (Leave Voting YPs, specifically) would prefer more regulation, not less. Even London CEOs apparently have warned against over-deregulation according to the Financial Times.

Also, we can absolutely ignore that some British once came up with some ideas. We were a massive hub for philosophy during the enlightenment - they came up with a tonne of ideas we don't really care about on a larger scale (eg. we're the original home of the Puritans and nobody would consider us Puritanical anymore). I'm talking culture, not philosophy or ideology. For something to become a part of culture, it has to be popular with the majority of people in a society or group. An idea being proposed does not an idea accepted make. If random people on the street and in coffeeshops were talking favourably of de-regulation - if soap operas and stand-up comedians started to make jokes about it and knew that everyone would get those jokes - that's how you know something has become part of the Country's culture. Even descriptions in favour of Singapore on Thames only say it's popular with votes of more Libertarian leanings - if it were a thing, that would make it 'Libertarian Culture', not 'UK Culture'.

Minor thing I noticed: swear words get used different amounts here, so "fuck" is used for much more severe things and the more common ones are "bloody", "bastard" or sometimes "shit". Like if you stub your toe you use one of the latter and you generaly only use "fuck" while incredibly angry.

Rumours of that sure, but didn't happen. We also don't 'graduate' until the end of uni.

I've read some where people are amazed that there are no dances usually, it's just the Yule Ball. That is normal. You might have the occasional disco (very naff) for years 7s and 8s, but a ball or prom for people finishing exams is a new concept and I think probably not in many British schools at all in the 90s. I associate balls with universities.

What muggleborn british kids might expect : way more sports teams (football, tag rugby, rounders, cricket, athletics, netball, gymnastics even rowing given its a posh school). Sports day. An orchestra (not 'band', I still haven't grasped what this is). Choir. French club. Chess club. ^ obviously some of these do exist, it's sport especially that's missing.

It partly functions to keep the school functioning too? I mean where else would all the food come from?

For example yeah Edinburgh is the current capital of Scotland but Dundee is Scotland oldest city. Even Dunfermline (now considered a town) used to be the capital of Scotland in centuries past.

St Andrew's is steeped in history and I've been to Falkland Hill and the Town and could totally believe there couldve been magic there in ages past. I mean everyone knows theres Haggis to be found up there. Ben Nevis too.

I mean this nothing against the English, just the more fanfiction I read and more plot holes you discover the more you realise how much her world building is.... lacking.

Which is a shame because if she did proper research, world building and the rest of it I have no doubt the world of Harry Potter could've been that on par with say Lord of the Rings.

It could've been rich with it's own history and cultures and languages. I mean Tolkien might not have liked the fact that's what he was likely to be remembered by but he didn't half ass it and you can't say he wasn't dedicated

Harry potter could've been so much More. And I'll admit she did try I guess (side publishing like Quidditch Through the Ages, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them [the textbook] and Tales of Beedle the Bard) but then you look at fantastic beasts the movies and it just feels.... half arsed.

Urgh totally. I did a double take when I found out she was Scottish because the books just feel so incredibly English. And Southern English at that. The films as well- the Hogsmede people, Rosemerta especially as we hear the most from her, should have Scots accents.

I also feel like there's this idea pushed through the books that it's good and noble to refuse financial help- like how the Weasleys never get any assistance and Molly is painted as the sort of person that just wouldn't take state benefits because it's "charity." And you'd think for someone who's lived on the breadline JKR would know there's nothing noble nor moral about struggling when help is available- but like you say, it's a middle class attitude and the book is full of them.

Yeah, that's gravy anywhere outside of the southern US: sausage gravy horrified me the first time I saw it too (I'm Canadian).

The biscuits sold with the revolting white gravy are... basically a croissant with a more bread-like consistency. Still flakey, still buttery.... but more bread. I guess? They shouldn't be dry, but the bad ones often are.

Re: milk in gravy - /If/ you're being a cheapskate and/or don't have sufficient drippings to make gravy the correct way, a bit of milk can help mellow the flavour from bullion if you happen to fuck up the measurements, same as adding butter.

Homemade breakfast biscuits and gravy is one of my faves, so maybe I can explain the creamy gravy.

The gravy is made from pan leavings of ground sausage, which is less "juices" and more oil. So I add flour to brown in the oil and use equal parts beef broth and cream for the liquid. Almost like a bechamel. Season to taste and throw half the sausage back in so all the flavors meld. Save the other half to top the dish or use in another dish later like maybe pizza topping.

When we make gravy for a roast, that's usually cooking down the juices and using something like a cornstarch slurry for a thickener if needed.

*** Biscuits are basically softer, buttery, and flakey scones. The gravy used in biscuits and gravy is made up of sausage, pan drippings, milk, and flour, all of which was more or less affordable. Biscuits and gravy was a meal for the poor working class that was often made out of the fat from when you cooked sausage along with the other stuff, which was all somewhat affordable. It's become a staple food in the US.

** It's not directly related to what people call 'britpicking,' but on a somewhat similar note, there are guides for how to write the various accents and speaking mannerisms seen in Harry Potter. There used to be several automatic translators, but the Fleur and Krum ones are defunct. The 'Hagridizer' can still be searched for and found, but it does a passable job at best.

If you want the rules for how to write that way, [[https://manu86.livejournal.com/25048.html][this link will explain them]]. Most of it is just straightforward replacements, like the Bulgarian/Krum rule of W=V, i.e. /"Ve are looking for vater,"/ or how the French don't understand the letter H and all THs become Zs /"Dear 'Arry, zis is 'ardly ze way to treat a woman trying to 'elp you, non?"/

To be brutally honest, if you just remember that Ginny, the twins, and Ron don't want to get on the bad side of their "mum," then nobody will likely notice anything. You only need to remember a couple of common word usages, and that's all it takes.

****** Even thought they used the Anglo-American system in the middle ages, I'm sure there will be adaption and evolution in the Wizarding world as much as in the Muggle world. Only makes sense. And I think we have lots of indications for that. For example the plumbing system in Hogwarts. Up until 1840, indoor plumbing systems only existed in rich people's homes. Or the modern kerosine oil lamp, invented 1853. Or even the chimneys in the castle. domestic chimneys first appeared in large dwellings in northern Europe in the 12th century. But Hogwarts was founded around a thousand years ago. So we can surely assume that things changed in the Wizarding world also. In my opinion the metric system is canon for a fanfic in most cases (except those who are written from founders time perspective), as the metric system is the state of art in great Britain and Europe for quite some time now.

** British secondary schooling begins at 11. You leave age 18 or just before your 18th. The school year usually begins at the start of September (my school begins September 3rd, but hogwarts begins September 1st.) we have breaks at the end of half terms called, as said before, half term. Our first one is a week in October, although Hogwarts doesn't seem to have October half term. We break for Christmas around December 18th-december 21st, and come back to school around January 4th-January 7th. There is another half term in February consisting of 2 weeks, although hogwarts seemingly doesn't have that, or at least its not written in the books. Then another two weeks around Easter, a week off in May and then usually break for summer around the middle of July. You may want to write the summer holidays longer for hogwarts, as they seemingly do not have all the half terms.

We have days off according to certain bank holidays. For instance, I have today off. You may want to look up British Bank Holidays.

We do not put cream into tea. It's milk (we have types of milk too! Green cap is semi skinned, red cap is skinned and blue cap is full fat. Dunno if that matters to you lol) milk and sugar or perhaps no milk but instead lemon and sugar or lemon in ho ey in certain Earl greys. Tea is very important to British culture. Younger kids don't generally drink coffee. I hate coffee, but my siblings only really started drinking it at 14.

School days are usually made of five periods, six if you have an after school booster/study session or club. Periods consist of one hours lessons. For instance, my 6th form education (exams equivalent to hogwarts newts, which you start age 16/17 and finish age 17/18) we have a tutor period from half 8 to 9, lessons begin at 9. First period ends at 10, then there's a five minute movement bell to get to your next class, which begins at 10:05. 2nd period ends at 11:05, then a 20 minute break. Third period ends at 12:25, then an hour lunch, then fourth and fifth period until the day ends at 3:30. I have clubs or study period after school sometimes.

We call 'pants' trousers.

When we ask to got to the bathroom, we generally say "Can I go to the toilets?" or "miss can I go to the loo?" (and then turn to our friends saying I'm just going to pop to the loos, be back in a min or so)

We usually say mum. Some accents/dialects say mom, such as Birmingham. Some may say mam or ma. mother if you're from a posh or well spoken area.

'hot cocoa' is called hot chocolate.

Detentions usually occur at lunch or after school. It's not really a thing to have Saturday detentions unless you've not attended the detentions set in the week and or truanced.

Skipping lesson is what we call bunking. Teachers will call it truancy lol

British food!! Here's a list of food my family typically eat for dinner (please look them up so you know what they are) : Shephards pie, roast dinner, cottage pie, sausage and mash, spaghetti bolagnese, vegetable pasta, fajitas, casserole, stew, fish and chips etc etc

What you call 'pudding' is what we would call mousse. 'pudding' for us refers to things like treacle tart, sticky toffe pudding, jam roly poly etc. We love Victoria sponge cake. Absolute British delicacy. So are custard cream slices.

There's a bit of competition, I would say, between the North and south lol.

We hate our prime ministers most of the time. Would be nice to see that mockery within wizarding culture. We call Boris Johnson BoJo, dickhead, twat etc etc

List of British insults: Dick, dickhead, twat, twatface, piece of shit, little shit, bitch, slag, slapper, prozzie, cunt, cuntface etc etc

Honestly, one of the things I find weird in Harry potter is the constant use of last names. Maybe it's because the wizarding world is more formal, but our teachers all call us our first names. One of my favourite teachers used to call me Rossi, because my last name is Ross, but it was like an affectionate thing. Friend sobvs call each other by first names. Hell, even the people I despised with all my being I called them by their first names.

All in all, just please check the spelling of words and use the British versions. :)

** There are definitely wrong things to write, but getting the right tone and vocabulary for all characters can be very difficult even for British people (especially now, at a 30 year distance from the 90s). Just like there are a ton of different accents across the UK, there are also a ton of different ways of speaking and sets of slang/vocab. Based on location, class, age, ethnicity... A lot of the advice I see on here and elsewhere says "use this term" or "this is what British people say", when in fact it doesn't all apply to everyone, and using some things for the wrong character will sound potentially worse than using an Americanism

*** Sweater refers to a style of jumper, so we still use "sweater". A knitted jumper (a la Weasley) isn't a sweater though.

Pants isn't used like "fuck", it's used like shit, more often as "that thing is pants"

Pants never means trousers, but it does refer to men's "Y-fronts" (knickers, boxers, or undies for other terms). It's not generic.

Chips are different to fries; we also have fries, but fries are skinny and thin, chips are thicker cut. Most people have chips except at fast food places.

Pudding is just dessert. What Americans call pudding we don't have in the UK. We also have a dessert cooking style called "pudding" (e.g. Christmas pudding or spotted dick) which is where a kind of cake that was traditionally steamed in a ball.

Bloke usually refers to a white-van-man type man, it's not generic. Not all men are blokes.

Bint isn't used a lot, and always refers to women but can vary in intensity from "old" to "slag" to "cunt" depending on context.

Pikey is a slur referring to travellers. Don't use it.

**** Yeah like we have "a night in the cells" which is usually where the drunk and unruly spend the night to sober up at the police station.

Prison is what you get after sentencing.

***** Pre sentenced prisoners in the UK are, if not bailed, still in prison but it's called being "on remand" and they're held in a different wing to sentenced prisoners.

Also on this, in the UK you cannot pay someone's bail. It's at the discretion of the court, if they say you're bailed you're free to go until your sentencing (often with conditions). If they say no, no amount of money will change their mind.

** 2 things that apply to basically all of Western Europe from what i know at least.

1 Weapons aka Handguns are not common or easily available in Europe and in the Uk most police officers don't carry handguns

2 Whist the Anime craze went through Europe it was not so prevalent as in the Us (at least where I'm from) therefore the false notion that the Katana was indestructible super swords that can cut through everything never was established if you want to give your character a sword use a European one. (Generally Anime and Harry Potter don't mix to well)

*** Statistically speaking a very small number of students at a school level get taught really anything about this - or they didn't a decade ago, I accept this may have changed. When I was at school it wasn't on the history curriculum until GCSE level and History was an optional subject AND you only got taught it if your school happened to choose that pathway - my school didn't I learned about Germany between the first and Second World War (significantly more interesting IMO).

So as [[/u/HeckingDramatic][u/HeckingDramatic]] said over here literally no one cares about the revolutionary war 😂
