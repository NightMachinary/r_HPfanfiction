I feel like pretty much every fic I've read have been has been from FFn and Ao3 (and Adult Fanfiction, I suppose). So, to broaden my horizons I would like to read some fics that are aren't from either of those sites.

I would prefer non-slash but I am willing to give anything a go if it is good.

#+begin_quote
  Heh, my fic probably isn't a good example. It was removed from their archives a while back.

  Recs:

  [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305303][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]] by [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=209695][Cambangst]]: Novel, Action/mystery, complete. Summary:

  /Many years after the Battle of Hogwarts, follow Harry, Ron and Hermione as they lead four generations of the Potter and Weasley family in an action-packed battle for survival against a shadowy puppet master who threatens to destroy the world that they worked so hard to build./

  I'd also suggest [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=328470][Like a Rat in a Maze]] by the author. One-shot, Horror/Mystery. Summary:

  /Peter Pettigrew finds himself in Severus Snape's house on Spinner's End. How he got there is a mystery. Whether he'll survive remains to be seen.../

  And [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=320809][Slytherin Career Day]]: Humor, One-shot. Summary:

  /The student of Slytherin House were born with everything: wealth, prestige and pure wizarding blood. Now it's Severus Snape's job to help them find the one thing they don't have: careers./

  [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=311891][Behind the Curtain]] (Cold War intrigue, features: Moody, Dumbledore, Tom Riddle) and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305274][Their Finest Hour]] (Dumbledore embarks on a quest to defeat Grindelwald.) by [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=212887][Cassius Alcinder]] were pretty good if I recall correctly.

  [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613][Ignite]] by [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=144658][Slide]]: Next-Gen, Romance, Action/Adventure, part of a Trilogy. Summary:

  /A mysterious illness leaving a handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot./

** [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128050][Bonds of Blood and Magic by Duelist]] is one of my favourite fanfics out there. It's H/G, post HBP. Harry was kidnapped in the summer after HBP, someone comes out of the shadows and helps him and Ginny hide from Voldemort. It is inclomplete (I don't know if the author is ever going to update it or not), but a real good read.

** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]]

*Description:* What if it had been Hermione's name that the Goblet of Fire spat out? A complex spell cast one summer with the most innocent of intentions results in the Brightest Witch of her Age being entered into the Triwizard Tournament. How can she get out of this?

*Published:* 07/10/07 *Updated:* 31/10/12 *Status:* Completed *Genre:* Action/Adventure Words: 287927

[[/u/tusing]] and [[/u/moon_potato]] it would be great if your next version of the bot could support sites like portkey. Thanks for all that you do!

*** Portkey is particularly annoying with this because they've decided to separate story metadata from the story page, putting it on the author page instead.

The bot is rather stable in terms of sites. If I ever add sites, however, it will probably be by adapting and integrating FanFicFare or something similar into the bot. I'm actually looking at doing that, but I don't have time to do it right now. More of a long-term goal.

** If you don't mind Lily/Severus, [[http://ls269.deviantart.com/][Sympathetic Magic by ls269]] is compelling (link goes to her deviantART profile, which has the chapter listing).

Unfortunately it has no summary, but it's full of interesting magic and an amazing plot apart from the romance (Lily is a Healer) - I'm probably bad at selling it, but give it a try.

Edit: I have no actual idea why this is being downvoted. o.o
