Fed up with the machinations of the flawed nature of the wizarding world and its inhabitants, Indy!Harry decides to form his own settlement/country for himself and his likeminded friends and companions to reside in..

Unfortunately, no amount of expansion charms, fidelius charms, isolated island chains owned by the Potters, house elves, and oppressed muggleborn shopkeepers selling bottomless trunks with the powers of a god can make Indy!Harry an effective leader.


** Andrew Ryan's whole vibe definitely fits Indy!Harry. "A Man Chooses, A Slave Obeys" is exactly the kind of melodramatic Randian (or Randy-an, depending on which flavour of Indy!Harry this is :D) philosophy Indy!Harries would espouse. :D

** Some outfit called The Toast did some crack snippets of if Ayn Rand wrote Harry Potter. I think it's hilarious, and I am a libertarian-ish, so I imagine it's fun for anyone.

[[https://the-toast.net/2014/05/27/ayn-rands-harry-potter-sorcerers-stone/][Here's the link]] To the first one. If you like it you can use google to find the rest. I'm on mobile and I don't feel like copying 7 links.
