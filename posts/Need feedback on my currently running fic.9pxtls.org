** Well, from the first chapter alone it seems a little odd that a thirteen-year-old kid worries about government corruption or makes elaborate fiscal plans. A single corrupt employee he had business with maybe, but the whole thing?

18 is not the magical majority, 17 is.

The conclusion that a prophecy is involved seems far-fetched, especially since he had just recently picked up divination and Trelawney appears to be a fraud.

Hermione "I made up revision plans six months in advance" Granger is not really "living in the present". Also, you don't have to mention her gender ("female friend") all the time. She isn't Tonks, she can't grow a cock out of nowhere.

Why would McGonagall do wand checks? Isn't that Law Enforcement business? And "wand record" seems a little odd since it only shows the last spell, not a call protocol or a time when cast.

** Honestly, if you've picked up that many followers in five chapters I doubt you have anything to worry about. I think I managed about fifteen follows in seven chapters, so you must be better than me.
