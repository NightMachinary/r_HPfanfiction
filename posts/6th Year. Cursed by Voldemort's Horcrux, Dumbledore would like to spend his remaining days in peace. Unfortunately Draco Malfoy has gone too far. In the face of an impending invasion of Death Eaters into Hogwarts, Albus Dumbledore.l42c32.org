** That... would be a very entertaining, but also very short fic.

The thing about Dumbledore is that he's been around for a long time. His methods, his way of doing things are very well known. While I'm sure there are some conspiracy theorists wearing stylish tinfoil hats and warding against all the means of entry and all types of magic that Dumbledore - and anyone else who put in the work - /could/ use, most only protect themselves against what he /does/ use.

That means, the moment he decided to do away with his limiters and utilize all his skill, experience and wide spell repertoire to remove the group of people who overstayed their welcome amongst the living... They would not last a single evening. All it would take is an unbreakable bottle, a bit of fiendfyre, and either Fawkes the Phoenix or a house elf, or even an owl. A duplication charm, and Dumbledore is all ready to express his displeasure. Since he's still active politically and all for talking ususally, the targets expect words... They are given flame.

For the few harder targets, Fawkes can still make deliveries... And Dumbledore would be more than capable of tearing down most wards*. After all, even in his advanced age, he is still the one Voldemort fears, for good reason. And if Riddle could break the wards of Hogwarts, what would stop Dumbledore from just walking into a lowly Death Eater's house?

Work of one evening. Followed by a visit to the Ministry to dictate some law changes and appointments to the - much diminished and throughly cowed- Wizengmot.

*** Didn't the whole using Fawkes to teleport thing happen in the one where a paranoid Harry runs away to the US and uses the fidelius to hide his identity. There, Dumbledore used Fawkes to teleport death eaters and paralyse them with the basilisk, if I'm not wrong. I forgot the name of the fic tho. It's pretty decent, but kinda cliche.

*** Dumbledore is more or less on his last breath and Voldemort can take him in a fair fight... But Voldemort doesn't deserve fairness.All Deatheaters get ruthlessly picked off and Voldemort gets Legilimensed for the location of his Horcruxes before slaughter.

Dumbledore doesn't have time to seek out the Horcruxes, but after Voldemort and his powerbase are gone, Harry's Horcrux Hunt will effectively become a picnic trip.

Since Harry probably won't get the chance to get AK-ed by Voldemort in the future, Dumbledore can only have Harry improve his Occlumency technique. He uses what little of soul magic he knows to completely destroy the memories of the Scarcrux. After that, just to be safe, he secretly applies a impotency curse on Harry so that he won't have kids and the malevolent spirit in the Horcrux won't have a chance of getting passed on.

After that, Dumbledore and Harry have a conversation. After Dumbledore tells Harry of the Horcruxes location, they converse about the nature of Dark and Light magic. Dumbledore talks about how he has been cursed, how he really didn't want to fight and just die a quiet death, how he had planned for things to take place after his death... Dumbledore admits that he was turning a blind eye to Draco's mad assassination attempts but he couldn't close his eyes to Hogwarts' imminent invasion. Dumbledore says that he really wanted to die with the reputation of being unstained by the sin of killing but now he will die as a evil worse than the Dark Lord who destroyed most of Wizarding Britain's aristocracy. Dumbledore asks Harry for forgiveness (while Harry insists Dumbledore never did anything that requires forgiveness) before passing on.

After Dumbledore is gone, Harry talks to Hermione and Ron about the legacy Dumbledore left behind - about the families that were attacked and Death Eaters slaughtered. The Order of the Phoenix and Snape swear to help Harry hunt down and destroy the Horcruxes. Harry accepts their help.

In his heart, Harry is determined to ruin Draco for driving Dumbledore so far.

** "I too often wandered the ailes of this here room. Often to seek treasure, mostly to find just rubbish. Always to find peace." Dumbledore slowly walked past a large cupboard full of old, dusty books. He turned his head in a slow, deliberate manner. "You do not seek peace here, Mr. Malfoy, do you?"

Draco was frozen still. His hand trembled. The tip of his wand went up and down with every new desperate plan in his head. He would have given it a shot, had Dumbledore not looked like wrath incarnate in this moment. They said Voldemort feared only this man. Draco understood now. There was no swirling of robes, or breezes from nowhere. All encompassing was a pressure, as if the air itself tried to flee from Dumbledore.

"I am used to being poisoned. I do not take it personally. I did falter at Ms. Bells fate by your hands, but given her recovery, I hesitated. Who knew? Maybe. I hoped. Hoped that the blonde was all you inherited from your father. That deep within, you were capable of compassion." Dumbledore's wand pointed at the Vanishing Cabinet. One quick flick of the wand and the door opened. "You are hereby expelled from Hogwarts. You may take the exit you intended to be an entry."

"No,..." Draco whispered. "Its not..."

"I know." Another flick of his wand, and Draco flew into the Vanishing Cabinet. His last desperate scream could be heard as the door closed. Not even a second later it apruptly stopped, followed by blood and gore seeping from its cracks.

** Not in 6th Year, but my version of this kind of Dumbledores:

Three years after Voldemort's defeat on Halloween 1981, Dumbledore decided that the Ministry couldn't be trusted to carry out justice against Death Eaters and dismantle Voldemort's sadistic genocidal terrorist network.

As the first step, he riled up Augusta Longbottom and together they confiscated the Lestrange vault, as the Longbottoms found ample sympathy among the public and in the Wizengamot. In addition to gold, Dumbledore also obtained the Cup, and could start the Horcrux Hunt 10 years earlier.

Next, Dumbledore managed to search the Malfoy Manor before Lucius got the dope, since Lucius Malfoy didn't have the time to corrupt nearly as many in the Ministry as in canon. Lucius was found guilty of possessing many dark artifacts, including the forbidden Death Eater regalia, and received 20 years in Azkaban. Most of Malfoy fortune ended in Dumbledore's and Minister Bagnold's coffers. Dumbledore further obtained the Diary.

Now that two Death Eaters turned out to have extremely valuable artifacts from Voldemort, maybe it made sense to investigate and confiscate more? The Ministry could use more gold, Minister Bagnold could use more gold, the Weasleys could certainly use more gold, and Remus could definitely use more gold to hire some werewolves, and send the pack after Greyback? Converting vital enemy war materials to your own is after all a fundamental war objective.

So, which rich Death Eaters next? The Blacks of course! They had to pay for the hideous betrayal of the Potters. Yes, this Sirius Black had to be thoroughly interrogated, with a combination of Veritaserum, Legilimency, and some secret DoM mean. What?! He was innocent? Well, then the Ministry should officially grant him the head of the house, and Sirius Black would in turn let us search the Black residence and ‘donate' some gold for the Greater Good. What?! His brother Regulus also defected and gave up his life to get one of Voldemort's artifacts? How many of those things did Voldemort make? Time to knock up on Horace Slughorn.

“Ah dear Horace, we already got three. He talked to you about this, didn't he? So how many more? You don't remember? Maybe we shall take you for a visit to the Department of Mysteries, I'm sure they can help you remember. Good, I'm glad you found your courage, Horace. You will be greatly honored once this is all over.”

“Yes Millicent, I've obtained irrefutable proof that he cheated the death by using Horcruxes. The Head Unspeakable can verify that. Yes, he could have made three more. So far, two of the objects are Hogwarts founder artifacts, one his personal item, so you can see a pattern here. All of them were obtained by searching Death Eater estates and vaults. Therefore We should first fully investigate every imprisoned Death Eater, to find more leads to his Horcruxes, to identify potential falsely imprisoned ones like Sirius Black, to uncover more potential crimes, to better understand Voldemort's organization, to allow arrests of more escaped Death Eaters, and to seize more of their assets to pay their victims. No, I'm opposed to Dementor's Kiss. Those convicted of murder should be sentenced through the Veil. Even if Voldemort regains his body one day, he will find his supporters and their gold gone.”

“The Wizengamot thereby has sentenced Gaius Avery, Amycus Carrow, Alecto Carrow, Walden MacNair, Adolphus Travers, Markus Selwyn, and Corban Yaxley to death through the Veil for mass murders, mass tortures, multiple counts of rapes, conspiracy to overthrow the Ministry, reckless endangerment of the Statute of Secrecy, and high treason. The Wizengamot has further judged, given the heinous nature of their atrocities and crimes, that ALL their assets, including gold, properties, businesses, among others, shall be seized and their victims shall be compensated.”
