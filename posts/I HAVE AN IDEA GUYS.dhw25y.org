Hey y'all I'm trying something new out and decided to attempt to dip my toes into the wonderful world of harry potter fanfiction. If I briefly outline some stuff below, would you guys be kind enough to give constructive criticism / opinions?

Regulus black had a one night stand the night before he went to get the locket (with a muggle, squib or half blood - not yet sure which) and as a result the main character, my OC Darcey Black is born.

The mother, gives up her child to a couple she deems acceptable. And darcey lives an okay life, she's physically and for the most part enmotionally fine but her mum and dad are manipulative people, and she hates it.

When she recieved her letter, her parents, refuse to let her go, and either accidental magic apparates her to outside Hogwarts to be found by madam pomfrey or, mcgonagall comes round and finds her.

Long story short, she goes to hogwarts and mcgonagall becomes her magical guardian. She is a ravenclaw, and in the same year as the twins. She became pretty good friends with tonks, and then when she left, cedric. Meaning most of her time is with the puffs, occasionally a slytherin..

I have plots sorted out for the third, 4th, 5, 6, 7th and the 2 years after that. Just not her first 2 years... any help would be appreciated.

Draco has more of a character arc, he is still darc but I wanna give him some dimension.

And the love interest will be marcus flint / lee jordan.

Obviously some changes to the storyline... I aim to save fred but kill of another Wesley (no spoilers) save sirius in 5th year, as he will be important to both my MC and harry. Inlcude some clubs, and ideas early on (a study club maybe, to increase house unity etc)

Sirius will be let out slightly earlier. Possible start of third year, minor wolfstar - but tonks will stay with remus. Other minor characters in canon. Appear more significantly to the plot: susan bones, flitwick , daphne greengrass... etc

There is more I could say but, would you read this fanfic? Anything you wanna see appear?Anything from canon, or in general YOU DONT want to appear?


** If I read this summary, I would immediately think "Hello, Mary Sue" and move on. No interest whatsoever.

That said, write the fic you want to read. Best of luck.

** Why is her last name Black? Why would Regulus care to tell a muggle his last name if it was just a one night stand? And why would the mother give Darcey the last name of a man who is, for all intents and purposes, a deadbeat who had no part in raising her? Why would the adoptive family keep the last name Black?

  in the same year as the twins

That's impossible. From the Order of the Phoenix, "Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree, at the name 'Regulus Black.' A date of death (some fifteen years previously) followed the date of birth." If we ignore the Black family tapestry Rowling made, and go on information in the books, Regulus could have died (depending on his date of birth) anywhere from late 1979 to late 1980. This would mean that Darcey's conception would be, at its earliest, still be over a year after the twins were born (April 1, 1978). She would either be in Harry's year or Ginny's. As such, she would not attend with Tonks.

*** I went from the wizarding wikki, I will do more research into the dates of her birth et cetera however in terms of the last name issue I've got that sorted out it's going to be part of the plot I am when she later as a inheritance test at gringos which will supply the fact that she is black and add to the storyline but up until that point it's not clear who her parents are

**** I wouldn't use Gringgots as a inheritance test, it's fanon quite a bit of people hate it.

Is Darcy known as a Black important to the story? What happened if until the story ends she (and everyone else) the doesn't know about her heritage?

If it is important, I'd rather make another subplot rather than using gringgots. Maybe make her questioning her parentage since she's a child, but she never found any leads. Until Sirius saw that Regulus had a child in the black tapestry. Or make her question her adoptive parents to find her biological mother.

** Is her parentage important to the story? I struggle to see Reg having a one night stand with anyone, let alone a muggle. Why does her birth mother give her up?

*** Well if it's a muggle - the mum realises she can not support her child financially nor emotionally.

If it's a squibb or someome else magical, it'll be due to her being of black heritage, a disgrace etc.

And reg wouldnt have a one night stand normally, but, he was about to die, gettimg the locket his head wouldn't be all there.
