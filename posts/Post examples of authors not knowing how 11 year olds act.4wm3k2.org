There's a phrase I've found myself using to describe many stories lately. It's "comically bad". Many things factor into a story being labeled as Comically Bad, but today I spotlight on the whole "First-Years-are-politically-involved" cliche.

Fine examples:

In linkffn(The Accidental Animagus), 11 year old Lord Potter formally introduced himself to other heirs of Noble families. This, on top of the story having absolutely no plot or point, was enough for me to drop it.

In linkffn(Harry Crow), we have the goblin raised 11 year old Harry wielding swords, backhanding Draco Malfoy, and talking down to the Hogwarts staff save for Flitwick. Granted, this is more of a trait of Robst' atrociously bad stories. The funny thing is I only began reading any of his stories yesterday, under the premise of giving each story a chance up to 5 chapters. It's like you took an elementary student's English homework and submitted it to ff.net!

Those are the two offenders I can remember at the moment, as I just read those stories today/yesterday. I invite everyone to link these kinds of shitty stories so we can collectively roast them.


** It's not exactly what you asked for, but the most immersion breaking example of 'Age means nothing' i remember is a fic where a 3 year old Harry gets dropped of at the orphanage and the matron hands him a stack of forms to fill out.

Not even if he was four times that age would anyone tell a kid to fill out anything important. Or expect them to be capable of it. I'm not sure what the author was thinking.

At least there he had had some training in political matters from Andromeda Black. In other stories, he just starts calling people "Longbottom of Longbottom" or whatever without any sign that that's a custom in Magical Britain.

On the other hand, eleven year old kid. Half of them, you'd have to ask them three times before they'd remember to do the thing. But it's not interesting to read about banal failings of children.

*** And it's worth pointing out that in actual noble families in any feudal society, the 11-year olds would already have a basic idea of what was going on in terms of the political situation. The child of a noble would be educated in whatever was necessary to run the manor from a very early age, the same way a child of a serf would be working the land as soon as they were capable. One of the very first things a noble child would learn in their education is etiquette. In a fanfiction focused on fanon interpretations of Magical Britain's society, in-universe, Harry is legitimately strange for /not/ knowing how to address his fellow heirs.

I also appreciate holding back on these things. I've given this writing thing a shot, and in order to present my idea of Magical Britain properly, I've spent a lot of time reading about European feudalism. When I see threads like this, it really grinds my gears. I don't think writers should come here at all, honestly.

***** I think that's part of it, at least. People really want to project their ideals onto these worlds. We're all guilty of it somewhere along the line. Hell, a lot of great writing spawns from the selfish desires of somebody who has literary talent and skill. The only time it becomes a problem is when something is delegitimized by those who don't share what's being presented, even if what's being shared isn't the author's ideal.

It's a bit vulgar, but writing is sometimes just literary masturbation. When you write, it comes from yourself, and should be for yourself first. People who get upset that what you write isn't what they /like/, regardless of whether or not it's good, are basically telling you to give them a literary handjob.

Of course, there's at least /some/ canon democracy. The Minister for Magic is elected, though I don't think it's specified who votes and when. Still, if your story needs to toss out a bit of canon to work, well, that's the foundation of fanfiction, isn't it? Everyone who wants to break from canon should go nuts, regardless of the pressure not to.

** Almost all fan fiction?

Unfortunately, when you do write 11-year-olds realistically, the result is not fun for adults to read. Real 11-year-olds are mean (in that their empathy hasn't fully developed yet), sex-obsessed, immature and annoying. Even the smart ones. Sometimes /especially/ the smart ones. Intelligence is no barrier to immaturity.

In the UK, sex education starts in Year 5 of primary school (age 10, 2 years before secondary school aka Hogwarts). So here they definitely know it exists XD

***** I am from the UK, as it happens though I was home educated, and then went to a Catholic school so sex wasn't really mentioned. I don't think we were officially told condoms (or birth control) existed until the head of pastoral care found out we hadn't been, and by that point we were seventeen. I'm still amazed there were no known pregnancies in my year (though I imagine there were a number of abortions which no-one ever mentioned). Given that supposedly many of the wizarding children are home educated their level of awareness may vary rather a lot depending upon how responsible their parents are, not that this applies to Harry or Hermione say (for obvious reasons).

Jokes about sex? Jokes about what you think is sex (which may be quite wrong)? "Technical" knowledge? Yes top all. But most 11-years old won't go further than a kiss (maybe even on the mouth), and aren't really equiped (physically, hormonally, and mentally) for more.

So basically, imagine mangled sex jokes that lacked correct information.

** The plot of "The Accidental Animagus" is far better than the canon IMO. The characters are actually acting according to their intelligence and reputation, as opposed to satisfy whatever the plot needs. This 11 year old Harry is indeed too mature, but he has a bunch of very smart people whispering into his ears. Unlike in canon, this Harry also knew right from the start what he was up against, so he and his support base got down to work immediately.
