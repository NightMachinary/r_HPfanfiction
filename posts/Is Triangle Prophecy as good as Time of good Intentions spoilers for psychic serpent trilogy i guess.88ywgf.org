** It's a pretty good story, has plenty of the "oh shit!" moments that Barb was a mistress of. Personally I find ToGI the better book, but TP holds its own.

Just... let go of all your expectations of a good ending.

See I love harry potter, the entire thing but I hated the final battle between harry and voldy. voldy kills harry, he goes to the train station heaven thing and he comes back and they fight and it was a very easy simple fight... not that i expected it to be gigantic... but yeah so i guess what i'm saying is it cant be any worse can it?

On another note, does Barb write any of her own stuff or only ever did fan fic? I swear the books are way too well written for an amateur, she put was too much effort into them.. I'm not complaining but man all this planning, the writing alone mustve taken ages than the editing. insane.

Well. At the time I read it (I'm old enough I read TP updates as Barb posted them), yeah, I did think it was the worst ending ever. But after so many years? Yeah I still feel it's a crapshoot. However, it doesn't matter that much anymore. A bad chapter does not erase an extremely enjoyable trilogy, even if it's the ending. It's the whole journey mattering more than the destination thing.

Don't think so. If she does, she never told the internet -- which makes improbable, as she already had a fanbase to turn into a hypothetical original book.

Other stuff to read by Barb:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/789839/1/The-Lost-Generation][The Lost Generation]]. A prequel to the PS trilogy, focusing on the Marauders, Lily and Bill Weasley. I read it only once, but it was pretty good. Read it after finishing TP, as it contains spoilers (even though it's a prequel, lol).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12662566/1/Replay][Replay]] A post-OttP story unrelated to the PS trilogy. I haven't finished this, only read a couple chapters. The writing is still pretty good.

Barb also has a [[https://psychic-serpent.livejournal.com/][LJ]] page, where she gives detailed notes chapter by chapter for the whole trilogy. Very fun and illuminating.

She also has a podcast (Quantum Harry). I've no clue what it's about.
