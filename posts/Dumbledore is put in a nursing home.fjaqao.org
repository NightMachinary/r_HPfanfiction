:END:
Trying to find some fic i read like a year ago, Dumbledor got his magic bound and put in a nursing home and everyone treated his ramblings of magic as him being touched in the head


** I think I saw a similar thing in the fanfic called Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia.

The only difference with your idea was that he was obliviated of all knowledge about the magical world and then posed as an elderly victim of dementia.

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

**** Great story and actually made the multi relationship somewhat believable, plus the story is so good I could suspend belief of the four way relationship.

*** I thought that was the one, or Harry Crow. One of them had the nursing home, one had prison, both had him either crazy or treated as crazy.
