I don't really care who the people reading it are. Just want to see if they have any good ones in the HP fandom.


** None of these are finished, but I really enjoy all of them.

  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

  "Not only will this class be reading it, but all of my classes will be reading it." Umbridge said, her girly voice laced with vindictive excitement. "And I've delivered copies to each of the professors and the headmaster. I believe these books will clear things up very soon."An unusual take on the 'Characters read Harry Potter' plot but there's no recitation here. Give this a shot, I'm trying to make it as believable as possible.

  If they knew what was going to happen, would they have been able to change everything. It was a normal day when they all were summoned to the great hall, to read about a special boy of the future. And perhaps when they know what is going to happen and if they can change them for the better,

  A package of the seven Harry Potter books appear at Hogwarts during the Halloween feast during Harry's fifth year, with a note saying that the books were sent from the future and that everyone in Hogwarts, plus a few guests, need to read them. This is about Harry's first year at Hogwarts and is Hogwarts reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.

  "The title The Boy Who Lived dominated the chapter, but this meant nothing to anyone, so their eyes skipped down to just below that, which was under the date 1981. Six years from now." A reading the book style fic, except much more loosely based around the characters interactions through varied locations. No actual book used, Marauders fifth year, Wolfstar and other details inside.

  Harry is lost back in time with four people he felt he really should remember...with no memory and only seven books to find out the truth of his life, before it's too late to save his new family. A reading the book series with no actual book usage, for a copy that does contain parts of the book easier to follow along, shoot me your email address and I'll send it along. UPDATE 02/23/21- This particular book has been edited by yours truly to try and get rid of some of the egregious grammar mistakes. If you'd like me to send you the updated copy, feel free to ask. Also, if you ever spot a spelling or grammar mistake you'd like me to edit for future republishings I email out, feel free to let me know.
