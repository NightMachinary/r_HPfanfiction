I made [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/hy5kv7/the_morrigans_spirit_possessesmerges_with_femharry/][this]] Prompt yesterday and now I have published the first chapter of the fic for it! The outline is also being worked on because I do want a bit of a line I can follow on for this fic or I might get lost and create plot holes and whatnot.

Here're the links:

***** A fem!Harry! I don't do post-war fics, so everything I write is canon-ish with the odd time-travel alternate reality fic in-between. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
