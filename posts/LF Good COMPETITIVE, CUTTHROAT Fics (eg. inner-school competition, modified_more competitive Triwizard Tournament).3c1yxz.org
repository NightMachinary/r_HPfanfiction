I want your best competitive fics. Fics in which students compete against one another, in which there are visible tensions, in which Harry is pushed to rise to the top.

Fics like Hogwarts Battle School and Wit of the Raven.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn?t mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry?s brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

** What Would Slytherin Harry Do? is unfortunately abandoned, I think, but it's a series of one shots from the same universe that obviously follow a slytherin Harry. A couple of the chapters are his plans for the TWT, and it was really good.

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five
