** Thing is, canon /sorta/ does this too. Not the cringy fanon stuff, but the "Lit 101 taught me the eyes are windows to the soul so I'll throw in a reference EVERY. CHAPTER." Tbh I wonder if JKR was trying to give the kids some easy book report fodder.

** While naturally I don't go in for the whole avada kedavara orbs and stuff, in fairness canon does make a point of repeatedly telling the reader he has very striking eyes. It's an easy shortcut to making him attractive in a mysterious way too, so it's no wonder fanfic authors bang on about it all the time.

The Diary almost definitely had to deal with Ginny's fanfiction about what life with Harry would be like.

** It's also quite funny, since a lot of fanfics are heavily based around the movies, not the books. Movie Harry, of course, has blue eyes. Yet I've never seen a fic that gives Harry blue eyes.

** It's not just Harry's eyes. It's Snape's eyes as dark as ink (flecked with gold, for some reason. I read that in fics on multiple occasions). It's Lily's eyes as green as a spring meadow. It's Dumbledore's piercing blue twinkling eyes layered with wisdom and hurt etc. The obsession over character's eyes extends far over the fandom and sometimes make me cringe to my very core.

Just imagine someone describing your eyes in intricate detail in real life and try not feel weirded out by it.

**** The main reason it irks me is from personal experience. I have central heterochromia and it happens occasionally that people take notice of it and make a comment about it. I don't mind the positive attention of course, but as soon as someone goes beyond 'pretty' it gets weird. As an example of something I've been told: "it kind of looks like a deserted beach surrounded by a light blue ocean. I could swim away in your eyes for hours."

Not exactly stuff you want to hear from people you barely know. T_T

** There are 1,619 uses of the word "eyes" across the seven canon books and another 496 of the singular "eye". Fanon's obsession with eyes stems from the originals.

** Never underestimate the power of emerald orbs in capturing the opposite gender! /s

This isn't specific to Harry's eyes. Dumbledore's blue eyes twinkle, several DE eyes glitter, Remus' golden eyes exposes his inner wolf. Also, whenever a romance fic has trouble describing someone as attractive, they have a habit of using one's eyes as a last resort (either because the character isn't traditionally attractive, or because it allows the reader to make up his/her own mind on how an attractive person looks like). For non-romance, eyes tend to get a lot less attention -- it still has an obvious presence, but not moreso than any other part of describing the looks of a person.

** /Glowing, emerald eyes shined with baleful light. They were spectacular during the day, but the rest of the boys in the Gryffindor dorm just wished Harry slept with his emerald orbs covered. The twin night-lights in their friend's head made the dorm room too bright to sleep in./

Glowing eyes of power, taken to the (il)logical extreme.

** I think it's partially because robes don't give you much to use to describe emotion through body language, and partially because they're just easy targets. Unless your protagonist has his eyes covered for some reason, they're always visible and always available as an easy storytelling medium to communicate emotion without having to go into pointless dialogue that serves no real purpose.

Ninja edit: Also, if you spend long enough described a person's body language to illustrate their emotions it starts reading creepy. That's just not good.

** I don't really like the use of Metaphor like Avada Kedavra eyes (or the infamous green orbs). But, considering that the eyes are considered to be the window of the soul, I like the use of the other adjectif (when done with reason).

I really hate how some fics just add "blazing" or "glowing" every time they talk about Harry eyes (and, for some reason, they do that a lot), just like I don't like how for some, Dumbledore's eyes are always twinking.

But, having a character starting to see a strange glow in the eyes of Harry when he is extremely pissed, almost as if they were blazing, I feel it's a good way to show the character state of mind.
