**** That would honestly be brilliant. Can you imagine Harry casting Expelliarmus instead of Cruciatus at Bellatrix when Sirius goes through the veil and his rage and anger pulls her wand arm clean off.

Harry then uses his Seeker skills to catch it while Bellatrix looks at him in awe, immediately pledging her allegiance to her new Dark Lord and planning on how best to practice casting spells with her left arm in order to usurp Hermione as his most prized lieutenant as quickly as possible.

****** I'm going to take that as a compliment.

Besides, I didn't even mention the part where they both eventually marry Harry with Hermione becoming Lady Potter and Bellatrix becoming Lady Black (obviously).

Harry also defeats Voldy by Expelliarmusing all the horcruxes from their receptacles. This would have normally killed Harry when the horcrux leaves his body but he is protected by Bellatrix and Hermione's love. The love of his other wives Daphne Greengrass (Lady Peverell) and Luna (Lady Ravenclaw) helped as well.

******* You forgot that after he defeats Moldyshorts(as he is referred to in the story) he Expelliarmuses the Dark Mark off of Snapes arm, and in doing so destroys the Dark Mark(and the person it's on) in order to kill all other DE's.

** I'm writing a fic set when Harry is in Auror training, and while he's pretty shit at all the other spells, he uses expelliarmus for everything.

Door blocking the way? Disarm it.

Monster attacking? Disarm it.

Someone on a killing rampage? Disarm them.

Remember in the Goblet of Fire when Dumbledore uses Expelliarmus to break down the door to Moody's room, that the shit Harry is going to do.

** Linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) here Harry focuses on the cutting curse and uses it for everything. Even Draco is horrified when first year Harry casually mentions cutting people's arms off to disarm them.
