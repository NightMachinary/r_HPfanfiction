What's your favorite crossover? I'm hoping for something where magic in the mundane world doesn't super over power all the other characters.

Like possibly HP and Thor? Some kind of crossover potential where magic hp style is new, but doesn't make the kids masters of the universe.

I read a crossover with the walking dead, which was really cool because magic made things easier, but the world was so fucked up in general they didn't have it easy.


** Absolute favorite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4183715/1/Awaken-Sleeper][Awaken Sleeper]] By Water Mage. It's a HP/Dresden Files crossover where Potter's the son of two low level practitioners (iirc) who was in a come for several years and dreamt the events of the HP books. It fairly accurately captures Butcher's style, but with Potter as the main character instead of Dresden.

Next favorite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince][The Black Prince]] by Cxjenious. HP/ASOIAF, where Harry is born as Harry Baratheon, second son of Robert Baratheon (Stag) and Cersei (Lion). Unfortunately very abandoned, as the summary says, but the premise was the very best way to get HP into Westeros that I've seen.

Last is a real guilty pleasure of mine in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8750155/1/The-Girl-who-Imprinted][The Girl who Imprinted]] by CCRevival. When I read the twilight series a decade ago, the Leah Clearwater was easily my favorite character. Twilight Fanfiction in general is fucking breathtaking in how bad most of it is, and this isn't exactly great either, but it's basically the only Leah fic above 50k words that doesn't read like a middle school girl wrote it.

*** I'd love to see a fic where someone cast a spell(maybe Voldemort at the time of his death) that turns muggles into zombies.

I mean like every single one, like 5-7 billion zombies.

And the wizards just sort of have to deal with it

*** Headcanon: HP zombies aren't the slow flesh bags from the Walking Dead. HP zombies are more intelligent than inferi, faster, stronger and just as resistant to most spells. The reason why inferi are preferred is that the zombification victim has to be alive during the creation process, while inferi can be made much easier by collecting dead bodies after battle.

  Originally posted at FanFiction.net, being reposted with edits and retouchings (BECAUSE IT'S BEEN LIKE 10 YEARS).Edward Elric is put on what he believes to be his stupidest mission yet: Babysitting a "Wizard." Everyone else calls it undercover work. To him, it's babysitting. But there's a lot more to this assignment than what's on file. And the more time passes, the more shit hits the fan.

** best recommendation from me would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11577249/1/Magic-of-the-Force][magic of the force]] they integrate magic and the force very well along with recognizing they are different, which some star wars fics dont do.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215532/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Shell-of-the-God-King][shell of the god-king]] was fun and different. rather than harry going somewhere the god-king illyria comes to england, using luna's body

lastly i would look at some of the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Avengers-Crossovers/224/9786/?&srt=4&r=10][hp/avengers crossovers]] many of them are very good. i would recommend just going through the list and reading any that strike your fancy for now.
