Pretty much what I mean is: Are there any good fics out there where Harry becomes a dark lord, but instead of using pure-bloods and hating muggle-borns he does the opposite?


** *The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), fits your needs perfectly. The Trio interaction and relationship are extremely well written.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** I personally would be waaaay more interested (not to say your idea is bad in any way, I appreciate it and would look forward to a fic like that, I just like this more) in a muggle born being like Tom Riddle, incredibly powerful, the really shitty childhood is optional, but unlike him no wizard blood in them. They are as muddy as can get. They are incredibly talented but grow up with overwhelming prejudice and so they hate pure bloods and seek to wipe them and their culture out. Then they use computers to do crazy arithmancy equations and break down many of the pure blood rituals and spells with that. It would be awesome.

In response to your question, there is no Muggle Dark Lord Harry fics, but this fic linkffn(11910994) by StarFox (who is definitely the current best author for hp fanfiction on ff.net) where the muggleborns lead a rebellion. It's like pure cocaine, I binged this fic so hard that I should have popped a vein in my eyes.

Edit: Sorry I forgot that he has another fic linkffn(10595005) where Harry and Hermione kill practically all the pure bloods and shit ensues. It's definitely his worst work, but his usual work is so amazing that it's all right. A fun read for sure but not awesome.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** *Divided and Entwined* is so good that if it finishes at current standard, it will replace *Seventh Horcrux* as my top favorite fic.

** There is a story out there like this, can't remember the name though. Basically Harry travels to an AU where Harry Potter is the Dark Lord with Ron and Hermione as his generals. Dark Lord Potter(thats not his name) has some kind of hereditary magical strength passed down from Gryffindor. Campeder strength, or something similar. His eyes are also golden.

The Purebloods are the ones shunned and persecuted in the story, I believe.

  DEAD. Harry is thrown into a world where purebloods are condemned, Tom Riddle is the Boy Who Lived, and the Dark Lord is someone he'd never suspect. Will his emerging abilities be enough? Should he support Riddle - or the Dark Lord? No slash.
