The Imperius curse is something that in many ways doesn't make sense from a real life perspective. It is said that to resist the Imperius curse, it is strength of will that is required. However, that doesn't really make much sense. Considering that the Imperius curse has been used to make parents murder their children and other sorts of acts, the will to not do what the person cursing you is telling you to do is clearly not enough. It is also laughable that Harry, an impulsive fourteen year old boy, has less desire to jump on a desk when compared to the amount of desire the Death Eater cursing him would have to show the Boy-Who-Lived as fallible. Seeing these and the canon description of the effects of the Imperius curse, I would like to propose an alternative explanation for why the ability to resist the Imperius curse is so rare.

Considering the feeling of perfect contentment the Imperius curse subjects its target to, I believe the true way to resist the Imperius curse is more due to a subconscious belief that the aforementioned target can never truly be at peace and completely happy. This is why Harry who was emotionally neglected growing up and subconsciously believes himself to be undeserving of happiness can resist it. Similarly, it is why Dumbledore who believes himself to be at fault for Arianna's death could resist it. By this logic, it should also be possible to resist it by consciously acknowledging that true happiness can never be achieved without painstaking effort or by becoming so paranoid that you believe all attempts at happiness is simply a trick which is probably how Alastor Moody acquired his resistance. However, as demonstrated by Barty Coruch Jr, this form of the Imperius resistance can be broken. This also explains why so many people got off by claiming Imperius as the only way to be able to truly resist it is to be broken deep down inside.


** My headcanon is that it's not actually willpower (it just feels that way, kinda).

Rather, resistance to the Imperius is achieved through achieving some level of mindfulness.

To illustrate, when I am thinking a thought, I usually both think the thought and a running side commentary second-guessing the thought and why I am thinking the thought the way I am thinking it. (Usually only for thoughts like "What should I have for dinner" or "I will go biking" or "I will say X to Y" or "I believe A about B".

So someone who is sufficiently practiced in mindfullness might automatically question the order, and end up throwing it off. In fact, from the canon description, it sounds exactly like this.

I particularly like this headcanon, as even muggles might learn to resist the imperius,

** Either that or a part of Voldemort's soul managed to help Harry be resistant to it.

** I've thought about this a lot from the other side: what it takes to place an effective imperius on someone, especially for the longer term. It requires a spellcaster who has a total will to dominate the other person. Was it Moody or Bellatrix who said that when it comes to unforgivable curses, you have to /mean/ them? I think that's true. I think it also says a lot about Barty Crouch, Sr. that he was able to keep his son under an imperius curse for so long.

** Harry also knew it was about to be cast on him and got some practice in. I think most people get 'magic suckerpunched' and then aren't even mindful that they should be resisting. I think a lot of people could get better resisting with practice too (knowing what the feeling is and remembering the difference). Harry has the leg up because he's lived a life ignoring and/or being distrustful of other people's instructions.
