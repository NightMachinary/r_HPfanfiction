** See, I think if you are shoehorning in practically /any/ character, then the fic is likely ruined regardless of who it may be. If the author operates from "this person must be the lead," then they have likely sacrificed the plot for a particular character to serve as their SI or avatar in the story. Ditto for Hermione as well.

****** It's such a dumb plan to begin with, "Hey, who's the best person that could fight against literally one of the two most powerful people in the world? One or a team of highly trained aurors? A strike team from the ICW? Or maybe... this zoologist right over here!"

**** The irony is how much bending over backwards is done to shoehorn /out/ Dumbledore and postpone the whole final battle for probably another fifteen years.

**** Does anyone ever wonder when the vow is created? It can't be before Ariana because the fight will never happened, but after Ariana also doesn't make sense. I can't imagine Dumbledore and Grindlewald meeting up only to create the vow.

And why did the vow have a physical aspect? That's stupid.

*** Anytime that Harry is OOC, imo he's being shoehorned in. If an author wants to see someone telling Dumbledore how stupid he is, it really shouldn't be Harry.

**** Especially Draco. Ffs just because they at each other throat for almost a decade does not mean they are true love more than the original couple. Even the aftermath, Draco is still an arse, still passing his Pureblood belief to his child.

**** Amen. I hate the perfunctory ones, where they have no chemistry, and it's just 'male and female spend time together, so obviously they're gonna fall in love.' And he's the main character, while she's the most prominent female character, so /obviously/ it's going to be Harry/Hermione.

Like, if it's actually well-written, I'm all for it, but it's the default for garbage writers, so it has to deal with that stigma.

***** I'd love to read a fic where it's all going this way, main male and female characters hanging out and getting closer, and then in the end it just pivots and Harry ends up with a random muggle cashier girl he met at the mall in the last two chapters or whatever. Total cliche dodge.

******** How was it great for that? It was literally just him ending up with the spare. Yeah, they had a bit of chemistry the movies didn't show, but let's not pretend she was the end all be all of women he could've been with. He just didn't know anyone else.
