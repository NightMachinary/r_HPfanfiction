If voldi's man motivation was to escape death, he's kinda already accomplished that, minor setback aside, at least now he knows the horcruxes work, even if getting a body again is a bit complicated.

Any fics out there were he decided "Fuck the whole ruling the magical world crap, I'm immortal anyways."

Ideally this would be during harry's first year, so Quirelmort, thouygh possibly going onwards. Either he's just trying to prove he can be a great teacher, or going for the stone anyways (because why the heck not, it makes getting a body easier after dying, so definitely still worthwhile). It's not that he regrets what he did, or that he never did any of it and it's all just a misunderstanding/lies/manipulations/evil dumbles actions, just his goals have changed. Maybe all that time in Albania allowed him to really rethink what his priorities ought to be.

The villain could be either remaining fanatical blood purists, or "just" the mistaken belief by Dumbledore that Voldemort's plans are unchanged. Hell, could even by a horcrux that never got the memo and is possessing somebody diary style.

Edit: Lets just not mention HPMoR eh?


** Although the main focus of the Perfectly Normal series by BrilliantLady is Harry, it does have a Quirrelmort who seems to fit your criteria.

** The fic that shall not be named: [[/spoiler][Methods of Rationality]] fits your criteria. Voldemort is intrigued by Harry because he is the only one who poses a challenge/curiosity to him causing him to to change his plans.

*** I was going to add a note that I already know about and have read HPMoR. I'm also not sure it entirely fits, IIRC voldie still wanted to rule the world in the end? Just got scarred of Harry destroying it completely? Or something? Whatever.

Yeah, HPMoR dont count yo. :p

** "Elsewhere but not Elsewhen" might fit. That Voldemort changed his goals drastically after he sent Harry away into another dimension (and is more than a bit of a troll, too). Alas unfinished.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.
