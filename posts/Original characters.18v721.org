** In most cases, a story focused on an original character is seen as an author insert fantasy, which lowers expectations. You'd have to hook readers with a really intriguing plot. If your OC is interacting with the regular cast, it's often a better shot to re-allocate an existing character to the purpose, especially since most of them have almost no personality of their own. Given that you're playing in the shared sandbox, the question that arises is 'why is creating this character necessary to tell your story?'

** I write original characters, but I actually don't like /reading/ fics with original characters as main characters unless I know the author can pull it off, because usually it's done pretty mediocrely (not that I can do better, but I try along with everyone else!). I think the main culprit is blandness and simply not fleshing out the character well enough. There's a lot more to them than personality traits and a background; there's quirks, irrationalities, and other subtleties that round out a character. Details, but very important ones. Do what you have to do to put yourself in their shoes.

wordhammer raises a good question of whether your character is necessary. Don't be afraid to say yes, because if you feel like a story really belongs to a certain character, /write that character/. I'm comfortable with it, because I enjoy writing in the world of HP and not necessarily about canon HP characters, but the responsibility is on me to make them as interesting as the characters that readers already know and trust. If you don't have an intriguing hook or luck out on mass appeal, you'll have a hard time. Your story is essentially half original fiction. Rate yourself on this level: would you pick your story up in a bookstore?

** Well, I'm writing two multi-chapter fics right now that have original characters, or as good as OCs (many next-gen characters might as well be considered that, we know so little of them . . .).

wordhammer makes a good point--can your story be told /without/ a new character (sometimes just the non-canon name will turn readers away)? someorangegirl highlights why this is: OC blandness. What it comes down to is this: Can you build a believable character within the framework of JKR's world, and if you can't, why can't you?

If the reason is that you, personally, can't identify /yourself//imagine /yourself/ in the shoes of any of the not-fleshed-out canon characters, you are probably in danger of writing a Mary Sue or author-insert because you're wanting to write a new, better you into the fic.

If the reason is that the characters in JKR just aren't powerful or special enough, so they need to be pushed aside or replaced in favor of your OC, then you are in Super!MarySue land. A good character has limitations, or is unattractive, or isn't always smart, or is of average popularity. They rarely have a 'tragical' history to match Harry Potter's--not if they are in Harry Potter's universe. He's the only Boy Who Lived.

I don't know if those who have read my stories would say I /succeed/ with my OCs, but here are my thoughts on writing them. When I create an OC or try to put flesh on the bones of a canon-but-not-developed character, I make lists about them. Like, really long, detailed lists. And character sheets. This is what I'd do:

- Write out exactly /why/ the canon characters need your OC to exist. What is s/he going to accomplish? How is s/he necessary to move the story forward? ARE they?

- If it's an OC (rather than a fleshed out, canon character), pick a simple, every-day name--especially if your character is Muggleborn. Create a name that seems to belong in JKR's world-no weird spelling or in-jokes. Unless you plan to have everyone in your story mock your character for it . . . If you're writing in a defined universe like JKRs, it's easy to use the hp-lexicon or wikia to find family names and naming patterns that fit in the wizarding world. There are lots of family names to choose from, and JKR uses some pretty precise formulas for naming her characters sometimes (flower names, nature themed, constellations, alliteration).

- What does he or she look like? (I find pictures that does not resemble me at all, then invent physical flaws because pictures I find online are of models and celebrities).

- What are the character's bad characteristics/flaws? (this first!!!!)

- What are his/her good characteristics/strengths?

- *Check:* Are their good characteristics sometimes the flip side to their bad ones (ie, stubborn/rigid/quick to judge ---> faithful, loyal person who is willing to fight for her friends)?

- Go back and ask WHY your OC has to exist. Again.

- Ok, the OC needs to exist. So what do they spectacularly fail at? Think of Neville and his Rememberall . . . Hermione and her bossiness/know-it-all attitude and bad hair . . . Who hates them (make sure there's a good reason)? Who do /they/ hate (perhaps NOT for a good reason? Because that's human?) . . .?

And so on and so forth. Basically, if the problem with OCs is that they tend to be Mary Sues and/or author-inserts, if you are going to write one, you have to do everything you can to prevent yourself from making your OCs perfect or bland.

Oh, and if you have an OC, please don't write oodles about their clothes, what they look like, or how many people love them. That will send people running, screaming all the way. ;-)

**** Character flaws AND development are, for me, the most important elements in any piece of literature. Don't make your character generic. Make her lively, engaging, quirky, and (most importantly) human. Jo's characters had all of these traits, and that's why they're so great and beloved. You can do it too.

***** Yes!! DEVELOPMENT!

People get really annoyed when characters remain static. There must be character growth, or they will become boring. Of course, not everyone changes fast. It can be a character-flaw that they have to learn everything the hard way (Draco Malfoy?), or that they tend to revert to their worst sides (Percy? Lupin-fleeing-Tonks?). But if they just don't change--or they don't change because they arrive on the scene fully-formed with nothing to struggle against internally, then there will be a problem . . .

**** You are welcome. I'm going to link one of stories, in case it is helpful, too. It's gotten very good reception, much to my surprise, because the OC is a son of Dudley Dursley. Who on earth wants to read about the Dursleys? Yet I've had a lot of people ask me to write a sequel about this character . . . and this is my second-most-often-favorited one-shot.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8918215/1/The-Wonder-Years-The-Diary-of-Hal-Dursley][The Wonder Years: The Diary of Hal Durlsey]]

I did all the things I suggested above before I wrote this story. You will note that Hal's name falls into the outrageous-for-effect category, if you read it. :-)

** I have to admit that I'm unlikely to read fics that center around an OC character. I have a reasonably high tolerance for OCs as secondary characters but I'm not likely to read a fic where the OC is the star.

I think there are loads of characters that are only mentioned by name that you can basically make into your own character. I don't mind a multi-chapter about the life of Susan Bones, but I don't care for a fic about some random member of the DA that we've never heard of.

*** Question: What exactly makes it different (to you) to read a fic about Susan Bones (or Su Li) than about an OC with a name you aren't familiar with?

I've always thought there are probably missing students--ones that somehow didn't get mentioned. I mean, are Hermione, Lavender, and Parvati really the only three female Gryffindors in their year?

**** I think there's a knee-jerk assumption that the fic isn't as rooted in reality and will tend toward the Mary Sue side of things if the character is made-up completely. It might be a good story, but most people will see the summary and move on.

There's a sort of implied credibility to names from the series, even if we don't know anything about them. Though I don't think that Su Li is going to have as wide an audience as Hannah Abbott.

As far as missing students, there's some question as to whether there are more Gryffindor girls. On the one hand, you would think they would have gotten some sort of attention in seven years if they existed. They would have been in all of Harry's classes for at least five years. And there's nothing to say that there has to be five girls in Hermione's year, just because there's five in Harry's.

But the class list makes things more complicated.

I honestly think that JKR got a few books in and realized she had never mentioned them and that it would be too jarring for the reader if she randomly mentioned two other Gryffindor girls in book 5 or 6 after we had had quite a bit of exposure to the other three as well as the rest of Harry's year. Lavender alone gets like 50 mentions even before she dates Ron, despite not contributing to the plot in the slightest.

** "what are some mistakes authors make regarding OCs"

- adding new character instead of using undefined canon one (Sally-Anne Perks? Septima Vector? Ellie Cattermole?)
- making this character unreasonably beautiful, smart and patient (etc). Story will not be interesting without some real conflict - that will not exist when one (and only one) side is good, smart, powerful and lucky.

** I love original characters. Whenever I write I always use an original character. I think a big mistake authors make (and I'm guilty of this) is trying to make their character perfect and good at eveything or constantly the centre of everything.
