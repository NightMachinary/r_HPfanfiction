** So true! This reminded me of a fic I am reading where Voldemort is investing in GME and Dumbledore's putting half of Hogwarts endowment in bitcoin.

#+begin_quote
  "The board does not approve of you parking the school endowment in bonds and stocks," Minerva warned him.

  "Have you seen my cryptocurrency yields?" Dumbledore exclaimed. "That rate of return the Board could not match over a hundred years of investing in fisheries!"

**** It's not really an economics fic. It's a pandemic story set in 2020 and talks about a lot about the Stockmarket going crazy, Brexit, Coronavirus but the economics isn't the main focus. It has an ongoing economics-savvy Voldemort like buying up IBM after WWII with the money he gets from trading homework in school. Hermione invests in Apple stock. Dumbledore is HODL crypto.\\

***** Beware, IBM is a crappy stock after 1973, vastly underperforming the market index and almost going under in 1993.

Apple was a shitty stock from 1980 to 2003, and would have certainly gone under if Steve Jobs hadn't returned in 1997.

The best performing industry group since 1960 is by a wide margin the Big Tobacco. People obviously need their vices.

But I think it's very much in Dumbledore's character to speculate in Crypto

****** By far the best investments, if successful, are the super early ones in big tech. Jeff Bezos threw a quarter million at the Google founders back in 1998, that multiplied 6000 fold to $1.5b. Amazon itself also grew a lot since it started as a bookstore. Given the number of time travel fics, it's surprising that few realize that a quick glimpse on the home screen of a smartphone could be one of the most overpowered things to have in the 90s.

******** Tesla was a huge stock over the past year, less strong before that. But also pretty volatile, so there are several possible scenarios where a time traveler would mess up the past sufficiently to make Tesla fail. Amazon's and Google's near-fails are about a decade earlier and less prone to butterflies. Depends on when a time traveler arrives and how much they intend to change. It's quite possible that major world history could go completely differently. Extremely likely even for any time traveler arriving before 2001, as that's probably the most obvious target for changing.

** I always wondered why Voldemort didn't just cripple the economy. I always felt like the Muggle and wizard economy's are linked, as such a small community like the wizarding community wouldn't be able to providing everything it's people needed. Robe makers make create but where do they get their supplies? How many wizard cotton or silk harvesters are their? How many wizarding farmers? And there will be wizards who work in the muggle world who require muggle money, and muggles (such as muggle born parents) who will require wizarding [[https://money.It][money. It]] seem like destroying or harming the economy would be a good way of seeding chaos in both worlds.

**** If he wants to quickly and quietly take over the muggle world then yes. He was already causing disasters and letting the Dementors roam free. With Muggles concentrating on a damaged economy and 'accident' that were taking lives then Voldemort with have an easier time taking control.

***** He's causing disasters right at the limit of what the Ministry could reasonably cover up. This damages the muggles, makes the death eaters happy and ties up enemy resources. He could attack the muggle world much more severely, but then it'd endanger secrecy, which a lot of people would be against. Pretty much the one thing all the magical governments agree on is secrecy, and if anyone threatens it, it's them versus the entire rest of the world.
