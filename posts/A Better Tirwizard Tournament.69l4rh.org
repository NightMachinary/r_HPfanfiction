The canon tournament is pretty disappointing. The tasks themselves are pretty bad, the spectators only got to see anything interesting the first task. The other two they stared at the surface of a lake and the outside of a hedge. The magic the champions used was also pretty unimpressive. The fist task each champion used one spell. In my opinion Fleur's was the most impressive, she affected the dragon directly she just got unlucky. The second task I find the most disappointing. Cedric and Fleur both cast the bubble head charm and that was it they had months to prepare. No transfiguring a rock into a dolphin to pull them through the water, no giving themselves flippers, nothing. Do you know how hard it is to swim down to the bottom of a body of water and across it with out equipment? Swimming underwater is slow unless you do it regularly. All I am saying is that for a tournament that is supposed to showcase the best students from the best schools of magic in Europe it is profoundly disappointing.

Any recommendations for better versions of the tournament?

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

*** While I do find the canon tasks a bit disappointing I am more bothered by how little interesting magic the Champions use.

I have other issues with the Rune Stone Path story but I do remember enjoying the tournament.

**** Runestone path is probably the only fic with a good polyamorous relationship because not everything is centered around Harry. But I disliked Daphne in there.

The tournament in this story was pretty decent I thought. It does take place later in the story though, just so you know.

I've read so many tournament fics that they have started to blur together. If I remember anymore I will make an edit.
