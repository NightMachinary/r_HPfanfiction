**** Thanks! I would have used the bot but I wasn't quite sure it would work for me, so I just did a direct copy and paste.

** Is this a story you read before, or are you asking someone to write this?

*** I read before. It was around 2 years ago I think. I've tried like crazy to find it but have so far been unlucky.

**** Where did you read it? Was it complete? Do you remember any unique events or spells-you said Harry didn't go canon route.

***** It was on fanfiction.net. It was complete. Don't remember a lot but Harry was a sort of badass that took charge of the situation and was more powerful than in canon.

****** Not that it helps much but I remember reading this as well. It went just a handful of long chapters but was a fun action thing. I'd swear it came from one of the regular Harmony-type writers like canoncansodoff, chemprof, rohata or possibly disobediencewriter, but I skimmed their collections without finding a good candidate.

******* I'm intrigued by the idea of him changing his plan based on seeing the future.
