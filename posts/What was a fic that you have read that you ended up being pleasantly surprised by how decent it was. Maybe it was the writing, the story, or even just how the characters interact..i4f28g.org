Every now and again I come a fic where after finishing it my first thought is "jesus christ that was actually good". I often find they are hidden gems that don't have a large following, have the usual tropes in fanfiction but is still quite good or just super unique. If you ever had an experience like that what was the fic and what caused you to feel that way.


** Honestly, it might just be because I've been binging her(?) stories for the last 2 days or so, but pretty much anything by TheEndless7 on ffnet.

Her romance fics are some of the most delicious slow burns I've ever read, for one.

Especially linkffn(Twelve Days by TheEndless7) and linkffn(Vitam Paramus by TheEndless7) are great takes on Harry/Gabrielle without it being creepy etc. Very well paced in both cases.

linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre by TheEndless7) is not really a romance (or at least it's not tagged that way) but more adventure. Still some romantic tones here and there, and it made me thirst for more fem-Voldemort honestly. I don't think I've ever seen it(female Voldemort) done so well. Worth noting that it has a sequel, though this story works on its own, that is unfinished. As a pretty serious warning, its good enough that you'll very likely find yourself emotional during reading (I cried).

All in all TheEndless7 has redefined my view of quite a bit of fanon. I don't think I've ever enjoyed reading about quidditch so much, but the clubs and characters as she writes them are my new head canon.

On the negative side, there are some quirks to her writing (for example starting sentences with 'but' at times) which might annoy a highly critical reader, but for me it felt right even if it's not always 'technically' correct grammar.

Sorry it's not a more niche writer :/

*** As much as [[/u/rpeh]] probably dreams it were otherwise, I am indeed a male. But I identify as someone that would rather have a drink than worry about pronouns.

Iron And Gold actually has what is, I feel, far and away my best quidditch. It turned into mostly my magnum opus of quidditch. Sadly it features a cast of almost entirely OCs and, well, Kreacher. While Kreacher is the best, he's not a huge sell.

I think Ithaca will end up being my best fic if I ever get around to finishing it. I made the mistake of writing the ending first and now I've lost most motivation to write the middle part. If you like Emily there's a very good chance you'll like Ithaca. Most of it isn't published yet, though.

Anyway, thanks for the reviews. I do appreciate them and am glad you enjoyed the stories.

Also it's perfectly acceptable to start a sentence with a conjunction. Don't let 1950s style manuals dissuade you. But, it can be distracting if it's overused. And, I will acknowledge that I likely should edit a few of them out. But, I'm not going to. ;)

I'm not entirely sure. I have a soft spot for the Titus & Harry friendship dynamic which I might be addicted to, add Eva and the banter just becomes even better. I feel as though those (off-pitch) interactions enhance the rest of the quidditch a lot.

Even so, I greatly enjoyed Iron and Gold. Though it wasn't necessarily what I was hoping for in the sequel, I loved seeing the new generation grow up and make their own mistakes as they learned who they were meant to be. The romance was, as seems to be your trademark, well done as well though I do feel as though the story ended too soon for my liking. I'd have loved to see some more told to follow up on the cup, but I'm probably greedy.

No, thank you! With as much pain as I'm currently in it was... I can't even really describe how much it means to be able to find your stories that almost allowed me to ignore it at times. I don't, usually, read as much HP as I'd like because I'm overly critical and tend to get pulled from the stories too easily when minor mistakes are made. Over all the 5 or so stories I've read of you by now, I only had the feeling it was happening once and it was so minor I was able to force it down. Extraordinary work!

So uh... Is it terribly rude to ask if you have plans to continue Cleansing the Sins of the Past? I realise it's been a year for you, so you might have decided to discontinue it by now but a reader can have hope, can't they?

*** Hmm...I only read about halfway through the first chapter of Twelve Days, but the age gap between Harry and Gabrielle felt to me like it loomed large. It wasn't entirely clear how old Harry was, but he had to be at least eighteen and maybe nineteen, while Gabrielle was fifteen - and she /acted/ much younger than him, too. Harry's behaviour is clearly aged up compared to canon, while Gabrielle still felt like a little girl.

Prose quality seemed solid, though.

I believe I imply somewhere in there she has a January birthday, which makes her weeks from sixteen when the story starts.

But, they don't start interacting consistently until chapter 3, where she's then 18. And there's not really any Romance between them until chapter 4, where she's 20 and three months from 21.

While I agree 15 and 19 seems a little iffy 20/1 and 24/5 seems less to, at least to me.

*** My only gripes about their work (after marathon rereading all their work this past weekend, except iron and gold) is that a lot of it blends together. It's almost robst tier at times with 'haven't I read this same story before but with a tiny difference?', and the quidditch scenes/broom racing motorsport references, while fun for the author and anyone else a fan of them, can be REALLY tedious to read.

Overall, absolutely more than worth a read of at least one of them, and as you said, it's an interesting change to typical fanfic romance and probably the best quidditch scenes, but I felt the negatives do warrant discussion/I'm interested in others opinions

** The summary of linkffn(Grow Young With Me) put me off reading it at first, but for some reason I tried it anyway and found that the summary was really misleading and the story is great. Really tugs at the heart strings.

Also, the premise of linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) sounded rather mundane at first, and I ignored it until quite recently, but it turns out that the author did a really good job of developing that premise and giving the story depth. Even when "Rigel" seems overpowered, there's always a cost - like the fact that fame is a danger to the pretense. Or when she's imprisoned and tortured for days by someone who wants to steal her magic, then essentially buried alive, and ends up with a foreign presence of dubious loyalties embedded in her mind.

  "I find a small pot of good tea can reduce many troubling problems to a manageable size," the Headmaster commented when a house elf had delivered the tea tray and poured them both cups.

  Rigel swirled the tea pensively, watching the little twister in the center of her cup with detached curiosity. "Would that tea could reduce an entire nation's pride and folly to a more manageable size," she said after a moment.

  Dumbledore hummed thoughtfully. "You'd have to poison a great deal of tea."

** There was a surprisingly good WGWL fic on ao3 called "You get what you give" by WaterMellonsFellons (idk how to spell it). It explored the "different girl who lived trope", "twin" trope, as well as Slytherin fem!Harry, the dynamic between Lily and James, and different heirships. It was also- strangely- a Tomarry, and used those terrible nicknames for Voldemort in jest. I find myself going back quite often to reread it.

There were a few things I enjoyed. It was not too tropey, and imo the writer delivered quite well. The author also incorporated their knowledge of ice skating, giving the female Harry (Belladonna) a sport. She is not the prophecy child, and instead, the burden is on her sister, Prue. Then it diverts into different blood magic, using Tom's diary in CoS and having Bella work with him to deal with Lily, Theo Nott's grandfather, and Karokoff.

** Hm. There must've been a bunch. Here are some that I remember.

Linkffn(Across the Universe by mira mirth) - I liked how reasonable people were and how it was entirely character-focused. No forced over-dramatics, but not a fairy tale happy reunion.

Linkffn(Constant Vigilance by Kevin3) - I've never read another fic cover Moody training Tonks. I was pleasantly surprised by the silly fun of the fic.

Linkffn(World On Fire by WiseTomato) - I find badass Old Man Harry fics to be quite rare, so it was quite nice to stumble into a decent one. I really wasn't expecting it in a Mass Effect crossover.

Linkffn(There May Be Some Collateral Damage by metisket) - I had very low expectations of any HPxBleach crossovers. This one isn't overly short and it doesn't drag on and it's complete. And I thought it was pretty hilarious.
