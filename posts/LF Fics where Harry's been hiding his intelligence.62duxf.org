From the Dursleys because they hit him, Ron and Hermione because they're his friends and he doesn't want to upset them, the school because it's his secret weapon against the evil masses, whatever. Harry's smart and it's a shock to the world.

Slash, bashing, Crossovers and dark!Harry are fine. Please no genderbending, mpreg, harems, romance/smut-centric plots or pottercest. Thank you!


** He hides his intelligence because he wants the Dursleys to like him and because he wants to seem normal. This harry doesn't realize that the way the Dursleys treat him is considered abuse and not how children should be treated. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/346100]]

*** Perfectly Normal is probably my favorite on-going series. Don't doubt the writer, she always follows through! She turns a lot of stupid cliches around with some really clever ideas about why they might have happened, explaining in a comment about why Voldemort would try to hex Harry's broom:

""I wanted to see what you'd do if you fell, and what magic powers or talents you hide that preserved your life as a baby, and I didn't care back then if you died" is much closer to the truth. "I thought an indirect attack on your life via hexing your broom wouldn't endanger me with a possible dangerous reversal of the spell" is another bit of information that I don't think will ever get shared in-story, but is part of my personal headcanon for Voldemort's motivations in this fic series."

  Harry doesn't want to learn magic or go to Hogwarts -- he just wants to be normal, like the Dursleys. But a meddling, crazy old wizard won't take “no” for an answer. Harry might have to learn how to be a normal wizard instead. But who will teach him what that means -- Light wizards or pure-blood friends?
