*Most wanted*: Tom Felton and Daniel Radcliffe

*Year:* 3rd year and up

It could be after they finish acting in all the movies or the chosen year in the movie. For example: If you want them in 3rd year, then they finished acting in the Prisoner of Azkaban.

How they travel are up to you. Either accidentally or purposely

Both of them are able to imitate their characters perfectly but have trouble with magic. They also sometimes can't contain their shock and excitement when anything magical happens and likes to explore the castle, grounds, forbidden forest. Also, they know each other as in they know both of them are actors.

If they get revealed, then it would be fun to see them acting like themselves and being good friends. And watch everyone else get weirded out by how nice and charming Tom is and how crazy Dan is. Maybe they'll even try the Sorting Hat and see what houses they get.

*If there is any similar fics to this, can you recommend? I would really like to read it :)*


** Closest one is Trading Places. Daniyel [sic] is an actor playing Harry Potter and gets switched with the real Harry Potter. Harry has to pretend to be an actor and his counterpart needs to pretend to be Harry Potter.

  An attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is just a story. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. AU OotP. Harry still has magic.
