Don't quite remember if it was a cross-over with some other universe -- I wasn't familiar with it at least. Basically Harry comes back to Hogwarts after this ball takes him through some sort of training thing during the summer. Becomes a H/Hr fic. I distinctly remember a scene were Draco Malfoy tosses Hermione something that's a portkey and transports Hermione off to the Death Eaters to be raped. Harry uses the ball to torture Malfoy in front of the Great Hall (to get to Hermione), breaking Malfoy's limbs, while also generate some magic fields that reflect the Professor's attempts to stop him.


** This is linkffn(Backwards Compatible by Ruskbyte). Like all his fics, pretty fun, and like 95% of his fics, abandoned :) Not a crossover, but the main of premise of returning from a hellish future (or sending back memories in this case) was taken from Terminator.

  The war is over. Voldemort won. The light's last hope is a desperate ploy, concocted by an insane genius, that probably won't work anyway. Now Harry must find a way to win a war he's already lost once before.
