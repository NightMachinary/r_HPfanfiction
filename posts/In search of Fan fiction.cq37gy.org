:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Years ago I started reading a fanfiction written in the point of view of Andromeda Black as she's at Hogwarts and falling in love. This is around the same time Voldemort is starting to come to power. If anyone has read this as well and can link it, I'd be forever greatful
