I've been itching to read some fics where the Granger family adopts Harry. This can happen before Hogwarts, anytime during, or even after as a ceremonial gesture.

It doesn't really matter if there is a H/Hr pairing included, it's fine either way.

For reference, I've already read linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) and Vox Corporis (I'd link it, but I can't find it on FFN).

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** linkffn(One World by Stellar Magic) is pretty good, though abandoned. It's pretty similar to White Squirrel's works, though a notch below, I would say. An enjoyable read.

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.

  Assumed dead, the last Potter grows up an orphan until she finds a home with the Grangers. The family explores magic together, but not all is wonder and enchantment. A killer stalks the streets of Crawley, and the Dark Lord isn't as gone as everyone thinks. Fem!Harry/Hermione. POC!Hermione. Slytherin!Hermione. Grey!Dumbledore. Violence & Suggestive Themes.
