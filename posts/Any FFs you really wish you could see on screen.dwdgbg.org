Just rewatched the last film (DHP2) and was thinkinging that I felt cheated that they left out the part where the shopkeepers, house elves and others come rushing in all at once. I know i will never see that scene on screen which got me thinking of never being able to see some great ff on screen (although thinking of it in my head is still good). Getting back on topic, is there any ff or parts of ff that you wish could be made into video?


** That Sirius gives Harry the talk fic with the donuts and bananas, I think. Tonks walks in and grabs a donut and Remus a banana. I think a good romantic comedy could be made out of linkffn(out of the fire and into the cupboard)

** Many Northumbrian stories: linkao3(1857084;1623053), AFTER FINALLY FINISHING linkao3(3068435) (of course, skip over first four chapters), actually stories involving brothers Creevies would be lovely short films (particularly linkao3(1709177) and linkao3(8468188)), all crime stories, linkao3(7155281) would be a nice historic short flick. I really believe that he writes with film scenes rolling in front of him (morning in the tent on the elevated platform with Harry and Lavender Brown sitting in front of it).

Talking about historical films, of course, linkao3(The Friar's Calling by Chthonia).

  February 2000 Newly Qualified (in record time) Auror Harry Potter remains obsessed with “The List.” The ten people still wanted for their part in the Battle of Hogwarts. Their capture is essential. It will bring closure to the events of the past few years. Harry has set himself a target. He wants to see “The Last Death Eater” and the other nine captured before the second anniversary of the battle. His attempts to meet his target will bring heartbreak, danger, pain, and a lifechanging injury for one former DA member.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

** What I wish for is JK Rowling went to WB and pointed to the Fanfiction community. And we got a series, one season for one fanfic that is complete.

Kinda like a Netflix series.

For example A BLACK Comedy would have a full series, 10 or 12 episodes and is produced by the creator(if they are available) and actual directors.

And each season has different actors for the same characters. And maybe we can have a Unatoned season where Radcliff comes back one more time.

I wish this would actually happen.
