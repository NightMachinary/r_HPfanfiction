Maybe someone else would be willing to write them, you guys can pm each other if you'd like, if anyone is interested in ideas.

Can be focused on any characters or anything.


** Honestly I just love seeing people wrote harry/fleur where it's not just an excuse to write smut or using the Veela Allure trope to facilitate Harmony or a harem.

*** Yeah that gets really annoying seeing it written like that. If you need to use that clutch, then maybe don't write the pairing, or think of a better way to write that pairing that hasn't been over used.

**** I dont mind it in general but I've seen a few where it's like ok this is harry/fleur only. Oh wait she sees harry loves hermione and forces them together and only shows up during sex scenes or something. Theres not enough pure harry/fleur. I was reading a really good one imo and the author abandoned it because of the shit JK has been saying recently. Like I understand that even if I dont agree with him about his views on the Divorceing the author thing but it still sucks

** Not afraid/unsure, but I have too many stories already started ... however, for the last couple of nights before I fall asleep, I have to think about the discussion between Ron and Lavender in the Hospital Wing after his poisoning. Ron spent the last couple of days on the edge between life and death, and he came to the (obvious) conclusion that his relationship with Lavender was all wrong so far. However, contrary to the canon, he decides not to ditch her, but to re-establish their relationship on the right foundations. So they finally talk: about their ideas about relationships, about life post-War, about their dreams and hopes, how to make it work for them.

Perhaps, Lavender admits that she had been building her gossip network intentionally into the intelligent-gathering tool for serious use (and mentions what all she has already learnt and which disasters she has already prevented). I love the idea of her running rounds around hopeless Carrows during their seventh year, who are not able to hide anything from her, and she helps Dumbledore's Army to deal with them. Inspired by [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Search&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Btitle%5D=&work_search%5Bcreators%5D=Northumbrian&work_search%5Brevised_at%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bsingle_chapter%5D=0&work_search%5Bword_count%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bfandom_names%5D=Harry+Potter+-+J.+K.+Rowling&work_search%5Brating_ids%5D=&work_search%5Bcharacter_names%5D=Lavender+Brown&work_search%5Brelationship_names%5D=&work_search%5Bfreeform_names%5D=&work_search%5Bhits%5D=&work_search%5Bkudos_count%5D=&work_search%5Bcomments_count%5D=&work_search%5Bbookmarks_count%5D=&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=_score&work_search%5Bsort_direction%5D=desc][the awesome Lavender Brown of the Northumbrian stories]].

** Wow, I have many, some are being written, some are just ideas.

-Harry goes with the Weasleys to Egypt and ends up going with Bill on a quick Curse-Breaker adventure where he meets a muggle(who is into the whole Wizarding World) with his teenage squib daughter that like to raid tombs, The Crofts. Yes, teenage crushes issue.

-Harry is taken to a camping weekend by the Dursleys(to cook for them) and gets lost in the forest where he is attacked by rogue vampires, he's bleeding out on the ground when an Elder Vampire that was pursuing them finds him, sees that he has some important stuff to accomplish, and turns him to save his life.

He now has to deal with the whole Vampire Masquerade stuff, being a Tremere, and attending Hogwarts as a Vampire. Perhaps Lily's blood protection makes him only a daywalker though, so he can drink blood and use the powers, has the hunger, paleness, aversion to silver, but sunlight is harmless.

-The Dursleys go on a holiday with toddler Harry to France, "forget" him on the hotel room, child services get him on the system and he ends up adopted by a family of wizards(France government has a way of knowing it and prefer to place wizarding children with wizards to avoid problems), who contact the British Ministry, by then the blood protections(they were gone the moment Petunia abandoned him) are gone and the French Ministry can see Harry was neglected, they get into a legal battle that ends when Dumbledore see Harry being well treated and loved by his foster parents, Harry is raised in France and chooses to go to Beauxbatons.

-Harry makes an effort in the Yule Ball and actually starts dating Parvati, getting an introduction in Indian wizarding culture when he goes to visit her during easter holidays and the summer.

-In Third Year, Remus suggests inter-year projects, and all professors are "strongly encouraged" to do it, Snape spitefully pairs Harry with a spitfire Slytherin second-year who is always getting into fights with her housemates(namely Draco and Co.), Astoria Greengrass, who becomes friends with Harry and maybe more a year later.

-Harry someway(maybe French plot but with Vernon going on a company-funded all family business/holiday trip) goes to Japan, and ends up adopted there, goes to the magical school there, that is very different from Hogwarts because some students are yokai and they are also taught talisman and Onmyo magic. Is still summoned by the Cup at Fourth Year. Has a half-kitsune girlfriend, speaks accented English, and knows jiu-jitsu and kenjutsu.

There`s some more, but those are more serious and some are being written.

** I've been thinking for awhile about a story where Harry cannot speak as a result of years of conditioning by the Dursleys, not one of those over the top abusive Dursleys stories, rather one where constantly being punished for asking questions and speaking out of turn coupled with the fact that when he tried to ask for help or explain himself nobody would believe/listen to him, convinced Harry to stop talking all together.

So when he arrives at Hogwarts a lot happens, first he makes enemies with Malfoy as the boy thinks that Harry is ignoring him and doesn't tolerate the disrespect.

Then Harry having to learn all his spells wordlessly would leave him a bit behind his peers so he ends up isolating himself spending hours in the library, there he meets Hermione that decides to help him and as the two become friends Hermione eventually learns sign language to speak with him.

I would focus in particular on how Harry manages to stay true to his character and inspire others without needing words.

Eventually Ron would be drawn into the trio (because I like him, frik you Ron bashers) and they would become friends and follow the plot of the original books but straying further and further from Canon every year because no one wants to read a retelling of the books.

** I want to write an SI with me being transported either in 1881/1892 or 1980/1991, but I'm already writing/struggling with another story and I don't know if I should do the type reincarnation from birth or popping into my eleven-year-old body out of nowhere and receiving my acceptance letter to Hogwarts. If in 1892 I would really change the events of canon and some world history (because I just popped into the nineteenth freaking century and I have goddamn magic) as well as having a potentially eventual romance with Albus and stopping Lord Voldemort from ever existing. But as I said, I'm already writing another story and I struggle to come up with basic enchanting theory.

** I literally have a file full of ideas and notes. I even had to add a TOC so I can find certain parts to add ideas as they occur to me. Here's one that I really am not sure I could do justice to:

/Sheep's Clothing/: a character study about young Remus needing to learn self-discipline to combat the wolf that raged within him, resulting in the mild-mannered (arguably cowardly) person we saw in Snape's memories and Harry's school years.

As much as I like his character, it really bugs me that Prefect Remus stood by --- and presumably participated at times --- while they targeted Snape. Not to mention running away repeatedly: after Sirius went to jail, when he was outed as a werewolf in Harry's third year, when Teddy was born and he didn't feel ready for fatherhood. I'd like to see him... well, "redeemed" isn't really the right word, but as less of a weak person and more of one who has successfully fought his own demons.

/If anybody write this, and wants to credit me for the idea, please use my fanfic name Fyrebird. But either way please let me know so I can read it./

** Everyday life. What is it like in the magical world if you are not at war? How does childcare work? Does small children play quidditch on toy brooms with soft bludgers? What are some fun jobs? How did WW 1 and 2 affect things?

** I have already started writing the fic I was unsure about lol\\
Pretty much everyone I asked said writing OCs would make the fic unpopular - well, I'm three chapters in and it's not exactly popular but I think it's doing decently.\\
Anyway I had this idea for months and I finally started, pretty much it's an AU that answers a few what-if questions.

Like "What would have happened if Sirius and Remus made different choices after seventh year? What if they had more to protect than just the Marauders and the Order? Where would their choice lead them and how would it change Harry Potter's life?" (it's not a wolfstar)

I'm not gonna spoil who are the OCs, but if you are interested I can link it.

** 1) SI fic where they expect canon only to learn that the universe is AU. Magic is different, history is different, etc. Sometimes their knowledge helps them, other times it's hugely misleading

2) SI fic that is mainly focus on the magical theories and world building

3) Harry is good at wandless magic, developing a unique system that works for him. However it's incompatible with the magic taught at Hogwarts and Harry struggles to learn the new magic while reconciling it with the habits he developed in his old system.

** Tentative title: Madsong. A crossover with Zelazny's Amber stories in which Harry, or perhaps Luna, follows a unicorn and meets Dworkin.

Tentative title: Harry Potter and the Sussex Beekeeper. During the horcrux hunt, they run across and get help from a long-retired Sherlock Holmes, who is a muggleborn who left the wizarding world after Hogwarts and devoted himself to logic. Cross with the original Conan Doyle stories, not any of the newer TV shows.
