The Sorting Hat could be an excellent teacher but it would need a body to teach. Barry Crouch Junior's body was currently unoccupied....


** "Hello everybody..." came the voice of the new DADA teacher.

It was oddly familiar and every single student could somewhat recognise it. The name was just at the tip of their tongue...

"I know you!" A boy from Slytherin suddenly exclaimed. "Your Barty Crouch Jr. Didn't you die in Azkaban ages ago?"

"My body is Barty Crouch Jr." the familiar voice corrected. "But I am the Sorting Hat. Now anyway-"

"How are you even in the body?" shouted a Ravenclaw. "Did you even enter the body in a ghost way? What happens to your Hat then?"

"Obviously I can occupy a body, I am doing it just now. And as for your second question, I.. do not know." 'Barty Crouch Jr' admitted.

"Then how can-"

"Anyway," started the Hat." around fifty years ago, Defence Against the Dark Arts was the best class ever! Teachers there used to actually teach for more than a year-"

"-You can't keep on ignoring my question-" the Ravenclaw interrupted

"-Now I want all of you to sit next to a person of another house. Merlin children! Don't look at me like that! To think you all behave worst than Godric and Salazar when they are drunk, and that's saying something... Anyway, lets start with some basic shield charms. Why don't you tell me the incantation, Mr Anderson, since you were all too eager to question how I acquired this body."

** How would the DADA curse effect the Sorting Hat?

*** The body inhabited by the Hat is "registered" as the DADA teacher and will probably need replacing in a year. Until the curse can be lifted, Hogwarts keeps requisitioning the bodies of terminal St. Mungo's patients, death-row inmates at Azkaban, et cetera.

** ... are ghosts souls? Or just imprints of the soul tied to a magical area? Could they enter and possess a body without a soul like Barty Crouch Junior?

*** They're echoes, like paintings. Think of a person as a shape, their conscious mind and apparent personality being the outer shell. When a ghost is created, the soul passes on, but leaves behind an imprint of that outer shell, but only that. Their existence is like negative numbers in mathematics - they have a form of negative life, or undeath. Life despite being dead. However, because they're only an image of the surface of a person, and a person's 'real shape' would be defined by everything that sits deeper than the surface, they're imperfect echoes of the person they once were.
