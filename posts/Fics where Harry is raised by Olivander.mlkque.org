I was thinking about it, and I've read fics about him being raised by everyone BUT Olivander. I just thought it was an interesting concept but if there's actually a fic out there I'll die happy :p


** Here's one!

  Char. Ooc, AU/AR, still within JK's world - Harry is apprenticed to a Diagon Alley businessman at the tender age of seven. From there the story changes... very mild bashing of some regulars.
