Hi there!

I didn't know where else to ask, so I figured you guys would maybe know something of this odd experience I had many years ago now!

Right before book 5 came out, I stumbled upon (what I thought) a prerelease of book 5 on pdf! I read it and I was absolutely taken in, and only after me and my mom (who read the real deal) started discussing the book, we found out that we had read two completely different books!

So now, years later, I'm looking for that odd PDF again.

It got some major differences, and I'm not sure if it should be posted as spoilers to you guys (????)

- Dudley becomes a genuine nice guy to Harry, secretly
- Dumbledores son enters Hogwarts
- Something about clones? Sorry can't remember it all
- Neville turns into a Death Eater

I hope you guys can help me! And sorry for the bad formatting, I'm not posting very often on Reddit.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent) perhaps? I've never read it but heard it described similarly.

*** That was my first thought, too, but the Psychic Serpent doesn't have Dumbledore's son nor a Death Eater Neville

**** I've only seen one death eater Neville, and he didn't mean to join the death eaters in that one.

*** That's not the one, sadly no. Though there was actually animagus-training in the one I read as well, so it definitely got some similar points :)
