No Drarry. No Weasley/Dumbledore bashing, Hermione is preferably with Ron and NOT Draco.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/][Exile]], linkffn(6432055): Draco is forced to flee to the Muggle world after the War.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): the part about Draco's â€˜redemption' is hilarious.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

#+begin_quote
  A man appears at the gates of Malfoy Manor. Draco Malfoy isn't the average first choice for a hero sent back in time to save the world. Narcissa Malfoy, slightly surprised to see the grown man her eleven-year-old son could be, isn't the average first choice for his Horcrux-hunting partner either. Honestly, they're supposed to be on the other side in all this business. But it cannot be denied that they're very efficient, especially given their quest is relegated to Narcissa's free time and Draco is relegated to a guest wing bedroom so his father and younger self don't interfere. Nor can it be denied that if the Dark Lord isn't going to show them loyalty and victory, then... well... Family First, after all.

  Through a dark ritual, Draco Malfoy is sent back in time, from his seventeenth year to his eleventh. Now he has the chance to use his superior knowledge and skill to change everything and save all his friends and family, but there's a terrible complication: it turns out that not even time travel can cure a case of lycanthropy.

No slashes, no romance centric, no bashing, just pure character build is all I would like.

The closes one so far that is promising is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12401900/1/Never-Tickle-a-Sleeping-Dragon][Never Tickle a Sleeping Dragon]]. I'm attempting to write out because I felt pushed to do one on my own, but I'm still in the middle of planning it out. I'm doubtful I would get far in all honesty. However, I would like stories to find stories similar to it though.

Basically, Draco found Sirius' diary which was under the name Padfoot so he really did not know who the diary belongs to besides the fact it was found in Grimmauld Place and written by a pureblood. Draco then learns about a different perspective of pureblood society. Overall, it's an amusing read.

  It was all because of that stupid diary Draco had found when he went his mother to visit 12 Grimmauld Place. If he hadn't started reading it then he wouldn't know about this Padfoot and he definitely wouldn't be questioning everything he had been taught since he was old enough to listen. He definitely wouldn't be standing outside of Harry Potter's house. That damn diary.

** Oh, I found another favorite I recalled. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11007575/1/Not-Alone][Not Alone]] by NutellaNinja101. Remus is more of a mentor to Draco in this fic.

  AU What if Harry didn't have a chance to show everyone that his boggart would have been a dementor? What if Draco had to go next? No slash!

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10255536/1/No-Church-in-the-Wild][No Church in the Wild]]. It's got everything you're asking for; hasn't been updated for a while, but its over 100k words so it's definitely something you can sink your teeth into regardless.

** So, my favorite Draco is from linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7). Draci has a brother, an Irish twin named Hydrus, and his father tries to get Draco placed in Gryffindor as a spy.

He succeeds and hijinks ensue.

I feel awkward recommending it because it's already more than a million words (and still in progress) and Draco is a subplot, but there you are.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

#+begin_quote
  The trials for suspected Death Eaters involved in the Wizarding Wars have begun, and Draco Malfoy finds himself trying to hold together what is left of his family and his fortune, while struggling to escape the looming, almost inevitable future of a lifetime spent in Azkaban. But there is one person who might not have given up completely.
