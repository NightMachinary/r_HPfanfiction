Since this has been interpreted to mean that they have to kill each other doesn't that also mean if they misinterpreted the prophecy and/or chose to go with another meaning they don't have to die at all?

Are there any stories that are based on knowing they are immortal if they don't fight?


** There are a few fics that have Harry trap Voldemort in a soul cage of sorts, but I don't remember any of them. I'll get back to you later when I do.

**** Ok, so the only that I can remember was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear]] but there was something similar at the end of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Distaff Side by Clell65619) has Voldemort banish Harry to another dimension because of that interpretation of the prophecy. There's another one where Voldemort does something similar, banishing Harry by sending him off on a thestral, which can apparently traverse dimensions. I don't remember the title of that one, off-hand.

  Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.
