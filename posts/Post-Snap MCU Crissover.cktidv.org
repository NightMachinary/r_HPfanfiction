Does anyone know of any crossovers occurring after the Snap in Infinity War? I thought it'd be an interesting concept to have half the wizarding world suddenly fade away with little initial connection to the MCU occurrences. Essentially canon to that point, when the world becomes smaller.

If not I guess we can call it a prompt.
