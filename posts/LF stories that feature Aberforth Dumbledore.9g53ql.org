One of the stories I've been following really closely does a great job making a real character out of Aberforth Dumbledore. I've been trying to find other fics that feature him and really do him justice, but I'm not finding much. Know any good, well-written fics with Aberforth as one of the main characters, or that at least have him as a well-developed character?\\
I don't care about pairings, both het and slash are fine, but I'd prefer no over the top Dumbledore-bashing stories.\\
I've also searched past reddit threads about this already, and have read the few stories that have been recommended in those posts.\\
Thanks!


** This one is on LJ and was actually recommended on this subreddit. [[https://wotcher-wombat.livejournal.com/5719.html][Scenes From the Hog's Head Inn]]

*** Ha, that's actually the story that I've been reading and loving that made me ask the question in the first place! I'm so glad the author updates like clockwork, but after the last few chapters I've been wanting even more Aberforth.

** The Minister's Secret by Canimal has Aberforth playing a pretty solid supporting role.

** I recall an amusing crackfic where Aberforth was the on who actually defeated Grindelwald and let his brother take the credit because he didn't want to make himself a target for future dark lords. Cut to present Day, where Albus realizes Harry needs to be trained to fight Voldemort and sets him up the with real slayer of Grindelwald... who teaches him how to properly mix drinks. Damned if I can remember the title though.

** I was frustrated about the lack of stories with Aberforth as a central character.

I'm working on a story about the Dumbledore brothers and their complicated relationship with each other throughout the years after Ariana's death, how they eventually got back on speaking terms and how Aberforth became involved in the Order during the First War.

Will certainly check out the one you've been reading.

** I'm not really sure at this point how central a character Aberforth will be in my story, but he does have a more developed back-story and will have a few important appearances at least, so if you're interested, let me know. He's not really part of anything just yet..
