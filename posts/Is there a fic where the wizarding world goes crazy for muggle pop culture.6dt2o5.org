Is there any fic where they get really into muggle music, or Agatha Christie novels or other stuff?


** I'd like a fic where wizards go ga-ga over the Apollo Landing and respond to DE 'What good are muggles?' with 'well, they landed on the moon'.

Every fic I've ever seen has wizards being oblivious to the moon landing, or disbelieving that muggles have the technology for it, or similar.

*** The antagonist in one of my fics actually comments that the moon landing is beyond impressive and shows a reason why wizards should be concerned of cultural stagnation

** I remember there being a one-shot where Harry was sorted into Ravenclaw and kept a really low profile. During the Yule Ball it turns out he is actually some big-shot musician in the Muggle world and (after some pleading) basically turns the Great Hall in to the high school dance from Back to the Future.

Can't remember the name of it though.

**** Found it again. "Rock Star" by Jeconais. Not quite what I remember it being, but oh well. Should be close enough to the request.

** In my story "Patron", Harry and Hermione start up "Movie Nights" at Hogwarts, which are a big hit among students. Muggle clubs become more popular during the war as well, though mostly because they are safe from attacks by Death Eaters, so that does not last.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** linkffn(RuneMaster) At one point Harry gets good enough with runes that he is able to make something analogous to a television or a movie projector, I can't remember which. Everybody loves the muggle movies that he plays through it and it becomes a big deal, a rather important plot device as well.

That aside, I consider the fic to be really middle of the road in terms of quality. Few grammatical errors, decent dialogue for the most part, but the last third of the story gets really stupid. It has a whole "Harry as a Masked Vigilante" thing going for a while that I considered to be really trite and boring, more cringe-y than anything else. Still, overall it is not bad, and really as with most fan fics that aren't spectacular you just gotta go with it and stop knit-picking and you'll come out just fine.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

** This one's crack, but in The Predestination Paradox Draco becomes convinced that he's doomed and decides to be a rebellious teen (because it's on his bucket list) by embracing muggle culture very publicly. If I remember it right, he rides a muggle bike around while playing rock music and puts on a performance of The Wizard of Oz in the Great Hall, and even manages to convert a few people.

  When Harry finds himself in the time of the founders, he makes a shocking discovery. Meanwhile, in the present, Draco finds himself in desperate need of a bucket list. Rated T for "cheeky" behavior.
