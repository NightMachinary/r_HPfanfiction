This popped into my head the other day, but I'm not really sure where to look, so does anyone have any recommendations or a doc they wrote themselves? Kind of like ‘Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance'


** one, that example is a "reincarnation" not an "incarnate" reincarnation is when people die and are reborn, incarnation is when a higher diety/being becomes human, like there are so many stories where harry is death. also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5756444/1/Reborn]] has the same premise but it's short and abandoned
