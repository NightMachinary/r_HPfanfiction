:END:
I remember it was during the second Triwizard task, Harry was gifted Excalibur and used it to stop a threat, and he then threw it back into the lake afterward.

Can't remember a damn thing else about the fic. Help?


** I'm pretty sure this happened in 'A Marauder's Plan'. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1085412/chapters/2182999]]
