So I cant remember if I made this up in my mind while I was sleeping or if I read this a couple months/years ago, but there are too many stories to comb through to find the right one, but I'm looking for something where maybe Lucius gets super pissed after Harry frees Dobby that he kills harry which inadvertently separated the horcrux from Harry long before it happens in canon and leads to a much different Harry throughout the rest of his


** Well, on the one hand there are A LOT of fics where the horcrux gets separated/fused with Harry early (depending on your particular belief regarding that). Most of them generally occur though during:

1. Voldemort AK's Harry in the graveyard (ex. On the Way to Greatness)
2. The dementor attack in OotP (ex. The Merging, a ton of H/D fics actually)
3. After the pseudo-possession in OotP (ex. HP and the Unlocked Knowledge, Abraxas)

On the other hand, I cannot specifically think of any with this occurring during CoS. That might be partly due to the fact its the /movies/ that show Lucius about to use the killing curse, but the books never actually show what he was planning to do to Harry anyway (though it would certainly be unpleasant, somehow I doubt he would jump straight to murdering the Boy Who Lived).

As an aside, thats one of the scenes that I would actually say was better in the movies than in the books. It feels much more emotional when Dobby is freed and he saves Harry.
