One thing really bother me in fanfictions is that how Unforgivable curses are cast by everyone, especially in Hogwarts. Like every person can cast Avada Kedavra, Crucio or Imperio.

It takes a lot amount of hate or negative emotions, energy and control to cast those spells effectively. Just because someone in Slytherin doesn't mean s/he can cast unforgivables. Draco Malfoy or any Slytherin couldn't cast any unforgivables successfully even if their lives depended on it.

Another thing bothers me is Horcrux. How 'family magic' contains information about Horcrux. How the fictions assume Horcrux is a very common knowledge in dark families. It's not. It's in fact very rare knowledge. There was a reason Voldemort choose Horcrux for his immortality. There are dark magics, and then there are /dark/ magics. It's /dark/ knowledge. Neither Malfoy nor Bellatrix knew that they were trusted a Horcrux. The chances of DMLE head, auror head or unspeakable head having the knowledge of Horcrux is next to nothing.

Edit:

I think I wasn't clear enough about Horcrux. In canon, Voldemort was arrogant enough to believe nobody would figure out his Horcruxes. Not even Dumbledore. I do believe the reason behind his arrogance was he thought this knowledge is so obscure that nobody would have thought of him creating a Horcrux. Let alone multiple.

I don't expect AU to follow canon. But It bothers me how in fanfictions, how creating multiple Horcruxes or Unforgivable curses are taken so lightly.

Edit 2:

Reckon I still wasn't clear enough. I know that Slughorn knew of Horcrux or Regulus figured it out. In many stories even some of the good readable ones: Harry meets Goblin, Lucius Malfoy, Amelia Bones, Croaker or Greengrass sr. Harry talks about his scar. And boom. Suddenly everyone figures Horcrux out. What I mean that Horcrux isn't this common knowledge that everyone would figure it out on a whim.

Ehh.. I think the DMLE Head, the Auror Head, and the Unspeakable Head are /exactly/ the kind of people who might have some knowledge of horcruxes. Particularly the latter. I mean.. Slughorn knew they existed.

Was Voldemort specifically confident that nobody would know about them? He may have been, but I don't particularly remember it. He was confident he wouldn't die, so nobody would even have a reason to suspect. He was confident that he hid them, so nobody would be able to find them. He was confident that he had them well protected, so even if they were found they'd be fine.

Why would he think nobody would even know of their existence when he learned about them from his socialite potion professor?

**** Yeah, it's extremely rare, but Voldemort and Dumbledore can't - or /shouldn't/ - be the /only/ skilled and knowledgeable wizards. Not to mention that quite frankly they don't have the resources that the Ministry should. Dumbledore has like 3 full time jobs and nobody directly working for him to do this kind of thing (and he doesn't like telling anybody anything), Voldemort has minions but has been busy taking over a country, but the Ministry has an entire department of wizards that do nothing but study esoteric and dangerous magic day in and day out. They even have a sector dedicated to death. They've likely been accumulating knowledge for hundreds of years.

I'm not talking about any of the mentioned people knowing horcruxes inside and out, but surely they have at least heard of them and have some ability to recognize and analyze soul magic. So they do some intensive investigative and detective magic on the scar and find that it's not just any dark magic scar, it's related to souls. Do some more research, dig up some spells, reach out to some trusted contacts, yadda yadda, come back and find out that there's a definitive trace of a foreign soul in that scar. I don't know how many different things can involved putting a piece of your soul in something else, but that must narrow it down quite sharply.

Edit: Though I do think it would be reasonable for a skilled/knowledgeable person who is interested in Harry for whatever reason to notice if the scar is obviously hurting him when they can see it, do some magical investigation and figure out that there's /something/ very not right about it, then take steps.

Bones sees Harry gasp in pain and clutch his scar --> investigation --> something fucky's going on, Voldemort and the AK were involved, better investigate Seriously --> she doesn't know --> first person she calls doesn't know, so as the DMLE Head she gets an Unspeakable or the Head of them to take a look --> Voila.

** "Family Magic" is pure fanon anyway, just as much as "Noble and Ancient Houses" and Lordships. If you see it in a fic, you can pretty much write it off as an AU, and you shouldn't expect it to follow canon rules of magic or the HP universe. In these AU's, you can seal a will, or have a Magical Guardian, none of which was mentioned in the original books.

However, Regulus Black in canon figured out what a Horcrux was and how it worked, so the knowledge is out there, and not /totally/ unknown. Regulus didn't know someone could make multiple Horcruxes though, so there are limitations to the information. Still supporting the idea that it's ultra-obscure magic.

**** You're saying that fanon makes rare magic like Horcruxes way more common than they should reasonably be?

Disregarding the concept of fanon/AU's, Horcrux magic isn't /that/ rare, not compared to the level of Philosopher Stone alchemy recipes. Who knows how long the books about them had been sitting in the Hogwarts Library being read by students, until Dumbledore became Headmaster and took them out. In any case, an "easy" Horcrux hunt is not inherently a bad thing, especially if it's just a minor segment of a greater story arc. Anyway, the "struggle mode" canon version in DH was full of Idiot Balls and contrivances to give it difficulty (months in the tent /wearing/ the Locket Horcrux, when they all saw the Ring Horcrux kill Dumbledore when he put it on).

In the end, it's the flow and tension of the overall story that matters most.

  Horcrux magic isn't that rare,
#+end_quote

It's sufficiently not-rare that it appears in Russian folklore and got borrowed for a famous series of muggle childrens' books in the late 60s (The chronicles of Prydain). By that and possibly other routes it found its way into the Dungeons and Dragons Monster Manual by the 80s. Never under the name the potterverse has for it, but the evil wizard who buries his heart/death/soul to become immortal and/or invulnerable is a folklore trope.

** Knowledge about Horcrux was once stored in Restricted Section of the Hogwarts Library, a school library! It shouldn't be that exotic. Slughorn, a potion professor, knew about it. Regulus figured it out.

It should be expected that certain members of dark families, Unspeakables, and some very senior Ministry officials also knew about it. But of course, JKR wouldn't have it because it would detract the heroics of the Trio! How dare there were competent (Ministry) adults assisting the Trio and sharing the glory!

No, in AU stories, authors should have the freedom to change this aspect of the canon. Ultimately though, these AU stories have to be internally consistent and logically developed to attract my interest.

*** It's not so much that it is exotic, the issue that in canon the knowledge is fractured and not all in one place - not even in the Hogwarts library. Anyone interested in it has to actually go, collect it and then puzzle it together from the various marginal references. That's why Voldemort was confident nobody would figure it out and that was why Regulus managed to put two and two together once he had an idea what to look for while everybody else who didn't have that crucial first hint, even Dumbledore, was stumped by it.

Fanon disposes with all that and provides easy to follow step-by-step tutorials ready to use for anybody willing to pick them up while covering them with neon sign spelling "How to cheat death before breakfast".

Then Fanon goes one step further and fills it with all kinds of rubbish detail.

I'd argue that it's the job of the Head Unspeakable to know about obscure magic and it certainly wouldn't hurt if the DMLE did too.

As for the unforgivables, they were apparently taught reasonably successfully in death eater occupied Hogwarts.\\
Harry manages two out of three in canon (Imperius when getting the cup, cruciatus on one of the Carrows in Hogwarts)

A 17/18 year old Crabbe throws multiple killing curses around like candy in their fight in the Room. This is the same Crabbe who is one of the poorest students in their entire school. Draco Malfoy successfully holds Rosemerta under the Imperius curse for 6-10 months when he is 16. A 17 year old HP is able to hold an inner circle Death Eater under the Imperius successfully, and cast the Cruciatus curse successfully on Amycus Carrow.

Agree with the control part, but not the others. The Unforgivables do not require any hate or negative emotion at all. An intent to kill/hurt/control does not require emotion, believe it or not. I have no idea why this keeps popping up again and again repeatedly on this same sub.

Also, there is not a single spell that requires any energy, if you're looking at canon magic. All spells require some amount of magical strength, but they do not consume this strength - if one is capable of casting a killing curse, they can cast as much as they want to for however long as they want.

** Horcruxes are so dark that in the only book that the Trio found(IIRC, in the Restricted Section of the Library) which even /mentioned/ them, the author basically said /"That shit's so friggin' dark I ain't even gonna go into it"/...and IIRC, this was a book called */Magic Most Evil/* or something like that.

Now, I do know that the specific book that gave instructions on both how to create and destroy Horcruxes(/Secrets of the Darkest Art/, IIRC), /was/ once in the Library before Dumbledore removed it and put it in his office. But I honestly doubt anyone would have known who wasn't specifically looking for that kind of thing, so even then it was probably far from common knowledge - the subject was banned at Hogwarts even before Dumbledore became Headmaster(Armando Dippet was Headmaster at least up to Riddle's 5th year, by which time he knew how to do it, since he created at least one that year). And the book would still undoubtedly have been in the Restricted Section.

Excluding Riddle and Harry, that we know of only two or three people knew about Voldemort's interest in Horcruxes: Slughorn(who knew Tom was interested in the subject), Dumbledore(who suspected Tom had created Horcruxes ever since the diary came into his possession, if not earlier), and Regulus(who seems to have figured out, somehow, that the destruction of the locket would leave Voldemort mortal and vulnerable)

So I agree that the knowledge should still be exceedingly rare.

** Where does everybody get the idea that they're so super crazy difficult to even cast? I mean canon has like a billion examples of how EASY it is for people to use them! Harry does it at 15 with crucio, Krum does it in the maze on Cedric (and he was Imperio'd at the time, which means canonically you can use Imperio to make SOMEONE ELSE cast an Unforgivable!) Draco does Imperio chain at 16 (another example of using an Unforgivable to make someone else cast one! So it CANNOT be that emotionally high of a thing to use), Harry does Imperio and a better Crucio at 17, and Crabbe or Goyle does Avada Kedavra AND Fiendfyre at 17!

And I don't even understand where that whole emotion requirement comes from, because in CANON, Bellatrix kills a FOX casually, and I doubt she hates a fox that badly! And I seriously doubt Harry was feeling so insanely worked up about McGonagall being SPIT ON that THAT was what got him to cast Crucio. And when he cast Imperio on the goblin we're in his head and I don't think he was feeling anything at all, let alone hatred or some desire for domination!

All that super difficulty, crazy emotional stuff is just fanon.

*** I think a lot of fanfic makes them harder to justify anyone not using them, because otherwise there's just no reason to cast anything but killing curses (at least for the death eaters who don't care about the moral or legal issues) since it's unblockable (unless you count physical objects, but it's not like any other spell does better there) and you win the fight if you so much as graze your opponent with it.

Crucio is people reading in to Bellatrix's "You have to mean it" comment.

No idea on Imperius, maybe they just the fall of the ministry to take more than just chain imperius (which seems to be pretty much what happens in canon).

** Totally agree with you on Horcruxes being rare dark magic, but not on Unforgivables. Per canon, you just “have to mean it” - Harry casts two (Imperio and Crucio, both in DH), Draco is shown casting Crucio and also cast the Imperius Curse on Rosmerta in HBP, and Crabbe and Goyle are both naturals at Crucio (according to Neville in Deathly Hallows, IIRC), which many students are forced to practice under the Carrows' direction. We also see Crabbe successfully cast Avada Kedavra, even though he misses.

Arguably you don't even have to “mean” them, just see the use of an Unforgivable as necessary to protect yourself/your loved ones (as Harry does in Gringotts once he realizes the goblins know Bellatrix's wand was stolen and as Draco does when Voldemort threatens him while ordering him to torture a fellow Death Eater). Saying Draco or other Slytherins “couldn't cast them if their lives depended on it” makes no sense ... unless you're saying it bothers you that students cast really powerful dark spells in canon, which I kind of agree with! Crabbe especially was so magically weak throughout the series and then busts out Fiendfyre at the end ... that threw me when I read DH for the first time. (Even though he pulls a Sorcerer's Apprentice and doesn't know how to make it stop.)

**** My headcanon says it's based around the very Idea that fire consumes all things, so to use it is to fight against the very nature of the spell and have it Not consume you and what you care about, but only Everything Else. Normal fire doesn't work that way, it burns all the wood you add to it, not just the wood you don't like. So, with you understanding that, your fighting against your own understanding of the spell as much as the spell itself. The more you know about it, the Harder in gets.

****** Ah, that's a neat prospective, and it makes me think of a bit of (technically) dark magic from some fic I read in the past called the “Blood Gorge”. It's an Army Killer that the ICM (my headcanon version of the ICW that I like more) has tried very hard to exterminate the knowledge of completely. It works by infecting the blood of anyone it touches but a drop of, spreading to them, ripping the blood from their vains and adding to the blood composed abomination that shapes into monsters and attacks more. Growing and spreading to everyone around it that it can (just) cut. A single drop drawn is lethal, and it's driven by the Idea it's infused with when it's first made.

Usually that of a plague, “to infect everyone it can”. It can infect animals and insects as well (anything with blood) and it doesn't ‘Have To' kill immediately. I believe it was said in the fic that you could use a single masquito to kill a country, let alone an army. The Blacks invented it, why do you think it's called “The Black Plague”?

It was established in fanon that spells in Europe are mostly based in latin and belief and intent are almost required for the use of magic, and that visualization helps. (I don't know if or not that was set in canon though) So, I choose to believe that pointing a wand at someone and saying Pulmenti Pulmenum will turn the targets lungs into steaming lung soup, which will most assuredly kill them while keeping them from healing themselves or fighting back while they die.

** I've always assumed that quite a few people have heard of Horcruxes, but the knowledge of how to make/destroy them is more obscure and less well-known. Because the books were in Hogwarts library up until Dumbledore was headmaster, Slughorn knew about them, Regulus Black was able to access information on them, etc, there must have been some awareness of them. I agree that the idea of creating multiple wasn't common knowledge, though.

​

People in the Ministry would know of Horcruxes at the least, but it isn't plot relevant to canon because by the time Harry knows of the Horcruxes his trust in the Ministry is so low that he'd be unlikely to go to them for help. In a different world, probably without Umbridge, he might have done. It stands to reason previous wizards have attempted them, if there's literature on the subject. Maybe not many, or for a while, but there would likely be some residual knowledge at the Ministry.

​

On the unforgivable I think that yeah, the vast majority of witches and wizards wouldn't cast them, and a sizeable proportion wouldn't be able to. And even of those who could, some of them probably wouldn't be able to cast all of them. Like Harry manages a weak Imperius, but struggled to manage Crucio (its debatable how much he manages it even on Carrow) and probably couldn't do an Avada. Crabbe and Goyle can I think canonically manage Crucio, but they perhaps couldn't an Imperius. I dunno, that's just always been my assumption.

** Personally, I'm a fan of the idea that only the most unimaginative idiots must default to using the “unforgivables”. I prefer “Pulmenti Cor” if you're trying to kill someone, or, better yet, “Pulmenti Pulmenum” to stop them trying to save themselves. Leganimence people into your perfect soldiers, and never even need to torture them. What kind of horrible person tortures people anyways? Rip what you want from their minds, use truth serum or loyalty potion. The same is true for “unbreakable vows”. If they were truly unbreakable everyone would use them, so why does noone? Invent your own spells, but don't use the stupid immediate-life-sentence stuffs.

If you're going to use Phylactory, go to an orphanage in the middle of a city on a wednesday when most people are at work, in a place that ‘actually has' gas lines, and burn the biulding down with simple fire. Not Magical Fire! Be sure to kidnap six kids first of course, and see everyone else killed. Don't Get Blamed For It! Idiot! Plan it ahead of time, and split your soul into temporary objects for now, like Common Currency! 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16. Then reabsorb the 1/2 one (I'm Not Comfortably With Less Then 1/16 At A Time, are you?), and the 1/4, so you're left with 13/16 of your soul in you, as well as 1/8 in one thing, and 1/16 in another.

If you can, get the 1/8 to split again into two, and one of those two into two more. That leaves you with Four cruxs (two 1/16 and two 1/32) and Five Total Pieces! Like a Pyramid! You still hold the vast majority of yourself inside of Yourself (13/16, or 26/32)! Then, move one of the 1/16 pieces into a ring; make the Ring out of something that can A: Channel Magic, and is B: Freaking Indestructible! Put defensive wards on it that are powered by the soul piece inside! And Take It Everywhere With You! Say you FOUND IT! Hopefully, (When) you're defeated they'll take it as a prize (cough, the elder wand, cough). That'll bring your total soul with you up to 14/16, or 7/8, which is a nice number.

Put the other 1/16 in some invaluable historical artifact in the Muggle World, that's Constantly Under Watch! I'm sure ‘eventually' the security will get good enough to catch magicals. Put a basic anti-magic protection on it, like you just wanted to see it safe (anti-fire, anti-theft, unbreakable). Don't Tell Anyone You Did It! Find a magical historical artifact and put it under Massive Defenses! Tell only your most trusted about that one. Make it look like it have A Lot of magic inside of it, and Don't Tell Anyone About the Soul Splitting!

Release one of the 1/32 pieces into the economy as an unbreakable-notice me not low denomination coin. A penny, say.

Find a normal russian rock from a particular part of sibiria and put unbreakable-notice me not charms onto it, powered by the soul peice (duh) [And Powered By Heat!] and drop it into the Long Bore Hole (or whatever the name of that is).

------

Hopefully it'll survive the death of our sun. Make Sure You Install A Failsafe Into Each Crux, that can only be activated from the inside! ‘cus you WILL get tired of life some day...

*** The only flaw in your plan is the reabsorbtion part. A horcrux is a piece of a split and damaged soul. To reabsorb it would be to heal that fracture, and the only way to heal a fractured soul that is mentioned in canon is through geniune remorse- something Voldemort is fundamentally incapable of feeling.

Now, if you wanted to add some more obscure dark magic of your own that wasn't mentioned in canon (soul fusion magics from South America/Egypt/etc) that could reasonably explain things, but nothing in canon is mentioned to heal a split soul besides remorse

**** I'm a sociopath, I can make myself feel whatever I want. Not My Fault voldie can't.

(Mind you, not enough of a sociopath to need to take medication for it, but it did come up in a mental evaluation I got done back when I was trying to join the USAF. Nothing ever came of it, I have a heart mermer, so I couldn't join. Sad face. Still, it's an interesting extension of mind-over-matter I had to train myself to do. It's pretty cool and I assume voldie could replicate it with Legalimency/Oclumency.)
