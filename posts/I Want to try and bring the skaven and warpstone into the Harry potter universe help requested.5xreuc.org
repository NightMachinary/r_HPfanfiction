I think it could be really cool . would the wizarding world except the idea of intelligent rat people better than the warhammer races ? How would warpstone effect wizard's? How would they deal with the skaven technology?

How could skaven and warpstone be believably be introduced into the Harry potter universe?

Thoughts? ideas?

This ideas been in my head for months and I really want to try and do it but I'm stumped on how to make it work

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.
