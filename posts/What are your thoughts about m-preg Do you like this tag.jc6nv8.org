In my opinion, this tag is somewhat weird, as I can't imagine how babies could be born in a male body. I mean, where the baby comes out? From the anus? ðŸ˜‚ lmao

**** Aye unless the story is wholly centered on the pregnancy, which almost noone would write and even less people would read, it's just an unnecessary amount of fat added to the story. Not that all lean stories are good, but still

** First off - if you enjoy it - power to you. You do you. I have no problem with what other people might like.

As for me personally (and it is just my opinion and you don't need to share it) - I find that trope utterly disgusting. I never read a story that contains it. I've seen quite a few stories that otherwise well written, are utterly, irreparably ruined by that.

Maybe it is just me, but the very idea raises too many ethical and moral issues for me. Not to mention the meaning of evolution, the role of men and women in society (in biological sense, I don't care what people choose to do with their lives). Men simply do not have required organs and to me the idea that magic somehow makes it possible, is repugnant.

If that were the case, would wizards be hermaphroditic? Would it mean there is no real need (in terms of biology) for women in society at all?

In any case, as far as I see it, to write mpreg, is to write about a /different humanoid species/ altogether.

**** Agreed. Most fem Harry is just ... Harry with few girly lines thrown in, but no actual consideration for how her character, views, likes, dislikes would differ. How other people would perceive Harriette or how events would play out.

I wouldn't mind reading a story that takes all that into account and makes a believable story.

Sadly I've yet to see such a story. Either fem Harry is for love interest, or it is a fix-all, because obviously a girl Harriette would be perfect and never mess anything up the way Harry the boy does...

** Honestly, it's one of the tags that will make me stop reading that fic immediately if you like it more power to you but for me, it just feels weird. Even if the premise is /so good/ that I have to read it I most of the time skip over the parts tbh and pretend it hasn't happened.

Then again I also have problems with imagining myself pregnant, so I try not to read any fics that have a pregnancy in them because for me reading fics is about imagining myself in the character's position and I just feel nauseous when I think of myself as pregnant.

** I actually don't have anything against those, as long as there's a plausible in-universe explanation - and with how loose the boundaries of magic are in HP, and with similar ways of affecting the body existing in canon (polyjuice potion, animagi, metamorphmagi), it's very easy to make a leap that as long as there was a smart, motivated wizard who wanted to find a way, he or she WOULD find a way. And the motivation is fairly easy to come by - you just need to accept that gay wizards exist, and some of them may wish they could have biological children with their partner.

So, yeah - mpreg just existing because male wizards can have babies is lazy writing and unappealing to me, but I will very easily believe in something like a potion made with the drinker's partner's seed that would create a womb-like sac in his body, and the child would have to be taken out through a c-section. Or a partial body transfiguration for one of the partners. Or even a female surrogate that would carry a child that biologically has two fathers via a potion. When the universe has working time travel with built-in paradox prevention, and potions that manipulate the environment around you to give you the best possible outcome for anything you might want to do, a way to have a child with two fathers doesn't sound too crazy.

** I don't read any fics with pregnancy, regardless of the person who is pregnant. The thought of being pregnant horrifies me and I definitely don't want to read about it. (I'm not saying other people can't enjoy mpreg or pregnancy in general, or that it shouldn't be written, it's just something I avoid.)

** I like the tag because it lets me avoid the stories. As others have noted, it's sufficient to break my suspension of disbelief.

I have read two stories that weren't tagged that way that included the concept. In one, the threat of being forced into a same-sex relationship that included pregnancy on his part was the McGuffin that caused Harry to run away and start the main plot. In the other, it was due to ancient eggs/artifacts that Harry chose to nurture in that manner.

** When reading a story, there is a thing called suspension of disbelief. However, nothing kills that in a story faster than Mpreg. For that saying to work, everything in the story has to be plausible, even with magic. Centaurs, magically created from a man and a horse coupling, so plausible . Turning into an animal, again, magically plausible. However, even with magic, men just do not have the necessary plumbing to have a baby. People will try to say "magic, but the only way a male can have a baby, even using magic, is to become a female, and then it is not mpreg anymore. How is a man supposed to get pregnant anyway? Men don't have the sexual organs necessary. But, but, Magic!!!!... Again, men do not have the proper plumbing, such as a uterus that is necessary for the baby to gestate and grow in.

** I don't mind them. This is a world where people can turn into animals, and you can turn into another person just by drinking a potion. I don't understand why male pregnancy is impossible for people to imagine.

As for how the baby is born- a c-section is the most common way. Other times it will be through the anus, or the genitalia will temporarily change to become female.

*** Exactly! In canon you can turn into animals and gain WHOLE ANIMAL ORGAN SYSTEMS. So why is it so impossible and weird for people for a human to just transform their body to have the organs of the other human sex? That's way less radical a change! And Polyjuice already does that anyways, just wholesale.

**** The difference though, is that with turning into an animal or polyjuice, you are fully turning into that animal or person. If the polyuice is of a woman and a man drinks it, he doesn't just grow breasts or a uterus, he fully turns into a woman.

** Wizards can change into animals - I'm sure they can shapeshift into females for nine months to a year if they really wanted to give birth. This is the same reason why I don't think being transgender would be a thing in the magical world - magic would just adjust any gender-sex mismatches as soon as a child is old enough to develop a gender identity. Mpreg is just unnecessary.

** I've never actually read an m-preg fic. Nearly all of them are slash, and I tend to prefer non-slash stories.

The closest to an mpreg fic I've ever seen is a normally male character getting locked into a female form for the duration of the pregnancy. For an added amusement factor, the "father" of the child was normally female.
