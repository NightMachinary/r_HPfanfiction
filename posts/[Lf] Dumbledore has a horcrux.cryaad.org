*** I like the attempt to spoiler tag but not sure how it helps in this situation as it seems a bit redundant... Good fic though, was my first thought seeing the request.

That's a fair observation. Thanks for pointing this out. I'm just so used to putting down spoiler tags to try and not give away things to people who might not want it. And as that was a pretty big reveal (at least for me), I figured I didn't want to spoil it for people, lol.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

*** If this is the one I'm thinking of (and I'm almost positive that it is) then while it is an interesting read it also is unfinished. On top of that it runs through a bunch of ideas without ever really exploring them and then the author goes off on a tangent about how the Middle East deserves to be wiped out.

***** I don't know that I've read “For the love of magic” but the one I'm thinking of had Dumbledore as the big bad and Luna as the niece of Alice from the Lewis Carroll stories. Don't want to say more due to spoilers

**** It definitely has its entertaining moments, but yes, as it goes on it gets more and more drowned in WTFery.

But as requested, Dumbledore with Horcruxii.

Also, the bit where Snape demonstrates Potions safety by plunging his head into a bucket of acid makes me giggle every time.
