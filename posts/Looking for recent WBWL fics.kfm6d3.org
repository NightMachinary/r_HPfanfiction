As the title suggests, I am looking for WBWL fics that were started recently( in 2020). Would like male protagonist stories. Not looking for anything specific within this trope. Thanks in advance. Merry Christmas.


** Ashes of Chaos; Prince of Slytherin are your best bets at the moment.

Although both focus heavily on Legilimency and Occlumency which can get a bit tedious if you don't like reading about that stuff.

** Are there any decent recent twin fics where the potters raise both twins? People can think the wrong twin is the boy who lived or not, but I'd prefer if they all at least sort of get along.

*** There's the awesome"Harry Potter and the boy who lived". Don't remember where all the chapters are available tho. Discontinued but still one of the best works in the twins trope imo.
