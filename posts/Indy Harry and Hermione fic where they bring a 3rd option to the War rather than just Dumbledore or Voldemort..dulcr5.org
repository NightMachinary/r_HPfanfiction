A fic where they decide to fight for themselves and their futures rather than for either of the crazy old men that have been battling for decades.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/Escape][Escape]], linkffn(11916243), looks like a good fit. Harry and Hermione first fled Magical Britain, but continue to direct the war cleverly behind the scene. They need help from an effective McGonagall and good Snape though.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play

** There's elements of this in linkffn(Delenda Est), with a younger Bellatrix rather than Hermione.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
