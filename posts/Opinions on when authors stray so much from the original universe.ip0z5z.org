Don't get me wrong, authors straying away from canon is fine, in fact, it's one of reason I read Fanfiction, however some stories feel extremely convoluted and feel as if they require you to read the fanfictions own Wikipedia page to understand what is actually going on.

At least in my opinion authors should try to stick to “keep it simple, stupid” as much as possible to avoid readers confusion.

Thoughts?


** I think that it's a "fish or cut bait" situation.

#+begin_quote
  *Divergence / Mild AU*: Avoid unnecessary deviations from the canon setting.
#+end_quote

If the story largely reuses the canon setting and characters and relies heavily on the reader's knowledge of them, deviations from the canon setting that don't stem from the fanfic's premise are jarring and distracting.

For an analogy, imagine watching your typical Adam Sandler romcom. The characters go to the Bronx Zoo, some animals escape, and they end up chasing the protagonists around with various wacky hijinks ensuing. But, said animals are not lions or tigers or bears (oh my!) but *velociraptors*. And, the characters treat it like any other dangerous zoo animal, and there is nothing indicating that the world of the romcom is otherwise different from the present-day Earth. That would be rather jarring, and it would leave one wondering what velociraptors are doing in the Bronx Zoo and why, for a long time after.

#+begin_quote
  *Heavy AU*: Anything goes, but the burden of making the setting work is now on you.
#+end_quote

On the other hand, if the fic already heavily rewrites the setting, then any additional changes are going to be absorbed in the bigger reimagining. However, it then means that the fic cannot rely on large parts of the reader's knowledge about the canon setting, so it is up to the fic to present a coherent and compelling setting without getting bogged down in exposition. This is far more challenging.

** Plot can diverge as much as the author wants IMO without any issues as long as the story is still rooted in the canon universe. Making changes to the universe on the other hand can make a story feel like a different fandom or none at all rather quickly IMO.

For example, you can write a story where Harry has a completely different Hogwarts experience with no stations of canon beyond Harry going there, or even going to Beauxbaton instead, and that would still be completely fine. But fundamental changes to the world such as Voldemort being the good guy or magic not being there, that's too out there IMO.

*** I think I fall into the same group as you because I think when you start fundermentally changing the character from the ground up I sometimes just wonder why?

​

If you do a Dramione but make Draco a Gryffindor and remove all his racist and bigoted views so hes just an arrogant sod who is in love with himself.....I sort of wonder why not just use Cormac mclaggen

****** He adds nothing because he is Dumbledore's bitch on a leash. He is a thoroughly abusive teacher, but him being out of prison is at Dumbledore's pleasure. What little intelligence he gathered can be sourced elsewhere (eg scar connection, Tonks, Polyjuice, Harry with his cloak) and was not decisive, him bringing the sword can be made redundant if Dumbledore just gives it to Harry or stores it somewhere accessible. Which also makes the "save the DA who tried to steal the sword" arc redundant.

Like, Umbridge is the better abusive teacher and actually an accomplished antagonist, Slughorn is the better potion teacher, you can spy through other means not that it is important in the first place, Malfoy can fit the evil bastard role equally well and he's not constrained by Dumbledore.

But if Snape was not constrained by Dumbledore, he could just murder Harry day one and the series would be over anyway.

** I don't know if you have either read "The Silmarilion", but it's pretty much the proof that you can write an amazing story despite a very convoluted plot.

Of course, as a general rule it's probably better to keep it simple (if only for the sack of the readers), but as long as the everything else is fine (well built world, coherent plot line . . .), the story should still be enjoyable to read.

** I loved Alexandra Quick; it mentioned Voldemort and Harry Potter like twice by name. The important things for an HP fanfic to qualify as an Hp fanfic is to use the basics of the world-building (muggles, wizards, etc), the magic (wands, magical theory is important), and the themes. One of the themes in Harry Potter or at least a commonality is that the plot did not need to be summarized by the author to be understood.

** I hate it when the author creates a set of expectations in the summary and then disregards them.

For example, stating the premise of "what if harry is resorted during his 5th year?" But not also stating "and Slytherin is completely white washed."

** I have basically three thoughts on this.

Firstly, if it's diverging from the canon rules (or reasonable interpretations of them), then it cannot be a fix it fic, so the fic shouldn't act or feel like it's meant to be one. This is my overwhelming impression of HPMOR these days, for example. There are plenty of fics which change a hell of a lot more than HPMOR (which, when it gets down to it, is mostly just a standard indy!Harry, with wards and familial politics), but most of them aren't a sustained attack on Rowling's philosophy. Other clear examples of this are in most cases (at least, that I've read although I avoid these fics) with Dumbledore bashing. No, mate, if you're using a Dementor instead of the canon solution (or if you don't have Harry the horcrux) you have not proven that Dumbledore was wrong all along...

Secondly, with contemporary Muggle AUs (which I think are seen as being the most AU of AUs), as long as you have the feel of the characters right, you're still working with HP fanfic. Ron and Harry should be best friends or, if they haven't met yet, will become best friends as soon as they do meet. Harry should be excessively curious (like, a house husband Harry, not that I've ever met one, should be Petunia but nice). That sort of thing. I suspect most Muggle AU authors stick to canon ships so they tend to get the character dynamics right from the off. It's hard for me to tell, because I pretty much stick to Hinny or next gen so... canon ships is what I read.

Thirdly, it's nice if an AU has a clear concept about what it is. Like, I'm writing... very slowly... a short Azkaban AU. Hopefully that tells you basically everything you need to know about the fic. If I, for some reason, have Harry breeding basilisks in the Chamber of Secrets in Chapter Four (I won't), I would expect a reader to complain about it because... what? But OTOH if I'm reading a fic about Harry's breeding basilisks in the CoS I wouldn't complain if it /became/ an Azkaban fic. When AU elements move further and further away from the original idea, it's just hard to understand what the universe is like. It's less noticeable, of course, the more widespread AU elements are (e.g. familial Wizengamot seats are basically fanon... so to find them in, say, "what if Harry thinks he's an elf?" or "what if Harry was a dragon?" wouldn't be "wut"... although I don't recall the well known fics with those concepts using this element of fanon).

I don't know if I'd actually have a problem with an AU that doesn't follow what I suggest is good practice, but the above seems a reasonable attempt at parameterising what "straying too much" might mean. In short form:

1. fixi it fics adhere closely to canon worldbuilding if not plotting, i.e. the AU is not a fix it fic
2. AUs with radically different worldbuilding adhere more closely to canon characterisation
3. divergent worldbuilding relates back to a core concept introduced early on

*** Mmph I think it's fine to change stuff. I just read two different fics with Harry breeding basilisks ("Serpentine" and "The Venom Peddler") and both were pretty good. HPMOR may have had some canon bashing but let's face it, Rowling didn't have much of a philosophy to attack. The main hate toward it here comes from its Harry being such an annoying character, imho. There are several other fics in the HPMOR universe that don't get hated as much because they don't have that issue as much.

There is a nice FF page (not exactly a story) listing differences between the HPMOR universe and the canon one, and all the differences are pretty reasonable, I thought. It's here: linkffn(11840345).

Not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about when the changes don't relate to the fic concept.

Take my story for example. If it was on ff.net the summary would be something like: /after the Triwizard Tournament, Harry and Ginny were imprisoned in Azkaban. Ten years later, wizarding society has forgotten them. Eventually Hinny./ I call it an AU because obviously this doesn't happen in canon. The concept of this AU is that Harry and Ginny get thrown in Azkaban. Breeding basilisks would be one thing if it was /why/ they were locked up. Breeding basilisks is quite another if they break out of Azkaban and start breeding basilisks. There's a casual connection between the concept (they bread basilisks, it's against the law, therefore they're in prison) one way but not the other (they were in prison, therefore they breed basilisks now... wait, what?).

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

What? Rowling practically hits the reader of the head with it. Death is a necessary part of life and people who are afraid of it are incapable of living. Love redeems. Doing questionable things for the right reasons is a good thing... and those right reasons are strongly suggested to be selfless. There's also another really obvious one that I can't remember right now because I went back to edit one of the earlier sentences in this paragraph.

#+begin_quote
  The main hate toward it here
#+end_quote

I don't care. I'm not trying to describe why other people don't like it: "this is *my* overwhelming impression of HPMOR these days, for example."

HPMOR does this very, very weird thing where it has a diametrically opposed attitude about on of the most fundamental things in what Rowling was saying and while the writing is usually good, it's incredibly hamfisted and obvious about this one specific idea, i.e. that seeking immortality is a good thing and that everyone should be immortal. Now, some people go, "Why is this weird? The whole point of fanfiction is that it /can/ be different?" Exactly. HPMOR is weird because it acts like it's critiquing canon even though it has made changes to make its divergent philosophy fit in better. It doesn't even change that much.

This is exactly the same as a Dumbledore bashing fic that feeds Harry to a Dementor in the hope it eats the Horcrux first. This is not a safer course of action. Hell, we even know this isn't an available option in canon from all the times Dementors do attack Harry.

If you're going to critique canon, the AU needs to be constrained by the same rules as canon. Otherwise it's gone too far. HPMOR is only an HP fanfic for marketing purposes. Like most indy!Harry fics, the "small" changes it make would be unrecognisable as Harry Potter without character descriptions, the odd canon station (like the troll) and character names. It could very easily feature:

- Tom Penny, our half-changeling rationalist hero raised outside the secret society of elf people by his human aunt and uncle but secretly the heir to the Noble House of Tanroth
- Francine Harding, a changeling whose experiences in the world of man have left her obsessed with the pursuit of knowledge
- Rhadon the Fair, the privileged and sycophantic heir heir to the Noble House of Pfing, one of the most prominent conservative Fey families
- D'Reth the Unchanging, an immortality obsessed Dark Elf who was defeated by House Tanroth some fifteen years prior to the start of our story
- Yis Yarling, one of Tom's Elfguides, but behind his contrary and charismatic confidence he hides a dark secret... he is D'Reth the Unchanging and he knows who Tom is
- Jurig fey Thatcher, the elderly and manipulative Elf King who also knows Tom's secret and suspects D'Reth is not as dead as he appears

and no-one would be none the wiser. And because the characters are Elves and the story feature Changelings, no-one would suspect humans are actually muggles and Changelings are muggleborns because Elves hiding away from Men and planting Changelings to be raised as humans are ideas as old as mud.

As I said... the kinds of changes HPMOR makes are not at all out of the ordinary. It's just that unlike most indy!Harry fics, its target is a lot more fundamental than just changing (or even bashing) Dumbledore/canon plot.
