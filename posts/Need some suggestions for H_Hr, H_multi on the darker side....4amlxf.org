Incubus has an acutal cohernt plot although its very loose and just series of smut basically, harry/multi, however not dark harry, just indy harry, he talks everyone into sex no dubCon/NonCon [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1061]]

after chamber of secrets events the piece of voldimorts soul leaks into harrys memories, he decides to have some rapey fun [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1344]]

haven't read this one but it looks promising Twins [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1382]]

harry potter and the panty swap some super rough harry/ginny and harry/hermione and harry/hermione/ginny. He doesnt shy away from slapping them around, degradation etc [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1567]]

#+begin_quote
  I literally causes fisical pain to read that sh*t. Im looking for stories that are mainly wrong bwl with hhr paring. Or some wehere Harry is darker, evil or a crime boss.
#+end_quote

compared to this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/3ea2f4/usaprh_unlocked_tmobile_note_4_32gb_with_2_new/][post]] wich has complete sentences, no misspellings, and even good grammar (better than I'm capable of). It doesn't look like you're the person that posted the earlier ad, in fact I would bet on it.
