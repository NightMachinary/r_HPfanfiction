Hello Everyone!!

I am wanting to start a project, a character zine project. Dedicated to a singular HP character. Lucius Malfoy.

If there is enough interest this will possibly turn into a collection of Character zines for every character in the HP universe. So if you would be so kind as to fill out this survey. I will be able to see what kind of interest I can generate.

I have been asked “What is a Character Zine?”

It's based on a Zine. A Zine is usually a collection of fan art. Now a Character Zine would be more like a magazine or Encyclopedia. Art, Essays, fics all collected in one place to celebrate one character.

Once finished it will be available for download for everyone to enjoy.

I am looking forward to completing this project. I am looking for an interest of 100 people you don't have to take part in the project I just want to know if there would be a demography that would want to read this and the many more that could be created.

Thank you!
