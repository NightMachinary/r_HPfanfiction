Blood protection issues aside, what would it be like if Harry and Lavender were siblings in all but blood? How would their Hogwarts years be affected? Would Harry still become friends with Ron and Hermione?


** The morning after the sorting

" HAAAAARRRRYYYYYY !!!!!!!!!!!!! " It was remarkable how loud Lavender could be despite her small stature even for an eleven year old. Harry jerked out of bed to see his adoptive sister and her four roommates : Parvati Patil,Fay Dunbar,Sally-Anne Perks and Hermione Granger ( who looked overjoyed at the prospect of being part of the group ) standing over his bed.

" Wha ?! " he jerked in surprise .

Lavender and her new " besties " sniggered " We have a job for you " said Parvati.

"Wha ?! " said the ever eloquent Potter

Lavender seemingly pulled a clipboard out of thin air " There are five Muggleborn boys in our year group and two Muggle raised halfblood boys,they have not been added to The Chart yet. "

Harry groaned;The Chart had been Lavender's pet project for the past few months; it contained details on the " datablity " of all the wizarding boys their age . It was however a testament to Lavender's character that the scions of the Malfoys,Notts,Crabbes and Goyles all had solid 0s across the board.

Lavender ploughed on " You're an insider in the secret world of boydom,over the next month,I want you to observe these seven boys and report back ! "

Harry mumbled something incoherent .

Lavender chirped " Atta boy , the Muggleborns are Dean Thomas,Oliver Rivers,Roger Malone,Justin Finch Fletchely and Kevin Entwhistle and the two Halfbloods are Wayne Hopkins and Michael Corner .

Parvati suddenly interjected " Focus on the Claws first ! "

Fay butted in " You should let your sister make her own decisions when it comes to boys "

Parvati snorted " Padma had a crush on Nott for two years,she's completely ignorant "

Lavender took hold again " We shouldn't talk about Padma while she's not here " " Let's go find her ! " Four of the five girls immediately trooped out of the boys dormitory leaving Hermione who wanted to ask Harry a quick question.

" Has Lavender ever had a boyfriend ? "

" Nope "

** Hard to say. If we keep the fanon interpretation of Lavender, it doesn't mean that Harry will become this super chatty and gossip spreading person.

I would hope it would make him less closed off and sullen, but he may still keep overwhelmed by Lavender's larger than life personality. That said, having a supportive family (I would assume this is the case), will make certain things easier for him and would hopefully give him a solid grounding in the magical world.
