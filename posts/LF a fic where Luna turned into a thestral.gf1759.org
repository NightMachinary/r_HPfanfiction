:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
As stated in the title, I'm looking for a fic that's stuck in my mind. It was a scene in the fic where Luna turns into a young thestral in the Forbidden Forest after she died and Harry was sobbing while holding her corpse. I can't remember the general plot or if it was a Harry/Luna fic but only that they were really close because Harry was really devastated when it happened. What I do remember is that it's a fairly long story, so it's not only a oneshot.


** Luna turns into a thestral in Chapter 54.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** It's not Harry/Luna... I think the plot involves Nott meshing with the wars using ghost?
