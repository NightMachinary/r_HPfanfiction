Also how do wizards actually learn languages? Any spells or potions I should know of?


** 1. DUOLINGO MY DUDE. HARRY BUYS A MODERN CELLPHONE IN 199- AND USES DUOLINGO TO LEARN FRANCAIS.
2. GET A FELLOW CANADIAN TO FLY ON OVER AND MY COMRADE WILL GLADLY TEACH HARRY FRENCH AS WELL AS OUR GREAT CANADIAN BRAND OF COMMUNISM.
3. HAVE HARRY WORK FOR DAT SHIT. LEARNING LANGUAGE IS HARD AND BRAIN MAGIC NO FUN!
4. ESTABLISH A FRENCH REGIME OVER MAGICAL BRITAIN THAT MAKES LEARNING FRENCH COMPULSORY.

** My headcanon on the matter is that there's a way (akin to Pensieve magic) to extract someone's knowledge of a language. It can then be drunk as part of a potion to transfer the knowledge to you.

Anyway, there's definitely /something/ in canon, though it may or may not resemble my above ravings. Barty Crouch Sr. couldn't possibly have learned 200 languages the Muggle way, for one thing. And Parselmouths are evidence enough that magically-transmitted knowledge of a language you never learned is definitely within the realm of possibility.

*** On the other hand knowing 200 languages is worth mentioning so its at least unusual and he probably still put a lot of effort in it.

** In addition to what has been suggested before, I have seen someone make it an "eat a candy from WWW and you know this language for that amount of time". And if by your question you mean "how can you (as in the author) do that, find a beta who is good in french.

** Canonically they learn languages just like muggles. Check the fourth book, no one learned to speak French, English, Bolgarian so quickly, or at all. They could learn some phrases or make some awkward, broken conversations about limited topics.

** Legilimency would assist in learning languages, perhaps even tenfold. A month of immersion in the culture surrounded by native speakers would probably do it.

** In the Durmstrang!Harry story I started once, I gave him something called a potion of enhanceability. I figure there's probably multiple ways to cheat, so I just made one up that wasn't too completely rediculous.
