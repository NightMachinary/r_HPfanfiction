Title says it. More I think about Snape in fanfic, more I realize that he isn't a tragic hero but rather an extreme version of incel who never let go of his grudge and took his grudge on kids who had no hands in his abusive past. He grossly discriminated other houses (especially Gryffindor) and favored his house, singled out Harry all the time in classes, refused to punish Malfoy gang when they hexed Hermione's teeth and the worst? psychologically abused Neville. There is no way that Dumbledore didn't know any of this.


** Why does Professor Dumbledore allow Professor Snape to be so nasty to the students (especially to Harry, Hermione, and Neville)? JKR: "Dumbledore believes there are all sorts of lessons in life ... horrible teachers like Snape are one of them!"

*** I think that's appropriate character development by JKR.

Attitudes toward rough treatment in schools have evolved a LOT in the 25 years between the happenings of the HP books and the present. Muggles tend to be ahead of wizards in these things, so that makes the gap greater. Dumbledore was over 100 years old and shaped by his own century-old school experiences, and that makes the gap greater still.

He may have felt that he was being progressive by not allowing Filch to break out the shackles as punishment. He was certainly publicly criticized for being too progressive with some of his ideas, like "hey let's allow for the possibility that Voldemort is back instead of just calling Harry insane" and "maybe we let the werewolf kid get an education."

Dumbledore's view is not limited to Snape. He, and the other teachers, mostly turn blind eyes to things like Harry having to watch 3/4 of the school wear "Potter Stinks" badges. We don't know precisely what happened to Sirius after the werewolf prank, but we certainly know it stopped short of expulsion when it probably shouldn't have. Trelawny tells students they're about to die. Filch threatens corporal punishment. Lockhart leaves students alone in a room with live creatures he doesn't know how to control. Binns doesn't bother to learn his students' names or run his class in such a way that anyone who wants to learn history will have an easy time of it.

Dumbledore's POV as stated by JKR just wasn't that unusual 100 years ago... or 25 years ago.

It makes Dumbledore look deeply flawed to the modern eye. But that goes along with the structure of the books: all four of the greatest forces (Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape, and Harry) are noticeably flawed, though the very young Mr. Power of Love Potter is the least flawed of the quartet by far.

**** Yeah, that's pretty shitty reasoning.

In real life, a principal or school board can't get rid of a bad teacher because they have tenure or are the most qualified credentially or have friends in high places or it might seem like discrimination or they have historically good reviews despite the complaints... etc. It's a big bureaucratic fustercluck to fire a unioned teacher outside of something like a scandal or poor attendance or something extremely gauche.

Everyone knows who the shitty teachers are. Everyone wants them gone. Everyone knows it's sort of a fact of life, but they still do whatever they can to make things bearable and at the very least put some effort into getting a better teacher. Dumbledore /hired/ Snape, knows he's a dick, and just lets him keep doing it.

Umbridge is a better example, but we should really see Dumbledore doing his damndest to get rid of her while the "the system" just keeps her in power.

Snape? Snape is a bad teacher, an asshole, and an adult bully who Dumbledore keeps around because he's good at the things /he/ needs him to do, not the things the students need him to do.

** Dumbledore hired teachers based on his own personal agenda and not because they were a good fit. He needed these people by his side, so he couldn't punish them too much or fire them.

Trelawney was mostly a fraud but Dumbledore didn't want her out in the world unprotected and where he couldn't miss other prophecies. The DADA professors ranged from hapless to dangerous to both.

Snape was actually phenomenally talented in Potions and was probably great in DADA too (and a boon to have someone qualified for multiple positions), but he did not have the temperament for a teacher. He probably wouldn't have chosen teaching as a profession and was trapped in the job by Dumbledore's “second chance”. Dumbledore concentrated more on his agenda and the upcoming war than the antics of those in his employ.

Dumbledore may have taken action against Snape that we don't know about. The books are from Harry's POV, after all.

As a double agent, I can see where a few of his actions may have looked bad on the surface but could have other motives. But some just defy explanation. The teeth comment was just pointlessly cruel.

Any decent headmaster, upon learning that a student's boggart was a professor, should've placed said professor on probation and spoken to students to investigate why. And upon learning of his "teaching" of the Shrinking potion, should've fired that professor's arse.

** What are Dumbledore's reasons for anything?

/It was necessary for the plot./

He knew Grindelwald was a bad egg and sat back for 45 years while Grindy was building a mega-prison and amassing a cult. He knew Riddle was a bad egg and sat back for 35 years while Voldy was committing acts of terror and amassing a cult.

- /FBAWTFT: Crimes of Grindelwald/ gives a retroactive reason, where Dumbledore made a Blood Pact with Grindy to sit on his hands or something.

- Readers retroactively justify Dumbledore's lack of action with him not having any clear proof of Voldemort being a criminal, even if he suspects things, despite his Chief Warlock and untarnished post-Grindy reputation riding high. Which should have allowed him to pull a Crouch and have Riddle arrested extra-judicially, because a man who runs a vigilante organization surely does not care that much about following the books.

Instead of trying to think in pretzels, it's easier just to pull the useful "The Plot Willed It" card. Aka, Author Fiat.

The second-most commonly pulled card is the, "Chill dude, it's a story for children." Aka, the "it doesn't make sense, but that didn't stop you from loving the story at age 12".

As fanfic readers and writers, I think we can admit that the books have flaws. Not as many true plot holes as people think (and "Plot Hole" is used so often that it has lost all meaning these days) but inconsistencies of character, character motivation, and lack of characterization depth, all to serve the overarching plot.

Or we could handwave it all with yet another common card, "The books were written from Harry's PoV, and he is not observant, and also limited in perspective and naturally biased".

Agree about him being an Incel! I always hated how fans were like oh he loved Lily, so feel sorry for him.

The woman you love dies and you literally torment her son and hate him because he happens to look like his father? You're cruel to the muggleborn girl and are the thing one innocent child fears the most. That's...not a good thing. From what we know, Lily was this amazing, understanding person. Neville is probably someone that she would've defended/protected.

I've seen people make excuses for Snape's treatment of Neville, saying it's because Neville could've been the chosen one but instead it was Harry, so Snape lost Lily. That's...absolutely demonic.

By competent I mean a man who definitely knew potions and magic in general. Like you never encountered teachers that were just plain mean. I had plenty of teachers who should never teach in the first place, by student standards that is, but by virtue of tenure, connections and just real life issues they were still teaching.

** Unpopular opinion time, and I predict this comment's going to be voted down into the negatives, but... OVERALL I don't think Snape was so horrible as all that, or at least that he wouldn't have come across as that bad to Dumbledore.

Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm not a Snape apologist. He wasn't a good teacher. He played favourites, he seemed to prefer insulting his students for not already knowing the subject rather than, you know, actually TEACHING it, and he let personal likes and disliked get in the way of his job. And, he had a great talent for making students fear him, just by being unpleasant. If I had been stuck with him as a teacher I would have HATED school.

But the thing is... I think we need to see Snape and Dumbledore in context. Hogwarts isn't a modern 21st-century American school in the day and age of bullying awareness. It's a wizard equivalent of British boarding schools from the early parts of the 20th century, especially as seen in literature. Back in the day when teachers could and did administer corporeal punishments and nobody raised an eyebrow.

If you've read Roald Dahl's memoirs of his own school days, and his description of how stern teachers and sadistic prefects would beat the students with a cane, and hound them so much that they ended up physically throwing up... then Snape's insults doesn't really come across as so bad in comparison.

There are certainly hints in the books that severe corporeal punishments happened at Hogwarts as late as when Arthur and Molly went to school... and of course Dumbledore went to school in the 1800s. When he was a kid, teachers beating on students would have been the norm. Since it's clear that this does not happen in the modern Hogwarts, it's pretty evident that Dumbledore's reign as Headmaster did see some changes and forbade teachers from physically diciplining students. Given the general old-fashioned standards of the wizarding world, Dumbledore actually comes across as downright progressive here.

So, compare this to Snape. And... I think you actually have to sit through his class as a student to get why he's bad, because if you look at his lessons from the OUTSIDE, they don't come across as so horrible. He never laid a hand on any of the students, after all... in fact, with two exceptions (which I will get back to), he never actually overstepped a line that he couldn't easily justify to Dumbledore. He could easily just say "yes, I'm strict, but Potions is a dangerous subject and the students goof off and get careless. It's better that they fear me than that they get careless and seriously hurting themselves."

And the students don't really have a leg to stand on there. We know Potions can be dangerous and need to be treated with respect, so "he got angry when I made a mistake and took away house points when I didn't know the answer to his questions" doesn't even seem that unreasonable for a teacher. Even "he Vanished my potion and failed me" could be defended simply by Snape saying that the potion wasn't up to speed and he needed to get rid of it before some unintentional reaction happened.

I think you have to actually have been Snape's student to understand. We as readers understand because we experience the lessons from the students POV... but Dumbledore does not have that luxury. He knows Snape isn't a popular teacher, and he knows the man is surly and unpleasant to be around... but that's not to say he understands the extent of Snape's attitude, or what it's like to be a powerless and weak student in Snape's class.

That said... there are two instances where Snape does cross the line.

The first one is one of the instances the OP mentioned; not punishing Malfoy for growing Hermione's teeth... or rather, the reason he crosses the line is because he looks at Hermione and says "I see no difference." THAT is BLATANTLY going too far,

The other time he steps over the line is MUCH worse though. It's in the third book where he makes Neville feed his potion to Trevor the toad, very clearly expecting the potion to be bad. He's essentially, DELIBERATELY forcing a student to POISON his OWN PET. And then when the potion turns out not to be bad at all, and Trevor is just fine, Snape sulks, takes points off from Gryffindor because "I told you not to help him, Miss Granger." He's so butthurt about not having poisoned Trevor that he goes up to Lupin afterwards and in front of everyone talks trash about what an awful student Neville is.

I don't know if any of these instances were actually reported to Dumbledore, though I have a sneaking suspicion they weren't. The students already knew Snape was terrible and as far as they knew he could do as he wanted, so why even bother making a complaint?

*** I'm going to suggest a third which I think people forget about.

Harry's first potions class. Neville ruins his potion and gets covered in it, causing boils to rapidly form and then pop on his arms, legs and face (as well as god knows where else). Snape takes the time to berate him for doing something wrong before sending him with Seamus up to the hospital wing.

Neville is moaning and whimpering in pain. Both Neville and Seamus have been in the castle for less than a week and probably don't know where the hospital wing is.

That's an eleven year old child who is having a severe and painful reaction and Snape makes him walk through the entire castle with only another eleven year old for company. If Neville had inhaled or swallowed some of the potion and boils started forming internally, what exactly is Seamus going to be able to do?

By contrast a week later when Neville breaks his wrist in flying class, Hooch takes him personally to the Hospital Wing.

**** Hmmm... No, I don't agree that this is an instance of Snape crossing the line. It doesn't reflect WELL on him, certainly, but unlike my two examples this COULD be interpreted as Snape actually trying to do his job responsibly.

After all, the berating is as I said earlier, something that Snape could justify by saying "potions are dangerous and I am not doing the students any favours by mollycoddling them; it's important that they know exactly what they did wrong." And he did let Neville go to the hospital wing -- Neville is clearly able to walk, so the damage can't have been THAT great, and Snape even sends Seamus along to make sure he got to the hospital wing okay. If Neville and Seamus didn't know where the hospital wing was after a week at school, that wasn't Snape's fault.

Could Snape have done better here? Yes, SHOULD he have done better? Probably. But was this an inexcusable and indefensible moment? I don't think it was.

The two other example is Snape being actively malicious and deiberately out to hurt, even completely unprovoked. That's not what's happening here.

He works on a big scale, qnd generally has bigger things to worry about. Campaigning for free treatment and raging at the smallest of injustices is a much more Hermione-esqe thing.
