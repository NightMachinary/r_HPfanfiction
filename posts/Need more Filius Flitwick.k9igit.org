He doesn't have to be a main character, he can be minor, side or background. Just want him used more than in canon.

Anyone can be the main character/any site/any length/old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes etc doesn't have to focus on pairings

Would rather NOT have Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame/fortune cliche. No Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc.

As happy as I am to see this disclaimer on more and more Requests, it (un)fortunately cuts down on a good amount of recs since a lot of the fics were written 5+ years ago when Weasley-bashing was all the rage. That and you'll get smartasses like [[/u/blackheart0810][u/blackheart0810]] who will rec bash-fics anyway because they think it's "deserved".

*** My apologies.... I wasn't trying to be a smartass.... I was posting a great fic that I believed others would enjoy.... the only Weasley that get truly bashed is Ron and by the end of the fic Harry and Ron are on even terms

You have to read pretty far to get to Flitwick, and he's only in a couple of scenes, but I do really enjoy writing about him.

** Linkao3(According to his own nature by CallMeSalticidea) has Flitwick mentoring a Gryffindor!Riddle that is still very much on the path to becoming Voldemort. Great explorations of dueling, Flitwick's perspective as a part-Goblin wizard, and magical theory. Could probably be read standalone, but might make more sense if you read the second fic in the series first.

#+end_quote

Meaning the author contrived situations to make it deserved. It's about as cringe-worthy as every other bash-heavy Harry-is-a-super-badass fic out there.

I thought it was pretty trashy, but I did still read all 700k words of it.

  What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.
