I know that most people writing fanfiction either don't have kids or aren't teachers, but I have seen so many fanfics where the author describes a 1 year old child running. Clumsily or not, no child is running at 1 year old. Children generally start running at 3.5 - 4 years, and that's not coordinated. Kinda like a penguins waddle tbh. Baby Harry might start walking between 9 and 15 months, but that is short distance assisted walking, like holding something to keep themselves upright. I'm sorry, but people need to fact check before they publish a story, the same as checking spelling and grammar. Get a friend to read it to make sure your they're/there/their is correct, because a spelling checker might say so, but it's the wrong use of the word sometimes.


** My kid started running at 2.5. like a penguin yeah, but still.

*** My point is I just read another fanfic where baby harry, at less than 18 months old, was running around a pool after 7 year old Tonks. First off, 7 year old Tonks would be in the pool if she tried to run around it, second, who lets a toddler run around a pool, third, no child at 18 months can run. At all. I am studying child development for a bachelor of Education, and I can say any child that can run at that age is a super sayan

***** Oh certainly, but I would say an uneven sprint is even pushing the limits of believability for people with kids or who work with kids. At 2, yeah, I'd say they could probably start running , but not with much confidence. Edit: grammar

****** Ok, I know this is an exception of all exceptions, but a friend of mine has a kid who is now a professional athlete. He was running at a year and a half, according to them. They have videos, too. It's kind of hard to tell his age in the videos, but I'd definitely say he looks under two. It was unsteady and yeah, not clean, but he was definitely running in the video.

Again, I know a professional athlete is not a good measuring stick, but still....

** The average child can run at 1.5 years old. [[https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/pdf/checklists/Checklists-with-Tips_Reader_508.pdf]]

Sure, it may be more of a waddle, but I doubt a fic author using "run" is using the word to describe an olympic sprint.

Also, people generally stop swimming in frigid oceans far before 115. I don't think it's implausible that a baby wizard could run even earlier than 1 because of their physiologies or do so through accidental magic, especially since the age at which children hit developmental milestones varies /greatly/ in the real world.

**** There's a clear theme of wizards being able to do things unusual at a certain age. Dumbledore can swim with a withered hand on a frigid ocean at 115, Griselda marchbanks can run, and Harry takes a cannonball at over 150 miles an hour plus and survives. Babies do run at 1.5 years old, I would not consider it odd that a wizard baby, belonging to a group that does the exceptional, would run before a muggle child.

Also:

#+begin_quote
  At last, lying face down on the floor he spotted what looked like a torn piece of paper under the chest of drawers. When he pulled it out, it proved to be most of the photograph Lily had described in her letter. A black-haired baby was zooming in and out of the picture on a tiny broom, roaring with laughter, and a pair of legs that must have belonged to James were chasing after him. Harry tucked the photograph into his pocket with Lily's letter and continued to look for the second sheet.

***** Fair enough but not conclusive evidence. Dumbledore and Griselda are old age endurance not early development. Cannonball is accidental magic, nothing physical. The broom is your best example but still, he could just be sitting on the broom without doing nothing else, like a father following a toddler on an electric toy car.

The thing is, if wizards developed earlier to a noticeable state, that would be a risk to the statute of secrecy through muggleborns

****** The bludger accident is mostly certainly not accidental magic. That occurs in 6th year, far past the point at which accidental magic happens. No accidental magic is mentioned in that scene. Harry still gets a cracked skull and fall. Incidentally, he survives falling with a cracked skull. Additional evidence is that Newt states muggles have different physiologies and gives Jacob a helmet. Fantastic beasts is written by JKR. A car crash is no threat to a trained wizard.

Would you let a toddler ride a bicycle with no training wheels?

It would hardly be noticeable. The sheer amount of misinformation in this post about child development is staggering, to say the least of the general public who could care less about a random child.

And again, babies do run at 1.5 years old. It is entirely fair to say that a one-year-old can run.

*** The Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) associates crawling on all fours with early onset of independent walking, however independent walking is commonly defined as a minimum of 5 unaided steps. Regionally collected data in Norway shows that by 13 months, only 50% of children /start/ to walk, and by 14 months 75% started. [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378378213000960?casa_token=wHYr-Zh3PAUAAAAA:SkgWbGSnyaB_dEko661-kgFSxiAMf_lqV_Qy0roUP0HYr8U1nqN74N6nN275EYug2G3NDjMaxuY]] Now I realise that there are some children who start earlier than others, but there has been nothing in canon that states that wizarding children advance at an earlier age, only that magical people live longer. At 18 months, or 1.5 years, an average child will not likely start running. Children of that age may run with an assistant, either one of those toy cars with no bottom that the child stands inside, or an adults hand. The fanfiction in question of my earlier statement implied that Harry was capable of running on his own. If it were me, I might have said that Harry waddled after Tonks, or something else along the same line of thought. I'm all for an AU where wizards and witches are tougher or more advanced than regular people, but if it isn't shown, I'm going to assume poor research.

**** That's actually an indication of a fascinating psychological phenomenon. You'll probably learn about it when your psychology class covers infant development. Culture informs the age at which babies develop. For example, a culture that heavily prioritizes child self-sufficiency will start conditioning the baby to walk from a young age. Note that this does not mean that babies in countries that do not have such a focus are not prevented from doing so as a result of a physical reason, they merely do not learn how.

I've detailed elsewhere why it would not be unusual for a wizard baby to walk/run a little earlier. Harry's straight up flying at 1. In any event, they are probably capable of doing so at 1.5 when normal babies have the capability to do so.

I'd also note that although it was probably accurate in this case, citing a single study to contradict the standards used by a very large population, based on data integrated from many studies, is usually not a good idea.

I mean, the very fact that they showed a baby wizard running around at an abnormally young age should be enough, no? Or do you want them to explicitly state that wizarding children develop quicker than their Muggle counterparts and interrupt the flow of the story to do that?

** I see that you mentioned studying child development for a degree and thought I'd say that helpful tips from your background specialty will always be a helpful resource for other writers! I have the same experience with the areas I'm studying at uni and a lot of the time people are far off the mark when it comes, for example, to legal procedure in a UK context. No crashing of gavels and “objection!!” would be tolerated in any courts of Britain, even magical ones. The very idea makes me cringe haha.

I'd encourage you to go easy on people messing up in your area of expertise, just because we don't have the same knowledge - in fact, you're in a good position to make a post or two educating us and making us as writers stronger for it. I checked and there isn't a good one that's specific to hpfanfic - I'd love to hear your thoughts on hypothetical development of accidental magic and how that might map onto child development for example 😊 that would be so cool.

Lots of fanfic writers are writing on stuff we have no clue about and it can be a baptism by fire. I'm still in the early stages sinking my teeth into writing fanfic and developing confidence, and I'm sure if I didn't see this post I'd have messed up this point. It's a long journey and most people will stumble on stuff like this from time to time.

*** I'd say that accidental magic would be a very tricky subject to work on, especially considering the understanding that children have. If a child is not capable of properly communicating with others, they get upset. It might be too hot at night, so they want the blanket off, but they want the weight of the blanket, so they cry. How does magic develop? Is it a core that grows with age or is it a skill/muscle that is developed? Now combine them. A child who does not have the cognitive development required to know the consequences of actions and lots of power can do virtually anything with little control. I'm amazed that muggleborn households stay in one piece before Hogwarts.

** It is very different for each children. Our Annie went to wake us up walking when she was just slightly under one year of age (on the Christmas Day morning, even!). It is really difficult to make broad generalization about babies. I don't think there is any reason to believe small Harry couldn't wake up in the middle of the night and walk (keeping balance by holding on fences, if necessary) through Little Whinging.

Oh sorry, I missed you point. You were saying about running, not walking. Yes, that is a nonsense.
