As the title indicates, I'm looking for fics that include more diversity than just white British people! It doesn't have to be the main point of the story at all, just present. Example stories that qualify off the top of my head include Rebuilding by Colubrina and Because Why Not by starspangledpumpkin, but really, anything where there are notes of other cultures besides the core white British one is acceptable. No restrictions on ship, genre, or anything else as long as it's got some diversity. Thanks folks!


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/tamilprongspotter/pseuds/tamilprongspotter][tamilprongspotter]] has lots of fics with Indian James and/or Harry. In particular I like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4689149][hold on to my heart]] linkao3(4689149) - James/Lily, Muggle AU.

  The man holds his hand out, and Lily shakes it. “I'm James Potter. And don't worry, the food's safe.”“I'm Lily Evans.” She says, taking one of the dumplings off the tray and popping it in her mouth. They taste of coconut and sugar, and they're really quite good. “Have you got a recipe for those?”

" In the modern-day wizarding world, two half-blood wizards attended Durmstrang with hopes of bringing change and justice to all students regardless of blood status. They seemed inseparable until tragedy struck, leading to them departing ways. While one withdrew to the shadows, the other boy continued the rebellion against the pure-blood hierarchy. "

Since I am a Swedish person I thought it would be fun to write a story that Swedish wizards and witches could attend and in canon that would be Durmstrang. This story follows the current canon very closely and incorporates features from both books, movies, and Pottermore.

** In my story "Patron", there are distinct cultures in the Wizarding World. Of the places that are visited in the story, Wizarding France has different customs and rules than Britain, or Bulgaria, or the Ottoman Empire, Jamaica is different from Scandinavia, and even in Britain, there are subcultures different from the mainstream culture.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** "To all the wizards I've considered before" follows the same premise of "To all the Boys I've loved before," but set in HBP. Race issues get mentioned a couple of times in it. Also features a Black!Hermione. I enjoyed it, though I've never read "To all the Boys" so I can't tell how much it's deviating from the non-HP source material.

linkao3(17777138)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17777138/chapters/41946050]]

The Autumn Swan features a Cho/Harry pairing where Cho's parents run a Chinese restaurant chain that's popular in both the muggle and magical worlds. Elements of Chinese and Chinese-British culture are present.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7869320/1/]])

The following fics have a significant non-British element:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) has a story where the majority of the plot takes place outside of the UK.

linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) takes place entirely in the US.

  Lists had never failed Hermione before. So when her feelings for Ron get out of hand, it's only natural for her to write a list to clear her mind. She would come up with a list of boys most objectively compatible with her, detail the reasons why, and choose someone from the list to serve as a distraction. Of course, she never dreamed that her notes would all magically get sent out. (Inspired by To All The Boys I've Loved Before)
