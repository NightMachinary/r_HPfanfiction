In canon we had Peter Pettigrew and Barty Crouch Jr. who were believed to be dead.

There are many stories were Regulus is alive, many of them are good. I also know a couple of fics were Fabian and or Gideon were alive, they are okay.

Requirements:

▪Status: completed or regularly updated. ▪Length: over 80 000 words. ▪Style: well written with no or almost no spelling mistakes.

▪Main character: As long as the "believed to be dead chara" plays an important role, I have no preferences. ▪Pairing: I don't care. ▪Genre: Not important.

Not a must, but I would prefer if neither the summary nor the tags tell which character is believed to be dead but is alive.

Thank you in advance for any recommendations ✌


** linkffn(I won't just survive(no you will see me thrive)) is one of my favorites, but it is slightly under the length requirement- Its 77000 words. I highly doubt you will regret reading it though

  When he'd seen Evan go flying off her feet, Lem had been sure he'd killed her. The chaos had stunned him, but Evan had been by his side, elbow brushing against his where her own captor had clutched her, and so it had been impossible for him not to see her as her feet left the ground, as she went horribly limp, as she struck the ground and didn't get back up.

** That happens in linkffn(Innocent); someone who canon says was killed in the first war turns out to have just had amnesia from the attack and spent a while recovering. First four books are complete, fifth is actively updating.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
