I was wondering what do you think a universe with no Snape be like?

Would James and Lily like they are? Who would be a spy for the Order? What would the Death Eaters be like? What would happen to Harry?


** I don't think Snape presence played that much of a role in James and Lily's relation. James was still an arrogant idiot even when he was not fighting with him, and Sirius mentioned that she only accepted to go out with him when he "grew up". Without Snape, there may be some minor changes into their relations (being together a few months early or late) but I doubt it would change much. Then again, it's up to the Author to decide.

Concerning the Prophecy, it would obviously mean that nobody is present to hear Trewalney, and that Voldemort does not specifically target the Potters and the Longbottoms. Which is probably a bad thing.

We know that, before losing his body when he attacked the Potters, Voldemort had a clear advantage during the war, and the Ministry was barely holding up, forced to result to violence. Without Snape, he may not attack the Potter and just "win" the war. Or maybe the war evolved differently, like the Ministry falling but a part of the country holding up by gathering somewhere else like Hogwarts (once again, author).

If I had to guess, the Order would have no spy in this universe. Snape only joined for personnal reasons, and I can't think of any Death Eater who would have the motivations (or means) to do the same. For the Death Eater, there would still be Peter.

In Fact, Peter may even become responsible for the attack. Depending of how the author treat it, Dumbledore may still share the content of the Prophecy with the concerned families (Potters and Longbottoms), or maybe just the fact that there is a Prophecy. As a friend, Peter may be told about it or just notice that the Poters are acting strangely and relay the information to Voldemort, who could still decide to attack "just in case".

​

Anyways, Snape abscence would change so many things that it's completely up to the Author to decide. One can justify anything with such a prompt, from Voldemort's early victory to Harry never being born.

** James and Lily could potentially get together earlier if he wasn't bullying her best friend.

Another potential fork on the road is regarding the prophecy. But there are too many unknowns to have one definitive path.

Was there any other Death Eater in the Hogs Head to relay part of the prophecy to Voldemort instead of Snape or did he get to know about it from his spy in the order - Peter Pettigrew? As it's a self-fulfilling one, someone has to do it, or there should be no prophecy. Or the prophecy in this case is not self-fulfilling, could mean something different or be worded differently.

If there is no prophecy or Voldemort doesn't know about it - Voldemort wins and Harry grows up with his parents under a new regime. Harry is not a horcrux in this case.

If there is a prophecy, then either another Death Eater in Hogs Head should replace Snape, or Wormtail could have told Voldemort about it, probably not word-for-word, Potters most likely told him about existence of the prophecy where Harry has the power to defeat the Dark Lord before asking to become the Secret Keeper. Or, maybe, after winning, Voldemort could get his hands on the prophecy orb on the Department of Mysteries (when did Dumbledore file it?) and know exactly what it says and go after the Potter later than in canon.

But Voldemort knowing about the prophecy may not be the only condition for it to exist. One of the theories why the Killing curse didn't work on Harry, supported by Deathly Hallows, when Harry "dies" for those in the battle of Hogwarts, is because Snape asked to spare Lily, Voldemort gave her a chance to step aside, but she chose to die for Harry instead. If this is true, then Voldemort would either just kill Harry and win or there would be no prophecy, because then Harry wouldn't exactly fit it, but that's depending on how you look at it. Or that explanation why Harry survived is not true, and it was all due to, for example, Voldemort's unstable soul crumbling when he tried to aim Avada on an infant, and it didn't actually hit Harry. Then someone asking to spare Lily is not relevant. I don't see anyone else but Snape who could do it, not even Wormtail.

Neville would grow up with his parents too if there's no prophecy.

If there is a prophecy, but it's not self-fulfilling and means different things than in canon, and Voldemort doesn't find out about it. Then Harry grows up with his parents (or just his father if things get really bad for Lily as a muggleborn), and could oppose Voldemort on his own after leaving Hogwarts. This would look very different to canon.

Either Slughorn or entirely new person as Hogwarts Potions professor and Slytherin Head of House.

No one would be a spy for the Order in the Death Eaters inner circle.

If Voldemort gets rendered to a spirit like in canon, without Snape doing the countercurse, Harry would fall off his broom on his first quidditch match, would spend time in hospital wing, but would recover. Hermione could notice that Quirrel's the only one concentrating on the broom while it's cursed or maybe not, if it happens too fast without Snape's countercurse. Wormtail would probably still escape to Voldemort during confrontation at the end of PoA. Dumbledore would probably either die faster due to the withering curse on the horcrux ring, or find someone else to slow it down. If Dumbledore dies instantly - McGonagall as Headmistress for year 6. And if Dumbledore didn't tell anyone about the horcruxes - Voldemort wins. If he lives, Dumbledore would have to find another way to tell Harry about being a horcrux instead of doing it through Snape. No Half-blood Prince book, no Sectusempra at Draco by Harry, and most likely Hermione, not Harry, wins the luck potion. Or it could be Draco, then I don't know, Dumbledore dies earlier? Or would this be not lucky for Draco? Narcissa would ask someone else to help Draco kill Dumbledore, or would she have anyone else? Without a Death Eater at Hogwarts, maybe she tries to help him herself, and Bellatrix is the one to fire the killing curse at Dumbledore, if he lives that long. A random Death Eater who previously not taught at Hogwarts as a headmaster in year 7. Life at Hogwarts would be even more difficult that year. Without Snape sending them the sword, Harry, Ron and Hermione would have to keep the locket and cup with them until they reach Hogwarts and destroy them there with the Basilisk fang. If Bellatrix or Draco are the ones to kill Dumbledore, then they would be killed by Voldemort to get the Elder Wand to work. It wouldn't work, even if it's Draco, because by that point it would already be Harry's. No other differences I can think off, besides the order not being able to prevent raids that Snape warned them about without a spy, or what he helped the order with.

** Post-Hogwarts:

- Snape was at the Hog's Head to overhear the prophecy because Voldemort had him spying on Dumbledore. Presumably, a different Death Eater would have been given this task in Snape's absence so the prophecy would still be overheard and given to Voldemort
- Voldemort would still choose Harry as the one to go after, but without Snape to go to Dumbledore, tell him that Voldemort was definitely after the Potters, and begin spying for the Order, the Potters may not go under the Fidelius Charm.
- Voldemort would go to kill the Potters, which would be easier if they hadn‘t used the Fidelius because they didn't get the warning from Dumbledore/Snape. Without Snape to beg Voldemort to spare Lily, Voldemort would kill her outright. Without Lily sacrificing her life, Harry wouldn't be protected and would die, too.
- For good measure, Voldemort may go kill the Longbottoms as well.
- Voldemort continues his takeover and wins. From the sound of it, he had the upper hand in the First War already and without Harry to stop him, I think he would have been successful. It's not like it was all that difficult for him to take over the Ministry the second time. The only catch is that he‘d need to kill Dumbledore to get Hogwarts, but that's not impossible.
