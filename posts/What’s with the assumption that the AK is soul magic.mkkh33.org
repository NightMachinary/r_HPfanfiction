The Killing Curse, with the exception of the single time in the forest with the scar horcrux, specifically targets bodily death. Furthermore, as shown with dementors kiss, a body doesn't need a soul to live. I mean, I get it's to make it more evil or whatever, but it's much more sensible to think it's just some spell a dude developed to kill cows painlessly and just happens to work on humans too, so as not to blame a spell for the deeds of a man.


** I think it's because Voldemort described the rebounding killing curse as striking him and “ripping his soul from his body.” I guess that's kind of inconsistent with dementors but maybe it's because the dementor slowly sucks the soul out whereas the killing curse is sudden and the soul being ripped from the body is such a shock that it kills the being.

The avada kevada wiki says that it does seem that you need genuine intent and willingness to murder to cast it- Draco knew couldn't kill Dumbledore because he didn't have the required hate and apparently Snape said that you need both “nerve and ability” to cast the Unforgivable curses.

IMO that's just because Voldemort has Horcruxes keeping his soul tied down.

** I always liked the idea, partly because it explains why the three unforgivables are the only spells that are apparently unblockable, they use completely different magical principles, like house elf magic. Also the whole 'extract horcrux edge of death dream sequence' thing in book 7 suggests that it does a bit more than just shuts down the body.

Finally you say that the Kiss disproves this, but does it? Presumably there is more than one way to remove a 'soul' that could have different effects, even if you use the exact same definition of 'soul'. Also, just because Harry is told that the Dementor's kiss removes the soul doesn't mean that that is literally what happens. Even if the person who is telling Harry this has an in depth understanding of the mechanics of exactly how Dementors work (which given how bad wizards are at dealing with them, I don't think anyone has), they are just going to give a 'good enough' explanation to a schoolboy with no grounding in advanced magical theory.

********** I feel that's some metaphysical malarkey dumbledore made up to explain to harry. I'm sure he wasn't the only kid to have a parent try to protect him before being murdered with an Ak, so him surviving while no one else does isn't because of love, it's because of something else and the prophecy being a type of self fulfilling power on it's own. It can be argued that love is a power all on its own, it can allow people do do things they normally wouldn't, it can bring people together, etc... But it certainly can't stop people being killed obviously. So unless love is some type of old magics like Aslan coming back in the witch and the wardrobe when the stone table is broken, it seems like a very superficial explanation to placate the curiosity of a young wizard.

*** Because JKR writes for Rule of Cool. That's pretty much the answer to 90% of questions about why spells work the way they do or why the world works the way it does. Rowling didn't write a fantasy series with rich worldbuilding; she wrote a series about a kid at a boarding school that happened to include magic.

Got a spell that kills without leaving a trace? Make it do something cool when it misses. Need to make Voldie's resurrection creepier? Make it a ritual when we've never had any indication that rituals exist or any idea about the rules behind them. Want a way to make a 14-17-year old kid able to stand against one of the most powerful and evil wizards of the last couple centuries? Let's introduce this weird wandlore idea that's had no effect on literally anything to this point.

Overall, her worldbuilding sucks, and that has an effect on everything. Spells don't make sense, society doesn't make sense, even the currency doesn't make sense.

*** Because it's magic? Maybe its one of those things that doesn't have a full explanation because it is magic.

One explanation could be that the magic in the avada kedavra spell has to do something, and upon failing the energy in the spell has to do something and since it can't find a soul it just explodes. Why does this do this when other spells may not? It could be the emotional involvement required or it could just be because its magic and thats just what the spell does.

** One of the important factors with the Killing curse is that it it at least seems to be fundamentally irreversible. Someone hit with an AK could theoretically be put on life support but they'd never recover.

If an AK doesn't somehow interfere with the 'soul', then someone hit with it could be revived. If all it did was stop the heart, then as long as brain function still exists, a person could be revived.

Some fics have that actually be the case, and it's just wizarding ignorance that considers death to be when the heart stops instead of when brain function ceases, and have seen more than one fic where basic resuscitation techniques were used to revive someone hit with the AK.

That's not to say there are ways around this without dipping into soul magics, it's just that that option is an easy one.

** People just saw that it kills without leaving any recognizable cause of death, and assumed that meant that it removes the soul from the body. The fact that the horcrux in Harry's scar was also removed by the Killing Curse also adds some credence to the idea. But as you rightly pointed out, the Dementor's Kiss does disprove it. But since when have people let facts and logic get in the way of an idea they like?

(And to be fair, the Killing Curse /does/ remove the soul from the body...in the same way that a knife does.)

** Because it's assumed to break apart the soul. Killing in general seems to do that (as example the Bloody Baron has to carry the chains even as a ghost as punishment for his crime) but the Killing Curse which seems to be designed only for the purpose of killing someone must take a toll one way or another on the caster as well. That's why it's not the go-to curse for most of the Death Eaters (as shown in the Battle of the DoM). Only Voldemort who thinks of himself as immortal uses it without hesitation.
