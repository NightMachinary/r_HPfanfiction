Examples include male pregnancy, slash with death eaters/Voldemort, Lordships, Harem fics, Marriage Laws, and white-washing death eaters. State your opinion. Free speech is encouraged, but civility, good grammar, spelling, and proper citations are important.


** Probabilistically speaking, you're right that I've rarely seen good fics using those premises (though if the sheer idea doesn't infuriate you, which I admit it /might/, I've seen some /decent/ stories using magical Lordships, provided Harry doesn't have ten of them).

That being said, I don't think any of these ideas are unworkable, they'd just take a lot more care and talent to be done right.

For example:

- "Male pregnancy" as a random way to pepper up a slash-fic? Rubbish. But if we take the idea that potions enabling it exist in the Wizarding World, there's a great worldbuilding opportunity of writing how alien a culture where women and men are equally qualified to bear children would be --- that would actually be a wonderfully simple explanation of why the Wizarding World is devoid of sexism, and how it affects gender roles in general would be an interesting thing to explore.
- Provided both participants are adults, a romantic relationship between one of the good-guys and one of the enemy is a classic storytelling trick; slightly hackneyed, I suppose, but aren't they all? If it's a believable romance, and not used as an excuse to suddenly absolve the Death Eater participant of all their crimes, it could be a pretty poignant source of drama. People /do/ fall in love with murders, and sometimes it's sincerely reciprocated, and that doesn't stop the fact that the murderer is a murderer, and it's obviously an unhealthy relationship but ergo also an interesting one.
- As I said I think there /are/ okay Lordship stories, but at any rate, writing the Wizarding World as an avowed oligarchy with an arrogant nobility, although it flies against canon, can easily be the stepping stone of some high-quality worldbuilding. The resulting culture isn't canon Wizarding Britain, but it seems like a pretty interesting AU. As for giving Harry a Lordship... it's a more delicate matter, but you can play it for drama as "the li'l guy standing up for the poor and Muggle-born suddenly finds himself revealed as part of the aristocracy; will this corrupt him? and regardless of whether it does, how do Hermione and Ron feel about him accepting the unfair privileges due his birth, forsaking his erstwhile moral opposition to such privileges?", or you can play it as a /Mr Smith Goes to the Senate/-esque moral comedy of "an idealistic kid who genuinely cares about the poor is catapulted into the grimy privileged world of grown-up politics".
- Harem fics are perhaps the hardest trope to get right, but it's not as though polyamorous people don't exist in real life. It would seem disrespectful to them, I think, to act as though a story about a polyamorous romance would by definition have to be rubbish. By the same token, though, I think the best shot at having a harem-fic be good would be to have it written by an actual poly person with experience of how such relationships work in real life, as opposed to heterosexual writers fantasizing about having a lot of obedient females to pick from.
- It might seem disrespectful in light of canon, and it requires heavy rewriting of Death Eater ideology that goes beyond "but pureblood culture is dying because of all the +immigrants+ muggleborns!...", but there's surely a terrific story to be had in Harry spending his early years believing Voldemort and the Death Eaters were the bad guys and the Order unambiguously the good guys, only to realize the Death Eaters were the heroic revolutionaries all along, not just moustache-twirling would-be-world-conquerors as Dumbledore would have had him believe.

*** I disagree. I say any story that contains these tropes and happens to be good succeeds in spite of said trope, not because of it.

Like White-Washing death eaters and relationships with them. I know Rowling left him out of prison after book 7, but Lucius Malfoy facilitated the possession of a schoolgirl by Voldemort and the unleashing of a basilisk on school children. Fics with a suddenly good Malfoy have him still try killing said students... On a similar topic, male pregnancy is done as an excuse for explicit slash scenes and a bit of drama.

You can't do a lot with personality before the character is just an OC with a canon name.

If it is at Hogwarts and Harry is underage, then the lordship story is trash. If he's an adult politicking, then that story has potential. But even then, people abuse it.

Harem fics are all bad. That many characters divides up the plot-driving characters to a ridiculous degree and are pretty much an excuse for explicit scenes. You're right that polyamorous people exist, but do any fics really exist with that? I suppose linkffn(Faery Heroes) counts, but it still has its issues.

Could you write a good fic with these tropes? Possibly. Does it happen? Not really.

** Thinking about it, I don't think these topics encourage bad fics, I think bad fics are attracted to these topics.

If someone says "As a non-religious, more tradition-bound society somehow with less historical sexism, they could have an interesting interaction with polygamy. Let's explore that", I see that having lots of potential.

The common "I want my wish furfillment character to get all the girls I find attractive. Hey, it is a different society I can make any rules I want" is almost always gonna be bad.

Or if someone says "magic could enable things impossible in the real world, like male pregnancy. What would this mean for relationships/fertility/etc in the world" has potential.

The more common "putting my favorite slash characters through a trial. Ohh, I can use male pregnancy" doesn't. Or at least, it is going to stand based on how the characters handle the trials, rather than the trials themselves.

** I think whitewashing death eaters can work both at the individual and group level (of course assuming you make some changes, in canon they're saturday morning cartoon type of villains), but I do agree that it's hard to pull off.

The main issue is that whitewashing authors don't seem to quite understand the concept of anti-hero, so they try to make their characters snarky and edgy but otherwise squeaky clean. It doesn't work that way.

** Male pregnancy: Yeah, that one I don't get. I mean, it's more likely that someone would use magic to change genders for a year so, long enough to get pregnant, go through pregnancy, and heal. Pregnancy and birth are risky, awkward and painful enough with female bodies which are built to support it.

Slash with death eaters/Voldemort: Depends on the circumstance. I hate Bellatrix pairings because she's a psycho, same with Voldie, but others (Regulus Black) that made stupid decisions when they were too young and under their families' influence and then took steps to correct themselves I am okay with.

Lordships: overused, but I have run across a few cases where it was done okay.

Harem fics: hate 'em, especially since very few show the reality of the backstabbing, jealousy, etc. that would be involved in such arrangements.

White-washing death eaters: that is mostly due to the original canon plot being too simplistic. Wealthy, in power families don't just swear allegiance to some honcho and go around terrorizing people. Something was happening, a shift in the socioeconomic sphere, that made them willing to sign up their children to kill their own cousins. Is mob mentality a real and horrifying thing? Yes, we've seen it. But in most of those cases, there was a root cause. White men did not want to have to pay their workers or loose their privilege (they should and slavery is evil) and so they had a rational (and very selfish and immoral) reason to fight anti-slavery. Some AU's give really believable reasons behind the start of the Death Eaters. They don't forgive the harm they caused, but it changes from random psychos doing acts of terrorism to political unrest that escalated into violence and gave opportunity for psychos to go wild.

My own most hated fic trends are huge age differences between pairings, marriage laws, and uber-abuse stories.

** If done well, every topic can make a fantastic story. But I agree that those topics aren't usually written well. But the same goes for self-inserts, original characters, etc. I'm not sure if it's the topic itself that is difficult to write, or if it just attracts inexperienced writers, or if it's the smaller number of stories...

**** I think that considering the Wizarding World as the Victorian Era with some tweaks is wrong from the start.

The wizarding World , and more specificaly Magical Britainm is a separated country from England, with its own culture. Muggleborn entering Hogwarts can be compared to immigrants on that point.

So yeah, some elements of this culture does look like the Victorian Era, but it's just because of magic. Something like 150 years ago, Wizards took adopted some of the inventions brought by the Industrial Revolution, the difference with the muggle world is that the items from that time only needed some little enchantments to reach a productivity that still fit the wizards need, but they could also be repared by magic so their never had to be replaced.

Also, items like the Hogwarts Express are the only thing brought by the Revolution Era, most of the "cultural" aspect such as the courtship traditions are fanon things, not canon.

Concerning the ignorance of electricity,I know a lot of fanfics love to have their "Muggle studies" chapter where the teacher explain it, but is it canon? I guess I could see Arthur not knowing how electricity work but I don't remember if it appears in books. Anyways, even if wizards don't know electricity, it's because they don't need it. The same way they don't need oil or gaz for example. We have to remember they are wizards, with magic. They don't need electricity to create light, since they only need one candle to light their home forever (hell they could probably ignore it and just conjure ball of light). Arthur managed to make his car work for years without one drop of oil, not to mention his car could fit 8 peoples easily, turn invisible, fly and even work without a driver. Do you know precicely how the pile Volta worked? It's kinda the same for wizards, they know it exist, they know what it does even if they don't understand how, but they know their method are better so they don't really care.

​

Finally for the acceptance of homosexuality, it's once again because wizards are a separated society which is not linked to muggle one. I don't know (or care) why the homosexuals would be more accepted. To be 100% honest I would even say that the blood purist family should be oposed to homosexual marriage since it would mean no descendant and so a risk of extinction of their line (except if they have magical way to create mpreg I guess). But mariage apart, some societies (like Ancient greece) accepted some kind of homosexuality as long as the man did his duty and create a descendance, why not wizards?

** Well, the problem with all those mentioned are that they are completely contrary to the spirit of the JKR's books, and the motivation for using them is usually rather ridiculous (teen wet dreams, to be specific). There is not much to be gained from them (aside from dirty unmentionables), and it really doesn't matter much how executed the idea is.

Also, the old author's rule is that one should never write about something he/she does nothing about, about something he/she never experienced. What are your experiences with male pregnancies or harems? Right.

**** Certainly, that's an interesting question. None, of course, but the question is whether it is really what my stories (and JKR's books and most good fanfiction stories) are truly about. Truly core point of the story is not magic, but friendship, love, fighting an enemy, value of life, and fear of death. Horrible truth about HP books is that magic is mostly just a decoration for the story itself. We read these books (and any books, including S-F and fantasy) because of what it is says about us, not because what it says about wizards, aliens, or future astronauts.

Slash stories, harems ones, however, have these relational situations truly in core of their story. That is what really makes the story make or break, and if gay stories (and I heard lesbian stories are even worse) are written by straight guy/gal who wants just to get his/her underpants wet (which I think is true about most of them; there is just enough LGBT people to write that many slash stories), it is just fake.

***** You don't read hard sci-fi then. It is true that sci-fi has a reputation for allowing introspection on modern society while being distant enough to avoid some defensiveness/hostility, but there is also the aspect of 'this is what we could be/do'.

****** I do read hard sci-fi. Growing up in the Socialist Czechoslovakia, the best what I read was Stanisław Lem, but then later I found Clark, Assimov and others. Surprisingly, I was prefer “Rendezvous with Rama” and “The Fountains of Paradise” to his more famous things. So, yes, I could imagine stories which are more like semi-scientific prediction of future, or trying to suggest possible scenarios, it is a bit strange type of literature, which probably doesn't fit in the broad picture I was drawing. And yes, even so, these stories actually don't contradict what I was saying. The matter which is most important for the story in these cases were not relationships and our everyday human experience, but exactly this prediction of future. And the best authors of the hard sci-fi (e.g., two mentioned) were actually specialists in the area. So, it just confirms what I was saying.

Having said that, I started with Ray Bradbudy as yet another sci-fi writer, but I have immediately found out that he is a way more a storyteller than literary prognostic of the hard sci-fi type, and that I like his stories a way more than I have ever liked hard sci-fi. OK, Fahrenheit 451 was a pure sci-fi, but Martian Chronicles are a bit questionable (I know they chronologically preceded Fahrenheit, but I think that in terms of his literary development they were more advanced). What “Usher II”, “Way in the Middle of the Air”, and perhaps even “There Will Come Soft Rains” have to do with hard sci-fi, really?. And since then Bradbury was moving more and more from the hard sci-fi: his later things were still absolutely brilliant, but some were absolutely non-sci-fi (his Irish stories, “The Magic White Suit”), and he taught what I really want from a story is not sci-fi (and yes, some like it), but the human story. Yes, sci-fi universe gives us possibilities which are not available in the real life, but in the end stories about those relationships not about predicting future (another example is Michel Faber's “The Book of Strange New Things” --- it is quite certainly very fantastic and very sci-fi in its external design, but it has really nothing to do with hard sci-fi, it is about faith, understanding aliens, or understanding between husband and wife).

***** The problem is that when you're writing about "fighting an enemy", the means you are using to fight become central to your story. And unless you're writing about how your protagonist uses pawns and social conventions to fight, that means magic.
