Hey all!

I'm interested in reading Draco fics that don't focus on romance as the main genre. It's fine if there is a pairing (and I don't mind any pairing, really), but fics that concentrates only on romance is not my cup of tea. I'd rather the fic be mainly adventure. Examples of fics I like:

/The Code by Aduro/

/Lust Over Pendle by AJ Hall/

/Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave/

Just to name a few. Any suggestions would be great!


** I wrote a novella about a year ago that explores what happened to Draco during the summer after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, when his father is sent to Azkaban and he takes the Dark Mark. It's completely romance-free.

*** Sounds right up my alley! Awesome! It's so difficult finding a no-pairing Draco story.

**** I agree. Most Draco stories that aren't romantic portray him as a one-dimensional villain. I tried to stick closer to the way I remembered him from HBP and DH in this story.

** Even though it has a reputation for a little bit of plagiarism, The Draco Trilogy is insanely good, at least from my perspective. It's AU though.

**** I'm on mobile, so I can't link, but just google "Draco trilogy PDF" and the first three links (from broomcupboard.net) are the ones you want. Draco Dormiens is first, Draco Sinister is second, and Draco Veritas is third. Keep in mind that this is AU (the last three books aren't used at all), that there is SOME element of romance in it, and that the beginning is a little hard to get into, but it gets so much better :) Hope you enjoy!

#+begin_quote
  /"You're dead, Potter... I'm going to make you pay..."/ Draco swore his revenge on Harry for Lucius's imprisonment, and Harry all but laughed at him. But Draco is planning more than schoolyard pranks this time. The old rivalry turns deadly when Draco abducts Harry for Voldemort. It's the perfect plan, guaranteeing revenge, power, and prestige, all in one blow. But, when Draco's world turns upside down, the fight to save himself and Harry begins, and the battle will take them both through hell and back. If they come back. Harry/Draco slash, Post-OotP.

It's been years since I read it, but I remember really, really liking it. It is D/H, but the pairing is very very minor, the fic is really all adventure.
