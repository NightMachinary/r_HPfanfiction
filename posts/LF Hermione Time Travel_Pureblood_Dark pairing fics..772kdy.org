After reading linkffn(Roundabout Destiny) , I fell in love with Hermione going back in time, either under a different identity, or as a pureblood. So I am looking for, specifically, Hermione fictions pairing her with a dark wizard. Time travel is preferred, but not required. I have enough Tomione to last me till the end of time. Elaboration into Pureblood culture also interests me as well. No Romione, please.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.

** I always upvote for Roundabout Destiny.

Mary Royale has some other fics you might like, but if I recall tends to stay away from pairing Hermione with dark wizards.

There is The Lost Lupin which has Hermione as Remus' younger sister being sent forward in time to protect her from Greyback before she figures it out and returns herself back in time as closely as she can. No dark pairing though and quite a few unorthodox multi/slash pairings that can throw people off.

linkffn(8706050)

Best Laid Plans has time travel Hermione and some pureblood plot. Also not dark pairing though

linkffn(8358716)

All of my other Hermione time travel fics are Tomione though.

  The Lupins fear Greyback's revenge will not stop with Remus, but might spread to his little sister Hermione. They make an unorthodox decision to protect their daughter without telling their son. Remus has been looking for his sister ever since. Time travel, AU, EWE, NON-CANON SHIPS (underline this bit 8,000 times), etc. Please see warnings.

** Reread your post and realized that with Time travel just a preference, not a requirement I have a couple more for you.

The Green Girl by Colubrina

One of my favorite fics follows a Slytherin Hermione as she navigates the perils of Pureblood society with the support of the Malloy's and her year mates. Dramione ship with the basic plot of canon still existing up till 5th -6th year, just in the background and not as important.

linkffn(11027125)

The Muddy Princess by Colubrina

After the war Hermione finds out that she is actually a pureblood put up for adoption. Not an action fic, focused more on the developing relationship with her pureblood family and Draco. Another Dramione.

linkffn(11149377)

Colubrina has a lot of good stories in addition to these that you might like. Quite a few one shots as well. She tends towards Dramione and Tomione.

*** Colubrina is hands down, my favorite fanfic author, and besides the two that Kingsonne listed linkffn(Pygmalion) is excellent, and features /Tom/ time traveling to the future. It's completely messed up but in a plausible way.

Linkffn(A Big Ball of Wibbly-Wobbly) has Hermione traveling back to the 1950s and landing in Tom's bed, literally. The most chilling "happy ending" I've ever read.

  The war is over, the good guys have won, and Hermione Granger goes to sleep in her lovely flat only to wake up in 1953 in the bed of someone she'd really much rather were dead. "I'm working on the 'kill Lord Voldemort now, work out the temporal paradox issues later' plan," she tells him. He laughs. Tomione. COMPLETE
