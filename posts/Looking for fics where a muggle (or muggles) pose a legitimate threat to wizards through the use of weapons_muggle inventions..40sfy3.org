Crack fics are preferred, but if there's a fic you remember with an element like this in a different genre I'm open to it as well.


** With Strength of Steel Wings, that's a major element of the story. It isn't very cracky, but It's good. It's currently on a bit of hiatus while the author finishes another story, but she's by no means inactive or abandoned it. Linkffn(9036071)

  A young Harry Potter, abandoned on the streets, is taken in by a man with a mysterious motive. When his new muggle tattoo suddenly animates, he is soon learning forbidden magic and planning to infiltrate the wizarding world on behalf of the "ordinary" people. But nothing is ever that black and white. (Runes, Blood Magic, Parseltongue, Slytherin!Harry) (SEE NOTE 1st Chapter)

** linkffn(Voyage of the Starship Hedwig) has this at the beginning and end, but it's

1. Definitely not crack

2. Full of characters dying, including lots of canon characters (kinda like Game of Thrones I guess, except they die for really stupid reasons sometimes)

3. For the most part completely separate from muggles (as in, on a different planet with no interactions).

4. Very much about exploration and settling on a new planet rather than conflict with muggles, at least during most of the story.

That said, I enjoyed it a lot and would recommend it. Also, if anyone knows of similar fics I'd be interested in hearing about it.

*** To be more precise, it's an alliance of muggleborns, half-bloods, pureblood "blood traitors" and muggles versus oppressive pureblood regime(s). Though with regards to tactics/weapons, muggle weapons and soldiers by themselves are not very effective without magical support in this story. It's all about combined arms.
