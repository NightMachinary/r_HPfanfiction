Tom has an unknown number of horcruxes, made of unknown objects, in unknown locations, secured with unknown defenses - except for one, which requires killing a child to destroy. Fuck that.

-Dumbledore

I'm looking for any fics where Dumbledore looks at the situation and decides that he needs to approach it from another angle. Maybe instead of dedicating his time to hunting down the horcruxes, he spends the years improving Nurmengard and training a Voldemort hunting squad. Maybe he cuts a deal with Grindelwald - in exchange for freedom he has to make an unbreakable vow to partner up in defeating Voldemort, then live the rest of his life peacefully.


** Yes, such a Dumbledore is long overdue:

- Capture Voldemort in some kind of very carefully laid out trap.
- Use anything, literally ANYTHING, to extract everything Voldemort knows.
- Obliviate Voldemort back to his infancy or a drooling vegetable. Even if Voldemort escapes as a wraith, he will wander the mortal plane as a harmless and confused spirit until the end of times!
- Dose Voldemort with Draught of Living Death.
- Lock him behind wards even stronger than Nurmengard.
- Based on information obtained from the interrogation, hunt down every Horcrux, every Death Eater, and every secret supply stash.

Before some of you complain that is this too harsh, too cruel, and blah blah blah, this approach is infinitely better than knowingly grooming and sacrificing an innocent child!

**** My version of a proactive Dumbledore:

Three years after Voldemort's defeat in Halloween 1981, Dumbledore decided that the Ministry couldn't be trusted to carry out justice against Death Eaters and dismantle Voldemort's sadistic genocidal terrorist network.

As the first step, he riled up Augusta Longbottom and together they confiscated the Lestrange vault, as the Longbottoms found ample sympathy among the public and in the Wizengamot. In addition to gold, Dumbledore also obtained the Cup, and could start the Horcrux Hunt 10 years earlier.

Next, Dumbledore managed to search the Malfoy Manor before Lucius got the dope, since Lucius Malfoy didn't have the time to corrupt nearly as many in the Ministry as in canon. Lucius was found guilty of possessing many dark artifacts, including the forbidden Death Eater regalia, and received 20 years in Azkaban. Most of Malfoy fortune ended in Dumbledore's and Minister Bagnold's coffers. Dumbledore further obtained the Diary.

Now that two Death Eaters turned out to have extremely valuable artifacts from Voldemort, maybe it made sense to investigate and confiscate more? The Ministry could use more gold, Minister Bagnold could use more gold, the Weasleys could certainly use more gold, and Remus could definitely use more gold to hire some werewolves, and send the pack after Greyback? *Converting vital enemy war materials to your own is after all a fundamental war objective.*

So, which rich Death Eaters next? The Blacks of course! They had to pay for the hideous betrayal of the Potters. Yes, this Sirius Black had to be thoroughly interrogated, with a combination of Veritaserum, Legilimency, and some secret DoM mean. What?! He was innocent? Well, then the Ministry should officially grant him the head of the house, and Sirius Black would in turn let us search the Black residence and ‘donate' some gold for the Greater Good. What?! His brother Regulus also defected and gave up his life to get one of Voldemort's artifacts? How many of those things did Voldemort make? Time to knock up on Horace Slughorn.

“Ah dear Horace, we already got three. He talked to you about this, didn't he? So how many more? You don't remember? Maybe we shall take you for a visit to the Department of Mysteries, I'm sure they can help you remember. Good, I'm glad you found your courage, Horace. You will be greatly honored once this is all over.”

“Yes Millicent, I've obtained irrefutable proof that he cheated the death by using Horcruxes. The Head Unspeakable can verify that. Yes, he could have made three more. So far, two of the objects are Hogwarts founder artifacts, one his personal item, so you can see a pattern here. All of them were obtained by searching Death Eater estates and vaults. Therefore We should first fully investigate every imprisoned Death Eater, to find more leads to his Horcruxes, to identify potential falsely imprisoned ones like Sirius Black, to uncover more potential crimes, to better understand Voldemort's organization, to allow arrests of more escaped Death Eaters, and to seize more of their assets to pay their victims. No, I'm opposed to Dementor's Kiss. Those convicted of murder should be sentenced through the Veil. Even if Voldemort regains his body one day, he will find his supporters and their gold gone.”

“The Wizengamot thereby has sentenced Gaius Avery, Amycus Carrow, Alecto Carrow, Walden MacNair, Adolphus Travers, Markus Selwyn, and Corban Yaxley to death through the Veil for mass murders, mass tortures, multiple counts of rapes, conspiracy to overthrow the Ministry, reckless endangerment of the Statute of Secrecy, and high treason. The Wizengamot has further judged, given the heinous nature of their atrocities and crimes, that ALL their assets, including gold, properties, businesses, among others, shall be seized and their victims shall be compensated.”

****** Honestly depends on how long Dumbledore waits to make his move after Halloween ‘81. In the pensieve memory of the lestrange/crouch trial, the wizengamoot was out for blood. Sirius comments in goblet of fire that he wasn't the only one thrown in Azkaban without a trial. If Dumbledore/the ministry used the momentum from the attack on the Longbottoms to clean house, I can't see anyone stopping them - to the point where even speaking out against their methods might get you tossed into Azkaban on suspicion of being a death eater/sympathizer.

** The House of Potter Rebuilt - DisobedienceWriter

It is complete and an interesting take on Harry. Dumbledore is killed by Quirell and starts ti really piss Harry off when he comes back as a ghost. It becomes Harry's inspiration for a rune project to repel a ghost. One thing leads to another and the device is improved to eventually trap Voldemort and Dumbledore in stone forever.

Its a cool story that involves the Flamels quite a bit as well as Sirius and most importantly it doesn't have Harry getting sucked into stupid shit he doesn't need to.

** This presupposes that Dumbledore COULD capture and hold LV. There's no evidence that he is capable of this post resurrection... Or really even that he's capable of capturing Voldemort pre-Halloween1981. I mean it's a common enough trope in fanfic that Dumbledore was just sitting around worthlessly twirling his cock or that he actually believed in the prophecy or other such nonsense that completely misunderstands canon.

If he could have apprehended or killed Voldemort... He would have.

I mean such a thing could be somewhat interesting to read but it does hamstring the villain. Its an understated theme of canon that Dumbledore is simply too old or unskilled to stop Lord Voldemort. He needed to defeat himself through his lack of understanding of the subtle magic of love and sacrifice. If he understood them he would never have made the same mistake twice... But it would be easy to argue that if he understood them, he wouldn't be Lord Voldemort in the first place.

*** In the department of mysteries Dumbledore doesn't seem to have much trouble running off Voldemort while protecting Harry and preventing Harry from jumping into the fight

McGonagall, Flitwick, and Slughorn were able to stand up to him together.

Lock Voldemort in a room with Dumbledore and the 5 next best good wizards and he should go down hard, particularly if Dumbledore had been rigorously training them for 10 years.

Even if Dumbledore couldn't 1v1 him, it's not like that's the only option. Voldemort spent the entire previous war running from Dumbledore and he still almost won. A human being can't 1v1 a bear, but that doesn't mean there aren't ways of dealing with bears.

This is all irrelevant anyway, because I wasn't arguing about how canon should have gone, I was talking about fanfiction. I was making a request for a fanfic. I doubt that you want to argue that it's impossible to write a fanfic where Dumbledore imprisons Voldemort.

*** The difficult part is in pinning down a wizard like Voldemort - you'd need to have laid out some sort of trap for him.

In canon, Dumbledore really doesn't do much to actually attack Voldemort. From a high level perspective, that's likely because /Harry/ is the hero, so we can't have Dumbledore beat the big evil villain. So instead we get Dumbledore's convoluted plan running through Harry, and focuses on more deflecting Voldemort's strikes it seems.

But luring Voldemort into a trap - perhaps through using Harry - could be far more impactful. In the department of mysteries fight, they're pretty evenly matched - add in a few other powerful wizards like Snape, Flitwick, and McGonagall, and Voldemort would be forced into retreat. Cut off said retreat...

Well, it wouldn't be /easy/, but they should be able to beat him - and once beaten, a series of mind wipes, petrifications, etc, to keep his body intact but mind gone... That'd get around his immortality in a de facto way, giving more time to track down all the horcruxes, if that were even needed any longer.
