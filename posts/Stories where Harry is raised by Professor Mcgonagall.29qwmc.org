** I'm guessing you've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry-McGonagall][Harry McGonagall]]? He isn't actually raised by Minerva, but by her nephew (I think). That's the only McGonagall-related one I know of, but I'll take a look because I'm interested in reading one as well.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry-McGonagall][Harry McGonagall]] and its sequel are the ones I see most commonly recommended.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/1/Just_a_Random_Tuesday][Just a Random Tuesday]] is a great short Minerva-centric story.

There's another great short one-shot of a day in the life of McGonagall set vaguely after her retirement that's hilarious but I can't find it at the moment.
