I actually really like OP characters in fanfics provided they're well-written and I think Fate does it spectacularly. The best part of it all is that Ron is only OP because he worked very hard in his magic and this is what made him better at it than his peers. So, do you guys know of any fanfics similar to that one?


** I'm planning on writing a story similiar to it on ffn.net
