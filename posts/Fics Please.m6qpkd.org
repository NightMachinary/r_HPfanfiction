I normally tend to stick toward the darker Harry potter fics but, they normally incorporate Muggle borns as good. I am looking for fics that have Harry actually hate muggleborns such as Hermione. Iwant to see if this part of the 'Dark Harry' part of the fandom is worth going into. The longer the fic the better, thank you!

100k + is prefered


** Harry Potter and the Homecoming is the best of that variety I've read. It's a complete series (albeit six books instead of 7), and really comes into its own in book 3. The first two books ... to be honest, you can probably skip.

  After four years working overseas for the shadowy Department M, a world-weary and dispirited Harry Potter returns to the land of his birth. He meets some old friends and makes some new ones, as he learns that much has changed since he left home. AU, a 'Harry never went to Hogwarts' story.
