** Yes. 100% yes. I'll tell you why too, its all the fucking hosts and celebs on talk shows reading out smut fics for comedy. I really try not to care, but everyone I know thinks its one big pornographic joke. Scratch that, my boyfriend is very very supportive, but everyone else can suck it.

** Hah, that's funny because I have a specific anecdote for this. Last night I was talking to my husband, and he asked me what my story was about, which is rare because he usually doesn't notice/care. So I brushed it off like, “Oh, it's really long.” Then he says, “I have time.” (We were on the phone and I've been away since Christmas, so I think he's lonely.) So I explain my long fic, but I have 2 versions of the explanation: the one that makes it seem like regular historical fiction, and one that includes all the HP stuff. Naturally I give him the first one...and then he asks, “When does Harry Potter come in?” And I'm like, “Never lol,” because it's true (the setting is pre-canon). He answers, “Well, there must be Hogwarts then,” and I gave him this awkward laugh because the majority of the story actually does take place at Hogwarts, lol.

TL;DR: Yes, I'm embarrassed but my husband has probably figured out I write it, and I'm not actually going to die of shame, so maybe I'm getting better.

** Kind of, yes. There are some moments when I don't really give a crap and will admit to reading fanfiction, but I still periodically tend to make up book titles when coworkers ask me what I'm reading on my kindle (most often I'll just say I'm re-reading Harry Potter and choose a book at random that I'm on). I care way too much of how others perceive me, though, which is a bad habit that I am trying to break.

I use my main (and only) account to browse this sub, though. I don't really care enough to be THAT secretive about it - but I don't go volunteering the info in the first place. If someone cares enough to go looking up what I post, then good for them, I guess.

** Embarrassed, not really. Cautious, yes. I'm older than most fanfic writers I know, and among my friends and acquaintances I have a reputation as a semi-intellectual with a penchant for literary novels, poetry, and a smattering of scifi and fantasy. It doesn't accord with their perceptions of who I am.

Some of my friends would definitely be uncomfortable with the fact that Harry Potter is a children's series, and some of them wouldn't know what to do with the fact that when I write fic, it's often erotic and very explicit. And it's slash. I don't think I have to explain to this sub how flustered and sometimes hostile the reactions can be to the idea of a woman writing gay sex - in which I'll lump femslash, since most non-fans in my circle would find both equally disconcerting.

I've told a select few. They tend to be aspiring writers themselves, and although one was more shocked than the others, they all enjoy teasing me about it and are generally supportive (except for the occasional comment about wishing I'd return to writing my own stories).

Lol, you haven't read "really bad fanfiction" then. Sure, you may call it fanfiction, but it was pretty well-executed fanfiction. And yes, there were problems, but not bigger problems than any other 'very good' fanfiction, even disguised as original fiction.

**** Force mechanics were completely redone in the +fic+ film: Force ghosts can manifest? Astral projection? Force training doesn't require any, well, training? All the Light and Dark side stuff thrown out in favor of "balance"?

(This is not to mention the deus ex machina of the hyperspace ship-as-battering-ram thing, which would have happened a bazillion times already in the series in drone-captained ships were it a thing.)

I think "really bad fanfiction" might well apply.

Force ghosts have been manifesting since Empire. And let's not forget the whole "balance to the force" thing was there since the prequels.

****** I thought the ship thing would only work at extremely close range, and those engines take a ton of time to charge. Basically either you go fast enough to hit lightspeed and miss, or you time it right and don't. But the engines are not designed for sustained high velocity sub-C speeds, it would rip the ship apart on debris. Also when the falcon dropped out of C into an atmosphere in 7, this proved that past that speed they don't interact with matter according to conventional physics, so it's only in the acceleration part that you would have the force required to do that kind of damage. So it's actually a really short range weapon that should be pretty easy to defend against. Notice how in 8, the general dude orders EVERYTHING at the ships retreating, not the one that would go for a suicide run. This meant that they had minutes of extra time that they should not have had. Headcanon, but as best as I can justify it.

******* Because the Death Stars are a lot larger than rebel ships. In fact in Return of the Jedi, a ship (though can't remember if it was Rebel or Imperial) crashed into the Death Star and not much happened. And the third "Death Star" was a planet so hyperspace wouldn't do much.

As for force ghost, all Yoda did was time lightning on cue (don't think the force allows control of the weather ) and Yoda was/is a pretty powerful jedi so even if it was possible it wouldn't surprise me. Not to mention some force users can use lightning.

***** Sure. Then read "Partially Kissed Hero" and reevaluate.

Or, if you want one of the most popular fanfictions: Look at how wrong Methods of Reality gets the magic system.

And all these problems you name are not as big and can be handwaved rather not easily:

- Luke can force-project because he is a) a Skywalker, who are established to be very powerful, b) Looked at the force in a way that is neither Jedi nor Sith, gaining different abilities.

Force training is a bit of a problem, but I feel like the amount of stuff Rey can actually do kinda fits.

But that all is not the point, most of it are nitpicks that might as well be titled "I dislike the new world building".

Lucas himself changed world building as he pleased, star wars was never known to be terribly consistent with powers.

And even if it was bad, it is not really bad fanfiction, because again: It is not really bad compared with the vast majority of fanfiction.

Go ahead, browse the most recently updated fanfictions with > 50k words, read a few random (read: median / average) fanfictions.

** I'm not and never have been embarrassed. I admit to writing fanfic, reading fanfic, and will tell people about projects I've worked on or am working on; mostly, I like to tell people who aren't into fanfic about the history behind it, how it came about, the different kinds.

Fundamentally, people are curious about other people's interests, why they call to them, et cetera. Even stuff like stamp or train enthusiasms can be interesting to a layman if you go for the interesting trivia and don't get too in-depth.

It's interesting to see someone devote a huge portion of their lives to anything, even if it's something we'd never want to be interested in ourselves.

Do people assume it's all just smut? Sure they do. If people are curious about porn, I like to tell them about the weirdest smut requests I've received, or about the biggest, weirdest tropes like A/B/O and knotting. But then, I semi-professionally publish erotica, so it's never going to be a subject I'm shy about.

** Well, most of my close friends and family members know that I actively read and write fanfiction, but it's not necessarily something I go around telling people.

The worst memory I have of being a fanfiction writer was back when I was a freshman in High School. I had this thing where, if I got bored in class, I would occasionally write a little bit on my next chapter, just to pass the time.

One day, one of my fellow classmates spotted the open Word document on my computer, and naturally, wondered what it was. Asking me about it, I kind of awkwardly admitted to writing fanfiction. I immediately realized I shouldn't have said that.

The dude I told it to assumed it to be pornography (as people seem to perceive Fanfiction as strictly erotica) and proceeded to make fun of me in front of the entire class.

I spent the rest of that semester being called a pervert for writing something that wasn't even slightly sexual.

So I can understand why people choose to hide their interest in fanfiction. Some people might misunderstand, and that can create some awkward moments.

At one stage, I accidentally used his real name in one of the chapters and not even my beta noticed. He has some sort of alert set up if his name comes up in new results on google, and BAM he immediately guessed it was me. I was mortified. Seriously, dig a hole and bury myself, momentarily considered suicide mortified.

He was kind of okay about it but I went and changed the name obviously. I've told other people about it, ones I knew wrote their own stories or something and they've always been totally normal about it. Other writers usually understand it i reckon, although one said I should never base my characters on people i know too well.
