** There's a (sadly unfinished) fic which touches upon "perfect" soul extraction/binding to an object, it doesn't play a huge role but its at least a relevant subplot. I have the name somewhere... I think it had Diablo references in there somewhere, but that may also be me mixing up two similar fics.

Aha, it's linkffn(The Merging)! Amazing fic, sadly no updates in the last year.

** What weaknesses are you thinking of fixing? They're already functionally immune to anything but basilisk venom and fiendfire.

*** Less fixing the horcrux's abilities as much as just improving their usefulness, since imo the default horcruxes are kinda weak. They protect you from dying, but in a weak incorporeal form, and reconstituting yourself is a difficult and lengthy process that took voldemort a literal decade and was impossible without outside help. Imagine how terrifying a villain could be if they found a way to make it truly resurrect them, so even if you kill them theyll be back in a month at the latest, kind of like a lich's phylactery.

** The biggest weakness of Horcruxes for me is that after you die it takes a lot of effort to bring back your body. Voldemort despite his ability, took 14 years to regain his body.

So developing some type of automatic body recreation magic that activates when you die would be a huge upgrade.

Or just have friends that you trust to bring you back.

Another thing is to explore living Horcruxes more. Split your soul to create a clone with all your ability and knowledge. Implant a soul into another as a sleeper agent, etc
