** While what you're saying makes sense to me, perhaps you are underestimating the physical side of becoming infatuated with someone. Oftentimes crushes /don't/ make sense, and I'm pretty sure Dumbledore's was one of those, given that they only knew each other for a couple of months, and Rowling has even said that Grindlewald didn't really return Dumbledore's affections.

I think you're right that most people writing are trying to explain how it happened and anything as slow-burning as you'd like to read would definitely be more AU.

** The problem is that a lot of writers go with "Albus is Light, Gellert is Dark" - as if Light/Dark are actual character traits like smart or funny, and not labels. Gellert did evil things, and felt that wizards deserved to rule over muggles (and he should rule over wizards). That's not the same thing as "being dark". Albus also thought that wizards deserved to rule over muggles and he should rule over wizards- he was just less comfortable with the violence that would be involved in setting up such a system, and after getting a taste of that violence first-hand when his sister died, decided that the violence /was/ wrong, not just a necessary evil, and that if the violence was wrong maybe the idea that wizards should rule over muggles was wrong too. He doesn't seem to have been as bothered with the idea of strong wizards ruling over the rest, though he did feel that he was a bad choice. Making those decisions didn't make him "light".

Albus/Gellert works just fine when they want the same things and avoid really talking/thinking about the bits that make Albus uncomfortable with their plans. And it's really easy for 17/18 year-olds (the summer after Hogwarts) to ignore things that they don't want to think about as long as they're not shoved in their face- especially when they're in love.

** We don't know if Albus was always light. The way he acts - it is very likely he agreed with Gellert and Gellert's goals until the death of Ariana, when everything changed.
