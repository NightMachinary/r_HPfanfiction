** As its a relatively broad category, I'll just recommend one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian]]

Updated in July, one of the best "dark" fics I have ever read, excellent quality, and a kinda unique premise. Canon characterization is eh, as it is good for non-Harry characters, but Harry's is substantially different and there are a number of OC's - a bit like RC, heh.

Have you read what is there of /Criminal Intent/ by Silens Cursor, btw?
