Supposedly, Ilvermorny is built on Mount Greylock.

I live in Massachusetts and have visited this "mountain" and any random person can search up Mount Greylock, and see that is clearly not "secret school of magic" material.

I was wondering if you guys could suggest alternative mountains/mountain ranges/locations for the American School Of Magic?


** Are you absolutely sure it isn't magic school worthy?

Or, is that the anti muggle protections talking!?

** I'm gonna second the Appalachian mountains if we're talking mountains. They're sparsely populated while relatively close to the east coast. Though I totally agree we'd need more than the two she's put in the east. Maybe another large one in the west with other schools focusing on different types of magic in between (like creole magic in New Orleans or different Native American tribes throughout the US)

** JK has really shown that she doesnt know anything about america when talking about illvermourny. europe gets 3 schools while all of north america gets 1??? North america is 6 times bigger than europe. 'mount' greylock is hardly big enough to conceal a school. also there arn't just random castles laying around in america. I headcanon it being one of the 4 or 5 schools in north america instead of only one, if it is the one located in the eastern united states (with another located elsewhere in america and 3 others in mexico and canada) then I think it should be a colonial university style building. Idk what the others would look like though, i need to research more on building styles in areas where I think they would be. I might make my own post about it

*** Mount greylock is a glorified hill. I agree with you on pretty much everything, but I think Mexico goes to castelbruxo while America and Canada go to Ilvermorny. At least that's what I say.

**** Jo probably just looked up 'mountins in massachusetts' and picked it without looking at it lmao. I don't know where I'd put them yet but I need to do more research on geography and where would make sense. I think the same goes for south america as well, there should be more than just one school for the whole continant. so mexico would still get it's own school or two, and south america would get plenty of their own schools as well.

*** Well, she doesn't know anything about Europe either (I won't start about the combination of English ignorance and French arrogance, but something like that). The British Isles have one large magical school, and the rest of Europe (that's in terms of population proportion is almost exactly 1:10) has two, one of them somewhere in the corner. What about students from Greece or Jewish students from Israel (both of them countries with huge magical history)? Somewhere in the Germano/Slavic school in the northern Scandinavia or French school in Pyrenees? And let not me start on Germans and Slavic people studying in the same school.

***** They're not actually poor, they're relatively poor due to the number of children they have. Most families we see in canon have one or two children, while they have seven. So even with a good wage there's no way that they are going to be able to afford the same things as other people in the same income bracket. There's also the fact that a lot of families seem to pay for tuition there up front at birth, so if they did the same for each of their children out of savings, the price of tuition could have gone up significantly over the next decade and they'd still be fine.

** I liked the school system described in “The World of The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel” linkao3(14259786). Yes, I know “Salem Witches' Institute” was not meant to be a school (it was joke on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Institutes][Women's_Institutes]]), but I agree that there should be one Ivy league (with some kind of magical Ivy!) in New England (easily somewhere around Salem), one Quodpot-and-apple-pie in Midwest, one Native American somewhere in New Mexico or somewhere there, one in The South, and one at the Pacific Midwest.

And of course, talking about Salem Witches' Institute I just have to mention “Pranking The Tournament by Gardevoir687” linkffn(13132217).

*** *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's%20Institutes][Women's Institutes]]*

The Women's Institute (WI) is a community-based organisation for women in the United Kingdom, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand. The movement was founded in Stoney Creek, Ontario, Canada, by Erland and Janet Lee with Adelaide Hoodless being the first speaker in 1897. It was based on the British concept of Women's Guilds, created by Rev Archibald Charteris in 1887 and originally confined to the Church of Scotland. From Canada the organisation spread back to the motherland, throughout the British Empire and Commonwealth, and thence to other countries.

** Would you really notice a small tower or cottage that's built into the mountain and covered in wards and then extends into the mounting for the rest of the school.

Remember that Hogwarts looks like an old, unstable ruin to muggles, which is why the parents of muggleborns can't go there.

** She really didn't put much thought into her international schools at all. My personal headcanon is that there would be one school based in NYC, based on population density alone there could easily be enough witches and wizards just in the city to fill it, one in the New England area, one in the Southeast (maybe either in Appalachia or in the Louisianna area), one in the great lakes area ( I like to think off the coast of Lake Superior), one in the PNW, and one in Baja California. I don't know enough about population density in Mexico or Canada to say for certain but I would imagine at least one per Canadian territory and one in the Yukon Territory with the intention of providing schooling for all students in that area as well as Alaska. For Mexico, in addition to the one in Baja (which I would imagine serviced students from that area as well as southern California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah) there would be one in an area or adjacent to an area with a high population density, and one further south to service Mexico as well as Central America (as I don't remember her ever specifying there was a school there). I also imagine that with so many different cultures present in North America, many of whom have different magical traditions of their own, there would be a lot of smaller schools that would cater to these populations (schools focused on indigenous traditions, schools started by immigrants, creole, Polynesian, etc) as well as some of the larger schools having their curriculum heavily influenced by the local magical populations' traditions. JK's idea of magic is very WASPy, to say the least...
