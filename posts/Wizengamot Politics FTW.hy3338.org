** The only time I enjoy seeing politics in fanfiction is when Harry /isn't/ involved. DE!Harry fics with Lucius bribing, manipulating and threatening his way to passing laws is interesting. Dumbledore gathering clout to fight those laws is interesting. A 14 y/o independant!Harry winning everything by default is about as interesting as his third wife's nonexistant personality.

** I especially love it when he speaks out against proposed laws and is basically a badass when shutting them down and everyone is just staring in awe at this kid who basically made a really good argument no one could argue against. idk I just like BAMF Harry....especially when he has a lot of titles.
