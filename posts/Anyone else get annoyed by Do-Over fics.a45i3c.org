The ones that cheer Harry on as he kicks everyone's asses the second time around, as he knows everything that's going to happen. That and he's an adult competing against children (ie. Draco Malfoy). It's like cheering on a 40-year-old adult beating a bunch of eleven year olds at basketball.... And on top of that.... The adult is CHEATING!


** The thing I really take issue with are the ones where a mentally adult Harry uses his past knowledge to get into the good graces of his past love/loves. They of course would later enter into a relationship with him. What's that one, Chasing witches and dodging prison? Harry does exactly what his brother did and uses his knowledge to bring them onto his side. He literally creates a divide between Ginny and her family in a Harry or Weasleys scenario. Ginny is ten in that situation, while Harry is a fair bit older. 15-16 maybe. It doesn't have the age aspect but he's still taking advantage of them. I never really got back into it after I realised that.

*** Yeah, that fic has some pretty big issues which is especially painful considering how many good things it has going for it.

The entire premise of having multiple time travelers on opposing sides in a universe heavily set against Harry is super compelling, and I love how it basically tells the stations of canon to go fuck themselves, and way the fic involves Hermoine's parents is pretty amazing too.

At the same time most of the whole harem stuff just makes me super uncomfortable, Ginny's part especially. The way how, in one of the latest chapters, she tells him she doesn't want to kill and is ashamed for it before resolving to do it anyway to please Harry, and he just nods off on it as if it were a good decision, and the fic then tries to present him as noble for not forcing the issue and leaving her an out (while still subtly manipulating her not to take it) is just so eurggghh.

Also IIRC the age issue does in fact exist. I'm pretty sure Harry comes from a timeline where Voldemort won in year 7 and ruled for several years, it's just John who thinks that Harry returned after year 4. Granted, Harry spent all that time rotting in Azkaban, so it's questionable how much those years affected his mental age, but he certainly acts like an adult in most situations.

I'm still debating whether or not to drop the fic because despite all this I still really want to see what happens and have a certain amount of investment in the characters who aren't Harry.

** One of the best time travel/do overs I read had the time traveling character struggle to fit into the time period they arrived at. The character felt out of place at times due to social customs and geopolitical situations. In this fic the character was ridiculously overpowered (with a good reason) but suffered from some amnesia so she couldn't remember everything, sometimes bits and pieces would come to her.

I think in a redo fic, not everything should go the character's way. Otherwise it can get really boring without any real conflict.

One of the more interesting do overs I read wasn't in the perspective of the main time traveler. It was his parents wondering what is up with him and why he's acting so weirdly.

**** linkffn(Strange Attractors)

This isn't really a do-over, it's more of a time travel. Hermione is the Time Traveler and prior to TT she was an Unspeakable. This makes her a very powerful witch by Hogwarts students' standards, and the fic doesn't gloss away from that.

Like you I like to read do-overs where everything goes the MC's way and all the problems are solved quickly. But it's so much more interesting if not everything goes the MC's way or if they've completely messed up the timeline.

  Unspeakable Granger wakes up with missing memories in Hogwarts...in 1942. Way back? What way back? If there's anyone who's too used to making the best of things, it's her. The least she could do is to drag the wizarding world kicking and screaming to the 21st century (that prejudice has to go---and oh, the things she knows...). But there's someone here that makes her brain itch...

** I love it when it is executed in a logical fashion (Harry kicks everyone's arse). An utter annihilation, a buggering for the history books. Bringing a tank to a fist-fight. Those can be quite cathartic to read once in a while.

Much worse are the fics which add some artificial challange along the way because the author has not properly thought the whole idea through and realised that it would take roughly 20k words to write the whole thing, but they want a lot more (since longer = more favs) and there isn't enough teenage drama in a one-sided slaughter.

A proper do-over would probably look very different than most people imagine, simply because 11-year-old children are not very interesting conversationalists and Harry would get fed up with them within a week. The whole "let's befriend Ron and Hermione again" arc wouldn't work out very well, all things considered.

*** What I just cannot comprehend is that after all these years and with all those fanfiction writers, there doesn't seem to be one or two properly written do-over fics. Sure, fanfiction writing is for everybody and in the case of Harry Potter, many younger children write their stories, but in every fandom there are a few very talented writers out there who write complex, lengthy, logicially thought out stories that are amazing and can be read again and again. I would have thought there were more of them in this fandom just because of the size of it.

** One thing I would like to see is a fifth year DOMs Harry wind up back in school not in the marauder era but with fifth year Bill, Charlie, or Tonks. Such that he is finishing school either as young Harry is starting or before that.

Another concept I have is four different Harry's all starting in 1991. A post DH, a DOMs and one that had just taken the port key out of the graveyard along with 11 year old Harry.

Wherein the central conflicts center around the different Harry's whose world are each slightly different from cannon and had different summer 1991 experiences

** I remember reading this premise for the first time about 12 years ago, when there weren't quite as many fan fics going around.

Can't remember which one, but it was a completely new concept - and blew my mind.

I've since read about 20 of essentially the same story, and there are lots of issues with it, but at the time it was fresh, new, clever, and insanely brilliant.

Lots of conceptual ideas were/are like that. Its funny how when you read Fan Fiction for so long ( its going on 15 years for me now.... Jesus ) when you go back and re-read fics you remember loving you realise they're not quite as good as you remember. Usually because someone has taken the idea, and written it much better in the years after. Its rare that the first person to come up with an idea also writes it with the best writing, characterisation, etc.

  Draco Malfoy isn't the average first choice for a hero sent back in time to save the world. Narcissa Malfoy, slightly surprised to see the grown man her eleven-year-old son could be, isn't the average first choice for his Horcrux-hunting partner either.

** The problem is, I have yet to find even one well written one. I have read extremely good do-over fics in other fandoms, but in this fandom, there just seems to be an abundance of horribly written ones, so yes, extremely annoying. But really, give me one good fic and I'll be content to have had enough of the stupid trope XD

The part about posing as a young child (it doesn't help that most writers seem to have barely entered puberty at the time of writing) when your mind is >20yrs old also makes it hard for me as a reader to take anything seriously. Why is that even necessary? Why not go back as an adult and interact mainly with the adults? Or go back at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts for example to the Marauders Era just before they finish school or something, so that they will be of similar age. I imagine that in both cases a certain chemistry (in a friendship/family kind of way) can be created that makes the story compelling to read.
