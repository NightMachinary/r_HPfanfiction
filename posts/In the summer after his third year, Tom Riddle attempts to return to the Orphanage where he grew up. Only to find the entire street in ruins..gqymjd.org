*** Would Dumbledore or Dippet really impede that, if Tom legitimately didn't have anywhere to stay? When he asked Dumbledore about it in canon it was a case of him not wanting to go back to the orphanage rather than not being able to.

Also I imagine that the choice of where he would say would be made by some Ministry official.

***** Depends if it would be easier for the Ministry to charm him into a new orphanage or just pay for a room in the Leaky Cauldron like for 3rd year Harry.

I doubt Dumbledore or Dippet would personally involve themselves in that. It really isn't their job to find him a home, or look after him during the summer in Hogwarts (I'm sure the teachers would rather enjoy their vacation too.).

Between the 2 options, I'm pretty sure that the Orphanage one would be prefered by the Ministry.

Even if the sum is not that much, it's one thing to pay a room in the Cauldron for /the/ Harry Potter, who happen to be targeted by a dangerous Dark Wizard who just did the impossible and escaped from Azkaban itself, it's another to do the same for some orphan Muggleborn whose home has been destroyed.\\
In comparison, it would only take one spell to send him to another orphanage, way easier (and cheaper) for a Ministry (especially one in the middle of a war).

I still think Dumbledore would have stopped the decision. He was deputy headmaster, so he had some power in the school and I'm sure Dippet would obviously hear Dumbledore, the great genius who could rival Grindelwald.

TBH probably not yet. Since when Dumbledore fought Grindelwald he defeated him and the war ended. Pretty sure it is said/implied that that is what lead to the Muggle war ending aswell. And seeing as the main London bombings happened early in the war I don't think Dumbledore would've faced Grindelwald yet.

******* Yes, but it was merely a "Genius" reputation, not a "Merlin reborn" or "Albus Dumbledore can do no wrong" reputation.

The difference here is that when you have a magical child that legitimately has no place to go, you'd need some seriously good arguments to deny them shelter - and no matter what, you'd look like an ass for doing it.

** I always thought it was weird to me that this society of magical people doesn't have a contingency in place for orphaned wizard kids. The government should have totally been notified when toms name and location showed up in the Book of Admittance when he first exhibited magical abilities.

I just don't see that the wizard government would be like "Yeah okay lets just leave this orphaned wizard kid in the muggle world, let's not find him any wizard parents. He's one of us but since he was born in an orphanage we better just leave him there."

I mean Tom theoretically could have been the first British wizard orphan but I would think it unlikely.

*** True. Based on rough statistics they'd get a muggle raised orphan once every 20 years, which includes from foster families. Removing a child from loving muggle foster parents would be a bad idea, so they might have a general non-interference policy.
