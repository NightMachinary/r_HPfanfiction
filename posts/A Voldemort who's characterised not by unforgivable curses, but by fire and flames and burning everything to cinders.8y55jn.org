So, like, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8p6bpf/how_to_make_harry_very_op_but_ensure_voldemort_is/e09bxff/][I had this idea last month]] to have Voldemort be a threat to a Super!Harry by playing up the fire serpent thing he does in OotP.

And I was wondering, has anyone ever written a Voldemort who's characterised that way? Leaving his enemies charred corpses and their homes smoking ruins, announcing his presence with firestorms and turning streets into infernos? Fiendfyre as his specialty? Where in Hagrid's explanation of the Boy-Who-Lived legend, he tells about 'The house was still burning when I got there, but I could hear yeh crying, and when I found yeh the flames wouldn't go anywhere near yeh...'?\\
I know White Squirrel comes close at the end of The Accidental Animagus, mind...


** Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): he is all about burning shit down. At one point he and Harry adventure "into his soul" and its represented by a tree of burning leaves.

** Linkffn(The Mind Arts) has teased this (the prologue implies Voldemort has set most of Paris ablaze) but we haven't seen it in action yet.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
