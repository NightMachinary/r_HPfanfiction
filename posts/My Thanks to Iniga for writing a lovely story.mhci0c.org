Hi, so I just finished reading "The bureaucratic error" by Iniga and wanted to tell her how much I loved her story, and to thank her very much for dedicating time to write it! It is perfect as it is!

Sadly, she was no reviews or PMs activated for reasons that are very understandable, so I leave it here, in the hopes that she miraculously finds my post.

Anyways, thank you Iniga!

  After his death, Remus Lupin finds himself five years in the past, having erased Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. His wife has never met him; the Boy Who Lived doesn't remember him. He trusts his old friend Sirius to help him put things right, though Sirius has a godson to raise and demons to face...

** Yay! I enjoyed this story on ffn and was sad when the author took it down. I'm glad it's up somewhere again.

*** Remus ends up back in time in PoA and tries to fix things. But it's not as easy as it seems.

*** The previous answer is a good description. I liked it because it involves a Remus that tries to learn from his mistakes and be more assertive, closer to his friends and family and to have less self-doubt. No more running from happiness or pushing away the people closest to him. It is not easy though, set behaviours sometimes become innate. He also tries to be a better "uncle" to Harry and lighten his burden of fate.
