*** Could be he is with his parents, looking for Snape's mother for some reason (the Snape Family might have moved away at that point, and they fear the worst or so), and James sees a girl do accidental magic.

**** Why would pre-Hogwarts James be looking for Snape, a boy who by all indications he first met on the Hogwarts train? How would he even know who Snape was?

******* Snape and James are the same age. Not too far-fetched to assume there was at least some overlap.

Cetainly enough of a reason for a "James meets Lily before Hogwarts" setup, which was the point.

******** I suppose so, but I was thinking in reference to Pottermore canon, where James' parents are quite old and retired before he's born. Of course, we've no information about Snape's mother but I assumed she was more of an 'average' age for a mum.

********* Then you can simply skip a generation. Have James's parents look for their goddaughter or something.
