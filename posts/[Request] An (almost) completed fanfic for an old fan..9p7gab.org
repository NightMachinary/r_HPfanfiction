Listened to the HP music during my studies for 1000% wave of nostalgia. Been *years* since I last read a HP fanfiction, but I remember a lot of half-finished/abandoned fics on fanfiction.net. Has the fanfic field changed in any way the past few years? I'm searching to read a fic to take off some steam from my studies but I haven't found anything that wasn't entirely unbalanced with OP character or almost omniscient mary sues.

â€‹

If someone could recommend me a fic that will most likely be completed or is completed with a balanced story I would really appreciate it! Preferably something Harry-centered any ship is alright with me!

*** Thanks for telling me! I already scrolled through them but most of these links are quite old and most of them I've already read. So I wondered if there have been any more recent fanfics that just blew reader's mind. :)

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** A bit late to the party, but here to plug one of my favorite fics, A Marauder's Plan by catsarecool-- Linkao3(1085412). It finished fairly recently, and I enjoy the story a lot. Some interesting concepts of Family Magic in it. NOT canon-compliant starting from Prisoner.

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
