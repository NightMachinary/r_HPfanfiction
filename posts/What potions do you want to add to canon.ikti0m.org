What potions do you think belong in the wizarding world, that we don't hear about in canon?

Have you encountered any potions in fics that seem like they legitimately fit into canon?


** A contraceptive potion; because with a massive castle full of horny teenagers, it's probably a small miracle that a day-care centre wasn't added on at some point.

*** And have there be two kinds, one for men and another for women.

The women's one is an old invention, and works very well, but like muggle birth control pills they have to take them with consistent regularity (maybe even down the the exact minute, because magic is a blessing and a curse).

The men's one is newer, also very reliable, but guys always ‘forget' to use it because it ‘doesn't feel as good when they use it'.

** Modified aging potion that works on plants, let seeds soak in it, and as soon as they're put into the ground they grow a sizeable plant. Inspired by something Miraculix did in the Asterix where Cesar tried to beat the village by gentrification (Mansions of the gods in English, Trabantenstadt auf Deutsch). Can be used for rapid forest growth, but the instantly growing tree can be somewhat dangerous to the planter. Planting could also be done more rapidly by loading potion coated acorns into airsoft guns attached to drones.

** I've read a couple pics where there is an ancestry potion. Essentially, user adds blood to the potion and it is poured into a piece of paper and writes out users ancestry. Usually used on super powerful Harry fics, but it seems like a potion that would fit into canon given pureblood obsession with ancestry

*** I'm . . . not so sure about that. Canon Blood Purist seem to be obessed with their ancestry, and love boasting about it, but their whole ideology also lie on a foundation of hypocrisy. I mean, most Death Eater know that Voldemort is a Half Blood (since he talked about his muggle father in front of them), but they still follow him as the champion of the Pureblood cause.

Umbridge may be the most extrem about it, but I doubt she is the only one hinding some secret about heir family tree. A potion like this would be just terrible for the Blood Purist (unless there is a way to modify the results).

** Lots of aesthetic potions. Wanna change your hair color? Eye color? Skin color? Hair shape(as in, make it more wavy, curly, etc)? Sure, you could easily do the same things with spells, but unlike the spell version, the potion induced changes would become inherent and permanent to you. There would be no way to reverse them.

**** It just bugs me greatly that Veritaserum is the only one we ever hear about despite the fact that Snape, from memory at least, mentions that it's the most powerful truth serum and a drop or two at dinner would have Harry spilling his secrets.. It indicates that lesser serums exist, which i find interesting..

** It'd be interesting if there was a potion that was similar to heroin. Humans can get addicted to horrible substances, why would it be different for wizards? They must have a black market for this sort of thing. Or maybe one of the raw ingredients for a particular potion is highly addictive so they brew the potion as a cover.

A more positive one would be a potion to resolve hunger. It's like lembas bread in LotR. Patients who are unconscious in St. Mungos will need a way to "eat" so this potion could be like an IV drip and nourishing meal all in one.

One thing I want to see more of in fics are sloppy potions that don't work as they should, or are not effective because they were incorrectly brewed. There are times when the author whips out a potion to resolve a plot hole and it comes off feeling unrealistic- unless the potion was brewed by an expert. Harry and friends making potions? Have it backfire, it would be interesting. :)
