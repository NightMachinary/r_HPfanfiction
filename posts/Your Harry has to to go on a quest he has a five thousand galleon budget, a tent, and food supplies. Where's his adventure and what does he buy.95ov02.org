** Destroying Voldemort's horcruxes and slaying him did not put an end to the Dark Lord's ambitions. Even now, in the darkness of the beyond, the malice and thirst for power emanating from his ruined soul draws hundreds, thousands of otherworldly beasts to his banner.

Now, decades after his second defeat, the spirit of Voldemort crawls out of Tartarus, backed by an army of monsters freed from imprisonment. They seek to cross the River Styx, the great river (or is it an ocean) in the spirit world that separates the land of the dead from the land of the living, and re-emerge into the mortal world once more.

With this ghostly fleet, thousands strong, Harry Potter will claim the captain's hat, take the helm, and halt the advance of Voldemort's horde across the waters of the Styx, saving Wizarding Britain and the world from an invasion of long-dead monsters.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (some fluff, no bashing, not power wank.)

** Seeing as 5 k galleon is like 5 billion USD/Euro, remember Weasleys were able to buy supplies for all of their children for 1 galleon, (second year)

  There was a

  very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one

  gold Galleon. Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners

  before sweeping the whole lot into her bag. Harry felt

  even worse when they reached his vault.

*** Wizarding economy works quite different from ours. Most things like books are basically free to make, so they cost only a few cents. A wand costs 7 galleons, so a galleon can't really be that much. And don't you think a million dollars is a bit much for school supplies?

**** That's the nominal exchange rate set by Gringotts, but it doesn't mean the purchasing power of 5k galleons is the same as £25k. There are indications that 1000 galleons will take you a lot further than £5000: Fred and George were able to use this amount to launch a successful business, including the manufacture of a large quantity of stock and a lease on a property in wizarding Britain's central business district.

In Muggle central London, £5000 would rent you around 2 square feet of commercial space.

***** IMHO the only thing that we really can compare directly is the price of the newspapers. A Muggle newspaper back then (early 1990s) should've been about 25p; the /Prophet/ is canonically 1 Knut according to Wikia, which is pretty much a factor-of-25 difference at canonical exchange rates.

Presumably, he has been dispatched by Hermione on some ambassadorial role with nonhumans. Considering the tent, I would probably go for the Forbidden Forest --- either the Acromantulas (in which case he buys a bunch of protection just in case), or the Centaurs (in which case he buys them gift bows and magical parchment).
