Blackadder was a BBC show in the 80s, with Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Laurie, among others.


** [[https://youtu.be/HpTova4Cdbw?t=487][Baldrick]]: "Please sir, don't kill me! I have a cunning plan to save Buckbeak!"

*Blackadder*: "Well forgive me if I don't do a cartwheel of joy. Your family's record in the Department of Cunning Planning is about as impressive as Stumpy O'Leg McNoLeg's personal best in the Ottery St. Catchpole marathon. .....Alright what's the plan?

*Blackadder*: "A...pumpkin is going to save the hippogriff?"

*Baldrick*: "Ah, but here, I have one that I prepared earlier. I will balance it on Buckbeak's head, like this. Then I'll cover his real head with a cloak. Then when I execute him, instead of cutting off his real head, I'll cut off the pumpkin and the hippogriff survives!"

*Blackadder*: "I'm...not sure it's going to work, Baldrick. Because once you cut it off, you have to hold it up in front of the Minister and say 'This is the head of a Ferret killer," at which point he'll shout back, 'No it's not; it's a large pumpkin with a pathetic pine cone beak!"

*Baldrick*: "I suppose it's not one hundred percent convincing."

*Blackadder*: "It's not one percent convincing. However, I am a busy man and can't be bothered hex you at the moment. Here is my wand, kindly run towards it as fast as you can."
