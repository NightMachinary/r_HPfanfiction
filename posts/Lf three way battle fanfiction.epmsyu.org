I don't remember much about the fic. All I remember is that there was a three way battle between harry,Voldemort and Dumbledore. But they end up having to fight against another enemy. Note:what I describe above takes part in a single scene, in a single chapter if I remember correctly. It takes place somewhere around the middle of the fic,not at the end. In the end after they defeat the enemy,they agreed on a truce and decide to fight another day.
