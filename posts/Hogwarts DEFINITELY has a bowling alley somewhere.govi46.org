Considering how easy it is to conjure such a thing, Dumbledore's long tenure as headmaster, and his love for ten pin bowling, there MUST be a bowling alley somewhere hidden within Hogwarts.

Fred and George have probably been there.


** Dude it's in the dungeon across the hall from the kitchens entrance, Hufflepuff house hosts a bowling tournament Tuesday nights. It how the prefects kept the twins and Seamus Finnegan From burning down the castle, The bowling alley is in the old 1940s Reinforced basement bomb shelter Dumbledore's predecessor created just in case the Muggles accidentally dropped a bomb in the vicinity of Hogwarts as they weren't quite sure how the ward would hold up against modern rocketry. Dumbledore height converted to a bowling alley in the 1960s. The Hogwarts bowling league Has become notorious in the last few decades throughout the international magical community, They are known for somehow accidentally turning their competitors bowling balls into pigeons At every international bowling tournament Hogwarts enters they've been banned from the European bowling league for the last decade because of it the judges got sick of cleaning pigeon excrement off their hats.

â€‹

The bowling alley is also home to the only place in Hogwarts where you can sing karaoke and not be judged horribly. It makes for a great date night according to many alumni so long as you bribe the right Hufflepuff to give you the password.

  Harry's attraction to Parvati leads him to take his Yule Ball preparation much more seriously and his night is changed as a result. Includes an awesome Ron, an interesting Parvati and a drunk Katie Bell. Oh, and what's a Yule Ball fic without a little Fleur Delacour?

** The Game Boy version of Chamber of Secrets had a mini-game in it during Sir Nick's death-day party. That mini-game was bowling with heads. It was quite fun but also way to easy, you could keep controlling the bowling-head a-la Wii Fit even after thrown.

*** Yeah, but they're ghosts' heads, not balls. I'm sure the ghosts have some influence over which way their heads roll. The cheaters.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13388022/1/Albus-and-Harry-s-World-Trip][/Albus and Harry's World Trip/]] describes where Albus really keeps his bowling alley.

It also does a fair job addressing a lot of the plot inconsistencies in the books.
