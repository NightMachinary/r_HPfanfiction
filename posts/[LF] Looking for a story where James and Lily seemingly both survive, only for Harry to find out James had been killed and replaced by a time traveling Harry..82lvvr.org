  Caught between life and death at King's Cross, Harry chooses to go back---but Dumbledore never told him where or when. Harry once again faces the Darkest Lord there ever was, with allies both old and new at his side. The magic of Prophecy remains strong even through the vagaries of space and time---only now, Harry's been Marked by more than just Voldemort... DH divergence, time travel.

** I had an idea for a story where harry's mind travels back in time and takes over his father's body when he 'dies' in an incident as a child. He has to live his father's life to make sure he exists. The fauxcest idea delighted the crap outta me
