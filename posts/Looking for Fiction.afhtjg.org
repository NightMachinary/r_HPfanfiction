Hello, I read a Tomione Fiction and unfortunately, I cannot find it. If anyone know anything, please let me know.

Please excuse if this summary is all over the place, I'm trying to remember every detail to help narrow the search.

*Takes place post-war; Hermione is investigating an killer with the same MO (targets families, always kills the mother and leaves the baby the alive with lighting scar like Harry). Mind you, Voldemort is still alive and has now created an new identity to get close to Hermione. He actually developed an obsession with her and changes how he kills his victim. It's kind of dark especially the last chapter I've read where he kills the random muggleborn mother who looks like Hermione.

Edit*

Found it! AO3

Title: Second Chances by Anonymous

Summary Tom Riddle has never been one for mediocraty, so when given the chance, he seeks out the one person able to tell him the future; a blind hag living in the Black Forest of Germany. However, he does not like what he is told one bit. How is he supposed to change it and who the bloody hell does this Hermione Granger think she is? My completely late post to the Tomione Fest 2018 contest!!! *still a work in progress
