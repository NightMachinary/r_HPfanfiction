** Enjoyed it.\\
Admittedly I've only read one Sherlock homes store, A study in Scarlet I think.\\
So I have no idea who Moriarty is, but I still greatly enjoyed it.

** So Sherlock says something without actually giving reasoning/we can't look in his head to see what his rationale was and how he found out these things. I think this is another case of a non-genius writing a genius. He is a Muggle, yet he somehow manages to find things from thin-air in a nigh-wizardlike fashion, it makes no sense and is inconsistent with his character.

**** You mean other than his entire analysis to the police on Amelia Bones' death? He said a bunch of things with exact and precise detail, yet we don't see how. Like, Sherlock says that the one that killed her was the tallest one, is this because of any particular point she has on her body marked by a spell, where the angle could only be done by someone very tall? Or how about, how he even knows Voldemort's shoe size? Is there a slight imprint on the carpet? I don't understand how he found out anything he did from the Crime scene, yet somehow the police does.

***** Height, fingernail length, shoe size ... these are all things which Sherlock Holmes regularly is able to discern in-canon. There could be more explanation in that scene, true, but it's more like a mini-prologue than a scene, so that hardly seems necessary, since the sort of details Sherlock gives are exactly the type he is usually able to find on crime scene.

Yes, but he usually finds them in a normal crime-scene, not a magical crime scene where the cause of death is completely unknown.

******** No, the cause of death is usually known, it's how it happened, who did it, etc... that is the mystery.

********* Ah, no. Sometimes the cause of death is known, sometimes it isn't. I refer you to the Adventure of the Devil's Foot, where the cause of death was a primary aspect of the mystery.

But that debate seems rather beside the point. The real issue is catching the murderer. And please tell me how an unusual weapon would prevent Sherlock Holmes from deducing things from the environment? I'm not even sure what the cause of death has to do with that. All the unknown cause of death does is prevent Sherlock from perhaps - figuring out that the murder weapon was a sawed off shotgun or something, it has nothing to do with the other evidence at the scene

*** The whole premise of the scene is not that the wizards couldn't figure it out, but that Scotland Yard was stumped. And what to you mean 'that's it'? The thing isn't to know that a wizard murdered her (which Scotland Yard didn't) it's to catch the murderer!
