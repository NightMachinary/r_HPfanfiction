so many fics exaggerate the abuse in canon but i was wondering are there any fics that have canon level abuse but harry actually suffers the consequences of said abuse rather than brushing it off easily within a few chapters


** Linkao3(Grey Space) is pretty good: it's an au where Hogwarts starts at 14 rather than 11, so Harry goes to Stonewall High for three years.

** Saving Harry by The Seeker

I think this is exactly what you're looking for. It's all the abuse Harry canonically went through, but with realistic results.

Don't read it in one sitting if you don't want to be infected with uncontrollably leaking eyes.

Though, it's Hinny if you don't like that.

**** Not to argue, just curious, my biggest problem with Hinny is just that theres not much there so its hard to have strong feelings one way or the other. How did you come by such profound hatred?

  I can't stand Harry/Ginny because I never felt any real chemistry. We are shown what most characters are like, we are told what Ginny is like, and for most of the books she doesn't interact much with him. Again, this might have been a deliberate choice to build up Ginny without giving the final pair away, but the result is it seems Harry doesn't care much for Ginny's company for most of the books. She's supposedly Hermione's best female friend, Ron's closest sibling in age and likely emotionally, Harry's visited her house multiple times for weeks, and they still didn't get on- Harry was uncomfortable in her presence for the first half of the books and did not even think of speaking to Ginny in Book 5 when worrying about possession by Voldemort.

  Ginny's characterization was the worst in the whole series and her actress in the films was the weakest of the main cast in my opinion.Her personality does a total flip between GOF and OoTP- in the early books Ginny was shy and somewhat polite even in interactions with characters other than Harry, but suddenly in Book 5 she's popular, and good at quidditch, and a powerful witch. I was never convinced Harry had anything more than a physical appreciation for her and I am utterly unconvinced that she saw him as anything utter than the boy-who -lived, and for a story contingent on the conquering power of true love that's absolutely fucking pathetic.

Sorry for taking so long to get back to you- I remembered your comment but didn't have free time to fully articulate my thoughts until Festivus and when I was asked my opinion on ships generally I thought you'd enjoy the Hinny section. Feel free to check out my recent comments for the full breakdown of HP shipping, if you care too.

P.S. I read the HP books when I was roughly Harry's age at the beginning and I had been embarrassed by unreciprocated crushes so Ginny's antics really got to me in CoS as I was so hooked to Harry as an avatar. This probably contributes a lot to my dislike of her character, although the enumerated rational reasons are hopefully a bigger factor.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.
