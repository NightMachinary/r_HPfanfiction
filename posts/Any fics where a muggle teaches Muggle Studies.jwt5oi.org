** "Welcome class. Unfortunately, we are short on teachers, especially muggle knowledgeable ones. Voldemort killed a good number of them las year, including our dear Professor Burbage," Professor McGonagall lowered her head, "So, rest assured, we got what we could. Without more to add, I want you to give a warm welcome to your new Muggle Studies teacher, Professor Dursleys," professor McGonagall sighed.

A beefy man stood in the Great Hall, twitching his walrus moustache.

"But, he's a muggle!" A voice wailed from the Gryffindor table. It was Hermione.

"And one of the few who can come here without breaking the Statute of Secrecy, for Professor Dursley is quite aware of the existence of wizardkind and has been so for many years."

"He's a horrible man!" Hermione yelled.

"Meh, We've had worse," said Seamus, with a shrug.

"That's debatable," protested Ginny.

"Enough! Mr Dursley is now a member of this staff and should be treated with respect." Said Professor McGonagall. "Now, Professor, some words?"

Vernon Dursley cleared his throat, "Ehm, Yeah. Listen, you, I don't like you and you won't like me. But they promised to pay me well to tell you about drills and some gubbins, so here I am. I will have anything... funny... going on in my class, or I'll see to discipline. The caretaker already offered to help me with that, a good man, ugly as he is."

Filch nodded in the back, a wide smile came to him.

*** /During class/

Random student raises hand after listening to Vernon drone on a few lessons, "wait, aren't we gonna use our wands?"

Vernon's eye twitched. "Why would you need those?"

"This is literally a magical sch-"

*** Good fic. Too bad it has a love triangle, the one thing that I hate reading about, even more than Lord Potter Black.

Anyone who doesn't mind that should check it out.

** These are usually either Dursleys (in various permutations) or Grangers, but let me suggest one very original (and well written) story: “The Divide by Beedle” linkffn(13022404). Main characters are OCs, and it is one of many examples how much it helps to any story when it moves out of Hogwarts and tries to be original.

  9/6/20-NEW CHAPTER! They're coming quicker now! - Professor Snape makes an unlikely friend in spite of himself, or maybe because of Albus. She may be a Muggle, but he slowly realizes what an amazing Muggle she is. It's such a shame that people need to think of Severus Snape as the greasy, grumpy, bat of the dungeons. (Orig story/Snape's POV/OC worked in w/o changing canon)
