I've been getting into Harry interacting with his parents. I'm looking for fics where Harry is either sent back to their time or they are sent forward. I would like his identity to be revealed at some point. Must be complete and I'd prefer multi-chapters. Any rating. Thanks!

** linkffn(Timely Errors) is decent, although I don't think his parents ever found out who he was (Dumbledore knew). The author's other work is worth a read, too.

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

  Hermione Granger thought that she could not possibly be surprised by anything anymore, but Theodore Nott arriving at the safe house with a perilous, last-ditch solution to the nearly-lost war against Voldemort isn't even the most unbelievable thing. The most unbelievable thing is that Theo is supposed to be dead. **The Order is losing the War. Most are dead and the ones remaining are sure to follow. Theodore Nott has a solution. Give up everything to win it all back. It's simply not the Slytherin way to run head-first at a problem, and Hermione is ready to try anything. His solution? A bit more cunning. It's one thing to run straight at the King and hope for the best, but perhaps the solution is to get rid of the pawns- one by one- first.
