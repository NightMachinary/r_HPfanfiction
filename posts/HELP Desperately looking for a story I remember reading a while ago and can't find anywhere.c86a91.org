:END:
I am looking for a Harry Potter Fanfiction that I cannot seem to locate anywhere. I don't remember the name of the story or the author, but I have an idea of what the story started with.

It's a time travel flick. Harry/Hermione pairing. Hermione is hit by a spell during what would be the 7th book and is flung back to the Marauders era. She is described as being very malnourished and skinny, and Sirious especially becomes very defensive of her. Lily/James tell Dumbledore, and they all decide to keep her identity a secret. She figures out that Harry will also be coming back to this time, but on a delayed timer compared to her. When he comes back in time, I believe he had just defeated Voldemort. Together, they begin to work to undermine Voldemort's efforts in the time in an attempt to lower the casualties in the war. Harry is described as a cousin of James who transferred to Hogwarts when he comes back. Feel good moments meeting his mom/dad and has tension with Sirius over his relationship with Hermione.

Eventually I believe they get pulled back to their time, but I am kinda hazy on anything nearing past when Harry arrives. Please help, Fanfiction hivemind, you're my only hope.


** Keep in mind I haven't read this story, but the summary sounds like it might match.
