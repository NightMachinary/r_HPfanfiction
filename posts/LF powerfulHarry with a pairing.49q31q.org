essentially a story that has a well-trained badass harry with romance, pairing can be anyone as long as it's not a slash and an OC. No time-travel and soul bonds please. Preferably Complete or at least not abandoned.

Perfect examples of fics i'm looking for are like;

** *Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650), will be finished by the end of this week. It starts out as a super Harry/Ginny taking on Voldemort, but changes to something very different and dark.

** I'm reading linkff(Magicks of the Arcane) at the moment, and although I'm around 17 chapters in at the moment and there is still no "actual" pairing it is definitely working up to a Harry/Fleur by the looks of things

*** I'm gonna have to give this a read. Harry/Fleur is on of my favorite parings. I also like a stronger Harry as well. Any other Fleur/Harry stories you recommend? I prefer longer stories but if it's shorter with sequels I don't mind. Cheers!

**** linkffn(When A Veela Cries) is my first and favorite Harry/Fleur. Although it's heavily AU and not for the faint of heart as it gets pretty dark, the romance is solid and was good enough to make me ship them.

such a shame its incomplete and the author hasn't updated in a while but i highly recommend it too harry/fleur shippers

***** I read this at the beginning of last summer. It was one if the first good Harry/Fleur stories I read. Before that I'd just read some bad cliche veela bond fic. This fic is definitely pretty dark though. If I remember correctly it was pretty angsty as well which can get annoying but overall a good fic. Wish it would update.

**** linkffn(Harry Potter and The Veela), linkffn(Knowledge is Power). I gonna be honest I do not remember how good those stories were but they are saved under Harry/Fleur in my collection. I think the former where kinda cringeworthy.

linkffn(Euphoria) is a neat Harry/Fleur but overall not the most outstanding story (but many times better than its summary). Definitely worth a read here.

linkffn(What You Leave Behind) promised Harry/Fleur but has yet to deliver, but the story is awsone enough on itself.

There is also linkffn(Letters). A good Harry/Fleur if i remember correctly. And of course [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/10191925/1][How Fleur Delacour Seduced Me AKA: I'm a Lucky, Lucky Man (revised)]] for the best smut story outta there.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
