***** And really, that's all Harry wants. He doesn't care about himself, he sees his parents and thinks that they have lost everything, and that he hasn't sacrificed even a fraction of what they have. His suffering is nothing compared to his parents'.

I think bittersweet would be the best ending too.

** linkffn(The Malfoy Case) is just finishing up. I liked the earlier chapters better than a couple of the latter ones, but it is still a damn good story.

linkffn(Etc, Etc and Life Goes On). A fitting end to that trainwreck of a romance. Really great stuff.

linkffn(Phantom Limb by rbackwards) updated after more than three years. It's on my re-read list now because I don't remember the particulars of the story, but I hope the writing style is as delightful as I remember.

linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) has been solid for a while now, and the latest update was no exception.

linkffn(Lovers and Liars by Nightmare Prince) is a trainwreck of a story, but it is a well written one that I enjoy nonetheless.

linkffn(Dreams and Darkness Collide by Epic Solemnity). As entertaining as overpowered Psychopath!Harry can get, I suppose.

linkffn(Of Bare Feet and Blubbering Humdingers by A Million Ways) provided another entertaining chapter. One of the very few multi-chapter Ron/Luna stories in the fandom.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** I usually read completed fanfics, but there are two Harry Potter ongoings.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - The fourth part of Harry Potter x Nasuverse x Some other things crossover. It has everything you may want and more. Two Voldemorts, rapist tanukis, Triwizard Tournament taking place in Durmstrang and more enemies than you can count. The direction of the story is mainly dictated by users voting on Beast's Lair forum, which results in rather big unpredictability. It's best to have some basic knowledge of Nasuverse (knowing Fate/Zero is probably the most useful for this series), but the author introduces all important concepts and informations.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531][You should start with the first part]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] - Harry Potter isn't the Boy-Who-Lived (or is he), his parents dumped him with his muggle relatives and are generally terrible (or maybe not), and his brother is an idiot (actually this is partially true). Of course with a life like that he could only end up in Slytherin. And as we all well know, Slytherins are actually nice people. For example one of the prefects to kill or imperius Draco, so he won't bother Harry and his friends. Fair warning, the beginning kind of sucks.

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions.

  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return. Rated M, so once again if you are easily offended, just don't read it.

  Curiosity killed the cat, they say. But satisfaction brought it back. A few years after the war Hermione is a widely respected academic about to start her latest research project. To see its completion, however, she will truly have to venture into the unknown. Cissy/Hermione pairing in due time. Might turn M in later chapters.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

** Linkffn(The Irony by awakethelion) has animagus!Hermione. If you've ever read Vixen (another SSHG), they both have some similar plot points.

Linkffn(Where the Moon Isn't by sarakitty) has werewolf!Hermione

Linkffn(Reckless by Lucrece01) is a save-Snape-by-marrying-him, which you can't tell through the "summary".

Linkffn(Of Ravens and Writing Desks by blood.stained.lies) is Sherlock/Hermione

I think The Irony is my favourite, simply because there aren't a lot of animagus!hermione out there.

  "Is this a dream?" she whispered as she felt his warm breath against her shoulder grow ragged and felt him reach to remove a few hairs from her face. He drew her closer to himself and pulled the blanket over both of them, silently as always, and resumed those agonising ministrations. He kissed her neck once more, then the spot between her shoulders and stroked her sides tenderly...

  Werewolf!Hermione. Remione. In which there are strange magical happenings, time and dimension travel, and other wolfy things. "Hermione mused, in some detached part of her brain, over how fitting it was that she was going to die on Friday the 13th. She'd never been much of a superstitious person, so she supposed this was life's cruel way of punishing her with the irony."
