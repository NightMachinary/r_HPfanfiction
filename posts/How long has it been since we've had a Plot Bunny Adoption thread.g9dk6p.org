I feel like I haven't seen one in a while, so apologies if there has been one and I missed it. But if not...

*Welcome to the Plot Bunny Adoption Centre!*

This is a thread to post fic ideas that you have but can't find the time or inspiration to work on, or just want to see what another writer's take on it would entail.

Keep in mind that if you post a plot idea here, other people are able to use it. On the other side though, if you like a plot bunny, it's always polite to check in with it's owner about using it.

Hopefully this will generate a lot of good discussion and maybe even the start of some decent fanfiction!

** I'll start with an idea that I haven't managed to get off the ground yet:

When Professor McGonagall is watching the Dursley's for the day, she sees an upset baby Dudley perform accidental magic, and let's Dumbledore know this when he arrives. This prompts Dumbledore to *actually have a conversation with the Dursleys* instead of just leaving a bloody letter.

In my mind, this then branches off into a few different possibilities:

1. Petunia and Vernon are so shocked by the fact Dudley is magic that they demand Albus take both boys away, and state quite emphatically that neither of them will have a home here. Dumbledore now needs to find a new family willing to take in not only the Boy-who-lived, but also his muggleborn cousin

2. Petunia and Vernon decide to keep the boys and stamp the magic out of them both, resulting in two abused children attending Hogwarts, with maybe one of the two being more brave and looking out for the other. I think it'd be really cool to have a very shy Dudley with a fiercely protective brother figure in Harry

3. Petunia and Vernon keep Dudley, either spoil or abuse him, but Harry is sent to a different home, with people who actually treat him well. It'd be very interesting to write the dynamic between a healthy, well-adjusted Harry and his recently discovered muggleborn cousin who was neglected in some way (either over-indulged or treated like Harry was in Canon)

Anyways, that's the bunny so far. Or maybe it's three bunnies...

Let me know what you think!

***** Arabella Figg would probably be the best option. She's already lives next door to the Dursley's, knows about magic, can live in the Magical or Muggle World, and with Dumbledore wanting Harry to have a "normal" life before Hogwarts, Figg being able to live in the Muggle World but keeping the two boys in the loop about magic, would be ideal.

Bill Weasley could be another option. Doesn't live with his family, works as a Curse Breaker, so he'd have odd hours, but he could also have Molly and Arthur babysit, instead of just having them raise the boys. Plus Bill would be able to protect the house with ease, with his knowledge on such spells.

****** I kinda disagree with those two, for a couple reasons. Arabella Figg has no experience raising kids, let alone two magical children. It's also implied that she moved to Little Whinging after Harry was placed with the Dursleys to keep an eye on him. Even if she was there before, if Petunia and Vernon didn't want to raise the kids, I doubt they'd be to pleased if the boys ended up living down the road from them. Overall she just doesn't seem like a good fit to me.

As for Bill well, all I'll say is at the time Harry and Dudley would need to be placed, young Bill was very much looking forward to the year after, when he'd be attending Hogwarts for the first time.

******* Arabella could always move away from the Dursley's, that wouldn't be too much of an issue, depending on how much money she has; of course. Also we know nothing about her past, she could be very experienced with raising, or helping to raise kids.

As for Bill, you have a point there. I didn't think about that.

Mhm, Remus would be out because he's a Werewolf. Severus would be out, just on principle, for how much I love Severus raising Harry stories, it just wouldn't happen in real canon, or even close to canon. Andromeda might be willing to help out, though after raising Nymphadora, she might not want to raise any more kids. I don't trust Augusta Longbottom, after what Neville went through.

Nymphadora would be a similar issue as Bill, at that point she'd be young still, and might at least be starting out as an Auror, if not still at Hogwarts.

Could always make it AU with the Flamels, though I don't know how much they'd be willing to raise kids at that age.

I doubt that Dumbledore would be willing to have the kids be raised at Hogwarts, if so he would have taken Tom Riddle Jr out of the orphanage the moment he saw where he was going.

Kingsley could be ideal, he's an Auror, he'd be able to protect Harry, he'd have odd hours because of his job, but again could ask Molly and Arthur to babysit, which I'm sure they'd be willing to do. Or even Andromeda or the like, if in a pinch.

***** The son of Dorea and Charlus? Or even Charlus himself? There's nothing that indicates they are dead and they are likely distant Potter relatives. Their questionable allegiance and the distance of their relationship (1st cousin once removed or second cousin) is why Harry never met them in canon. My headcanon is that Charlus was a Percy-like black sheep who adopted the soft bigotry of the establishment which put him at odds with his family of muggle/muggleborn advocates, hence why Dorea was not blasted off the tree. But maybe by 1981 he's had a change of heart?

** I've had this idea for ages where Voldemort won the war, forcing most of the people on the light side to flee to other countries. Harry goes into self-imposed exile out of shame, and not even Ron or Hermione can find him. Years later, Ron and Hermiones daughter (She doesn't have to be called Rose, this is an alternate timeline) manages to track him down and convinces him to return and fight. They rally the Order again, take the fight to Voldemort, and win, although Harry is mortally wounded, he gets to spend one last moment with Ron and Hermione before he passes.

Some other notes to go along with it.

- Voldenort wins partly by securing his Horcruxes.

- Harry carries a war wound from losing to Voldemort the first time, something like missing an arm.

- Everyone initially fled to Europe, but Voldenort slowly began to take that over, forcing them to flee to other countries.

- Harry went into exile in the mountains, either the Alps or the Himalayas.

- Rose is about 19 when she tracks down Harry.

** where lucius malfoy is the sports rich frat boy. it's why he's friends with everyone upper class. it's not just money and privilege but shared interests.

he'd be the kind of guy who made a full event of going to a puddlemere game spent his time at the dinner table talking with draco about drafts and formations. head deep in a paper every day looking up the bulgarian league games to discuss with Crabbe senior/ and Nott senior if Ireland has a chance this year. and all the while Narcissa is quietly running his finances and political endeavours with an indulgent smile. and the whole death eater attack after the world cup is them having been completely wasted from celebrating the irish victory and are letting off some steam.

i always thought it was an interesting dichotomy about how southern racists love american football and are deeply appreciative of the game and individual players despite their tendency to be black.

like Lucius would champion a muggleborn before the fucking wizengamot if she was a competent seeker for his home team.

secondly i wish his rivalry with arthur came not from a political hatred of blood traitors but like an old school quidditch rivalry. or and i think this idea is hilarious an old romantic rivalry over either molly or narcissa.

** One thing I've always wanted to see is that the Malfoys help Harry onto the platform instead of the Weasleys, and treat him the same way Molly did. A similar but separate idea is that Harry isn't prejudiced against slytherin (and by extension malfoy) from the very beginning, and ends up in slytherin. Or literally just anything that involves taking Harry from the dursleys early, blood magic be damned, and fostered with a magical family.

It can easily fix two of my major problems with the series. Slytherins basically being faceless evil bad guys as well as Harry actually acting slytherin in some way. He does have clever moments but like it's the house of cunning and ambition and uh he just doesnt rlly show that much even though that's the first choice.

And it's fine not to have ambition cuz the house isnt just that. The problem is he doesnt really show much cunning from what I remember.

Yeah personality traits arent fixed but like we are told those traits are there and they are basically never even mentioned again. It's just annoying for this potential to be there and its just like not mentioned and that's painful.

He could have come out of it all completely downtrodden but instead is looking forward to a fresh start at Stonewall High. He wants to make friends and the train's barely left before he has one, sort of thing.

I'll admit that it's a bit of a stretch, however. A bit like Albus Severus being in Slytherin yet seeming more Gryffindor than anything. I could understand the idea of the houses not being nearly as split personality-wise as made out (I strongly suspect this is the case) but I don't think that was where JKR was going.

It's annoying because a house of people who are ambitious and cunning could be so much more than how shallow it actually seems.

Like nobody needs to be a carbon copy perfect example but it honestly doesnt seem like slytherin characters were given the chance to be developed enough for them to be different.

******** Yep, it's deeply uncomfortable how even many adults in the series suggest they are uncomfortable with children sorted into Slytherin. When we look at the size of Voldemort's inner circle, it's simply not possible that the majority of Slytherin's were involved.

Once you get outside that circle, you fall into the 'you don't know who you can trust' zone. I suppose that's probably a fair write up of people, though. There's nothing to stop someone being an extremely loyal bigot, after all.

I mean, what were Crabbe and Goyle's personality traits?

All the houses, save Gryffindor were quite weak, really. Even then, Gryffindor was essentially a demonstration of how most characters had traits from other houses.

** I have /so many/, but here are some highlights:

- Harry gets access to the memories in his scarcrux, and development of Occlumency allows him to access his own early memories. He's aware of how things were at the end of the last war, and is uncertain about whether to even bother with Wizarding Britain. He decides to attend Hogwarts, at least for his first year, to get a feel for how Wizarding Britain responded to Voldemort's defeat, and whether it's worth fighting for when Voldemort returns. He'll certainly find a few people worth protecting, but how will he judge the society itself?
- Somehow, the Wizengamot and/or the general Wizarding public get a complete and detailed accounting of the events of the graveyard (Pensieve memory played at Harry's hearing?). One of the Darker pureblood lords stands and, after reaffirming his belief in the importance of blood purity and the superiority of purebloods over other wizards (and wizards over Muggles), calls out the Death Eaters as the /real/ blood-traitors. After all, here are a bunch of purebloods debasing themselves before a lowly half-blood son of a Muggle, and murdering other purebloods for refusing to do the same. Now the Death Eaters have new opponents - the Dark families.
- They say that those we love will always remain a part of us even after they're gone. For Master of Death Harry Potter, this is a far more literal statement. He carries the souls of departed loved ones within him, and they're far from silent, conversing with him and with each other, and often influencing his behavior and personality. Having outlived pretty much everybody he's ever known, his head can be a very noisy place. At times, he can be distant yet strangely insightful, bossy and axiomatic, or even just hungry and craving a chess game.
- The war ended, and within less than a year most of the people of Wizarding Britain had turned on Harry. /Again/. Now he's in the past, in the body of his younger self, and he's going to do things right this time. No, he's not going to vanquish Voldemort more quickly and efficiently; he's going to basically leave him free rein. He's going to save the people worth saving, and leave the rest to burn.
- Trelawney is deliberately teaching Divination poorly, with the intent of lessening people's belief in Seers and thus helping protect those that truly have the Gift. She herself is a gifted Seer, but the constant influx of what-may-be is just too overwhelming, so she drinks to keep her Inner Eye closed. Should a Battle of Hogwarts occur, she'll sober up for the fight, using her gift to fight with foreknowledge of the enemy's moves and of where she can make the greatest difference.
- Phoenixes are born not of other phoenixes, but when a magical being of extraordinary character and purity of heart dies. The Order of the Phoenix is (unbeknownst to any but its founder) named not for Fawkes, but for Dumbledore, who has convinced himself that he'll become a phoenix. For decades, being reborn as a phoenix has been one of his main goals, though he also tries to encourage others to behavior that he believes would help them towards a phoenix rebirth. This is also why he has no fear of death - he honestly expects it to turn him into a phoenix - and why he seems so intent on reforming everyone: He both wants to give them a chance at phoenix rebirth, and considers redeeming evil people "light" and thus part of his journey to becoming a phoenix himself.
- Deathly Hallows indicates that there is no separate Heaven or Hell in the Potterverse, just an afterlife where the punishment for misdeeds is the damage they did to your own soul. Merope Gaunt's punishment for raping Tom Riddle Sr. is to first watch the horrors perpetrated by the child of that union, then spend eternity caring for the eight mutilated fragments of her beloved son's soul, forever wishing but unable to ease his pain. Could work well as a horror/tragedy oneshot.
- When Harry is first introduced to the Ministry of Magic, he's told that they handle keeping the magical world secret, but as the series progresses they turn out to be more of a full independent government (one which clearly doesn't follow the laws of the UK, and at least borders on autocracy). This idea is: The Ministry was /originally/ founded as a secret government agency/department/organization/whatever with the stated mission of maintaining the Statute of Secrecy, but since that time, they've been gradually (and past a point technically illegally) expanding both their role and their authority, while cutting away the ties binding them to the rest of the British government. Nowadays, very few in Her Majesty's government know about magic, and though they know that the current Ministry is flouting a large number of important British and international laws, they can't really do anything about it without risking a full-scale conflict with magicals. It doesn't help that, every time the British PM confronts the current Minister for Magic about the illegality of their Ministry and its actions, they tend to forget about the entire issue (even if other people still remember and have records).
- Occlumency is meant to protect the user's mind from external intrusion and influence while granting said user greater control over their own mind and emotions. What if there's a downside to this? What if, the more you master and use Occlumency, the more resistant you become to new information, ideas, opinions, etc.? In this concept, Occlumency tends to result in the gradual ossification of the user's thought processes, making it harder and less likely for them to change their mind or their plans. This might explain how, no matter what happens, all Snape sees when he looks at Harry is a mini-James, or how Dumbledore and/or Voldemort might keep trying the same thing or attempting to salvage the same plan despite repeated failures.

*And Crossover Ideas!*

- The Second Blood War wasn't won as quickly and decisively as in canon. Instead, the fighting began to spread to other countries and other populations, eventually pulling in even Muggles and nonhumans. New would-be conquerors arose across the globe, each preaching their own version of a genetic utopia. This period of war and devastation would echo down the centuries, and later referred to as "The Eugenics Wars"...
- Remus Lupin shares at least the spelling of his last name with a couple of other fictional characters. What if they were actually kin? How would a Remus that's descended from and/or related to a notorious thief change things? Heck, what if a certain modern-day thief bearing that name came along to help out Harry and company, bringing his somewhat eccentric friends with him? In other words, Remus Lupin is related to Arsene Lupin and/or Lupin III.
- Umino Iruka (from Naruto) ends up teaching at Hogwarts. He acts as something of a mentor and genuinely supportive adult to Harry and other outcasts (Neville, Luna, Hermione, etc.), and during the Second Blood War advises the Order as someone with actual military training and wartime experience. Alternate version: ~15-year-old Sakura gets dropped into the summer between Harry's 4th and 5th year, leading to a Harry/Sakura pairing. I recently finished posting my take on the first idea as "Umino Iruka and the Will of Fire" on ffn and AO3, but would love to see others' versions.
- High School DxD crossover. Harry dies for real at the battle of Hogwarts (either Dumbledore was wrong or Harry decided not to come back). A Devil (Rias? Sona? Somebody else?) fills in some of their peerage from the casualties of said battle, starting with Harry. If Harry accepted his death and decided to move on, that could create some serious tension between himself and his new King after they dragged him back from his rest to fight in new battles. Another possible source of tension - I never said that only /defenders/ would get reincarnated.

Deciding that desperate measures are called for, Sirius summons the ghost of a distant uncle/cousin (the Black family tree is a bit of a tumbleweed) to help in the fight against Voldemort. He knows of this particular ancestor thanks to being compared to him by some older relatives: Both were free spirits with a love of pranks and a sometimes cruel and vicious sense of humor, though the latter was far more pronounced in the ancestor.

This ancestor was posthumously cast from the family due to his increasing fondness for Muggle American culture. Choosing to no longer call himself a Black, he went solely by his first name, one completely in line with the family's preference for astronomical names.

As his mother would often shout after his latest bout of antics: Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse!

Sirius becomes rivals with James, and friends with Severus. They lean on each other from shared experiences with bad family, temptations of dark magic, and problems fitting in in Slytherin as a Black that makes it clear he doesnt want to be there and the half blood son of a disgraced Prince.

Eventually Sirius needs to step up to protect Regulus, and begins playing the part of the perfect son like expected of him. Sirius and Snape join Voldemort with intentions of bringing him down from the inside.

** Petunia is asked by Harry after the Battle to come with him to return to Cokeworth for some reason. Most likely, Snape made Harry executor of his will, and particularly he is asked to find any relatives of his father's family and give him all his money (Harry then gets all magical books, Potion material, laboratory etc.). Petunia is thus forced to comfort her past (also, to attend the Snape's funeral) and explain it to Harry.

** First Idea: Remus ends up sitting with Severus and Lily, on his first train ride to Hogwarts.

Second Idea: Sirius is sorted into Slytherin, while Severus is sorted into another house.

Third Idea: Regulus secretly lived, and became a spy for Dumbledore.

Fourth Idea: Harry is Boy Who Lived, but also a Squib.

Fifth Idea: Next Gen story where James, Fred II or whomever else isn't impressed by their family and what they did, but get all excited about bands, or the like. I just imagine, seeing so many "influential" people, would make them immune to acting excited, that people in bands or the like would excite them more.

Sixth Idea: AU Where Remus and/or Tonks ends up surviving to help raise Teddy. Just would be nice to seeing more of those.

Seventh Idea: Sirius comes back from the veil, sometime after the war ends, and gets a trial to prove his innocence.

** I don't have the writing chops or the time to do this justice.

An AU where Merope lives. Riddle is still a psychopath but in a CEO way rather than a bloodthirsty dark lord way. His manipulations have Abraxas Malfoy beat out Eugenia Jenkins for Minister on a campaign based on being tough on the Squib rioters and anti-Muggleborn dogwhistles about "pureblood pride" and "wizarding tradition". They pass policies gradually that reduce the ability of Muggleborns to hold positions of power. Then begin requiring magical children to go to Ministry run schools before Hogwarts age, this gives non-Muggleborns the advantage of more magical education than Muggleborns and it allows the Ministry the ability to indoctrinate children. "Mudblood terrorists" infiltrate the MoM sometime in the late 80s/early 90s and kill several employees who just so happen to be muggle/muggleborn friendly purebloods (Arthur Weasley, James Potter, one or both of the Longbottoms, etc). This massacre is used to justify even more oppressive policies and elevates Bellatrix Lestrange to Head of the DMLE.

Eventually, sometime in the early/mid 90s, the pureblood regime, with their power firmly secured, turns their focus to anti-halfblood policies. Riddle is outed as a halfblood and falls from power and starts building his own resistance. Riddle and Dumbledore + his supporters find themselves reluctant allies.

** A fic where James and Lily live and Harry's brother either is/is thought to be the boy who lived. James and Lily train Harry's brother way to fucking hard, to a point where he hates magic and actively tries to suppress it in the thought that is he were a squib they wouldn't train him anymore. He becomes an obscurial and Harry is brother to the-obscurial-who-lived. There'd prolly be a bit of James/Lily bashing or something but idk. Harry loves his brother and they've always been there for each other. Idk where to go from there.
