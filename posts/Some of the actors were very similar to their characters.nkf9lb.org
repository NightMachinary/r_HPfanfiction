- Emma Watson is like Hermione because she is an activist who stands up for the rights of the disadvantaged

- Evanna Lynch is like Luna because she's not afraid to break a social norm to stand up for what she believes (she's vegan)

- Jamie Waylett is like Crabbe because he is willing to hurt people and suffers the consequences (he was caught with a bomb in a riot and imprisoned)

- Alan Rickman is like Snape because he's dead
