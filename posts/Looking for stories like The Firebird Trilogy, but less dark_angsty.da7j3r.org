The Firebird trilogy (by Darth Marrs) has a lot going for it. It's AU, in that there is still a wizarding world, but it's not just different, it's VERY different. The Magicals aren't just humans with magic, they are actually, biologically, OTHER.

It's a fascinating world, and a well written story, but it is CRAZY dark. As in, horrible things happen to the main characters. While I have no problems with villians being evil (It IS Harry Potter after all) I don't particularly enjoy stories where the protagonists spend an inordinate amount of time suffering.

So I am looking for other stories where magical people are more different than just having magic, or perhaps where being magical means more than just the ability to cast spells. Stories where the Wizarding world is deeper than seen in the books.

** If you haven't read it already, you might like Linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom). It's a deadfic, and the early chapters are full to bursting with Rouge Angles of Satin, but if you can get past that, it's an AU where Britain's magical society is much larger and completely different than what it was in canon.

** You might like my story "Patron". Wizarding Britain isn't just "old England with some spells and Quidditch", but far more fantastical and different - more progressive in some parts, more archaic in others, compared to muggle Britain. And Magical France, Bulgaria, Jamaica, Scandinavia and the Ottoman Empire have different socieites and customs as well.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

  Hard times lead to hard choices. What's more important? Freedom, or fate? Love, or death? Harry Potter stands on the edge of a precipice, and he is not sure if the right move is to turn and fight, or fall.

  They had a plan, formulated from before they were even born. That plan died. From its ashes rises a Harry Potter no longer willing, or able, to let others fight his battles for him. Outgunned, outclassed, outmatched, nonetheless Harry will take up the sword to change not only Britain, but the world.
