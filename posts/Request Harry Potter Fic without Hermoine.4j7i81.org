** On my phone right now, so can't give you the links.

The They Shook Hands series has her killed in the troll attack, I think.

Too Young To Die has her not being very involved. There is a scene where Harry nearly beats the shit out of her.

It's hard to find fics where Hermione isn't involved, considering everyone's massive boners for her.

Thanks, i already read the "They shook hands series" but i'm going to give the other one a try. I really don't mind people liking hermoine but in most fanfictions hermoine becomes a way to advance the plot when they don't know something and is often used as the perfect girl for harry
