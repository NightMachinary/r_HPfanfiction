** Not a Draco self-insert, but one where the SI is his little sister

It's dead, but I quite enjoyed what is there

  I never pretended to know what I was doing in my last life. Why should I pretend to know anything about this one? Well, the other option is a horrific and bloody death, so...I better start learning how to be a witch. OC Self-Insert/Draco's Younger Sister. [DEAD]

** I would love to read a self insert draco fic!!! :) Also yes the self insert could become harry's friend in diagon alley when they first met and also do other not canon rehash stuff like easily stealing the Diary Horcrux and destroying it, and also maybe incriminating Lucius and Narcissa and getting them arrested very early on! :) Then maybe the self insert could go live with Andromeda or something! :) Yes there is so much not canon rehash story potential in this self insert!!! Yes if I was writing this story I would do most of these things I mentioned here, and also yes everything would go very different from the very start. :)

I do not like when self inserts or time travelers in fanfictions sit on their butts for all seven years of Hogwarts just to "maintain the timeline and keep foreknowledge" instead of /actually acting like/ they are committed to ending a war and saving lives, which yes requires /preemptive actions/ and not going to school for seven years doing nothing.

I also really do not like it because time travelers or self inserts are all two shoe goodies who /not only sit around/ on their butts to "maintain the timeline," but who also don't just be more like KYLE REESE, who was a time traveler and unlawful good!!! He went around stealing cars and breaking into places and stuff in his time travel mission, and he was a kind person! /He got things done!/ My self insert or time traveler would be more like Kyle Reese, and just apparate to azkaban with a group of mage mercenaries and break Sirius out, and go right to Dolohov and the other free Death Eater homes and just capture them and turn them all right over to the Order and tell them to stash them in a basement somewhere!

Why would you sit around and follow all the rules and laws and waste so much time trying to get Peter imprisoned and tried and Sirius exonerated and jeez I HATE HOW FANFIC WRITERS DO THESE PLOTS!!! IT IS LIKE THEY ALL JUST TIE THEIR MC'S HANDS BEHIND THEIR OWN BACKS INTENTIONALLY TO WASTE TIME AND STRETCH THE WHOLE PLOT!!! "OH I CAN'T TELL ANYONE I'M A TIME TRAVELER! OH I CAN'T GO OUT LOOKING FOR THE HORCRUXES! OH I CAN'T ENLIST AID IN ANYTHING! OH I CAN'T JUST GO TO AZKABAN AND GET SIRIUS IN HALF A DAY!!! NO I HAVE TO SIT HERE IN SCHOOL AND NOT DO ANYTHING TO BREAK RULES OR BE PROACTIVE!!!" KYLE REESE GOT THINGS DONE BECAUSE HE SAID SCREW THE RULES I HAVE A MISSION TO COMPLETE!!! WHY CAN'T THEY BE LIKE KYLE?! THEY COULD PROBABLY LITERALLY BEAT VOLDEMORT AND DEAL WITH ALL THE DEATH EATERS AND FREE SIRIUS IN LIKE A MONTH IF THEY REALLY ACTED LIKE THEY WERE DESPERATELY COMMITTED TO A TIME TRAVEL MISSION TO SAVE THE PAST!!!

IN FACT YES, I AM SO FREAKING FRUSTRATED ABOUT HOW THESE STORIES ARE HANDLED THAT I AM LOGGING INTO MY QUOTEV RIGHT NOW TO WRITE A MORE TERMINATORY KYLE REESE VERSION OF THE TIME TRAVEL FIX IT STORY!!! MY PROTAGONIST WILL DO IT IN A MONTH.

*** Going to the school is important to learn magic, and gather influences with an army behind you. You can't skip it and expect to mary sue it? If it is a self insert in one of the kids. About time travel, there are anti spells in Azkaban. Also, can you make the protagonist Adult Draco Malfoy since in the Cursed Child he has a time turner that allows him to go anywhere in the past. I would love to read and review it.

**** Well yes, in the self insert case they WOULD need to go to Hogwarts to learn their magic stuff, but the time traveling adult? They SHOULD NOT be wasting years in that place hanging out with their childhood friends rather than going out and furthering their mission. :( Also yes there are probably anti apparition charms on Azkaban, but you could just take a boat or a portkey, or imperius a guard to get you in, or polyjuice a guard, or a dozen other things.

Also YES. :) I will make a long adult Draco time travel story!!! :) :) But I am also writing one with Harry that will be very short, to show what he could do if he did not screw around playing with his friends, and pretending to be a kid again like in most fanfics "to keep the timeline" even though he's trying to change it in the first place!!!

******* I feel like canon!Draco is just wasted potential; it's clear that Rowling created him to be Harry's 'nemesis' (Then Voldemort when he eventually gets resurrected) but he is not only incompetent, idiotic but also weak in terms of power. Rowling should've made him smart, reasonably powerful; countering Harry but not winning against him, plotting and at least playing pranks on Harry (instead of spreading dumbass rumors that are partially true). The 'Nemesis' could have eventually allied himself with Harry, realizing the danger Voldemort posed when he was resurrected. It would have made for a much more original and enjoyable story.

**** No Kevin! No we don't! :( The whole POINT of time traveling to change the past is that the timeline ISN'T pure, it's TERRIBLE. So no one is going to actually go back in time and then defeat their own purpose by keeping it how it is!!!

Also yes Kevin your name is very cute! :)

***** The SI's presence will change things no matter what; butterfly effect and all, but changing the timeline majorly at the beginning fucks up everything, you lose most of your knowledge, thus your only advantage against the opposite side. A smart SI would begin to change things around 5th year, letting Voldemort resurrect to truly defeat him, using his knowledge, the SI would help Harry indirectly (clues about the horcruxes whereabouts) and directly opposing the compromised ministry (un-imperiusing ministry workers). He would help in the shadows, knowing the dangers of befriending Harry or any important character, he wouldn't draw attention to himself, thus making him seem more powerful and mysterious (if he created an alter-ego). He would know the places and people to strike with his knowledge (again making him seem incredibly powerful and unbeatable). This would be the ultimate SI in terms of effectiveness; what most readers are looking for is someone who interacts with the HP characters, get himself know and yadda-yadda, providing entertainment for himself (the reader).

*** It depends on when the OC becomes Draco, but I would imagine that a self insert would be rather attached to his family by the time they have the capability to actually do anything significant.

The reason they don't suddenly bust into azkaban is that the OC is supposed to be human. They just died and lost everything they ever knew, so it's not surprising that a reincarnated OC would be more interested in just living their life and enjoying it rather than jumping into plans that are likely to get them imprisoned or killed (especially considering most SIs are rather sheltered from their previous safe lives).

In fact, I'd quite like to see an SI/OC "gone wrong" fic, where the protagonist jumps into a big plan to save the world and is instead locked up in azkaban for years instead or some such (perhaps upon release their time leaves them a little twisted, angry at the foreign world that wronged them).

**** That could be an interesting flip of the yes fic trope! :) An SI who messes up and does time and then is angry and stuff at the world for it! Maybe the Dementors even twist them into wanting to just destroy stuff and hurt people instead of saving it!
