So someone pointed out in one of my HPMOR threads that I really haven't done anything of note, at least in the HP fandom. So i want to try and change that and write my first HP fanfic. Any prompts you guys can think of or recommendations for plot points are welcome, honestly the main reason I haven't touched HP when it comes to writing is because of a lack of ideas, most of the stories I want to write have already been written and I kind of feel a bit dwarfed by others if that makes sense?

So yea what are some fics you guys wish there were more of or want to see written more often?

** Something involving gods and deities that isn't anime-based, slash-focused, or (if a PJ cross and not based on original myths) not a ''XX goes to Hogwarts!" plot.

[Side note: nearly every PJ cross I've encountered focuses on both settings being in the same time-frame, when in actuality there are up to two decades in differences -- HP is in the nineties, and PJ well into the new millennium. The time-frame of HP in the PJ universe is largely unexplored because none of the PJ main characters have been born yet, and those few that were are either in limbo or non-related.]

A plot bunny I had recently is that Dumbledore discovers, to his shock and horror, on having an innocuous, casual conversation with Harry that the boy does hear voices that he responds to... but it's not the slither of Voldemort's soul trapped in his scar nattering as he feared.

Attracted and heartened by Lily's love and sacrifice, the old deity Aphrodite decides to look after/raise Harry as best she can. That, and she's had nothing to do really for the last few thousand years.

A major cravat? It's not the lovey-dovey aspects of Aphrodite, but her war-like persona of Aphrodite Areia -- you know, a /war goddess of Sparta/.

Thus Harry's rearing was a bit... unconventional.

Well, the reason for that is pretty easy to see. For a lot of people, the appeal in a crossover is to see specific characters interact. And given how easy it is to adjust time periods, particularly of two works that were set at the then contemporary time, it's not a huge surprise/deal.

There's certainly potential in keeping the time period steady! Just that if the goal is to see Percy + Harry interact, for instance, it's much more intriguing to have them both the same age.

Hermione thinks the world would be a better place if wizards helped out more so does her crusading thing and does something about it.

Aimed to try and get it as a crime style fic where Harry is rocked when he discovers who is behind the latest breach and struggles to do what must be done to stop her.

This does not have to be a romance, it can very well be a "as friends" event where Padma ends up comforting Harry about not getting Cho. Or it starts as a platonic arrangement but due to the lack of pressure from the "date" status, they both enjoy it a lot more and end up having an unintended, splendid date.

Another thing which hasn't really been done is one of the older students (eg Alicia, Penelope or even one of the Slytherin upper years) taking Harry under their wings WITHOUT turning it into an eventual romance or "pureblood politics".

However, where all fics in that genre fall short is that they make Harry act like a girl almost immediately. But I've yet to read a fic where Harry is like "ok, I have tits and need to sit down to pee. Carry on". Because there are other options instead of fully embracing every female stereotype. She could dress butch and cut her hair short.

To End a Prophecy

James and Dumbledore agree that Harry will never be able to fulfill the prophecy and defeat Voldemort so they try to off him. Their idea is that with the prophesied child out of the way someone else can kill Tom. Lily takes Harry and they escape to France. Sirius goes with them and they stay in a Black holiday home in France. Their new neighbors are the Delacours. Harry/Fleur of course

** A bunch of prompts:

​

1. Luna enlists Harry's help in investigating one of the Quibbler's phony conspiracy. Which is of course false, but they stumble into a real one, involving some of the highest profile people in the country. Should start as a comedy but become serious at some point. Real danger involved, etc... Maybe set year 5 or 6.
2. Dumbledore has been training harry since 1st or 2nd year, acting as a real mentor. During the battle of the DoM, Voldemort kills Dumbledore in front of Harry's eyes. Harry is forced to flee the country, but vows to avange his mentor. He starts running around the world, seeking power, experience and backing.
3. After dealing with Voldemort, Harry is framed by the ministry (which is still filled with death eaters) and sent to Azkaban. He manages to adapt to the place through whatever way (maybe meditation, mind magics, crazy discipline or whatever which has him become more powerful). A few years after, a new Dark Lord appears and Draco Malfoy, now head of the DMLE, realises that only harry can help. (think something like Detective Dee 1's plot, if you've seen this movie)
4. A one shot about Hagrid being sent to the Witcherverse and traveling with Geralt a bit. The culture shock would be amuzing.

***** Oh, I should have mentioned. That is not a fanfic, it is a TV show / VN game called Steins;Gate and it has exactly what you are looking for. It is sci fi. It is about a bunch of freinds in the 'future gadget lab' (Which is just really a room they hangout in). The main character is a chuunibyu like Luna, who beleives in things that may not be real and is a mad sceintist.

They go investigating in a random direction, but they stumble upon something huge with dire concequences. VERY dire consequences. And there are several plot twists, not just one big one. There is a lot of character development too, and although the characters may seem a little shallow to someone who isn't looking close, after episode 12 their complex backstories are revealed. Some of them aren't really special backstories, but somehow they are still special to you. It takes a while because it is world building and has a comedy tone at the first 12 episodes even though a few suspicous things happen. The comedy is alright, but the mad sceintist may put you off, just to warn you (But it is worth it). Episode 13 and 12 and anything after have the darker tones.

I KNOW this is exactly what you described, I know it!

Steins;Gate is my faveourite ever, and for me the best sci-fi AND story I've ever seen, and I see a LOT of Scifi AND stories.

You should probably try it out if that's what you are looking for.

By the way, it is an anime. I really hope you are not the kind who thinks anime is trashy childrens show/ porn fetish fantasy because it is not.
