Bottom of the page: “sections in italics were taken from J.K. Rowling”


** Definitely aggravating, especially when you have sentences mixed with italic copies and plain font creative text. I think an author would be better off marking at the beginning, "some text has been used or reworded from the original work by J. K. Rowling," or words to that effect.

**** Either put it in the language of the story or don't tell the reader what it means to be deliberately obtuse (useful for various reasons). Look at how a lot of movies handle it, typically the actors will just speak in the main language, for the sake of clarity and understanding, or they'll subtitle, it which is like adding a translation after each phrase/sentence.

**** Mention it's in foreign language and write it in italics maybe? As long as it's relevant to the story. Depends on the context, if it's to be understood well write in English in italics so the reader knows what's going on, but the characters clearly don't. Or if the reader isn't meant to know write all in foreign speech

***** Writing works however the writer decides it works for them. If they want two characters to converse in two languages they can. If they want to use a language specifically for certain words and phrases they can do that. As long as it is consistent and makes sense they can largely do whatever they want.

"Have a target audience in mind" is one of the age old advice's you find when learning to write, and how you structure your writing will be part of that. If you can't understand context and see what is said or done before and trough that understand what is said, maybe you are not the writer's target audience?

****** Having translations as an addendum or appendix is a carryover from books, wherein it was contained at the bottom of the page, not at the end of a ten thousand word chapter. It doesn't fuckin work when you don't have pages.

But no, please, tell us more about how we should read an entire scene of dialogue in a language most readers probably don't understand (with an interface that does not allow highlighting to copy paste into google translate no less) and just magically understand it from “context”

You can't just claim every dumb structural choice a writer makes as “you're just not the intended audience”

** Honestly, I thought the whole 'characters read the books' was a fascinating idea but they all turn out to be "print a paragraph from the book, have characters throw off oneliners". Which kinda suck.

A story about the books ending up in Harry's first/second year, the fight over them, and /absolutely no quoting/ could be great.

  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** Honestly, I don't really understand why people do that? Like, really, why not just try and rewrite the scene from memory using your own models of the characters? That's what I do, and so far, I've wound up with some really interesting minor differences in a lot of my scenes.

** Hearkening back to the original with more than an adoring nod strikes me as inexcusably lazy either way. Even the indirect retelling of canon is questionable and languid at best.

In fact, the way some of the older fics especially work so closely next to the canon timeline makes them utterly unreadable for me.
