:END:
Some time (I think over a year) ago, I read a fanfic (I don't think it was complete and may have been abandoned) where Harry read Indiana Jones novels or something similar over the break. When school started up again, he asked the Hogwarts librarian if she had anything similar... The closest thing she had was a journal by a previous Potter who went looking for a lost city or cities in America. The journal was mostly in English, but along the bottom of each page was writing in Parselscript. I think either Su Li or Padma were the second main character along with Harry...
