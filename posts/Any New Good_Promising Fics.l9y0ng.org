Just as the title says. I'm tired of everyone recommending the same stories over and over again! I've read it all and Yes I think it's shit. (am I allowed to swear on this?)

Anyways leave your recommendations below. And I mean new as published in the last 4-6 months!!

If you're a month off I don't want it - lol jks

Thanks in advance :)


** I've seen plenty of good stories /updated/ in the past few months, even completed or very close to completion, but I don't think I've picked up any entirely new ones, sorry.

  With Professor Snape's hateful and cruel words towards her, Hermione's trust in authority figures comes crashing down for good. She begins to question the adults' response to Harry's forced entry into the Triwizard Tournament and concludes that it's up to her to keep him safe. And if they have to leave the country to escape the madness that is Hogwarts and Magical Britain, so be it.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means.
