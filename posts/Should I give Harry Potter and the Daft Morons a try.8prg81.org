This is a tad different that the usual fic searches.

So I've been looking at this linkffn(12562072) fic for a while. Is it just a massive bash party or is there actual real content in it. Like the summary is rather terrible but is the fic reasonable?


** In the first chapter Harry unironically commands Dobby to, "bring me my bag of destruction."

Within the next 1,000 words the story shoehorned in the "Harrison Potter", "Ancient and Nobel House of Potter", and "14yr old manipulates and begins to talk down via monologue to the rest of wizarding society" tropes. From that point on, the story functionally does not deviate from a long MarySue monologue.

I find it very frustrating to read. If you need an Indy!Harry story I recommend reading linkffn(9704180) : I'm still here. It's not the most original and it desperately needs an editor, but at least it integrates or reinterprets the typical Indy!Harry and Harem!Harry tropes in a way that isn't completely insulting.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

**** I don't know what you are specifically looking for, but some of these might pique your interest:

linkffn(11287688) : In spite of Obstinate men.

A nice detective story that starts when Harry runs away and meets the Delacour family on the Nightbus. Mr. Delacour is a detective and investigates the charges against Sirius Black while Harry and Fleur start as antagonists but over the course of the story become friends.

linkffn(4152700) : Cauterize

Short one shot, but much better than the cannon epilogue. This is the story that brings me back to HP fan fiction whenever I start to wander away.

linkffn(3766574) : Prince of a Dark Kingdom

Lovely AU world building and scenes in an alternate universe where Voldermort won the war without being involved in the death of Harry's parents.

linkffn(6919395) : The Changeling

Very nice retelling of the cannon period from a Slytherin Ginny perspective. The Golden trio is around but are not the focus of the story.

linkffn(11752324) : Limpieza de Sangre

Post GOF coming of age story for Harry that involves him interacting with a female Voldemort. Really well written characters and original story lines. The author has already posted a few chapters of the sequel.

linkffn(8604692) : Taking Umbridge

Takes the POV of Fleur Delacour who grapples with a personal history of child abuse while trying to protect Harry and Hogwarts as an instructor.

linkffn(11697407) : Contractual Invalidation

Post cannon Auror Harry gets involved with Daphne Greengrass. This and another story are usually the two recommended Harry/Daphne stories.

** Honestly, I found it awful but I couldn't stop reading it - I just want the damn thing to finish. Bizarre amount of bashing - someone else said he bashes his own harem, which he does. He's also written as this rather awful dude who's incredibly controlling and treats women like children, but the author makes this okay by constantly reiterating "Oh, Harry is autistic so this is why others consider him an asshole". Like, no, you can't just use autism as a scapegoat. Mostly I'm mad that Hermione is written as a girl with apparently uncontrollable behavioural issues that need to be rigidly controlled by her father or Harry. Also the author has an extremely bizarre attitude towards sex. There have been some interesting parts to the plot, but now it's got to the point of just endless rambling about Harry maybe buying a yacht and how pureblood laws should be changed at some point.
