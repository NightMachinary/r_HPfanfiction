** If it came to an open conflict, wizards would wipe the floor with muggles thanks to the Imperius curse. Wizards do not maintain Secrecy out of fear. They want to be left alone and not be the ones you call to fix everything. It's not discrimination, it's classic isolationism.

*** Eh, I have always read it as in a straight up fight, Muggles would dominate wizards. HP magic is just too individually targeted to be able to survive against the massively that is an organized state.

Now, if wizards used guile and subterfuge, they would easily win. If only because they could set muggles against each other.

I think it would really come down to how developed Wizard worlds knowledge of the muggle world is.

If you have the wizarding world tracking (unseen in canon) advancements in how connected/progress the muggle world has made in order to enforce the Statute, they will probably be clued in enough to win.

If you have them relying primarily on luck and magic for keeping their world secret so far, and they are caught surprised by how efficient the muggle governments, it is unlikely they would adapt fast enough to survive...

**** All you'd have to do is to mind-control the presidents of the US, China, Russia and maybe UK/France. There would be no war if wizards played their cards right. And apparation, invisibility and Fiendfyre would be all the tools you'd need in a field battle.

Now, wizards with guns and anti-apparation wards vs wizards with only magic would be a different thing.

***** Given the hidden nature of the setup, there would certainly be an absolute strike first advantage. This is true in a lot of conflicts, but is especially true here. Which is why fics that use the "Wizards decide to take over muggle world, muggles get steamrolled" and "Muggles find out about wizarding world mess, prepare a takeover" both work. Neither side really have protections in place to block what they don't know about.

However, I did say in a straight up fight. Mind control only really works if you can get it all off before the "Enemy has mind control, operate independently" order goes out.

Any muggle/wizard conflict is going to very quickly start discovering what the limitations of magic are. We know HP magic is limited, although canon intentionally doesn't really define how. A conflict against those without magic, would push those boundaries quickly.

** As Neriasa points out below, /how/ Muggles became aware of magic would have a huge impact on their reactions. This is part of why, in at least a couple of fics, Harry starts up clinics that secretly use magic to treat incurably-ill Muggle children: Beyond just "it helps people that need it", if/when the Statute falls it'd allow magicals to point to the clinics and go "See? We've been helping as much as we could while staying hidden" - good PR, that.

On the other hand, if the Statute falls due to a Death Eater attack and its aftermath being caught on video, maybe a live news broadcast, Muggles would see wizards showing up and murdering innocent people for no reason, then wizards in uniforms acting to cover it up (which makes it look like the Ministry of Magic is actively covering for and therefore supporting the Death Eaters).

Regardless, Muggles wouldn't all react in one uniform block - the differing circumstances would just change how many fell into which category of response:

1. They're different! Destroy them!
2. Our interpretation of our religion says that magic is evil! Destroy them!
3. They're a threat
4. They're a potential threat and potential asset
5. They're gods! Worship them!
6. They're so cool, let's be obsessive fans!
7. They're people. Those powers are interesting, but people are people. (Sadly this would probably be the least common response)

** I think you are mistaken here in your interpretations, so I will try to break it down point by point.

Wizard Supremacy as a name is an eye rolling-ly unsubtle parallel of the term white supremacy (admittedly, Rowling has never demonstrated much nuance for culture and historical context). Wizard supremacists, like their muggle model, don't believe as they do because they are "afraid" - they think they are "better" than the muggles. That being born with magic makes them superior to muggles, because of the differences in power/social/morality, etc. And if you think you are better (whether individually or on a societal or cultural level), why should you have to be in a supposedly inferior position to your lessers?

That's the rationality used by most groups or individuals that look at the situation and see on the surface that "it isn't fair, I/we should be the one(s) in charge." The fact that wizards/witches are in fact not the same as muggles, both in physical capabilities and magic, further complicates this situation, unlike with say racial/cultural excuses that are generally unsound.

In truth, like with Nazism or many real world parallel ideologies, the current status quo in the Wizarding World was not one born of racial fears or hatred, but out of collective decisions to benefit the current society as a whole (getting back to that whole historical context). The SoS was debated for nearly a century on the basis of whether separation or maintaining their lifestyle was preferable. In essence, it came down to which path would allow the magicals more independence and to act as they will.

This is the underlying social contract of the Wizarding World in the past three centuries: we will surrender some of our freedoms in exchange for maintaining the separation of magical and non-magical. And this is essentially why every Ministry of Magic in the world exists; every function of the magical government centers around maintaining the SoS in one form or another. Wizard supremacists are in essence something like a rejection of that social contract, that they should not have to give up any freedoms because they are better.

** Muggles and wizards aren't monolithic groups. Each contains many different people who think differently. I think 90% of wizards and 90% of muggles would get along just fine. But there's definitely some people on either side who'd not get along with the others. For example religious "thou shall not allow a witch to live" extremists and blood purists. Without secrecy there'd be a lot of messy conflict. Magical criminals taking advantage of muggles being relatively defenseless without secrecy to hold them back. ISIS terrorists suicide bombing magical shops. A bomb goes off faster than you can say Protego.

** Muggle and Wizards are not equals, Wizards are superior to Muggles. Basically anything a Muggle can do, a Wizard potentilly can, but they also have something called magic that can make them litteral God in a Muggle eye. The best Muggles may be superior to the worst wizards, but the best wizards will always be superior. But you can be superior to someone and still be benevolent, Voldemort and Dumbledore are both superior to 99% of the wizards, but one is a kind professor that try to lead student in the right path (no matter their age), and the other will torture/ kill you if you don't act exactly like he wants.

Concerning the Statue of Secrecy, surprisingly enough, Hagrid was 100% serious when he told Harry that they were hiding because they don't want to deal with Muggles and their problems.\\
Most of the "common" Muggle problems are easily deal by Wizards thanks to Magic (Lackc of place? Expansion Charm. Lack of Ressources? Gemino spell. And the list goes on).\\
In case of conflict, Wizard should also be able to win against Muggles easily enough. Dark Arts is the obvious answer (Imperius Curse to destroy the enemy command chain, and Fiendfyre to destroy material and soldier lives). But even without this, Wizards have so much trick in their sleeves that their enemy would be absolutely unable to fight back unless helped by other wizards (which, in the case of a full scale conflict started by muggles, is unlikely to happen). They can Apparate so it's easy for them to escape an ambush or go behind enemy lines. They have spell that can hide an Area and even make it impossible to put in a map (used in place like Hogwarts, Diagon Alley or the Quidditch World Cup in 1994). Use it on your base and be completely safe from Muggles. Use it on their base and see the enemy losing his mind trying to return home.

Wizards are hiding from muggles because it's the easiest solution for them, in Hiding, they have to maintain the Statue, and have people specialized in erasing the Secret from Muggle's memory, but it works well enough. Should they come out in public, the following situations may appear:

- Muggles see Magic, and decide it is a threat for them, deciding that if they can't control it, it should be destroyed. A war start where the Wizards destroy the Muggle and, with the exception of the poor Muggleborn who is found by Muggles before being able to defend himself, and the unlucky Wizard who forgot the shield himself before leaving and got snipped, there is almost no victims for Wizards.
- Muggles see Magic, and think it's pretty neat. Government don't do anything but now a horde of Muggles want to ask Wizards to deal with their problem (we lack food over here, can you multiply it for us? We have injured people, do your things and heal them. Can you use Magic to clean this area for us . . .). Wizards know have to spend all their time working for Muggles, and refuse and create resentment, which can later lead to the War scenario.
- Muggles see Magic, and decide that these people are obviously Godly beings. Wizards are now the overlords of Earth. They know have an army of (more or less) willing slaves, these slaves are pretty useless (1 House Elve can do the work of a thousand of them, and is more loyale to his master), and they have to provide for their slaves. So now they have to spend their time dealing with the mass, making sure there is no uprising, yet the Muggles still create nothing of value for them.

Better stay hidden and not deal with all of this.

**** Yes I do. Nothing in canon says that the Shield Charm has a "resistance limit", so if you can stop a bullet, you should be able to stop 500, or 5000. Unless Muggles manage to infuse some kind of magic into their bullet (which would need a magical assistance, which would transform a "Muggle Vs Wizard" war into a "Wizard Vs Wizard with muggle troops"), automatic weapons would be as usefull as a simple gun in front of a wizard. And even if Shield Charm fail, there are others spells, maybe a "Arresto Momentum" can stop bullets mid air, or maybe someone will come with a spell that totally stop all bullets early in the fights.\\
As for the nukes, I'm not sure it "could" be stopped, but I think it would be useless for the followings reasons :

- Muggles would not know where to nukes. It's not like the Muggles know where are the place of importance for Wizards.
- Even if the Muggles were to learn where these places are, let's say by asking Muggleborns parents you have Hogwarts (somewhere in the Scottish Highlands), and Diagon Alley and the Ministry, both in London. It's not like the muggles could afford to nuke there own capital. Especially since Wizards can evacuate a lot faster than Muggles, so all the population would need to be sacrificied for it to work (which would include people like the PM or other high members of the Government, maybe even the Royal Family since there absence would be easily spotted). As for Hogwarts, what will they do? Nuke all the old Scottish Castles? Nuke would hurt muggles more than wizards.
- I'm not sure if the "normal" protection" of say Diagon Alley would work to stop the blast of a nuke, but Wizards have other means to protect themselves. If they learnt about the plan they could impersonate the pilot, or just controle it. They could veto the plan all together the moment it is proposed. Or maybe they will just charm the nuke so it doesn't explode, or transfigure the plutonium into something harmless like confetis. The point it, it's unlikely the nuke would do any damages.

And, even if we say that the Nukes worked and an important place like Hogwarts is not more. Congratulations you have now a lot of very angry wizards who decided to become serious. 1 hour later, all the high members of the Government and the military have been abducted with the Royal Family, the Wizards are working on a new treaty with the Dementors to let them prey on muggles cities and they are thinking about releasing Dragons in Ireland to make it a new, bigger reserve.

******** that wasn't it, there was no prophecy about a doom in the one i read, and if other wizards are better with tech, why is arthur still the head of the misuse of muggle artefacts for so long? he was only replaced after he was promoted to be head of a brand new department
