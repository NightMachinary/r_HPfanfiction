** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), depicts the Trio's gradual descent into darkness. Brilliantly done and very much in their canon characters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942), is a Star Wars crossover in which Palpatine successfully turned Harry into a Sith. Hermione and Luna managed to moderate him somewhat later, but they would do all kinds of very nasty things together, including human sacrifices and genocide.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11564067/1/The-Last-Enemy][The Last Enemy]], linkffn(11564067), is one shot in which Harry became a serial killer in research of the immortality.

**** Yes, but its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), takes place mostly outside the Earth. Harry, strangely, is less brutal and evil in that one, and he actually becomes the victim of machinations of those closest to him a few times. The author Darth Marrs really likes writing edgy moments, so readers either love or hate his stories.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

It's far from well written but its certainly a guilty pleasure. The plot is actually kind of unique, but the execution struggles and some of the world building isn't that great either. Still fits your criteria and has 4k favorites so its far from terrible. Harry/Daphne
