Pretty much what the title says, I'm looking for fics with Azkaban breakout scenes.


** Best I know of: Voice of the Nephilim's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]]. 52k words, complete.

  The crumbling island prison of Azkaban has been evacuated, its remaining prisoners left behind. Time growing short, Harry Potter will make one final bid for freedom, enlisting an unlikely crew of allies in a daring escape, where nothing is as it seems.

*** Thanks! That's a great length for a fast read too. Perhaps putting "best" was somewhat disingenuous; I'll happily read any Azkaban breakouts anyone recommends and it doesn't have to be what the whole fic is about. I'm looking to get a sense of the fanon surrounding the defenses of the prison.

*** Oh, this is such a great fic, it's sort of what inspired this question. It's in my top 10 favorites and I /really/ hope the author hasn't abandoned it forever.

** I honestly don't remember if this does or not, but it should have an azkaban breakout scene. It's a HP multiverse fic mocking a lot of fanfic tropes, and touches on most HP fanfic types.

** As much as I hate the rest of it, HPMOR did do the Azkaban escape pretty awesomely.

** I remember reading this one forever and a day ago. Don't know if it held up well, but Harry had an interesting way of getting out of Azkaban. linkffn(Beyond Boundaries by Rachel A. Prongs)
