Looking for stories that actually make use of what should be a powerful magical artifact. Not just oh it was destroyed or oh harry steals it but instead of attempting to use it he returns the damn thing


** In Linkao3(6765496), a pharma company manages to make a copy of the stone after secrecy is breached. They attempt to mass produce elixir and get a monopoly on pretty much the entirety of medicine, and they figure out that the mysterious "curse" that prevented Flamel from mass producing gold was that with some heavier lead isotopes, you get radioactive byproducts.

It's a subplot on the side, in the main plot Voldemort takes over North Korea and portkeys around nukes.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** At the risk of being dogpiled by its detractors, I'll just state this occurs in some of the recursive fanfics of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/1/Significant-Digits][Significant Digits]] is a sequel where the Philosopher's Stone is used in a magical hospital that provides services to wizards and witches from all over the world, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/Following-the-Phoenix][Following the Phoenix]] is a divergence from Methods of Rationality chapter 81, where the Stone works a bit differently and is eventually used to resurrect the majority of people who have ever died. ^{ffnbot!directlinks}

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

*** I'm not a fan of cringe-worthy stories at all, but I've read HPMoR multiple times and I really don't see much of that in it. There's no accounting for taste, I suppose.

... You're not hung up on the endlessly misrepresented scene in chapter 7, are you? Draco's threats against Luna were realistic given his background and what we know about wizarding society and capabilities, but neither Harry nor the story narrative endorses them at all; Harry is personally horrified, and Draco goes through slow and painful character growth as he is plainly shown the errors of the pureblood philosophy and realises to his dismay that he won't be able to meet his beloved father's expectations and example.

#+end_quote

Indeed. What's funny in that case is that my own taste changed with time. I started reading the fic back in 2015 and got to chapter 70-ish and generally liked it and thought Harry was pretty cool. I came back to it this year and started from the beginning and finished it. (Thanks to the audiobook). And my god, Harry is such an annoying little shit. He constantly talks back and thinks he's wise because he's read some science books. He outright refuses to listen to adults with decades more experience than him. He refuses to even consider the fact that someone other than him might just be right. For someone with a hard-on for science and rationality, his argumentative skills really leave a lot to be desired. I mean, I get it- he's really smart. But he's still 11 and experience is also important. Especially when it comes to fighting, politics and leadership.

Now my second turn off was that halfway through the plot just kind of took a vacation and the fic became more of an essay about heroes, gender and evil. Which I didn't find very interesting. No, 11 year olds are not evil (bar Voldemort), no 11-year-olds are not superheroes. And it took like 10 chapters to get there- I think they were called "Roles". Hermione even formed some kind of anti-bullying group. Don't get me wrong- the Azkaban break-in and the fights Quirrel organised were fun though. (If we can ignore the morality of making soldiers out of children.) But that whole spiel about heroes and gender roles and evil was just... meh.

Oddly enough I had no problem with that infamous scene and honestly don't understand the uproar about it. I think it fits Draco's character perfectly- far too many authors give him an easy time because he was played by a pretty actor in the movies. It's possible he didn't even realise what the word or action itself meant and was just trying to show off in front of the Boy Who Lived. I can just see a kid Draco sneaking through Malfoy mansion after bedtime and coming across his dad with friends, drinking and smoking, and reminiscing about the "good, old days" when they raped, tortured and killed people. So he overhears it, not fully understanding everything and then just tries to show off how knowledgeable and adult he is to Harry. I think that's a reasonably plausible scenario.

***** Of course, if Harry was a good deal more sensible about listening to people older than him, then you'd have people criticising the author for making him an unrealistic 11-year-old (more than they already do) :D.

I appreciate the response; you've clearly thought this over, and actually finished reading it (audiobook counts) before passing judgement.
