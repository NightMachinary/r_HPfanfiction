** I read one a while ago where the ICW's sole purpose was to enforce the statute of secrecy. And they didn't mess around. Everyone was terrified that the ICW would decide enough was enough and exterminate magical Britain because Tom just wouldn't stop attacking muggles.

**** I think there was a bit where Hermione mused on how African wizards were exterminated because they used magic against muggle invaders?

It seems a bit counterproductive to me, if the entire point of the Statute of Secrecy is supposed to be to protect the wellbeing of human magicals.

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach) technically has what you want in that the ICW is a major world power after the fall of the Statute of Secrecy.

However, I personally would not recommend this fic as it also is kind of a crossover with Gulliver's Travels and therefore spends what feels like a hundred chapters talking about centaur wars, like if Binns were a fanfic writer. After the starting point, it also kind of stops being a Harry Potter story. While one of the story arcs involves the ICW stopping Voldemort from becoming the British Prime Minister, the author also likes to describe what's going on at MIT during the story in excruciating detail, and also Vernon Dursley has an American cousin who gets funding from Al-Qaeda to fight wizards.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** My headcanon is that if Voldemort had decided to try to expand beyond Britain, ICW would start to intervene. Basically, as long as the threat is contained within Britain, ICW doesn't want to bother.

This means that I can never see Voldemort as truly becoming as bad as Grindelwald -- even in a case where he truly wins the war in Britain (say, by lack of critical characters in the right place at the right time to cause events leading up to Halloween 1981), he would ultimately lose due to ICW interference once he inevitably tries to go beyond Britain.

** *The British Reformation,* by kb0

linkffn(9977668)

​

This is a "Harry feels betrayed by everyone and nopes out of the country to a Black Family island" story, but it features an ICW that takes a pretty hard line against British Ministry of Magic. Ultimatums are issued... and consequences follow.
