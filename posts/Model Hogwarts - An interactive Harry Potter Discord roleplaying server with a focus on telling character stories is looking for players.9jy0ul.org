* Hello, witches and wizards of Reddit!
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: hello-witches-and-wizards-of-reddit
  :END:
Are you looking for a group of passionate, dedicated fans who love Harry Potter?  Have you always dreamed of a simulation of going to Hogwarts, casting spells, meeting new friends and going on adventures? Want to write out your life exactly as you dreamed it would (and should!) be? Tired of waiting hours to get a reply on your roleplaying posts? Want to attend classes, play quidditch, and meet cool people, all in the same place?

Well, this is your letter of acceptance to Model Hogwarts! Have a live chat with your professor in their office, or watch as quidditch game unfolds right before your eyes! Brew some Veritaserum, finish that essay on the Goblin Wars of 1812, and go stargazing up on the astronomy tower at night. For some more information please check out our [[http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki][wikia]]!

* What's unique and awesome about Model Hogwarts:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: whats-unique-and-awesome-about-model-hogwarts
  :END:
1) Everyone starts off as a First Year. Everyone gets to starts in the same classes and no one gets a shortcut to being a seventh year. This is awesome because everyone gets the same experiences! You and your class will become even closer because you all remember the time that exploded potion nearly shrunk all of your heads into pinpoints, and somehow you dramatically saved the day! We also make it easy to graduate. A year is 11 weeks, with 2 weeks of summer in between. You also get to chose how many classes you want to take. Are you the next Hermione Granger? Don't worry, we've got you covered with a time turner so you can take all seven classes! Are you more like a Neville Longbottom? You only have to take a couple and still pass the year! We understand everyone has different priorities and classwork isn't always on top.

2) You get to choose where you are sorted. We're not going to place you in Ravenclaw just to get an even number of students in each house. We want you to thrive where you'll do best, and find a social environment of like-minded students. Because of this, you get to choose your house, and once you do, a whole world of opportunity emerges. House parties, study sessions, quidditch teams, and more are awaiting you, so throw on that Hufflepuff scarf and get ready to drink some butterbeer.

3) We're at a point where we are an established roleplaying community -- Model Hogwarts has recently surpassed the one year point! This is great because you have the chance to leave your mark on Hogwarts. While having the safety net of an established community with systems and guidelines to guide you along your roleplaying journey!

4) As an established roleplaying community, we have developed -- and continue to develop --  a variety of systems to ensure you have the best experience possible! This includes a variety of discord bots, including a spell bot (that uses a combination of a learning and dice-based system to determine whether or not you succeed in casting a spell), a stat bot, and a chocolate frog bot, just to name a few! We also have a variety of systems, including the tokens system which allows you to purchase special abilities for your character so that your character, and every character in Model Hogwarts is truly unique.

5) We're welcoming to both new and experienced rpers. If you're new to RP it's okay!  Model Hogwarts can get you started! We have a detailed [[http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Roleplaying_Basics][RP guide]] to give you some tips and tricks as you begin. We also run a plot every year, so even if you're new to RP and shy, you'll have plenty of chances to join in on the fun!

6) We want /you/. We're not picking you from a bowl of applicants, you're picking /us/. So ask us your questions, and we'll try to help you. We want Model Hogwarts to be the best experience it can be, and provide students with as many opportunities as possible.

7) You may recall us posting before the school year started. It may have been dubious the success of this project, but I am happy to confirm the server is active with about ~175 extremely active players! During the first year, a dangerous ghost by the name of Cyrus haunted the castle, and it was up to students to solve the mystery! In the second year the Head Boy was murdered and students and teachers alike found themselves embroiled in a complex conspiracy involving dark magics and terrible manipulations that culminated in the resurrection of the ancient murder Elizabeth Báthory, leaving the student body reeling and schisms forming due to the choices made by certain students.What will happen in next year's plot? No-one knows! Classes are going strong, and you can join whenever you like! In Transfiguration, for example,  they're discussing the theory and origins of magic, and in Defense Against the Dark Arts they're learning about magical creatures and classifications. Drama is always present, and whether you're a muggleborn or a pureblood supremacist, Mexican or a British nationalist, shy and reserved or the class clown, Model Hogwarts has got a group of friends just waiting for you.

8) We are also looking for professors as well! If you're interested in teaching a classes, and roleplaying as a mentor to students, then the professor position is right up your alley! The classes looking for professors are as follows:

Muggle Studies

History of Magic

Herbology

Transfiguration

Potions

Divination

Arithmancy

If you want to be a professor, let us know when you join the server and we will direct you to the application!

* How to start: 
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: how-to-start
  :END:
1) [[https://discord.gg/56z6GMM][*Join the Discord!*]] This is where the magic is happening. Meet your classmates and professors, roleplay, go to classes, fight mysterious ghosts, and get lost in the library. You'll get a week of ‘Hogwarts Summer Camp' where you can informally meet your peers in you year and explore the castle without all the annoying upper years.

2) [[http://model-hogwarts.wikia.com/wiki/Model_Hogwarts_Wiki][Check out our wikia]] for more information as well as some information about our classes, professors and some peoples' characters!

3) Take a peek at some of the classes we offer! Classes are drop in, so even if you miss some you can still attend, but they're totally optional if you're more interested in roleplay! First years can currently attend the following classes:

Charms

Potions

Transfiguration

Defense Against the Dark Arts

Path to Success in the Wizarding World

Herbology

History of Magic

As well as elective classes for third years and up!

4) Please comment down below with any and all questions you have. We'd be happy to answer them! We can't wait to welcome you to our roleplaying community!


** Did you solve the time zone issues yet? I tried it, but was invariably told that if I couldn't be there at 4am, I'd have to roleplay out all important events by myself- not one person seemed to be willing to be on at a different time to act as Ollivander, the sorting hat, etc. If you haven't, I really can't recommend this server for anyone not in the UK.

*** Yes! One of our big goals has been to make the times we hold events (like the sorting hat) more EU friendly! The times we're picking for major events now are times that accommodate both Americans and Europeans. So if you join back you shouldn't have that issue anymore. :)

** I joined the last time this was posted. It can be fun, but only do this if you have a /lot/ of time on your hands.

It is also very, very confusing with a lot of channels. You will have to mute a bunch of channels by necessity otherwise you will be spammed with notifications 24/7. The rules and how the bots and stuff works is also very poorly explained. The admins and mods are willing to help out to an extent but the wiki and guides need major overhauls.

Basically, this is great if you have a lot of time on your hands and don't mind being utterly lost the first few weeks. If not, you will probably be frustrated. It's not something that you can pop in and out of when you have a spare minute. It's very, very roleplaying-heavy.

** Alright this post just gave me the idea of a vive or some sort of Virtual reality Harry Potter game, I've only ever looked into the Vive so I'll use that as an example. Imagine it you could actually walk around Hogwarts and do whatever idk why type of game it'd be but you could use the handheld controllers and it'd be a pretty good representation of a wand and would allow wand movements. Ok I'm ranting but your post title made this pop into my head and I had to share.
