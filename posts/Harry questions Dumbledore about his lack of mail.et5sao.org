I can't remember the exact scenario, whether it was time travel related or otherwise, but I remember a scene where Harry confronted Dumbledore about his overall lack of mail from the magical world his entire life.

Turns out Dumbledore had every piece of mail Harry was ever sent redirected to a storage room. This led to a dramatic Harry exploding at Dumbledore "Do you realize what you've done?!" attributing his lack of mail to the reason most people avoid him and think he doesn't want to befriend them. After all if he can't even respond to their letters or thank them for their gifts then he's probably a prat, right?

Dumbledore turns over all the mail to him and he uses house elves to sort it all for him.

I can't remember anything else about this fic but this scene and I haven't been able to find it again.


** Honestly, redirecting infant- and young-Harry's mail was a pretty sensible idea--so long as he actually answered it where appropriate. What was Petunia supposed to do (even if she wasn't a total trash heap of a human being) if an envelope starts spewing bubotuber puss or screaming at infant Harry?

** There is a scene like that in Three to backstep, as I recall. He ends up hiring other students to help write replies, in addition to the house elves.
