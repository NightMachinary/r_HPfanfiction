6 Months ago I posted about this fic I can't find, but the original post is archived now so I'm posting it again :D

I just copy paste the original:

"I'm having a hard time finding a particular fic...

Tom is innocent, and was imperioused by Dumbledore as a Child, Harry reads out his diary in the Slytherin Common Room, A lot of characters essentially 'Time Travel' and regain their memories, includes the Twins, Lupin, Sirius, I THINK Tonks and a bunch of others I can't remember...

I hope that's enough information, since Google and my Memory has failed me!

Thank You!"

Someone please help me! I need this fic again! It's LITERALLY been half a year and I'm still searching!!!

Thanks anyway.
