Can anyone please recommend any powerful Hermione fics where she is the main focus and a complete BAMF. She can be dark or light and with anyone who is her age that is not Ron or no relationship. One example that comes to mind is " Hermione the demonologist" by Brilliant lady. Thank you in advance!!

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

*** Is this canon from Hermiones perspective? Or is it something else? The summary doesn't really have much meaning to it.

**** I'd say that it's a complete AU that has canon elements. The summary is intentionally vague because it has two huge twists that would give everything away if it were in the summary. I've put them in spoilers below if you want them.

Hermione is literally the spawn of satan. No really. She is being raised by the Grangers, but is not their daughter, but instead the Devil's daughter. She is evil, and she does evil things, but she's also very likable and loves Harry quite a lot. There are many very humorous moments (and a couple of very evil things she does that will shock you). The second twist is that she has somehow managed to get Tom Riddle's diary from the Malfoy's before she goes to Hogwarts, and has Tom Riddle in her brain, though she isn't that influenced by him (mostly it's the other way around). It's a very good story if you enjoy powerful and very dark Hermione (and dark Harry later in the story).

** Linkffn(For the Only Hope) Hermione trains to be a bamf protector of Harry. She uses the time turner to get more time to train, so a lot of the plot is around that and her work for the Order. It's one of my favs :-).

There's another one where she gets stranded on an island and trains there, but when she finally gets back to England, the war has been lost. There's a time turner and she secretly helps the war from the shadows. I believe she gives herself the codename Nemo, but doesn't reveal herself to Dumbledore. I'll keep trying to think of the name.

Linka3(Tangled Strings and Technicalities)[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13552503][link]] HG, Ginny, and Luna accidentally fall back into the past, and at the same time Sirius falls out of the veil. They have to decide whether they're going to risk interfering in the war. She's less of a bamf in this one, but still an awesome main character.

Linkffn(When a Lioness Fights) HG becomes spy behind Order's back and eventually forms alliance w Snape.
