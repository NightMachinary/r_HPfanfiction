Like, he introduces himself to the Avengers as the Master of Death and Tony scoffs and calls him and edgelord, meanwhile Thor is wide-eyed in the back of the group. “Loki told me that if I ever meet a green eyed man calling himself the master of death I need to *Run*” or “oh shit, it's my sister's boss!” or “whelp, it was nice knowing you Tony” or something like that. Or Deadpool asks him to give Death a day off for date night sometime.

Or Wonder Woman's mother told her stories of the black-haired, green-eyed master of Death as a child and Batman has heard enough snippets about him from various people that he's willing to believe it. Or the Guardians of Oa told John or Hal to just step back and clean up after the Master of Death if they meet him. Or Superman discovered info on him from some archive he took from brainiac. Or Doctor Fate greets him as a compatriot as he keep order between life and death.

The Winchester brothers are cautious but making jokes meanwhile Castile or Crowley or Bobby are like “oh. Fuck.”

Death comes by and tells Q to stop messing with the Enterprise and... I don't know enough about Star Trek to know who'd be aware of the Master of Death. Maybe Data or a politician they're bringing somewhere for some reason.


** I kinda wanna see a subversion of this: Harry is "death" or Death's 'partner', but goes about his regular life/business and stays 'low-key'.

Unfortunately, more 'in-the-know' characters recognize him/what he is/alludes to his nature, and that causes dominoes/shenanigans.

Like John Constantine having an "oh crap" moment on meeting him, and others are confused why it's like he's walking on a tight-rope. It'd be ironic if the characters you'd expect to be the most skeptical, like Batman, are in fact the ones to discover/believe what he is first, confusing the others entirely.

A Green Lantern's ring suddenly have a panic attack?

Wonder Woman remarking that "it's more personable than I expected" would be pretty funny.

I think Terminal Justice had elements of this, but that fic went off the rails *hard* even compared to the cracky Make a Wish foundation it was built on.

Or where other powerful beings, like high-up fae, act all courteous and respectful to the apparently normal-looking, plain guy in the crowd. I could see Dresdenverse fae regarding Harry as some sort of Eldritch thing, warily scrutinizing his movements for some danger even as he just pops to the shops to buy milk.

Sometimes, the most dangerous guy in a bar isn't the flash or aggressive guy drawing attention to himself, but the quiet guy in the corner, his back to the wall, drinking his pint in peace.

*** Well, you know what they say. The last person you should mess with in a bar is the older guy quietly having a drink in the corner.

And I'd love to see some of the stories that would fit your description, they'd be great! Maybe it'd be the time that Thor and Loki are walking around earth in Ragnarok and they see a guy whistling as he walks down the street, and Thor notices Loki is doing his absolute best to appear politely indifferent. And once the whistling fades he stumbles and steadies himself on Thor, who asks what's wrong. “That was the Master of Death, whistling as it walked by.” And Thor doesn't believe him until he realizes that each of Loki's tells are visible. And he says “Oh,” in a variety of tones (questioning, realizing, pants-shitting terror, more questioning, I have an idea) “should that make him our sister's boss?” And Loki stares at him like he's an idiot before realizing that, yes, he probably is, and the world's about to end so they might as well call the Master of Death's attention to themselves while they're at it. They do better under pressure anyway.

******* Turning down a story that ticks all your boxes because you saw it has a gay couple as the lead is definitely a little homophobic. You don't have to be gay to be able to enjoy a story with gay people in in it ffs your sexuality has nothing to do with that.

I clearly made an exception if it's a sexual story but if it's just romance the sexuality doesn't matter unless your homophobic at least a little.

******** Again, just no.

You're basically saying that because I'm uninterested in reading a story that features elements that aren't my personal preference/taste, I'm a 'phobe' or an 'ist' of some type because I simply have no interest in reading it.

You can't try to shame or force someone into liking or accepting something you have interest in reading or liking personally simply because it just doesn't suit your world-view.

Some people like reading Hermione/Malfoy; I'm not one of those people. Some people like reading Harry/anime crossovers; again, I'm typically not one of those people.

What, are you going to call me a 'phobe' or 'ist' of some type for not having an interest in those, too?

Hypothetically, what if you personally don't have an interest in reading Harry/Fleur? By your logic, I can call you a 'Francophobe' because you 'obviously' must be racist against French people 'by even just a little', right?

I am simply uninterested in reading slash fiction. I daresay there are people out there who do not like reading, say, harem stories (personal preference again, here: I'm not interested in reading Harry or another character having a wank fantasy of being with Hermione, Fleur, Tonks, and the kitchen sink simultaneously -- again, I suppose by your logic that makes me 'polyphobic' or 'heterophobic' or some rot, right?) or anything else.

To believe so is not only a very sheltered viewpoint, that in itself is just offensive.

You're either trolling, or you seriously need to walk the world a lot more.

** If you want a crossover fic with Babylon 5 then I would recommend reading the Lone Traveller series by Dunelos ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1456519]]). Harry is kinda MoD, but not really.. also sometimes people recognise him and panik and other times they dont. It really is a great series, but also really really long.

If you want an Avengers crossover fic, where Harry is also the MoD, I could recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136/chapters/9358017]] it is the only avengers x harry potter fic i have ever read, but I liked it.

*** If you like Avengers and Harry Potter crossovers, may I recommend linkffn(Heroes Assemble! by Stargon1)? He's not full-on "Master of Death" but he does utilize the Deathly Hallows, and I feel the writer does a good job incorporating the magical world into the realm of Marvel. Draws from a bunch of comic material too.

Also, beware: it. is. LONG. Also diverges incredibly from MCU Canon. And Marvel Canon in general. Obviously. But it's a good read. Not the best fic out there, but certainly not the worst.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.

**** I will check it out, but generally I stay away from crossovers ^^

I dont know why, but I prefer just one franchise at a time. The two that I posted are the only crossovers I ever read and the Lone Traveller Series, has many different crossovers and many stories that are just Harry Potter..

Still I liked the last Avengers Crossover I read, so I will give this one a chance :)

**** I love heroes assemble but I just can't read more than 80 chapters in. I'm not a fan of heroes winning /but wait! It was all apart of the villains plan!/ it really invalidates the win and it's just one stressful battle and bittersweet victory after another because you can never actually defeat a comic villain! Norman Osborn always is resurrected by the devil or has a clone or didn't really die, and guess what else! He cuckolded you with your now dead girlfriend and their kids were raised to kill you! And she's alive as a clone now as well! Isn't that great!

That's why I prefer older/competent!Harry or Harry with one reliable, reasonable adult helping him. Usually those stories give good battles and successes. And even if/when the enemy has secret plans someone recognizes this.

I just remembered that she sends her Lone Traveller into the Babylon 5 universe quite often, but I also remembered a character named Q coming up every now and again.. could have been different stories though :D

I am not very well versed in Babylon 5, but it some TV series about space ships and aliens and a space station named Babylon 5. I only know what I read in that series of Dunelos.

The Doctor Who part is really just a lay over and not much story. It just tells him being there for many years and lives and then moves on.

​

Personally, DS9 is my favorite. I haven't seen Discovery or Picard, mainly because I refuse to pay for the CBS streaming service and I haven't cared enough to hunt down a free stream online yet.

One advice I'll give you though is that pretty much all of the shows start off a little rough until they find their footing after a few seasons. DS9, for example really picks up with the start of the Dominion War.

Also, the best eye candy is on Voyager and Enterprise, heh.
