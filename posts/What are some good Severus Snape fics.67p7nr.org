Your favorites?

It can focus on him or a pairing (Please no male-male as I like straight Severus. Also, no Lily/Severus because JK Rowling did too good a job to spoil in my opinion to read a fic of them)


** I am currently in love with this.

linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower)

This is one of my all time favourites. Harry gains closure with portrait Snape.

[[http://occlumency.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=5403]]

I'll always recommend linkffn(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love by billowsandsmoke)

You should go check out the entries on Snapecase. There's some fantastic work there. Especially the younger Snape fics.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** Do you mean stories focused on him or with him as a significant supporting character?

linkffn(The Apprentice by Deborah Peters; 7937889; The Never-ending Road; Digging for the Bones; 4763572; Chasing the Sun by Loten; 4041666)

These are some of my favorite stories featuring him as a main character from common tropes.

The Apprentice is a time travel redo fic that does things differently than others. Snape is very IC this is very well written. It hasn't been updated in a while, but it's worth reading.

A Difference in the Family is a biographical account of Snape's life that is canon compliant. Much of it, especially Snape's childhood is especially well written. It offers a different perspective from the early "mean professor" presented in canon.

The Never-ending Road features girl!Harry. It follows certain aspects of canon, but diverges quite a bit after the second year. This story is a gen-fic with very small amounts of romance. The main character Harriet actually acts and thinks like a girl which is refreshing. This story follows Snape's thoughts and feelings as he treats Harriet differently than canon Harry. His friendship with Narcissa is an entertaining part of the story.

Digging for the Bones is a Severitus story that deals with child abuse and its consequences. Kind of a tearjerker when referencing the student death.

Honor Among Death Eaters is a canon-compliant fic set during the First Wizarding War. It is about Snape's relationships with the Malfoys, Regulus, and Lily.

Chasing the Sun is a SSHG alternate version from OotP onwards. Snape mentors the trio and directly influences the war effort.

Phoenix Song is the first in a trilogy. It explores a Hermione Snape relationship starting from HBP and remains canon compliant. It was interesting to read because it makes you consider that so much of what Hermione could be doing is behind the scenes.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF.

** [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwfE6l6RtZAsd2xYdHliN0NrN0E][Soul Play]] by snapesforte.

This is the definitive Snape fic for me. He is subtle, ambiguous, pragmatic, ruthless and more than a little fucked in the head.

It's an alternate 7th year, Snape/Narcissa (though the romance isn't the main focus). Harry appears later in the story.

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) A massive AU with more reasonable and sane Voldemort. Snape is one of the main characters here and I love the way he is characterized. He was not responsible for Lily's death here so he is bit more balanced while still being in character. Great snark and humour as well.

linkffn(Pet project) Good Snape/Hermione fic, but no romance until the last few chapters. Lots of humour scenes and a good progression of their friendship.

Also linkffn(Had I known) and linkffn(Kept behind)

  After killing Voldemort during seventh year, Harry vanished without a trace. But now, 8 years later, a deadly secret forces him to return and it seems that only Snape will be able to save him. SSHP, no slash

  In the end Voldemort always comes back to Severus. Bellatrix is his most devoted follower, Lucius is his most useful... but Severus is Voldemort's mirror. DH oneshot.

  The trio want an insight into what goes on at the Order meetings, but they end up gaining some new perspective about a man they never considered much beyond 'ugly, greasy git'... a few itty swear words, nothing too bad. Could be seen as AU.

  One-shot. It'll be simple, Dumbledore said. Just pretend you're a loyal Death Eater, and use your position to protect the students. Sure. Simple. But how was Severus Snape supposed to protect the students when they did stupid things like try to steal Godric Gryffindor's sword from the Headmaster's office?
