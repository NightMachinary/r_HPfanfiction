:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey guys, long time lurker, first time poster. I'm looking for a fic I read a few years ago that I literally cannot find anywhere.

The premise, as I recall it, is Hermione saves Severus from the shack. At some point they get together. It's not majorly sexually explicit as far as I recall. The particular detail I remember is that there's a lot of references to how he charms their bedroom to appear as a tent out in the wilds of Africa complete with lions roaring in the distance. The twist at the end is that once you think they've led a long and happy life together, it was all in Snape's mind and he asks himself why he imagined a life with Hermione, not with Lily. Hermione may have also been having the same fantasy with the help of the Weasley Patented Daydream Charm (I'm sure those are mentioned at some point).

I know this isn't much to go on, but the description of the tent and SS questioning why he imagined HG as his wife not LE have both really stuck with me and I was hoping someone else remembers or knows this fic and can link me up, as I'd love to read it again
