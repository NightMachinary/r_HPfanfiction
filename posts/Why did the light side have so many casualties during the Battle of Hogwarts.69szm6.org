So, as you know castles were built to be defensive structures. Hogwarts sits at the highest point of its imminent surroundings with open ground between the Forbidden Forest and the castle itself. This means that any attacker has to expose for several hundreds of yards while literally fighting an uphill battle. The defenders can fire into the advancing foe from behind the battlements without exposing themselves too much. From a distance of 300 yards, they are effectively impossible to hit with accurate fire.

Now, every witch and wizard carries a lethal weapon. Even if they are not using the killing curse they have a wide arsenal of effective battle magic at their disposal. The bombardment curse (Bombarda), the Reductor curse and the blasting curse (Expulso) are just a few examples. Now imagine 40-50 defenders firing these curses into the ranks of Death Eaters and Dark creatures as they march onto the castle. The defenders don't need to aim at individuals but simply fire at the bulk of Voldemort's forces, much like siege warfare played out prior to the invention of the machine gun. The average defender could fire a spell every two seconds, thirty every minute. With at least 40 defenders per side of the castle that equals 1200 spells per minute fired at the opposition, who is on open ground without any cover. They might use shields but that prevents them from using offensive magic and explosive spells create shrapnel when they hit the ground, which can cause further injuries and is not shielded.

Such an attack over open ground would be disastrous and the battle would end before the first Death Eater reaches the castle gates. So why was the light side performing so badly while defending a heavily fortified hilltop overlooking open ground?

PS: The secret passages could be easily secured with magic or explosives made from potion ingredients hidden and rigged to detonate when the enemy is nearby.


** The "Why" is actually pretty simple. Rowling has even less an idea about effective battle tactics, let alone magical battle tactics, than she has about simple maths in worldbuilding. Plus, she needed the battle to be close for story purposes.

The only "in-world" explanation I could offer is that the defense was hasty and barely organized. Aurors are dark wizard hunters, not soldiers who would immediately try to figure out how to fortify their position. The defenders were students and civilians, with the rare Auror and veteran in the mix.

The attackers were a bunch of trained and socio-/psychopathic killers.

The fact is, killing is hard. Even in life threatening situations, killing comes very hard. For example, soldiers in WW1 often fired in the air to sort of "shoo" the opposition away. Thats what we do, as humans. We pose, roar, threaten, but actually killing is rather rare. You need to be trained to kill, hence why armies around the world issued drills when they saw the meager hit-rates of their soldiers in the trenches and smaller, well-trained armies conquered the battlefields. The Death Eaters were trained to kill, and even enjoyed it in many cases. They had a /huge/ advantage, because they lacked the barrier of empathy, or were trained to kill. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zViyZGmBhvs][(If you want source on this, here is a great video on the matter.)]]

People like to assume they could pull the trigger in a life-threatening situation. But for a matter of fact, most can't - at least not before utter panic sets in.

*** In addition to this, what we /have/ seen of magic fighting are basically just one-on-one duels in an enclosed environment. Fights where spells where slung and dodged and/or shielded against.

If it is possible to dodge/shield from magic slung at you a mere couple of meters away, than flinging a few Bombarda's from the battlements would (presumably) give the Death Eaters enough time to tapdance their merry way through.

Not even taking into account that the spell may fizzle out or lose effectiveness the longer it is 'airborne'.

But they're two people. You asked about the entire defense of Hogwarts. My argument stays the same.

Maybe add the old Order members as trained militia to those numbers. We'd still talk about a dozen, maybe a bit more or less who could do true damage without having to fight their own psyche.

** Well, shield charms are a thing. The attackers could easily do a Testudo phalanx of overlapping shield charms. Since the defenders aren't in the habit of using Unforgivables, that makes it pretty effective. I imagine it could also cover more than one person, so they could pair up with one for defense and one for offense. Fragmentation from hitting the ground is less deadly than hitting solid stone, so that would be minor chip damage at best.

Also, the defenders are static while the attackers are mobile, even if they do present a big target. Stone fragmentation from Confringo (the actual blasting curse, Expulso is kind of a force push. Or maybe we just have a lot of blasting curses.) or Bombarda (the movie blasting curse) would be pretty deadly, not to mention collapsing walls or floors.

There's also the fact that a good quarter to a half of the defenders were teenagers and likely wouldn't have been aiming to kill in the first place.

Pretty sure there were also dark creatures acting as a vanguard. So you'd want to deal with those first.

*** Why wouldn't they aim to kill? That's one thing I never understood. It's them or you. Kill or die. That should be more than enough motivation to use every curse you know up to and including the killing curse. These people want to rape and murder you, your family, your friends and everyone outside of their race. Why should any Death Eater be spared?

People killed for home and motherland throughout history. People defending their homes refused to fight when they knew that they would live if they surrendered. If there was no such guarantee they fought until the end. Even Sun Tzu recognised that when he wrote The Art of War.

#+begin_quote
  Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard.
#+end_quote

Soldiers of that time were no professionals but peasants armed to fight with little training, most of them between 14 and 30 years old. So the argument about the defenders being kids does not work against Death Eaters. Young adults fought and killed since the dawn of mankind. Audie Murphey, the highest decorated US soldier, joined the army at the age of 16 and received the Distinguished Service Cross and the Medal of Honor at 19 years old.

**** Because the majority are scared children who haven't internalized that killing is necessary, or that they would die if they didn't. They have not internalized what it means to deliberately murder another human being, even in self defense. They might aim. They might even kill. But I highly doubt even three quarters of them are /aiming to kill/.

For the rest of it, you're confusing modern british schoolchildren with poverty-stricken peasants from older times. Peasants who knew the harsh reality of the world and had fewer moral qualms about doing whatever they needed to survive. Peasants who killed animals on a regular basis and had at least partially desensitized themselves to death. Peasants who knew they were fighting in an actual war and mentally prepared themselves accordingly.

Even your example of Audie Murphey disregards the fact that he joined /a muggle army, received specialized training, and knew precisely what he was getting into./ Throw a Gen Ed college student into a fight to the death with hardened killers and you're going to get bad results.

***** But he went on and even faked his birthday in order to join because he wanted to fight for his country. Surely more than one pureblood will have that motivation. Hell during the Warsaw Uprising 1944 the bulk of the fighting force were young adults around the age of 18. These people had little to none military training but fought with the power of desperation. They were doomed to fail due to the political plays of Stalin but they fought nonetheless, engaging in close quarter combat (where they saw the brutality of warfare). They fought because they knew what happened to the losing side. Gulags and execution or fighting was their choice and they chose to die trying for a better future. If the fight was necessary is another can of worms but young, educated adults are still able to fight if the need arises.

****** You are correct in that age doesn't matter. What matters is mindset, and the majority of hogwarts students did not have the mindset necessary for pitched battle. There's a reason you go through bootcamp when you join the army, and it's not for shits and giggles.

The defenders lost so many people because the defenders were civilians. Not soldiers, not psychopathic killers, not army conscripts. Civilians. Who are in no way, shape, or form, prepared for a soldier's job.

I think we're going to have to agree to disagree here.

******* I'd raise a counterpoint about the mindset of the defenders of Hogwarts. They were throwing Mandrakes over the walls. A Mandrake's cry is lethal to anyone who hears it. Therefore at least some of the defenders were using the magical equivalent of a gas attack (potential for paralysing or killing the enemy in large numbers) and had no moral issues with it. And Professor Sprout as well as Mrs. Longbottom seems to agree with the sentiment of lethal force.

******** I don't think that's a very strong counterpoint. There's an element of separation from the consequences of throwing a Mandrake over the wall into the enemy. They'd psychologically believe they didn't kill the enemy, the Mandrake did. At least in the moment.

Professor Sprout and Mrs. Longbottom experienced the first war and their losses. It makes sense for them to have a different view than scared school kids. They have a wealth of experiences behind them that children don't.

** I would say that the Hogwarts defenders are less likely to use or be able to use lethal force. Magic can seemingly save people from a lot of physical damage (Harry's fall in PoA, Neville bouncing). This means the attackers can patch people up and send them back to the line. Adding to that, the castle and its grounds are large, so there might not be enough people to cover the whole of the castle's exterior, allowing attackers to close in. Giants also act as tanks, absorbing and dealing large amounts of damage. I also believe that the attacking side had a larger initial force, while the defenders didn't gain numerical superiority until reinforcements from Hogmeade and other areas arrived. While you are correct about how quickly spells can be fired, I find it unlikely that many witches and wizards could sustain that pace of spell fire for longer than a few minutes at most and would likely be tired afterwards. Finally, it is unlikely that the attackers didn't create cover as they advanced on the castle, and were also likely spread evenly around the castle and on broom. All of these factors are why the attackers could likely reach Hogwarts with fewer casualties than a non-magical force.

*** You only need a few minutes of fire, especially if using the killing or blasting curse. That's more than 1000 potential kills each minute. There won't be much opposition left after that time because most of the spells would find a target, be it a spider, giant or Death Eater. Even if you only kill 1/4 of the opposition that is more than enough to break their force because another quarter will be injured beyond the capabilities of field healing before they reach the castle. Harry was slowed by Dumbledore and Neville performed accidental magic. And while you can mend bones and cuts within seconds detached limbs and crushed organs are an entirely different matter. Because that's the kind of damage you face when under fire by explosive spells that have the ability to break a massive stone wall.

** Probably because they pulled a stinking Dumbledore :( - as in:

They didn't put their enemies in the ground permanently and used stunners and other non-deadly curses, while the Deatheaters simply use killing curses and other dark magic (like that cutting curse Dolohov hit Hermione with in the Department of Mysteries in 5th year!)

Most of them don't have the stomach for killing and only do so when absolutely necessary, while the Deatheaters are professional terrorists and have no compunctions about taking somebodies life - especially if it's "only a half-blood, blood-traitor or a worse: A mudblood!" - the Deatheaters might not have been trained, but an untrained person with a gun is still more lethal than most trained people who don't like to kill and only use tasers!

Add a lack of tactics (using existing fortifications, adding some to it where needed, using stuff like land-mines (or a magical version of that), trap-spells etc.) on the light side (they are vigilantes not trained soldiers, even most Aurors would probably barely make it in a non-magical army or police-force (especially something like SWAT!)), coordination etc.

Not to mention that their morale has been eroded - the DEs control Britain and for them it's also, probably, death (or Azkaban) if they get caught, so they are highly motivated (not to mention that Voldemort will torture them if they fail, if he survives of course)

ps: Exactly this (that they don't have compunctions about using unforgivables and killing) is why I think all DEs should have been tossed through the veil after the light won, but nope, the likes of Malfoy - again (in Lucius's case!) - got off with a slap on the wrist!

** Voldemort had access to hundreds of dementors, a group of giants, he had roused the acromantula, he had groups of imperiused wizards at his call. As wizards they also had access to brooms.

Essentially he had an infinitely mobile fighting force that could attack from virtually any vector fighting against an immobile ragtag group of adults and children.

Fill the sky with the nigh invulnerable dementors and you've effectively taken out the defending forces most deadly and hardened fighters (the best fighters are also probably the only ones who can maintain a patronus). Have a large contingent of broomstick bound wizards lay down covering bombarda's upon the battlements to make these high school aged children even scared to peak their heads out. Send in small groups of dissillusioned troops to provide effective sappers and wreak havoc upon any lightly defended portion of the castle.

Then send in a blitzkrieg of Giants to the main gate. The 25 foot behemoths could cover a measly 300 yards rather quickly. With this group send your imperiused wizards, make the opponent hesitate even more to land that killing blow. Back that up with a heavy dose of covering fire and the highly magic resistant giants should have no trouble breaching the gates.

After that the defending force must split their attention both internally and outside which would allow voldemort to push his advantage even more.

** I'll take the other side. The light did unrealistically well. A competent, organized group of combatants should have have overwhelmed the civilian irregulars.

The cheap, cannon-compliant solution is to note that children can cast Fiendfyre. The Imperius curse exists. And McGonagall's defense tactic is to pack everyone into a room and lock all the doors.

But that's unsatisfying. So let's rule out strategies that revolve around treachery or professorial incompetence.

Instead, we'll use your scenario. A siege of Hogwarts. The Light has 200 civilian defenders. Figure that about half of them are kids. The other half are older students or civilian adults. They're divided like you suggest, with 40 / wall, and the last 40 inside the castle or on the roof or something.

The Death Eaters have about 40 people. And they've got a few hours to prepare.

Other people have talked about willingness-to-kill. So, let's handwave that. The defenders are able to shoot their spells at the attackers.

The problem is aim. Wands look like a less-ergonomic version of pistols. And they don't have sights. Competitive pistol competitions put their targets are ranges like 10, 25 or 50 meters.

Untrained civilians aren't going to hit human sized targets at 300 meters. They're definitely not going to hit moving, invisible, human-sized targets at that distance, in a battle, at night.

This gives the death-eaters another unsatisfying exploit. They can win by attrition. Get close enough to trade spells. Wait until someone is downed. Retreat, reenervate your guys. Repeat. Any defenders you hit are out for the fight as broken bones still take a while to heal.

So, let's rule that out. Maybe renervate is really costly to cast. Or Voldemort wants the castle taken by dawn. Or whatever. The death eaters need to actually take Hogwarts.

Static fortifications are a great protection against arrows. They're much less helpful against artillery or fire. And, from the damage to Hogwarts, we know that the Death Eaters have combat spells that can damage stone.

So, to take a wall, you'd use fog + disillusionment + a broomstick. Have your people approach the castle arrowslits / embrasures from slightly above. Then everyone casts something explosive or burning down into their assigned opening.

If you want to get fancy about it, send the attackers in pairs. One to cast the explosive spell. And another to handle detection spells and defense, or to catch their partner in case a defender happens to notice the disillusioned attackers.

At that point, you've got a trained team of fighters standing off against some schoolchildren and civilians. And the fight ends pretty quickly.
