Ok so I don't remember a whole lot from this story, the biggest thing I remember is that it was a Haphne and that Harry discovered that the Crucio curse was actually a spell meant to act like a difibulater which he used on Daphne to revive her.


** This is a terrible title for this type of thread. It looks like a discussion thread.

I don't know that specific one you're talking about but you might be interested in a similar concept. Linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn518) has a discussion about Crucio originally being used as a medical spell. It has a a touch of Harry/Daphne as well (Or at least a good leadin). This is a reasonably common trope.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** This is a cliche that made it's presence in every indy!Harry fic made between 2005 and 2009 and still occasionally pops up today from people still trying to emulate those stories.

  AU GoF. Harry is brooding over his involvement in the Tri-Wizard Tournament when he receives an offer of help from a most unexpected source. H/Hr/DG, light Ron! and Dumbledore!Bashing, mild language.
