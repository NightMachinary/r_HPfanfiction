**** My understanding is that she has been writing two new stories that she is interested in, though she has expansive notes on her existing works.

******* I gotta say, as someone who only recently started actually using the follow feature on FFN, I love your story so much I anxiously await every chapter and find myself checking every day. Great job

** Kathryn usually writes updates for all her active stories and publishes the new characters all at once. Which usually means that you get 100k words to read at once of you are interested in her stories. Definitely worth the wait.

** To my understanding she Co writes with Plums, and it's always a big chapter that's better delivered rather than bite sized portions.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.

**** Thanks for the detailed reply. Unfortunately, I'm not too interested in her summaries of her stories. I don't like multi-pairings, I certainly don't like Star Wars, and 79k words with just three chapters? But to each their own.
