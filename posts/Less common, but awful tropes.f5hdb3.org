I've read a LOT of fan-fiction (primarily HP and HP crossovers) and I'd love to hear about tropes that you find irritating that are rarely discussed. Below are some of mine.

1. A huge change is made... but nothing actually changes. So many stories change Harry's childhood, personality, friends, etc. but proceed to follow cannon identically - changes should have consequences! Forging the Sword (I think) does a great job of this where Ginny dies in the chamber of secrets and so the Weasley's dont go on vacation and Sirius Black doesn't escape Azkaban. Bravo! On the other hand, I read a story where HP is the master of death (literally and figuratively) and time travels back to the summer before his fifth year. Cannon then proceeds down to the detail (he even gets tortured by Umbridge but doesn't react because he doesn't want to rock the boat). I find these stories completely pointless and honestly worse than the wish fulfillment nonsense that are at least somewhat different from cannon.

2. Heroes join together (crossovers). In many crossovers HP travels to a new world where he encounters the protagonists of that universe. This is interesting. However, he immediately realizes that they are the good guys (how?), tells them all his secrets and joins them. This makes no sense to me given that he is usually coming from a dark world where he has been fighting a war for the past 10 years. I've seen this trope most commonly in HPxAvengers (Marvel) fanfics where Harry is the Master of Death who barely defeated Voldemort, travels to the Avengers-verse, and then instantly tells all his secrets to Nick Fury. Why would a paranoid person like Harry do this? I've seen another version where HP travels to Westeros after a grueling life, finds the Starks, and instantly swears loyalty to them and gives Jon Snow part of his powers. HP's entire life has been at war and he swears loyalty to the FIRST family he encounters? It makes no sense. I understand wanting protagonists to band together, but it's boring and OOC. I would love to see disagreements between people that are fundamentally on the same side. For example, I'd love a HPxBuffy crossover where HP kills Angel based on his experience with monsters turned good and ends at odds with Buffy/the Scoobies.

3. Everyone is OP. Cannon quite clearly makes some wizards/witches more powerful and capable than others. It is debatable if HP is one such wizard or not and many fanfics make him exceptional on par with Dumbledore and Voldemort. I'm okay with that. What I find irritating is when all of HP's friends and allies also become OP. This is commonly seen in Dumbledore's Army fics where HP turns Dumbledore's Army into a "real" army and Hermione, Ginny, Neville, Ron, Luna, Susan, Hannah, etc. all become badasses and are capable of defeating multiple death eaters with ease. I think this trivializes the struggle against Voldemort in the first war if so many wizards and witches have the potential to fight back. Another version of this I've seen is where HP is wealthy and gives his money to Fred and George, Bill, Charlie, etc. to start a joke shop, curse breaking business, dragon sanctuary, etc. and they are all super, super successful. Having one character be OP is boring - having all the good guys be OP is even worse.

4. Muggle-wank. I get it, the Wizarding world is terrible and it would be great if there was some recourse to fix it. However, muggle-wank fics where a single machine gun can decimate every Death Eater and Auror is boring. It trivializes the struggle of the 1st Blood War (why was Lily so stupid - why didn't she make an AK-47 invisible and blast Voldemort to Kingdom Come?) and makes all 1+ million words of HP completely pointless. Another common angle of Mugglewank is muggleborn students bringing popular culture to Hogwarts. This is often seen in the form of movie nights, trips to muggle theme parks, etc. where wizards and witches are completely overwhelmed by muggle technology. It also makes no sense. What's so great about a roller coaster when you can fly on a broom stick? Why would a witch be impressed by a theme park when they can change their appearance or turn into animals and have trunks that can fit entire forests? What's so great about movies when you can share memories?

5. OOC. I take issue with a very specific kind of OOC that I can't quite explain but have a few examples of. I read a fic where HP is assaulted by Lockhart and takes the case to the Wizengamot (this is his second year) and is supported by Head of House Black, Sirius. During the trial, Umbridge acts as an obstacle. This makes no sense. In cannon she is an obstacle because she is loyal to the ministry and he is opposing the ministry. In this case, HP is a national hero supported by a pureblood - so why shouldn't Umbridge be on his side, or at least neutral?

6. HP explains it all. In this trope everyone is stupid until HP enlightens them. This is often seen where Hermione rants about House Elf rights and Harry completely destroys her with FACTS and LOGIC in ten seconds. Similarly, he sometimes corrects people about wandless magic (it's all about intent, dontcha know), pureblood culture, or whatever other topic comes up.

Here are some of the commonly hated tropes that we don't need to discuss yet again: 1. Harems. 2. Goblins 3. Wandless magic/Harry suddenly OP 4. Trunks 5. Pranks/Gred and Forge/Twinspeak/... 6. Anything you can find on those top trope Bingos on hpfanfiction top of all time

I'd love to see what less common but equally terrible tropes you take issue with. I'd also love to see good subversions of the above tropes.


** 1) The trope I hate most is that James and Lily are abusive parents if Harry isn't the BTW. Snape, meanwhile, is depicted as some fantastic, near perfect person.

2) There are some fics that depict Slyerthins as one dimensional bad guys, but a lot do it to the Gryffindors too and it's kind of ridiculous to have the author characterize it as the "big Gryffindor bullies" when the Slytherin characters are freely throwing around the word mudblood in the same fan fic.

3) Muggle wank and "pure blood culture" wank both suck. I'll take the former over the latter, tho.

4) Evil mastermind Dumbledore. He makes some truly shitty decisions, but he's not "evil" and blaming him for Voldemort, Snape, or even Sirius (he should have gotten Sirius a trial, but Sirius also contributed to his own fate) is silly.

5) Harems.

6) Kids acting like full fledged adults, and adults treated the kids like adults. Characters can be well written, brilliant, and mature without resorting to this trope.

6) Stupid hufflepuffs.

** I agree with your points - except I am okay with wizards finding muggle culture interesting / exciting. I think real problem is fics where muggle culture is presented as /clearly superior/. And I love stories where wizards get to explore the other side.

I would also add one more trope that bothers me a lot when I read stories. Random characters (kids!) having knowledge that in canon is obscure and little known. For example how entire Slytherin house goes around practising occlumency & legilimency, everyone having their own pensieves, instantly knowing what mirror of Erised is, intimate knowledge of Harry & his struggles, knowledge about horcruxes. Stuff like that.

*** I don't mind knowledge that in original canon is described as obscure be turned into something more common - but the issue is when that doesn't change the world by becoming common knowledge. For instance, I can see the argument that occlumency would be common place among the wizarding elites, and something they'd teach their kids ASAP - but if that change is being put in, there's probably other repercussions that'd come to.

**** Good point. Don't get me wrong - if there is good story reason why someone knows this or that sure I have no problem.

For example horcurxes: I find it annoying if every death eater knows about them before Harry revealed them during the stand off. And even then it should probably remain a throw away comment with very few understanding / grasping the implication. Recently read a story where Draco joins the horcrux hunt and instantly knows all about them, where to find them and how many Voldemort has. Extremely silly.

***** Ah, I see what you mean there. In that case, definitely - I could see the concept of Horcruxes being known by adepts in the dark arts, but not as a general known idea. And Voldemort certainly wouldn't have told others that he'd created them, nor where he hid them.

I do like how horcruxes are handled in something like Blood Crest though, in relation to the dark arts.

*** I've tried to make a list of people who would feasibly know about Horcruxes, once. They are obscure magic, very dark and evil. However, they are bad enough when in existence that they need to be known to a select few people trained to deal with them. I also suspect that knowledge of them is top secret, because the usual wizard's reaction is probably "cool, where can I get one?" instead of "merlin how horrifying", and that knowledge falling into the wrong hands would be disastrous.

I eventually arrived at a single set of people:

The Unspeakable(s) working in the Death Chamber, or perhaps only the boss of that particular area. They seem like exactly the kind of people interested in that, and researching them.

**** I think a small number of intelligent, curious wizards with certain dispositions. (Slughorn for instance). And they for the most part only know in abstract. Like we know about nuclear weapons, but vast majority have no idea how they work, much less how to construct one.

I think it is quite telling that in canon practically no one knew, or understood why Voldemort lived. Voldemort himself was utterly sure in his secrets that he handed them out to his followers. Lucius for instance had no knowledge what the diary really was.

If they were common knowledge - everyone would be like "You Know Who is back? Well he must have created a Horcrux!" - we see none of that. Nor any effort by Voldie to add extra security / measures to safe guard them, or check and make sure no-one was onto him.

** 1. I can't agree more with this. God i hate it, and its even more obvious in some time travel fics when despite Harry purposely going backwards in time he wants to "keep the timeline" whatever.
2. Also agree, you could always have them Fighting in first instance and after a while make them realize they are both on the same side or whatever.
3. Making someone OP without no one to balance them on the other side its just Mary Sueing. Mary Sueing only works when its interesting and for me it only works in comedy) crackficks. Otherwise its just too easy for the OP character. The Arithmtancer is totally an example of Mary Sueing. God it had sooo much potential., But after a while, i get bored of Hermione lecturing everyone and being just oh so good at everything.
4. Muggle wank: lets just say it applies to the grass is greener on the other side. Also JKR Magic usually seems weak, and since it has not very well defined mechanics the fic author can do anything they want. It falls ultimately if what they do is interesting (as in really balanced fights for example). If its too easy for muggles is just bashing in on a large scale, which is ultimately bad writing.
5. That is not OOCing, IMO, its just breaking the suspension of disbelief. This can be aa small as a character acting weird or as big as the internal consistency of the universe (for example , COG breaks suspension every damn second, and the list is way too long to put here, if you want i can get into detail).
6. That is related to bashing and Mary Sue.

** At some point (usually in one of those cliche fics, where Harry decides to become more independent after fifth year) Harry buys himself an iPod - and the author deliberately changes the dates to one decade later than canon just so iPods exist and Harry can get himself one. No other reason for that change. And the iPod is then never mentioned again in the story.

One could think the author's parents once took his/her iPod away, thus deeply traumatizing him/her.

​

And then there's that stupid letter from Harry's parents which they left in his trust vault. Alternatively they wrote something to the same effect in their will. Something like: "You know, actually Pettigrew was our secret keeper. We trusted him with not just our own lives but with our baby's life as well. But just in case he's a traitor and gets us all killed, we're telling you this so you know not to punish Sirius."

This must be the most ridiculous, most moronic and most pathetic plot device to get Sirius out of Azkaban without any effort on the author's part.

In case you didn't get it: The absolute trust required to entrust their baby's life to Pettigrew's moral integrity would make it impossible to even consider that he could betray them. If they had considered it *at all,* they would have made Sirius secret keeper instead. That letter simply cannot exist. And a completely credible alternative would be just mentioning their secret keeper's identity in passing ("... and to our secret keeper Peter Pettigrew I leave ten thousand galleons and my collection of porn magazines that Lily must never find out about...")).

** The problem with Mugglewank (and wizard/pureblood wank) is that it's not balanced. Authors veer too hard in either direction and it's a pain to read. The wizardwankers that say 'Muggles suck' forget that the wizarding world uses many Muggle inventions (car, bus, train, radio, etc) and that even canon acknowledged if wizardkind didn't marry Muggles, they would have died out. The Mugglewankers forget that wizards have too many tricks up their robes (Veritaserum, Polyjuice, Obliviate, etc) to really predict, and could make you question everything about your life and experiences.

The best way to compare the two is to say that wizardkind peaked early. Like an older sibling that had everything handed to them and was naturally gifted through high school and college/university. Everything came to them and they didn't have to work too much. Meanwhile the Muggles are the younger sibling that had to work very hard for everything and made their own way (even with the older sibling taking advantage of them and bullying them whenever possible). Sooner or later, the younger sibling will eventually catch up to the older one if they keep slacking off (tortoise vs the hare), and with the way canon wizards treat Muggles, it'll be to the wizard's disadvantage.

*** I kinda agree that in the HP universe, Muggle could, eventually, catch up to wizards (though the main reasons why most of the "muggle" items wizards use are decades old is more due to the fact that, thanks to magic, they are still in pristine conditions with equivalent performances decade later rather than the wizards being backward).

But I still hate Mugglewanks fics because even if this future is a possibility, we are talking about something that should happen decades, if not centuries in the future. "Present" wizard do not hide because they fear the muggles, they hide because they wish, or need for nothing the muggles have and so hiding is the easiest way to not deal with them.

I think that "The other Minister" chapter from HBP describe the best the relationship between muggles and wizard : "/Hello, we are currently in a civil war, most of the accidents that happened recently were not accident but collateral damages, sorry about that. There is absolutely nothing you can do about it and we are only explaining the situation to you by courtesy. Now you can only wait for us to deal with it. Also, we placed one of our own in your entourage in order to protect you, you didn't know about it but you said he was a good employee so no hard feeling. Goodbye/"

** One trope that I find outright disgusting is "good things happen to good guys and bad things happen to bad guys." I have dropped two stories that had much potential because of this. In both of them Malfoy was his normal annoying bully, but when Harry and friends just humiliated him without much effort, all tension in the hostility evaporated. What was more, the good guys were able to be cruel towards him without any consequences. Both times I began to consider Malfoy the victim. If a story makes the reader consider the good guys as the oppressors, that is not a good sign. I wanted them to lose, but since it was obvious the stories were just personal fantasies of the writers, I knew it was not going to happen. It was better to stop reading.

Super-power Legilimency is something I hate. In one story two people used Legilimency on each other to share all of their memories. It was done in one evening, and it didn't even leave the two mentally exhausted. Just how powerful is Legilimency? If that kind of thing is possible, why is there a magic school at all? Why doesn't Dumbledore just visit every magical child and plant all his magical expertise in their minds? Legilimency should be slower and much more exhausting than scanning your own memories. Who can relive his entire life in memories in one evening?

One of the most annoying tropes is when a character's music preference is emphazised, especially if it doesn't make sense. It's okay if Hermione likes the Beatles, but if it's someone from a wizarding family, it takes me out of the story. Usually the writer just wants to tell what kind of music s/he likes. It if doesn't serve any purpose in the story, don't put it in there.

This music thing can be done well. For example, in my ongoing story Tom Riddle goes to St Paul's Cathedral to listen /St Matthew Passion/ by Johann Sebastian Bach on Good Friday. However, it's not just my persona seeping into the story. Tom considers it a victory over his past as the poor orphan who wandered the streets of London envying the upper class. He wants to show himself that he has triumphed. It tells what kind of person Tom Riddle is, adding depth to the story even if the detail doesn't take the plot anywhere.

** I generally agree with your points - although, I would disagree with the 4th one to an extent, and a bit about Umbridge. For the muggle wank, obviously if it's taken to an extreme it's not good. But wizards generally seem pretty clueless about actual muggle culture, and seem to have an understanding of technology/culture that's always a few decades out of date.

With that in mind, I would definitely see them loving things like movie nights, theme parks, racing, etc - they'd just look super eccentric while doing that. I also really enjoy well done technology vs magic aspects in general. Would wizards be convinced of the superiority of magic over technology, by and large? Yes. But there's others that would realize - and be worried about - how technology can let /anyone/ do those things, and not just if you have magic.

I'm not sure where you fall on the spectrum of 'magic OP' to 'muggles OP', but I just want to throw out that it is a spectrum - and that making muggles/technology completely useless if they come to a fight, or strictly inferior in terms of culture/abilities is not my favorite take either. After all, much of the 'solutions' the wizards go with in canon are not really better than technology!

For Umbridge, she's not simply an obstacle in canon because she's loyal to the ministry. She's got her own agenda - both power for herself, but also hate towards nonhuman creatures, etc. A lot of her views fit in with the Death Eaters - so if she sees a chance to make herself look good or more personally powerful, she'd take it. In the fic you're talking about, it doesn't seem like it'd be the case - but there are ways to set it up so that she sees an opportunity and seizes it.

  What's so great about a roller coaster when you can fly on a broom stick? Why would a witch be impressed by a theme park when they can change their appearance or turn into animals and have trunks that can fit entire forests? What's so great about movies when you can share memories?
#+end_quote

Here's the counter to all of those. Not every witch or wizard /can/ do that.

Riding a broom like a roller-coaster track is not within everyone's skillset and is also /far/ more dangerous than a roller-coaster (we see Aiden Lynch, a professional Quidditch player, have a serious accident in the world cup final match). You also need a good broom. Whereas pretty much everyone who wants to can hop on a roller-coaster and ride the ride.

Human transfiguration and self-transfiguration into an animal are both NEWT level types of Transfiguration. Not everyone is going to be capable of that but pretty much everyone can go and enjoy a theme park.

Trunks that can fit an entire forest in them are not canon. Moody's trunk is the only book canon example of expanded trunk storage and that is a single deep pit of a room not an entire forest. We also don't know how expensive or hard to create they are.

Sharing memories is only possible through a Pensieve. Of which we only see one. Owned by Dumbledore. So that's hardly a common. And tbh, are your memories /really/ more exciting than a summer blockbuster? Harry's might be, but are most people's?

That's obviously not what they meant, though. Like, we don't go to the cinema to watch billy-bob's fishing trip, filmed on his nokia seven. We watch extremely expensive works of art, crafted by professionals. I see no reason for this not to be possible in HP, and it would be infinitely more engaging than a 2D screen or a 3D illusion. Imagine walking through the mines of Moria with the fellowship, for instance. Obviously it would be a different format, without any breaks and much more engaging, but it would still be very enjoyable.

I did not forget the Planet-in-a-box. However that comes from a movie series which is only tangentially linked to Harry Potter and which also contains several glaring deviations from actual book canon. Ergo, from what we see solely and wholly in the books, planet-in-a-box trunks don't exist.

You mean /other/ than the fact we see exactly one Pensieve and they do not appear to be in any way commonplace?

And it's not so much that it's not /possible/ simply that at the time the Harry Potter books are set in, it clearly hasn't /happened/. Given that the example being complained about is muggleborn students setting up movie nights, if you sat a pureblood down in 1994 and showed them Star Wars or Jurassic Park do you think they wouldn't be amazed? Maybe not overwhelmed, since they are used to moving portraits that can speak, but at least engaged or even curious as to how the fuck those things were accomplished.
