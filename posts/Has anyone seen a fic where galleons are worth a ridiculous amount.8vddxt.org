After all, those are some pretty big gold coins, and just one could be an ounce- and an ounce of pure gold's currently worth 1295 dollars.

With that kind of money Hogwarts could be funded purely from the snack lady on the Hogwarts express really, and perhaps Dumbledore and his faction are keeping the exchange rate between muggle currency and wizarding that low for whatever reason- insanity perhaps?


** Seeing that actually used would be a deal-breaker for me, because while I can suspend my disbelief for magic, I can't suspend my disbelief far enough to allow for non-greedy, ethically-sound bankers who wouldn't debase the currency at the slightest excuse.

If they keep the exchange rate low - presumably by treaty at the end of one of the goblin wars - the goblins /will/ devalue the coinage so as to not lose money. They don't even have to adulterate the metal: take five quid's worth of gold - a bit over one two-hundredth of an ounce at today's prices - use an engorgement and reverse a lightweight charm, and you've got a coin that satisfies the treaty-mandated sterling exchange rate and gives the goblins their gold back. Trying to melt the coins down for their bullion value breaks the charms and your crucible full of galleons becomes a teaspoonful of molten gold.

It's Gresham's Law, Magical remix: bad money magically replaces good money.

(Headcanon: Goblins aren't, of their nature, necessarily greedy unpleasant dishonest backstabbing little shits. It's just that all the goblins humans ever meet are bankers, and bankers with a monopoly at that. There are plenty of perfectly nice goblins, they just live two miles down and don't ever come to the surface.)

(Also headcanon: the MaCUSA Dragot doesn't have a treaty-mandated dollar value and became the US Magical community's equivalent of the Krugerrand. With the repeal of the Rappaport Laws in 1966 they discovered that everything was cheaper on the nonmagical side, and selling their Dragots for their bullion value made them, for a few years, able to live much higher on the hog than they had been doing. The Nomaj economy noticed the sudden influx of gold, and in 1971 the Gold-US Dollar Exchange standard was formally ended in response.)

It's more knowing a lot about historical shenanigans with minting, seigniorage, debasement of currency, counterfeiting, bills of exchange and promissory notes, exchange-and-deposit goldsmithing, coin-clipping and allied trades. Add the increased capabilities of magic to the long and apparently inevitable history of fiscal chicanery and there are possibilities that are just too obvious not to be common practise.

***** Slightly off topic I suppose, but what was involved with minting and counterfeiting currency back in the day?

Were coins relatively uniform, or were they closer to chips of a valued metal at a certain weight?

Was stamping a monarch's face on the currency done for a long time, or is that a relatively recent thing?

The monarch's head thing has already been answered, but go look at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coining_(mint)]] - in summary, you cut out a metal disc, put it on an engraved planchet, rest an engraved die on it, and administer a mighty wallop with a hammer. The engraved designs would last a few hundred or a few thousand coins before starting to blur, and the design wouldn't go all the way to the edge so coin-clippers would shear off the excess*. And the King/Emperor/Grand High Poo-Bah would be adding more and more base metal to the bullion to make it go further (you can trace the decline of the Roman Empire by the silver content of the denarius: they were pretty much pure pot metal by the end.)

*\ this was, of course, a crime, since it reduced the weight of the coin below honest levels while leaving the state guarantee of value intact, so you were basically making a liar out of the king. The penalty for which in 17th century England was hanging, drawing and quartering if male, or burning at the stake if female.

******* *Coining (mint)*

In minting, coining or coinage is the process of manufacturing coins using a kind of stamping which is now generically known in metalworking as "coining". This process is different from cast coinage, and can be classified in hammered coinage or hammering and milled coinage or milling.

A coin die is one of the two metallic pieces that are used to strike a coin, one per each side of the coin. A die contains an inverse version of the image to be struck on the coin.

That's a really old thing. It was very common in the Roman empire, for example, and Alexander the Great was on coins although I think those started showing up after his death.

*** There's a few ways around this:

a) the coins can't be melted down or if they can it is forbidden by goblin law and you will immediately be surrounded by spear-wielding goblins.

b) individual coins are imbued with notice-me-not magic. You can't sell them to muggles and they will be entirely disinterested in buying or evaluation

**** That makes it /more/ likely that the coins are magically debased, not less. Measures taken to prevent them being melted down make the debasement less detectable, giving greater incentive to do it. Measures taken to stop them circulating out into a third party economy also help in that regard.

It really becomes a suspension-of-disbelief problem if you know anything about economics. There's a /reason/ no nation in human history has turned over fiscal seigniorage to a recently-hostile foreign power, still less to the bankers thereof. Even if you discount every last jot and tittle of the anti-goblin racism of british wizards, the goblins still have a strong incentive to ensure that the Galleon has as little gold in it as possible. Without magic, the wretched things would have only a bit higher gold content than seawater, as Pterry Pratchett memorably described the Ankh-Morpork Dollar. /With/ magic, the opportunities for fraud just get shinier.

A sensible wizard would keep his gold and silver in the form of Kruggerands and Maria Theresas - want to bet that assaying charms are a thing? - and buy Galleons only when he had to after selling bullion to get Bank of England paper that has a treaty-mandated exchange rate.

This is, of course, why Galleons, Sickles and Knuts are still widely used: everyone knows they're cheap goblin crap, but Bad Money Drives Out Good because all the good money is stashed in vaults as a store of value, only converted for current account needs.

Esprit d'Escalier edit: This is why the Weasleys come off as so poor. Arthur thinks he must, as a Ministry official, treat the Galleon as good coin and thinks that dealing off the treaty-mandated, goblin-controlled economy is somehow underhanded, so he just puts up with the screwy prices and the bizarre disjunction between them and wages (wizards went their own way a century before muggles invented trade unions, after all). The man may be fascinated with muggles, but he hasn't ever picked up one of our economics textbooks... mMeanwhile, the likes of the Malfoys have their wealth stored in land, bullion and fine art and can treat Galleons as a cheap currency they can pass off on dipsticks like Fudge who are impressed by the illusion of wealth.

*** I always imagined that goblin coins are indestructible and therefore it doesn't matter how much gold they contain, you couldn't melt them down for arbitrage. Maybe the goblin magic that makes them indestructible only works on pure, unenchanted materials so the goblins would always have to use the full amount of gold, which would mean they couldn't create money from nothing, and the wizards still couldn't abuse the ridiculous exchange rates. That still leaves the problem that the goblins would have to buy the gold at a rate that is far above what they get when they make galleons from it. And even if they get all their gold from the Egyptian tombs they plunder, that still wouldn't explain why they don't just sell it to muggles at a higher rate...

Then while writing this I stumbled upon another question: How is new money introduced to the wizarding world? The goblins employ wizards like Bill for cursebreaking but that can't be the only thing or it would skew the economy dramatically. Physical money is lost all the time, even if it's indestructible and I'd wager that wizards generally tend to increase the gold in their vaults over their lifespan if they can. Not introducing enough new money should thus lead to heavy revaluation, and only introducing new money by paying gringotts employees should make those quite powerful. At least that's how I understand it from googling about economics for about 5 minutes :^)

**** New money is probably introduced through similar mechanisms to Muggle economics - Gringotts mints new coins, offers loans to individuals and businesses that spend the newly minted coins and get them in circulation. The Ministry could play a large role in this - they might sell bonds to Gringotts, paid for using new coins, and the revenue from the bonds are used to pay Ministry employees, vendors, etc.

** Yes, it were up to me, I would have Goblins charging Wizards an obscene bid-ask spread in GBP:Galleon exchange rates:

If Wizards want to exchange GBP into Galleon, they will cough up whatever 1 Oz of gold cost in GBP at the time. In the 1990s, 1 Oz of gold generally cost 200 GBPs. Nowadays, it's about 1000.

If Wizards want to exchange Galleon into GBP, they used to get a rate of 5 in the 1990s. Now it's 25, reflecting the rise of gold in terms of GBP.

Muggles who only need to change a limited amount of GBP into Galleon got a rate of 5 in the 1990s and 25 today.

** I recently read a fanfiction in which people assumed the galleon is made from pure gold - to which one of the MCs pointed out, that the Goblins were quite aware of the Muggle Gold Standard Price per Ounce, thus, they - sneakily - replaced the Gold-Galleon with a rune-inscribed cheaper Alloy that still weighted exactly one ounce and looked like gold - but did actually cost barely anthing.

But yeah: I totally agree that there are quite a few too many fanfictions that try to fill 1-2 chapters with ridiculous ideas over how to cheat the Goblins/Wizarding World out of money.\\
Like... duh.

That one cross-over in which FemHarry leaves Britain behind, and the goblins are like "Yeah look we usually burn the silly paper muggles use to pay with, because its no gold" and FemHarry is like "Imma give you 5 Galleons for all the paper you have now and all you get over the next year, deal"? Goblins: "Deal bitch".

*** Yeah, I've seen that excuse used a few times- one where they were lead coins only spelled to look like gold, and that and many more have the gold coins impervious to melting and damage- which makes me wonder why no one has made armor out of galleons- maybe by sticking them to clothes with a sticking charm or something.

It'd be expensive sure, but you'd be invincible to all but the goblins.

**** i was thinking more about the gold source itself being somehow magical, and the goblins having a monopoly on mining the magic gold veins.

the idea actually brings to mind neal stephenson's baroque cycle. theres a plot point where a bunch of groups are chasing down a cache of “solomonic gold”, “alchemical gold”, or “heavy gold”, which has physical properties (such as weight) that mark it out as different from the normal stuff. theres a scene where a mysterious alchemist uses some of it to create a healing elixir.

**** Physical armour is rather useless in most fights, since there enough spells that can be used on the environment to affect an armoured opponent, and any strong enough curse could probably bypass it. Since you can't melt the galleons into your armour there would always be small holes that might leave spells through. And Any spell with kinetic force would still throw you around. The Armour would be quite heavy, making dodging harder (and since the galleons are spell resistant you couldn't even charm them featherlight). Armour on your arms would slow down your casting. You probably wouldn't want to put armour in front of your face and if you do then you would probably leave at least slits for the eyes, through which spells could enter, and hitting them wouldn't even be that hard with you being so slowed down from all the gold your carrying. And the Killing Curse would probably still get you anyways.

Hmm...well, if you start with the raw gold...titanium-alloy it for strength, flatten it out into a thin ribbon, inscribe that thin ribbon of titanium-gold with runic code for protection, anti-duplication, anti-theft, self-stacking-and-sorting, and self-auditing enchantments, then roll that ribbon up into a spiral, plate the top and bottom with titanium-gold circles with more runes on the underside and coin information (goblin head, date of production, etc) on the outside...

The cost of gold, titanium, labour, any potions for enchantment, that should properly make an expensive galleon.

** I'm not sure how "economy breaking" a real exchange rate would be. I'm using it in my own fics, but in the 90s, an ounce of gold was somewhere between 200 and 300 pounds, leaving you with relatively normal amounts of money. The Weasleys win 200,000 GBP while Harry gets 250,000 from the Triwizard Tournament. An average Ministry salary would be 10000-20000 GBP/month. That's rich, but not "broken" level of rich.
