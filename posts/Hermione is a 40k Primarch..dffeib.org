Basically, the Emperor created a secret 21st Primarch. She was supposed to develop at a slow rate, not unlocking her full potential until the Emperor decided she would. When the Primarchs are scattered by the ruinous powers, she is not only sent to another world, but into another universe altogether. The Emperor manages to find her after about seventeen years. He finds her, and she has done well alongside this worlds version of Psykers known as 'wizards'. Her name? Hermione Jane Granger. The Emperor travels to this alternate universe, and finds her being tortured by Bellatrix.

What happens next? Both immediately and in the near future?

*** Just a few over here. I like the idea of taking the Emperor or the Primarchs and dropping them into various franchises

** The Emperor's precise moulding of the immaterium that allows him to travel betwixt what is and what is not and what may be collapses like a house of cards as Magnus inspect it with all the grace of an inebriated cow in a China store.

The four chaos gods overtake Hogwarts almost immediately and each of them claims a house.

Draco becomes a prince of slaanesh and Dumbledore becomes a Tzneechian lord of whispers.
