** ‘They're what?' Hermione snapped, incredulous.

‘They're turning every unmarried woman into a forced sex slave of the state.' Ron replied, looking at her from over the top of his newspaper.

Hermione whirled around, wand already being brandished. ‘Right, that's the last fucking straw. I'll see you tonight, Ron, I've got a building to raze and a government to topple, I'll have to pick up breakfast on the way.'

*** This is the best response.

Ron: Need a hand?

Hermione: Yes. Keep an eye on the kids. They've already had ice cream today. No more. Tell your mum I can't send her that casserole recipe I promised her today. Love you.

**** Ten minutes later, at the entrance to the Ministry building...

"Give me my wand, Harry!" The incensed witch jumped again, trying to grab the wand held well over her head.

Auror Potter was glad for the extra six inches of height he had over Hermione, and that she hadn't managed any wandless summoning charms. "Hermione, the building didn't do anything wrong. It's the idiots usually inside it that you need to hex. They all called in sick today."

Hermione kept jumping, punctuated by grunts. "Must... topple.... patriarchy..."

***** Hermione: Give me names, Harry. I need names.

Harry: But I don't thin---

Hermione: NAMES, Mr Potter. Now.

Harry ducked his head, and muttered out a few choice ones.

Hermione grinned a wicked grin. There were going to be some howlers going out tonight. And not just from her and Ron. No no no. She was going to get all of Wizarding Britain, France, Switzerland, Germany, and Bulgaria in on this. If those mealy mouthed little fucks had ears by the time she was done, there would be hell to pay.
