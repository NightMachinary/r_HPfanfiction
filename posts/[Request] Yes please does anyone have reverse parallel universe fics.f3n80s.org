Yes like instead of canon Harry going into a perfect parallel world where his parents are alive and stuff, it's someone from the perfect parallel world coming into the crapsack canon world? :) And like if it was harry's parents they'd have to deal with their son being totally different and suffering, and also try to get his trust and maybe raise him and stuff while canon stuff is going on. :) And Harry would have to deal with his parents showing up alive to take him away from the Dursleys like he always dreamed of and that would be emotional. :)


** Not a fic, but an idea of mine:

Lily Potter, Vanquisher of the Dark Lord Voldemort in an alternate dimension, comes out of the Veil.

This Lily lost both her husband and son on that Halloween night, but she managed to destroy the body of the Dark Lord. In the following week, she saved the Longbottoms and killed two Lestranges in the process. Over the next decade, she, Sirius, Remus, and Severus led the effort in hunting down Voldemort's Horcruxes. Finally on Halloween 1991, she managed to track down and destroy the Diadem of Ravenclaw. Voldemort, still lingering as a wraith in Albanian forest, was permanently vanquished.

However, this victory came at a steep cost. Sirius, Remus, and Severus all died at various stages of this dangerous quest. Lily locked herself deep in the Department of the Mysteries, trying desperately to bring her family and friends back. Eventually, she settled on the concept of dimensional travel. For almost 5 solitary years, she worked to modify the Veil into a gateway to a world where Harry and her friends are still alive.

She came out some time before Harry entered this room. This Lily was much more powerful than Bellatrix and slightly mad, so the Death Eaters never had a chance...

Dumbledore&co summoned Harry Potter... who said 'nope' and jumped to another reality.

This Harry then helps a Girl Who Lived, written in the PoV of Girl Who Lived during year5.

***** Except I stopped reading after chapter 4. It is a one dimensional stupid bashing fic. Making everyone unlikable and cartoonishly malicious and stupid - except the daughter, of course. :( And Harry is super OOC.

****** Yeah that was my issue with it :(

The writing was good, but the characterization of the AU Potters was cartoonish, and the way they wrote Ginny/Ron was disappointing

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.
