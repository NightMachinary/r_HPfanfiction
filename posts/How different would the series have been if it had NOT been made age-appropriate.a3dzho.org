There have been countless "What if Hogwarts starts at 14/16/17/18?" threads around. And the answer is pretty much "sex, drugs and rock-n-roll". But what if we leave the ages as they are but remove the age-appropriate criterium? Stuff like Lockhart raping and mind-wiping people comes to mind or more pronounced effects of abusive/torturous situations (Harry after the Dursleys, Sirius after Azkaban) would be some starting points, but there has to be more.

(We all know that teenage sex would be rampant and as teenage "hero", Harry would be getting a lot of pants thrown his way).

How was he so scary that everyone basically drops whatever they're holding twenty years later at the mention of his name.

I think mental illness and trauma would get more than a handwave: Harry, Sirius, the Longbottoms, Remus. These people need help. They definitely don't need Mrs. Weasley calling it "fits of the sullens".

We'd get more insight into the wizarding world because Harry would be more curious. HOW he doesn't find out who Voldemort's supports are until book five is beyond me. That would be lesson one for most older teens.

And yeah, sex drugs and rock and roll.

** The first few books would definetely be very different. One of my biggest problems with HP canon is how little sense it makes when re-read after reading the further books. You learn in book 3 that there's a spell that allows you to hide a location so well that only actual betrayal by a single specific person can lead to it being found. Why not hide the philosopher's stone in a house under the fidelius, rather than at Hogwarts, full of schoolchildren? And while we're at it, why make one of the obstacles a RIDDLE that lets you deduce THE CORRECT ANWSER? Rereading the first books after the final ones just makes me feel that manipulative dumbledore is actual canon. I like to think that if all of the books were targeted at an older audience, we wouldn't get results like this.

**** Thing is, trying to apply any sort of logic to the things Dumbledore does in the first few books doesn't /work,/ because Rowling wrote them to be a kid's romp in a magic school. At the time they weren't a cultural icon, they were just somewhat more successful children's tales in a world with literally millions of children's tales. They hadn't become /THE/ Harry Potter series, and I think Rowling just didn't think that they'd become so... them. So she wrote about a magic deadly snake in a school because it was just a magic snake in a magic school in an imaginary story.

After a while, the books /blew the fuck up/ and now nearly every man woman and child on earth knows about them. So Rowling starts building this huge magical world, and it's wonderful, but it's inconsistent with the first two books because at that time, they were just... books. Another story. An author trying to /become/ successful, not one that had made and given away a billion pounds already. They didn't have the weight of The Wizarding World hung on them. They were just a fun romp in a magical school for kids. And in the fun Harry Potter kid's romp, a responsible Dumbledore who cares for the children and who is responsible isn't allowed, because then there is no romp. No romp means no story.

Which is why I think Dumbledore will never make sense to anybody trying to make sense of him through the lens of the canon storyline.

****** His actions in later books are things the reader can locate within the plot and come to understand through careful reading. They can discover how Dumbledore felt before, during, and after almost any choice Dumbledore makes GoF onward and especialy OotP onward. The first book on the other hand, we are vaguely led to believe that Dumbledore has controlled everything that year, but nearly all the plotpoints don't makes sense for his motive if he had known about them (detention in the forest, Harry thinking Snape was the one working for Voldy instead of Quirrell, the fact that most of Harry's knowledge comes from him overhearing conversations by chance) and also it is impossible to understand which parts he controlled and which he didn't, and it can't be figured out backwards because a lot of plotpoints contradict each other.

For example, Harry discovered the mirror because he was searching for Flamel and Dumbledore appears surprised because he didn't know Harry knew who Flamel was. Immediately after Dumbledore expresses his surprise that Harry knew about Flamel, Harry tells Ron and Hermione that Dumbledore secretly helped him discover the Stone. Except why would Harry think that considering that discovering Flamel was THE MOST IMPORTANT CLUE in Harry discovering the Stone! Sure, one can sweep it all under the rug and say "Dumbledore works in mysterious ways and didn't want it to be obvious he was giving Harry hints", except if this was Dumbledore's motive, then surely Harry's statement to Ron and Hermione proves that Dumbledore is not very good at this. This is only some of the ranting I could about this book.

******* I think this is a great question, and the only better question I can think of is putting stuff in his will, which makes a permanent record of his gifts to Harry, Ron, and Hermione, clues that tie Harry to the Deathly Hallows which is not something I think should be on public record especially considering how famous Harry is. Dumbledore didn't foresee how the Elder Wand would play, so he can't have predicted that, but even without that, for probably hundreds of years, conspiracy theorist would likely correctly guess that Harry has the Invisibility cloak Hallow and Hermione being gifted the Tales of Beedle the Bard would all but confirm this; this is the exact opposite of what Dumbledore wanted for Harry and the Hallows. The only explanation I can think of is that these objects needed to be introduced into the story and because it created interesting characterization for Scrimgeor and gave us a dramatic scene for Harry and him to fight the day before Scrimgeor is murdered and that JKR didn't consider that it doesn't make sense for Dumbledore to do this.

I think your question is a little easier to make sense of though. I have nothing against Harry having one longer lesson, but I also don't think having a few lessons across the school year is as crazy as your question implies. I think Dumbledore underestimated Draco and this was his biggest downfall that year, because Draco organized the murder faster than Dumbledore expected. If you consider that a reasonable interpretation, then it goes to follow that Dumbledore's timing was off and that he planned his year thinking there was no reason to hurry.

What does Slughorn's memory have to do with it, though? I'm not really sure, sorry.

Harry wouldn't be facing him head on; his years at Hogwarts would be less life-threatening, he might not necessarily be as famous...I dunno.

If Hogwarts were 'adulted-up', I figure that a lot of the civil-rights themes that started in later books would come to the fore a lot sooner. The indoctrinating beliefs and values and practices of the Death Eaters, and how to counteract them, would make up a significant part of the plot, as would the rights of various magical creatures.\\
Far from being a background element alluded to by Binns, the goblin rebellions may be significant struggles for civil rights, and what's recorded in pureblood aristocratic history (centaurs chose to be beasts, giants are dumb savages, house-elves love to be slaves) may not be the same as the truth at all.

** Even removing the "age appropriate" requirement would still leave most things within the stylistic preference of the author. People in real life have sex, yes, but not every story targeted at an adult audience is crammed full of sex scenes.

Ultimately stories contain matters which are relevant to the story the author wants to tell. So if you're just changing the target audience of the books from kids to adults, I doubt much would change.

Obviously, but the overall word choice and background situations would change. Hermione would not be called "scarlet woman", you could replace "snogging" with "shagging" pretty much everywhere.

I mean, I get your point, and having a "dick/cock/cunt" every third line is no good writing, not even if you're Eminem. But when Malfoy is shouting insults again and, crudeness adds impact.

*** Whilst you could /technically/ change absolutely nothing and simply say the story's aimed at adults, that kind of misses the point of OP's question entirely, and somewhat disregards the fact that there are general expectations of stories aimed at children vs adults.

The implication of OP's question is clearly about changing the story based on those general standards.

** I think Voldemort would act different compared to canon and would be more effective in getting things done.

​

In book 1, he could've killed harry as early as the welcoming feast. He can make Quirrel brew a poison (slow-acting to prevent detection) and put it in his goblet (switching spell? personal house elf? there are a lot of possibilities). If that is too open for his purposes, he can place the poison on harry's bed or pillow. He can make the death of harry potter an act of revenge from the death eaters. He can even send a letter or return a graded test/assignment laced with poison (absorption through skin contact).

Harry being killed at this time can be an effective statement for the English wizarding world. If he is caught or he did the more overt option, he can own up to it and show Voldemort's face for everyone to see. Voldemort can talk to them to show people that he's actually alive and has done the "impossible" of "defeating" death. For a more dramatic effect, Quirrel could have shot morsmordre at the Great Hall while shouting "LONG LIVE THE DARK LORD!" He doesn't have to live for Voldy to be resurrected later on. But, this move would be like a message to his Death Eaters like "Hey guys, I'm back. Let's get things moving."

Voldemort's spirit(?)/ghost(?)/wraith? would make an appearance like how it happened at the end of book 1. Everyone at the great hall would see him and realize that the Dark Lord is not limited by the confines of a body. Kids from death eater families would tell their death eater parents. Kids from neutral and "light" side families would tell their parents. These parents would tell their friends, siblings, acquaintances, etc.

Rumors would start and these death eaters would act on getting the political and social landscape prepared for the return of the Dark Lord. Those who had family and friends die from death eater attacks would relive the fear during the first rise of Voldemort. There would be an undercurrent of fear and the Death eater-backed ministry and hogwarts can take advantage of the situation by placing reforms to prevent Voldemort's rise from happening again. Misinformation can be spread through the daily prophet to make public sentiment favorable to the reforms being done.

This is just in book 1 and just one scenario for how things could go.

​

Voldy didn't even have to wait for 1991 before he starts possessing people. He could possess people and get in touch with his loyal Death Eaters to get things started.
