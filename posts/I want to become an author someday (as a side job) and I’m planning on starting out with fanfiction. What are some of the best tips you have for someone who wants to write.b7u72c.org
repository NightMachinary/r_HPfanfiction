I only started reading fanfiction regularly last summer and I figured I might as well try it myself. I don't have much writing experience outside of school so I was hoping this would be a great start for me.

I've written a few quick stories, but other than that, I'm not sure what to do exactly. I know this subreddit is full of people much older and more experienced than me so I'd like to ask some questions and hear some suggestions.

- What should my writing process be like?
- How much of my free time should I spend on writing?
- How much of it should I spend reading?
- How much of it should I spend cooling off/doing something else?
- What are some of the things that I should and should not do?
- How do I get people to read my stories?
- How do I improve and how will I know if I am?
- What should I expect out of this potential hobby?
- Any other good advice for beginners like me?

Obviously it's me asking these questions, but I'm sure other young people reading this thread will get a lot out of it as well.

For me, if there is one thing I've learned from the past four months since I started writing, it's that everything gets easier as you go. Don't expect yourself to write a good story on your first try. Don't rush your story and expect it to be good right away. Give yourself and your story time, and it will all turn out better eventually.


** The best advice I have - and the one I have trouble following myself - is just freaking write already. And I say it with love. There is going to be times where it will look terrible and you hate it and you hate your dream of writing, but with every page you write, you're style will morph into exactly what it should be. Proofread to make sure there are no misspelled words, but other than that...don't look back. You can always go back and edit when it's completely done.

** Most of your process is something you're going to have to figure out by doing. How long to write, how much time to spend reading, are things you work out by doing. I can tell you I average 1k/words rough drafted per day, that I discovery write using beat sheets for pacing, and that I read about 4 non-fic books a month, but that's going to be almost irrelevant to how you work.

You can get a lot of readers by writing a popular pairing (or, I suppose, popular trope) in a popular fandom. Sexed up dramione gets more readers than a thoughtful examination of the nature of good and evil centered around minor characters ever will. That's not good or bad, but if your goal is a large audience it's something to be aware of.

You'll improve most in the craft by finding trusted critique partners. Destructive Readers is pretty decent IMO, for sentence level feedback. Don't expect useful criticism from reviews.

** Well, those are some big, multi-answered questions you've got there. I've spent far more time reading than I have writing fanfic in the 17ish years I've been around fanfic, but I'll see if I can help.

Broadly, the answer to all your questions depend on you, what you're trying to create, and what you learn works for you. But I'm not going to make that my only answer.

In order:

​

-This really is different for everybody. As you're starting, try out a few different styles, and find out which helps you create a result you're happy with. Some people write out full-fledged outlines, with Chapters, paragraph summaries, arc summaries, character bios, etc. Having such a detailed and thought-out outline can help you through the slow tedious parts, and help make sure you don't contradict yourself later in the story, or create plot holes. Whereas some people (like me) write a rough outline of where I want the characters to be by certain points, and major plot points, and just write as I go. Can confirm, you may have to scrap large portions if you write yourself into a corner with this method.

​

-Depends on how much free time you have. You also don't want to get sick of it. Spending so much time on it you're starting to dread sitting down to write? Take a break. This is fully under your control.

​

-I don't read too much when I'm actively writing a story. I don't like to influence my story by inadvertently lifting someones good idea, or derailing my own story to address a pet peeve I may have had with the one I read. Again, personal preference.

​

-I sort of addressed this in the second one. take a break when you're getting truely fed up with writing. Not to say that you should quit every time you hit a wall. Sometimes you have to just write down a bunch of garbage to get past a difficult to write part, just to find the one little thing that helps you write that section the right way. Learning to get through blocks is a valuable skill, just don't burn yourself out.

​

-There are lists and lists and lists of do's and don'ts of fanfic. If I had to pick the top ones...

Do: Proofread

Don't: Not proofread

Really. You'll turn almost everybody off to a story if it's filled with misspellings and grammatical errors. And use formatting. A block of text is difficult to read. If nobody can get through your story, you can't get any feedback, and you won't have much growth.

​

-Post your stories. [[https://fanfiction.net/][fanfiction.net]] and Archive of our own are the two I use. There are plenty more. A note on this if you post stuff though. People will like your stuff, and some people wont. People can leave some real crappy reviews when they really don't like your stuff, and that's really okay. I used to take it really personally, but then I read the reviews on some of my favorite fanfics of all time. Ones that I thought were the best of the best, and there were people being crappy in those reviews. Some people just can't keep negativity to themselves. It's much easier to just quit reading a fic you don't like, than to flame the author in a review.

A secondary note on that note. Not all flames are useless. I got DESTROYED in a flame-y review of a chapter of mine, but the person had 3 excellent points about failures I had in the story. I actually went back and changed 2 of the 3 points he made. Some angry reviews will have criticism. If you can learn from them, you can turn the negative comment into constructive criticism.

​

-You improve by writing, and absorbing constructive criticism. That being said, don't pander to the reviewers and give them everything they want. This is *your* story, but it doesn't hurt to test their ideas and criticisms out in a draft where only you can see them, then decide whether it's something that works for you.

And just go back and read something you've posted before to see if you've improved at all. If you're halfway through your second story, and wondering if you've improved, go read your first story. You've improved. Trust me. This works. Hoo boy, it can be hard to read old stuff, but writing junk is a necessary step to getting better.

​

-What to expect? I mean, not a whole lot right away. Some enjoyment at having people like what you write. Better writing skills for sure. If you're thinking about what to expect in terms of money, or a career, I'd say don't worry about that. You've got a lot of bridges to cross before you're ready for that one.

Also, expect people to not like your story, or your interpretation of the characters. Like I said, you'll get bad reviews. It's life.

​

-My advice, is save on google drive. Nothing worse than losing A WHOLE STORY cause your computer dies. So there's that.

Also get a beta. Someone to look over your chapters before you post. Fresh eyes can help point out problems that you can't see anymore because you're so used to reading and re-reading the chapters. The can also help give you good ideas that you might not have thought of otherwise. Not all beta's are created equal, and you won't work well with everyone who offers to help, so try to find someone that only enhances your vision for your story.

Take criticism well. You won't learn otherwise. At all. If every negative comment feels like a personal attack, then you won't be able to improve.

Manage your time well. I'm procrastinating doing my creative writing homework as we speak. So there's that.

Take a creative writing course when you can. It really helps point out your weaknesses, and strengths. I'm good at characterization and dialogue, but bad at setting. So bad at setting. Describe a library, don't just say that they're in one.

​

The sky is really the limit for what you can create in a story. Do you want Harry to also be the Hulk? Sure. Whatever floats your boat. Have fun with it.

Edit: Changed 'any negative comment' to 'every negative comment'. You dont have to be a machine that powers though negativity.

#+begin_quote
  What should my writing process be like? How much of my free time should I spend on writing?
#+end_quote

It's what you want and what suits you best. Set a daily word count you'd like to reach and do your best. If you don't reach it, no biggie. There's no need to sit down for three hours if you can't get out more than a few sentences.

If you can write, do so --- even if it comes out terrible. Do the editing later. You can edit as you go along, but trust me, while this /can/ work for some people, it often just slows you down. It's much easier to make that perfect sentence from a rough sentence rather than nothing at all. Write until your mind stops providing the sentences, then go and edit, then go see if you can write some more.

#+begin_quote
  How much of it should I spend reading?
#+end_quote

A lot.

I can't really stress enough just how much a person can improve by reading. The majority of fanfiction authors would improve tremendously if they read the Harry Potter series again and paid attention to the grammar, style, what works and what doesn't, etc. But go further. See what styles or prose you particularly like, read a lot of it, and you will get better.

I find myself doing this without even meaning to. After I've finished reading something of JK Rowling's, I find myself leaning toward a simpler style of writing; after reading Tolkien, I begin structuring my sentences a certain kind of way --- his way. I often have to snap myself out of it.

tl;dr read a lot, it helps

#+begin_quote
  What are some of the things that I should and should not do?
#+end_quote

This is going to sound like terrible advice at first, but trust me: don't be ambitious. Save that ambition for later. Start small. If you outline a whole series, fill it with foreshadowing and complexity, plan to cover years of Harry's life, chances are you're going scrap most of it when you improve and realize what you wrote is garbage.

Exhibit A: me.

#+begin_quote
  How do I get people to read my stories?
#+end_quote

Have a good summary. Have a good first line. Have a good first paragraph. Have a good first chapter. That's where you hook your reader in. You can also self-promote, but only if your story definitely meets the criteria of what the person is asking for. Some people will recommend their own work when it's only loosely relevant, and that often rubs people the wrong way.

Or write popular pairings.

#+begin_quote
  How do I improve and how will I know if I am?
#+end_quote

By reading, as I've already mentioned, and writing. It's like anything else. Practice it enough and you will improve. But you must also accept criticism. Just writing alone won't get you anywhere. You need to find out what works and what doesn't. See why great books are great. Ask your readers to give constructive criticism. And grow thick skin.

You'll know you've gotten better when you look back at old writing and realize how awful it is.

#+begin_quote
  Any other good advice for beginners like me?
#+end_quote

- Get a beta.

- Grow thick skin.

- Be open-minded. But also don't take every bit of criticism as absolute fact. Double check. Get a second opinion. Or a third. Sometimes the reviewer doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about and you shouldn't listen to a thing they say.

- Run your work through sites like [[https://app.grammarly.com/][Grammarly]], or [[https://www.slickwrite.com/#!home][Slick Write]], or [[http://www.hemingwayapp.com/][Hemingway Editor]], or anything similar to proofread your work. That said, proofread it yourself. A neat trick that can work for people is changing the font of the chapter and rereading; it might help you catch certain things.

- If you're taking a long time to write a chapter, don't sweat it. It's your story and you're not obligated to update quickly if your life is busy or you just aren't feeling it.

- Take breaks. Either to get up and stretch and move around for fifteen minutes, or just stop writing for a few days or weeks if you really need it. If forcing yourself to write is making you miserable, stop.

- If you find yourself getting anxious every time you get a notification about a new review, disable those emails and simply check once a week or so on the site itself.

- Variety. Vary your sentence lengths. Don't use one word or phrase too many times. Don't start two sentences the same exact way in a row, unless repetition for point of emphasis is your goal. Don't end two sentences right next to each other with the same word.

- Learn the rules, then learn when it's okay to break them. There's very little you should take as absolute gospel. A talented writer can pull off almost anything.

This is really good advice. Read, read, read and then read some more. But when you read, don't just passively read. I've worked with some newish writers that have said, "Oh, I never noticed that," when I pointed out a basic grammar or punctuation thing they were getting wrong.

When you read a story that engages you, slow down and think about how the author is using language to get you into the story. How do they build tension? How do they communicate the character's emotional state? What narrative methods do they use? How do they vary their sentence structure? Why does this particular type of writing engage your interest?

Thinking about what you read will help you become a better writer. :D

** Hmm... best tips:

While audience feedback is okay, don't rely on it. Or even take it that seriously. It's far, far easier to criticize than create, but on the other hand, the 3rd refinement is almost always going to be better than the 2nd.

--------------

On that note, finish /then/ refine. It's not as much an issue on paper or even a typewriter, but with computers it's easy to write a paragraph, a page, or a scene... and then spend a lot of brain power tweaking and tweaking it, trying to get it perfect. You will /always/ see room for improvement, even if it's just a change in word choice. So finish first, then go through and do the second to sevenhundredth draft..

--------------

Seriously, take what people are saying with a grain of salt, especially when it comes to overall plot and characterization. (grammar is fine, even well-written authors still have editors) There's a saying in videogame development that applies to this sort of serialized writing: "Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game." In this case, readers will optimize everything that makes a story worth reading right out of it. Look at all the power-fantasy or fix-a-fic's out there that are just completely unreadable because they're /boring./ That's what happens if you let your readers optimize the fun out of your story.

--------------

But to address only a single direct question:

Then, especially in the beginning, write what you want to write without catering to people. Adjusting your content to reader wishes comes later.

And the rest... figure it out yourself. Thats half the fun.

** I'm gonna answer these in the order you asked.

1. Nobody can tell you how you should write. You need to experiment. You may be a planner or a pantser or somewhere in between. Planners tend to write out detailed plans, pantsers tend to just make it up as they go. Personally, I tend to start out a pantser but I have an end goal, and I eventually will make a plan. I always write notes though.

2.However much you can spare. Always try to write at least 5 out of 7 days a week, but try not to overwork yourself. Set aside a certain time, like after dinner, to write and just get stuff down. You can't edit a blank page, so just write and you can go back and edit later.

1. That depends. If you're really into a book or series, it can make you forget about writing for a bit. That's okay. Read books when you feel like it, but reading isn't necessarily mandatory for you to write.

2. Again, that depends. I find that I do sometimes have to step away and do something else for a while and it can help. Before you step away, you should try to work through it because sometimes you're just going through a tough patch or not feeling motivated and working through it can make you feel really good about yourself. If you still feel you need a break, then take one. Reading can be your break if you like. If you get engrossed in a book or series, then that is your break. Don't limit yourself, but do always try to get back in the saddle if you can.

3. DO: Ask advice when you need it; Celebrate your milestones (50,000 words, 100,000 words, etc.) ; Edit your work yourself. You can work with an editor, but you should try to be actively involved in the editing process; Try to find an editor. DON'T: Give up just because you lost your mojo for a bit; Let anyone tell you this isn't worthwhile; Be ashamed to ask for help, no matter what with; Listen to every randomer on the internet; Let mean people get you down.

4. Share them. Either put them up on the internet like many fanfic authors do, or share them digitally or on paper. DON'T sell your fanfiction; that's illegal! If you're publishing online, be sure to tag properly so your work can be found by people wanting to read stories like yours. Also make sure you use the appropriate warnings.

5. Practice. You probably won't know you e improved until somebody tells you or until you edit and see the difference in the quality of your work.

6. Fun. Tears. Frustration. Satisfaction. Wonderment. Fulfilment. Difficulty. Mean comments. Nice comments. Feeling like you're getting nowhere. Hating your work. Loving your work. Going nuts, but enjoying every second of it.

7. Write for you. Don't try to cater to an audience and don't let people sap the enjoyment out of writing. Be responsible if you're portraying possible trigger material or anything that readers might try at home. Just get in and have fun. Laugh, cry, scream, scrunch up your first draft and try again! If you happen to start your story over a few times, save each new start separately and keep your old ones; they can be really useful.

Have fun!

** You're so cute. Because your questions are so innocent. Listen, writing is so personal that the biggest part of it is developing your own answers to these questions, instead of accepting the experience that others have created for themselves. (Negative thinking can create negative experiences and pass them on to you as "reality," when people actually have easier and happier results. )The best advice I can give is write what you'd kill to read. That means knowing what does it for you, regardless of what's popular or trendy, or "acceptible". In the end it's your interest and passion that fuels and finishes a story. Believe it or not, that same passion is underneath all the words and attracts readers. Soon, there's no question of attracting readers. They go where there's a good story. Hell, they go where there's a "bad" story. The power lies in you KNOWING you have a gripping character or story. If it grips you, it'll grip others. Know what this is? Confidence in your personal excitement. In you. That's what great writers write with. All it takes is a feeling. The rest is just decoration and execution, and can be changed according to your life-needs. That's why everyone will have varying answers to your questions above.

If you're wondering where to go from the feeling, I suggest the books, Scene and Structure by Jack Bickham. (You can literally turn a one-page cheat sheet/outline into a saga or a small novel.) and Law of Attraction by Ester Hicks. Incidentally, you engage more readers by writing the next story, not necessarily by writing the current story. But all of that comes when you just plunge into the life and live your writing as often as you can. Cultivate the habbit, but don't beat yourself up for not writing everyday. When you honor the decision you've made to become a writer, your brain never stops writing. It's processing the potential of everything that interests you, whether you spend the day at the keyboard or not. It's a relationship with your inner self and you've barely met it. When you really trust what it can do, you won't need others to answer these questions so much. It's okay if that takes as much time as it needs to. Best wishes!
