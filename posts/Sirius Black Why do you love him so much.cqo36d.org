Recently, I made comment about how I dislike Sirius Black and I got 5 downvotes. This got me thinking. Why do people like him so much? Can someone tell me? I understand, he was very brave for escaping Azkaban. But other than that, what else?


** Well he is a funny and likable character with a little drama and sad story going for him.

Also before book 3 all adult wizards were portrayed as prim and proper and Syrius was a badass escaped convict maruder.

We all know he had his faults, he didn't really grow up but 12 years in azkaban would break anyone.

He was indoctrinated from birth to be a pureblood supermacist and probably a dark wizard but he did't become one.

Syrius was a rebel.

I agree and Gary Oldman.

** When I read Prisoner of Azkaban I was 12 years old. The Dementors, and Harry's story in general spoke to me very strongly, even though I certainly was not sleeping in a cupboard. The feeling of nobody understanding you, nobody taking your side, of teachers and students going on with their lives and leaving you alone. All these were very relatable to 12 year old me.

Sirius was one of the first adults who used his adult status (whether it was money or his legal status as Harry's godfather) to make Harry happy. Not to educate him, save his life or whatever, but purely to make him happy. First he bought Harry a Firebolt when his Numbus 2000 was destroyed, then he signed the permission slip for Hogsmeade. No other adult till that point in time had every done something so kind for Harry. He gave Harry hope that one day, he would live with his family, with people who loved him.

Of course with adult eyes we see that Sirius rather conveniently removed himself from the pool of potential legal guardians for the plot's sake, and that he doesn't seem to benefit Harry much in the next two years he lives. But to me that isn't a mark against Sirius' character, but just the circumstances he was in. I don't blame Sirius for having a breakdown when he found James and Lily dead. And I don't blame Sirius for being so erratic after years in Azkaban and then a year in a house he hated. His is a tragic tale, and I don't like fics that bash him, especially if it's to whitewash Snape.

** For me Sirius represent childhood, he's that hope that things will be better. He's the emotional support despite being an emotional wreck himself.

Lupin is caught up with his own issues but he's pretty much a functioning adult. Sirius has nothing else to live for except for Harry. He never really grew up but it allows Harry to have someone who sympathize with.

Harry craves for familial love. While the weasleys are great, there's a lot of children that he is an afterthought . Albus is none existent unless plot calls it. Lupin has his own issue. Then there's this broken man who have nothing else in this world, who broke out of prison when he realized that there's still danger for Harry. He tries to pick up the pieces of himself for Harry and make him happy. While everyone worries about the bigger picture, Sirius only worries if harrys happiness since he has nothing to fight for. It's safe to say that Sirius is long dead but he only held on for Harry. That means a lot for Harry who always tried to save others, it's the first time someone did something for him out of love for him that he has tangible memories of.

I highly suspect that if Harry had a happy life with Sirius surviving, Sirius would most likely kill himself or drown himself in liquor the moment he feels he is no longer needed. he's a mess but you can't help but feel for a broken manwho still tries for his remaining loved ones. Lupin didn't, lupin tries to run away from everything. Albus cares for the greater good and not for the little things, Severus is a bitter man holding on to his obsession. The weasleys tries but that will always be this distance and insecurity that Harry has when interacting with them. Sirius has nothing but Harry so Harry feels needed,wanted he can hope and have faith for a better tomorrow. Sirius died before he can disappoint Harry, he came to save Harry time and time again when no adults ever came to his rescue.(broom jinx goes to hermoine knocking quirel, besides its snapes job to save him)

Sirius is also the turning point of the story. While book one and two are light hearted adventure, Sirius have been saved but the issue is not wrapped up in a neat bow that at the end of day not everyone gets a happily ever after. He represent the shift in the tone of the Story, when he died Harry's childhood died with him. The hope that some adult will make things better for him ended.
