It kind of ruins my immersion when I have to reread a line and correct it in my head to make the dialogue sound human. This is vital for me to enjoy a story, because if I can't make the scene play out smoothly in my head, I just can't read continue.

This Harry/Tonks fic I'm reading is guilty of this, and the only reason I haven't dropped it is because I like the dueling depictions.


** Yeah super annoyed. I pointed this out in a review once and the author responded that that was how they talk because their mother raised them to speak properly. I was so tempted to respond with "yeah but harry and Co don't sound like robots."

  their mother raised them to speak properly.
#+end_quote

From a scientific perspective, people learn to talk mostly from their peers, not parents. So as long as they weren't raised around robots they would've naturally picked up contractions.

If anyone doubts this, consider that the kids of people with accents don't have accents if they were raised in the US (or another English speaking country)

**** I don't think it's that easy. We all have different registers, and the language I used as a kid with my peers then - mostly working class people's kids - was much coarser than what I used with my parents. Presumably you learn the respective register from listening to the people using it in a given context?

I think that is true also for dialects, but perhaps not mere accents. The use of contractions, depending on the exact one ("ain't" or "don't"?) is either dialectical or a matter of register I think.

***** Definitely, I was just simplifying a bit. Basically a kid will always acquire the language/dialect of their peers. They can also aquire the language/dialect of their parents but that's always in addition to what their peers speak.

But yeah you're spot on

About accents, sometimes people acquire both (like my dad can speak in American or Indian accents) and sometimes people just pick up what their friends speak (my cousin only speaks American English)

** Agreed. Completely ruins immersion every time I see it. I understand it can be hard to remember what situations to use them, or if an apostrophe should he used, but it really does make a dramatic difference. BTW, mind sharing what story you were reading?

*** It was Harry Potter and the Summer of Change. Overall garbage in my book, I made it about halfway through the 8th chapter before I realized there was no buildup and rather bad characterization. Harry, well he borders on cliche Indy!Harry-style lecturing. He does this through monologuing to the Dursleys about how he won't tolerate the way they treat him and how he will hurt them (no details, just says he will hurt them).

3/10 would not bang nor recommend

(also Harry suddenly dropping the 'Uncle' when referring to his uncle broke immersion for me a bit, just because it was a change with no explanation)

** Yes, it ruins a story for me. I like to think of contractions as informal words in Spanish. Could you always talk in a formal tone, to people ranging from your girlfriend to your boss? Sure, but you'd sound ridiculous because, with some people, you should be informal unless discussing something serious, whereas in a professional setting you may try to act more formal. It's exacerbated by the fact that Harry and any other student at Hogwarts are teenagers, and I can't remember ever meeting a teenager who refused to use contractions, doubling the lack of immersion.

It's something people say in real speech, there's nothing wrong with typing it out---it's more natural, even. I feel the same way about slang and constructions that may not be typically grammatical.

*** It would probably do you well not to use them too commonly, as that can give you bad habits (and contractions or their lack can be used to shift emphasis from one word to another, so sometimes it doesn't do to mindlessly shorten everything you can). But having a character who does that or something of that ilk would be fine.

** It's interesting that I have also had people suggest that contractions outside of dialogue are not appropriate. This idea that they are grammatically incorrect is invalid; one may have had a composition teacher opposed to their use, but that doesn't mean anything at all. As a former English teacher, I grow weary of the pedants.

** This bothers me a lot. To add onto it, there are times when a sentence is written in a way that someone would never say. Like, it's fine as a sentence, but nobody would ever say it out loud because it doesn't flow well or something. I usually try to fix this by reading what I've written out loud, so it sounds a bit more natural.

** I'm not annoyed for as long as it's limited to certain characters who would have a reason to do it.

Contractions have a place in speech (and text) because, even if we do ignore dialects and slang, contractions are used to shift emphasis; for example, “it's” places the emphasis on “it”, whereas “it is” places the emphasis on “is”, even though they mean pretty much the same thing. And furthermore, because it is hard to convey via text, carefully juggling that emphasis can be very helpful at times.
