I just finished this [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/530818][awesome series]] and I'm looking for recommendations on something like that.


** I generally like pretty much everything that author ... has once I get past the fact that pretty much every story sets up for a sequel that never gets written. The more recent stuff tends to have an awesome end note that offers some of the closure I'm looking for, but on the older stuff I basically get to the end and cry.

** There's a magical space travel subplot in linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay), though it really only gets going late in the story. Quite interesting once you get to it. Ron learned a bit about muggle space travel and got inspired.

(The flair you want is Request, BTW, rather than Recommendation.)

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** linkao3(4629198) this series has a lot of space stuff in it.

linkffn(12125771) If I remember right this had space plot in it as well but its been a while since I've reread it.

**** I don't think so, it should mostly take part at Hogwarts but I can't recall how it ends.

I have read almost all the Authors other stories without always having knowledge of other franchises and can usually keep up.
