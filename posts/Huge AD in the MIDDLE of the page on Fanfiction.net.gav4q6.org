** Mobile giving me like 5 or 6 ads per chapter interrupting so much text with pointless bs. I don't care about Banner ads or ads AFTER the chapters, but ads in the middle of text ruins the flow of your reading.

*** Well, I would normally have uBlock Origin installed, but for a transient period I found myself devoid of its protection.

That Fanfiction.net decided to do this was the point of concern to me; I was aware that the site was laissez-faire in the extreme with regard to content moderation and slow to make interface improvements, but I did not think it would be so actively user-hostile.

**** FFN is a cash cow operated on the principle of maximising revenue while minimising cost. My understanding is that they have basically a single employee responsible for content moderation for the entire site - one person who responds to all user reports, copyright notices, etc.

** They're very annoying, especially when using the site with a black background and white fonts and these adverts are white. Like a metaphoric punch in the eye.

** .. use an addblocker on pc, or use the app on the phone? If the adds annoy you, just remove them. Thats litterally the purpose of addblocker programs.
