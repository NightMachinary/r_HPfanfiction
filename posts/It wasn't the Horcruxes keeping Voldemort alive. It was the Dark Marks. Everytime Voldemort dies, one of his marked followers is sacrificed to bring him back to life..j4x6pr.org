** It's morbidly interesting -- I like it. This also raises the question whether the DE knew about it or if LV tricked them into it.

If it was the former, then the DEs would be an almost fanatical cult worshipping LV and his ideals, even more so than they already were in canon. In canon, they denied their alliance and were quick to cry /"imperius!"/ after all. They won't have the chance to do so, this time.

If it is the latter and they learn of it after LV dies, thanks to Harry, how will they react? I imagine, once word gets out, they'd panic and try to get rid of it, maybe some would even try to get Dumbledore to help. Maybe there'd be infighting between those trying to get rid of it and those really fanatical ones who see it as a privilege or something.

Very nice prompt! It opens lots of interesting possibilities for fics.üëçüèª

**** Now that makes me think of Death Eaters using 55 the same way neo nazis use 88. An interesting tidbit for my next story, perhaps.

  According to Voldemort's memories, earning the Dark Mark required each prospective Death Eater to commit a murder, because the Dark Mark was actually a modified form of the horcrux ritual. Riddle had investigated the horcrux ritual while still at Hogwarts, but had only made one horcrux---the diary---before he concluded that modifying the ritual to sacrifice a small portion of each follower's magic would be a safer way to anchor his soul to the mortal plane, as opposed to committing the murders himself to split his own soul into fragments.

  The bottom line was that Voldemort had managed to keep his soul tethered to each Dark Mark, which meant that he would never truly die until every marked Death Eater was dead.

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** I get to suggest this fic twice in one day. :)

Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar has this or something similar. It doesn't go into detail, but his immortality is tied to the Dark Marks, not horcruxes.

** What if it's a combination of the two?

Tom does make only one horcrux, the diary but doesn't make anymore because he finds another for his immortality a.k.a the Death Marks. The diary could also be misleading because Dumbledore would think he only had those to worry about.
