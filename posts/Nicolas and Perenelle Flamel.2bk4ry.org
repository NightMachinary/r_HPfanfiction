Have any of you read fics wherein the Flamels are active characters? I would prefer ones with no bashing (of Dumbledore, specifically), but I'm interested in reading any fics you guys can come up with. They just seem like they might be very interesting characters.

Thank you, folks!


** Probably not exactly what you're looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the World is Harry Potter]] by nonjon has an interesting take on Nicolas Flamel. The rest of the trilogy, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2477165/1/The-Untitled-Cheekquel-Project][The Untitled Cheekquel Project,]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2630300/1/You-Did-What][You Did What!]] is also pretty good and also has a pretty unique take on dementors.

*** Thanks! I've read some of nonjon's writing, and while I can tell that he's a good writer and can see why so many like his works, they aren't really to my taste. That said, I have never read Where in the World is Harry Potter, so I will give it a try.

** Sitra Ahra by Voice of the Nephilim [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4894268/1/]]

I thought this was a really well written fic (Harry is adopted by the Flamels after spending some time in a muggle orphanage) but the only issue is that it isn't finished yet. I think there's like 3-4 chapters left.

** One of my older stories focuses on the Flamels. Never reached the popularity of my first story (or the quality and originality of my more recent work, in my own opinion) but you might be interested in it.

**** There's a number of stories where they act as a sort of background support for an AU Harry, an alternative to Dumbledore, in the way they do in /The Thief of Hogwarts/. Off the top of my head, they're pretty active in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here][I'm Still Here]] a sort of AU / Peggy Sue, though they don't show up till Ch. 5, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622538/1/Travel-Secrets-First][Travel Secrets]] another Peggy Sue.

** The Engulfing Silence has a series of stories out at the moment, the flamels are active characters in the 2nd one. But the series does have a couple of downsides, worth a read though. Nice interpretation of alchemy too.

**** I'll do a pro's and con's.

Pros

It has a very interesting premise - that Harry has an astoundingly good memory, to the point were he remembers everything. This interested me as I'd not seen it explored before, as opposed to another story were Harry goes back in time.

There is quite a bit of depth to the story so far, he's finished the first 2 books and reached 400,000 words. It also explores the world quite a bit which I found interesting.

Con's

It does have quite a bit of wish fulfilment, and stuff that seems kind of pointless. Like Harry knows Karate...because reasons.

The pairing is also Harry/Multi by the authors own admission which isn't everyone's cup of tea. I personally don't mind it if it's done well, and it's not looking too bad.

It does the whole "calling people who aren't wizards muggles is offensive" thing - which I personally hate.

Honestly I think it's got enough depth to be worth a read but the author will needed to stop his Harry becoming a Gary Stu. However given that this guy has written a lot of FanFic and some recent chapters I think that it'll be fine.

I apologize for any spelling or grammatical errors, I'm writing on my phone.

***** Hey, thanks for the reply. Now that you've described it I remember actually remember trying to read it a while back. I don't think I got very far because I was really turned off when eleven year old Harry had a six-pack. Like, really? Until boys go through puberty they don't have the ability to grow muscle mass and definition like that. What eleven year old needs a six-pack?

****** Exactly what I'm talking about with the wish fulfilment, I actually stopped reading it about half way through. Despite its flaws I think that I will read it again when the series is closer to completion - the author has a understanding of basic grammar, which I've really come to appreciate since I started to read fanfiction.
