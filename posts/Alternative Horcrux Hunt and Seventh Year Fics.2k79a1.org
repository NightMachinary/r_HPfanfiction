I'd like suggestions for fics that have an alternate take on the Horcrux Hunt, or the seventh book in general. I'm particularly interested in stories that bring more characters into the hunt then just Harry, Ron, and Hermione. For example, [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600009442][Harry's Seventh Year]] by Metafrantic, where practically the entire DA is involved in some way or another. If it takes starting further back in the story, ie first year on, to make the character relationships make sense, even better.

Even if more characters aren't involved, I'd also be interested in reading stories where the trio are just more strategic and logical about finding the horcruxes.


** The only alternative horcrux hunt fic I know of is:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux]]

I haven't read it, but it's the same author as "Harry Potter and the Power of Emotion" and "Harry Potter and the Curse of the Damned", which are major classics in HP canon-compliant fanon. I remember they were the first fanfics I ever read, back in 2005.

*** Seconded. 7th Horcrux is seriously good, and I'd also recommend PoE and CotD as well.

** Well, I wouldn't say the trio is being more strategic or logical about the Horcrux hunting necessarily, but this story does bring in another character like you wanted at least: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10255536/1/No-Church-in-the-Wild]]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/Betrayal]]

Winner of the DLP February 2013 Apocalyptic/Dystopian Fiction Contest! Attempting to hold the trio together, Hermione grabs Ron just before he Apparates, accidentally abandoning Harry on the Horcrux hunt. Four years later, Harry is a changed man.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos]]

A mistake by a dying man drives Hermione to obsession as she seeks to unlock the secrets of the Deathly Hallows. Harry, wanting only peace, tries to rid himself of the taint of death. Two friends clash in a tragic struggle for identity and destiny.

I also vaguely remember another fic with a similar premise as /Betrayal/ that involved Hermiones daughter decades after Harrys seventh year. If someone could link it, that would be great.

*** Though I like DH just fine, I remember loving this, particularly Snape's final role. It made so much sense.
