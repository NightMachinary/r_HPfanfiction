:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I found the fic in a comment here last week but I can't find the post it was in.

It was a wrong boy who lived, but without all of the bashing. It was like the author wanted to include all the cliches of WBWL fics and make them into something worth reading.

Harry is a Slytherin in Fred and George's year, he's BFFs with Cedric, his little brother is the BWL, Harry remembers Lily dying, James is a loving, overprotective father, and recently someone sent him a boggart that made him relive the night Voldemort attacked.

Thanks in advance!

  Only two people know what happened the night John Potter became the Boy-Who-Lived: Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter. And neither of them are talking.
