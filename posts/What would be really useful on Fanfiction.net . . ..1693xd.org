There is one tab on the user profile that is missing (IMHO) that would be really useful. In addition to favorite fics and favorite authors, wouldn't it be nice if you could add "Currently Reading" to conveniently list the stories (including ones that are complete and therefore impossible to "follow") that you are currently reading?

What other tools do you wish the site had?


** Proper advanced search (to do any proper search I made program that crawled through top stories - results are available for anybody interested here: [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/10tgby/list_of_2500_top_completed_fics_by_favs_from/]])

** Yeah, like a bookmark function. Other sites have it. (Such as AO3, IIRC.)

I wish there was a way to indicate "Like" on fics without having to leave comments. It'd be nice if the search engine were a little more robust.

On the content side, I wish there were more HGRLs that didn't automatically include time travel. But I can't exactly blame ff.net for that!

***** I just like any decent RL story. not many age appropriate women to match him with. Read maybe one or two AU LE/RL stories. neither were finished though. Read a few OC stories that were ok. Bleh, I too bore of HG/RL time travel fics.

*** If you were a SSHG fan, there are plenty of sites that have those stories that aren't solely based on Timeturners, but there aren't many for RLHG (sadly), b/c I do really love that pairing. GrangerEnchanted might offer more stories not based on time travel.

** I would love a Boolean Search feature of 'NOT' which means that if I wanted to find all the stories with Hermione, but NOT with Harry then it would. Also I would love a reviews search feature. For example, I would like to search for stories that have at least 100 reviews or more. Think of reviews like a purchase price feature off of Amazon. You can chose what price you want, I'd like that for reviews. It would make browsing some of the lesser reviewed stories much easier.

And make it easier for me to access my account on my phone! I hate that I can't read my favorites on my phone unless I send a link to my twitter account and access that way!

*** You can use the - sign to search if you want certain terms not in the summary/title. I wish there was a way to say "not romance" and that sort of thing.

** At the bottom of the chapters, there's a /Follow story/ button next to the /Favorite story/ button. Is that what you were wanting?

*** Not necessarily. Some stories are not still being updated, so "following" them doesn't make much sense. I was just thinking of something like a "bookshelf" where you could temporarily list books that you are reading now, even if they are not being updated. I don't necessarily like receiving a lot of "update" emails, and as I said, the follow option isn't much good if the story is finished . . .

**** I use 'fanfiction reader' for my android. It does all that. I love it. dont need to be online to read. It remembers exactly where you last were over multiple stories. It's free, you should try it out.

I love that you can sort by # of reviews and favorites now, even if you can't do it if you're searching for a specific term.
