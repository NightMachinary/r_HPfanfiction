Hi. I'm looking for a fic I read many years ago, and this is probably a long shot but I hope someone here can help me. Thinking back, it was probably almost 10 years ago since I read it lol.

What I do remember about the fic

- Marauder era

- OC x Sirius. The story was about their relationship, but it was the typical on and off, drama etc

- OC was a girl. She played Quidditch and she was really talented. I think she was talented in most things

- She was really good friends with James.

- She also played Quidditch in the national team. I remember she left Hogwarts quite a lot for Quidditch matches

- in the later chapters there was this good looking, exchange student from the US. I think he was a potential love interest for MC, or at least making Sirius jealous

- Something about MC's background was (fairly) dark and tragic, can't remember what exactly (but tragic to her at least, she had some sort of secret about her past she barely told anyone, but not something that she was a vampire, more something about her having a dead sister or similar)

- I am a little bit unsure about this one but the MC was kind of 'the chosen one' somehow. I think Voldemort wanted her captured somehow. But this is kind of foggy to me

- I thiiiink the MC's name might have started on the letter A, but I'm very unsure about this!

Thank you!
