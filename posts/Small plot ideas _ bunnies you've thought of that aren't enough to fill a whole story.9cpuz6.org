Maybe a little side plot, a one shot, or a bit of world building you've wanted to see or put into a story. Or something interesting that wouldn't be the entire plot, such as Harry absorbing all of Dumbledore's memories.


** Oh boy, time to dig through my GDrive (I might write some of those eventually):

- Harry has a girlfriend of a certain background (no matter if she's a Japanese Muggle OC, a Slytherin, Susan Bones or one of the Patil twins) and then just go on in a normal fashion without the background influencing who the character is. I am sick of stories where I can tell how things will play out simply based on the love interest.

- Harry walking in on Hermione and Daphne, which leads to him discovering that they were having a thing for quite some time and that Daphne is as enthusiastic about Muggle stuff as Mr Weasley (just not so belittling and she possesses the ability to read books to figure stuff out).

- Pansy is in a marriage contract with Malfoy and wants out through the purity clause (lose her virginity to Harry so that she is "tainted"). At some point of the "despoilment", they agree to go out on a date in the near future. Due to some vague contract term (Malfoy is referred to as heir Black), they unknowingly end up fulfilling the contract and figure out that they aren't opposed to the idea since neither knows how a good marriage looks like and they'll figure something out along the way.

- During the Horcrux hunt, Harry walks in on Hermione singing "British Grenadiers" to herself since it is her grandfather's birthday and she loved to visit him (they'd listen to that kind of music on his record player and he'd give her candy against her parents' wish). They proceed to get drunk on canned beer from Tesco and have a karaoke evening with British patriotic music.

- Harry ends up in Slytherin, but it sucks. Millicent Bulstrode beats up Crabbe and Goyle in defence of Harry since he was helping her with homework and they become friends.

- Donna Andromeda. Basically, Andromeda watches "The Godfather" and decides that life as a Mobster would be easier, so she breaks her sister out of Azkaban and they build a criminal syndicate. At some point, Harry gets liberated and the Dursleys get to swim with the fish.

- Harry and Hermione have a "friends with benefits" agreement but realise that they might be the worst friends with benefits ever since they royally fucked up the "no strings attached" part.

- A next-gen story where Delphi and Teddy grew up as siblings under Andromeda's care. On the Hogwarts express to their fifth year, they think about all those failed marriages (people rushed things due to the war/the defeat of Voldemort) and how their own strange family prevailed (Andromeda, Harry, either Hermione or Tonks, Luna as the odd aunt who always brings awesome gifts). Delphi then tries to wingman for Teddy, who has the hots for Victorie.

- A postwar Harry/Hermione/Lavender triad which began when Harry and Hermione saw how badly Lavender was treated after the battle (outcast due to being a werewolf). Maybe touch on the failure of Kingsley's reforms and how things did not change for the better after the war

- Harry and Cho wake up in Vegas with an epic hangover and realise that they have gotten married last night.

- Padma, Lavender and Hermione meet in a lesbian bar and then make jokes that Ron turned them away from men. They are all grateful since they never were happy before their revelation and feel bad for him since "all my teenage dates became lesbians" is a shitty thing on your resume. Therefore they get together and make matchmaking plans for Ron, which eventually succeed.

Edit:

- A oneshot where instead of the Weasleys, Tonks comes across Harry at King's Cross and answers his questions about magic. Gwenog and Hestia Jones enter the compartment and in the end, Harry has three friends in Hufflepuff, so he wants to go there as well. Harry spends most of his free time with the trio, they teach him Quidditch after the Malfoy incident and he makes the team, just not as seeker. Harry picks up some spells while around the three older witches. Eventually, Tonks adopts Harry by accident (magical bond). Neither knows what to do so they just go with it. Harry would not be shipped with any of the older girls. This one would require playing with the ages a little bit (6 years from Gwenog, 1 from Tonks)

**** The two which are closest to completion are the Harry/Pansy one and a story where Harry gets a Japanese girlfriend over the holidays and tells his friends a bullshit story how they met (something with the Yakuza, street racing and ninjas) while in reality Sam was just visiting her grandparents in London and ran into Harry and Tonks playing football in a park. Since she plays for her home club (Doncaster Belles), Sam asks if she can join and proceeds to dismantle Harry and Tonks. The two women get some banter going since Tonks was part of the Liverpool Ladies youth squad before Hogwarts, and things grow from there on.

And I published a cracky Hermione/Tonks one-shot on Saturday if you are interested in some wacky entertainment. Mostly just silliness and experimenting with different writing styles a bit.

*** I'd like a subversion of the wandless magic trope where the protagonist is super smug about how wands are a crutch and they're a "master" of wandless magic but then it turns out wandless magic has major negative side effects like without a focal point energy just radiates off them and they are unable to use electronics or when they get emotional they can end up harming innocent bystanders. It's fine in small doses or when you're young and still growing but if someone forces their body to repeatedly and continuously release wand levels of magic without a focal point on a daily basis they end up wearing out their inbuilt inhibitors (Which is like cartilage, it can't be "trained" and it doesn't grow back) and then it becomes uncontrollable unless they are a zen master (Or severely depressed so the magic is just plain weaker). And knowing occlumency does not make one a zen master, just because they can hide their emotions doesn't mean they aren't feeling them.

Also since magic is constantly radiating off of them they become a lot easier to track.

And sometimes I just want funny, badass Hermione who's tired of waiting for an answer so she just does whatever she wants. Could be some kind of 8th year AU (she could be 21 or 22 and may have taken a few years after the war to track down her parents or something, since I don't care for underage-adult relationships anymore) where Hermione is coming back to Hogwarts to finally earn her NEWTS, decides she wants a potions apprenticeship, Snape isn't really interested is she just slowly starts to mix with his life. Staying a bit late after class to help clean up, voluntarily earning detentions to clean up and eventually help him do grading, inviting herself into his classroom to help with whatever he has to do... Until she's basically his apprentice in anything but name. After a few years they'd develop a weird friendship, and eventually she'd become a potion teacher at Hogwarts (he'd either go back to teaching defense, or there would be 2 potions teachers needed because of the post war baby boom) and then they'd develop a romantic relationship. Eh, I'll maybe write that someday.

*** Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes. They've got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses... and what's with all the carrots? What do they need such good eyesight for anyway?

**** Taurie! :) Bunny noses are super cute, and they need super good eyesight so they can see lots of people because they are very nervous all the time so they got to know when to run away. :)

** Harry and his friends were surprised at first when they found out there was a book series about them... But what really confused them was the theme park. Harry Potter characters visit "The Wizarding World of Harry Potter" at Universal Orlando.

** I have a small bit of a story idea for this. But I always really loved the hopeless sort of “duel” Harry had with Snape both in the book and movie. One of these scenes that's been in my head lately is one like that between Sirius and Dumbledore.

** One more... any Professor Layton fans here?

Professor Layton is hired as a muggle studies teacher at Hogwarts, despite his lack of magical powers, because of his experience in dealing with the supernatural.

** I've been thinking of writing a gender-swapped Lily and Severus Marauder's era fic. It honestly could be enough to be an entire plot, as it'd be interesting to see how boy!Lily would influence the Marauders' dynamic, and the all male Marauder group would be far less inclined to attack fem!Severus.

** I'm not really a writer so this isn't something I have any real hope of doing myself, but after getting introduced to the Persona series I realized that Harry Potter definitely has a large enough cast of characters that you could probably assign each arcana to a reasonably significant character. A series of character studies, or small vignettes that describe (canon or whole cloth) interactions between them and Harry and how it affects their relationship, basically his Social Links/Confidants. Something in the style of Cauterize, maybe.
