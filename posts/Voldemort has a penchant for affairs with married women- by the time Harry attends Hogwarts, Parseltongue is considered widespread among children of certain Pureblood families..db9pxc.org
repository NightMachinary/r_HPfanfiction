** Draco spends his first year whining about how upset he is that he can't speak the Secret Slytherin Snake Language when even Crabbe and Goyle can. This is highly embarrassing for Lucius and Narcissa, who are somewhat of an anomaly in that they remained faithful to each other.

When Harry's Parseltongue comes out, Snape has a brief BSOD moment before realizing that there's absolutely no way Harry is Voldemort's kid, he looks way too much like James Potter. Draco /tries/ to bully Harry by calling him the son of Voldemort, but for some reason this makes other people not like him.

With everyone hearing the evil insane snake in the walls, it's obvious that it's an evil insane snake. This makes the plot of Book 2 substantially different.

****** Depending of how it's treated, it's the kind of fic I would love to read.

I remember reading some fic where Harry is the son of Voldemort, or somehow related to him (grandson, distant cousin . . .), but most of them, Harry either randomly change side (Voldemort is my father, I guess that makes me a blood purist), or Voldemort is completely OOC (I like the intelligent Voldemort as much as anyone else, but when he is so redemned that you end up thinking "The Death Eaters were 100% right", there is a problem).

​

But having Harry related to Voldemort open up so many possibilities.\\
For example, is he still related to Petunia Dursley (who would be Lily's half sister)?\\
Does Voldemort know about Lily (did he knowingly killed his daughter)?\\
Did Lily know about it (would give an interesting turn to "Blood Magic/ Love Protection")?\\
How would Voldemort react about Harry heritage (potential heir to train, or just another reason to kill him before he menace his rule)?\\
What about the Death Eater and the rest of the population (Do they know about Harry, how would it change Harry's interaction with both Order members and mini Death Eaters).

​

Is there any "good" fic where this is part of the plot?

******** I'm not so sure. All we really know about what happened is that Lily did something that not only protected Harry from Voldemort, but also gave him some kind of protection able to burn him on contact and that was supposed to work until he was 17.

If Voldemort still want to kill Harry, there is no reason why this protection would not still work, even if he was family. And if the story goes more toward "Join me toward the Dark Side", well the main theory for what Lily did was using blood magic, and to sacrifice her life to protect Harry's.\\
In that case, I guess the intent based protection could be changed for a bloodline curse. Like Lily using her father blood while using her mother blood for protection, so someone of her mother blood (just Petunia and potentially Dudley) could still be used to recharge the spell, and Harry would not just burn Voldemort on contact, but anyone of Voldemort blood (considering he killed the Riddle and the Gaunts and inbreded, it would just be Voldemort himself and his uncle Morfin).

But to be fair, "Harry is Voldemort grandson" is the kind of plot that would go terribly with the canon story so any fic using it would probably need to change the plot a lot.
