I'm starting to write actual story now, and I'm trying to debate where to start. Is it better to start at the beginning, or start a bit after and fit in events as flashbacks or revealed through dialogue? It's a choice between starting with a character arriving, or starting with them already having been there for a bit. I know the former can be slow, but it also sets the tone. On the other hand, the latter draws you in faster.

*** It doesn't take place during the written canon, but a year after the seven books end.

***** I agree that flashbacks should be fine, just be careful not to overdo it. I've seen a fic or two that was just a series of poorly placed flashbacks. Also, make sure you get to the meat of the matter; don't let each flashback drag on too long with unnecessary filler.

** I've found that it really depends on what I'm trying to accomplish. Sometimes, I'll write out a scene as it is occurring in the story and it just seems to get bogged down in exposition or other unnecessary cruft, so I'll go back and rewrite it as more of a flashback. Sometimes that works out better, sometimes it doesn't. I would suggest first thinking about what it is exactly you want to convey and write it both ways and if you have pre-readers, see what they think.

In the case you illustrated, I can see pros and cons for both. If you start with the character arriving, you have an opportunity to communicate to the reader their internal thoughts about what is going on. Like, it's their first trip to London and they're a bit of a country mouse, so wow, look at all of this traffic! Everyone is rushing around like they're in a great big hurry. Don't they know how to take it slow and live life?

Or, the character has already been there for a while and you can handle some of the setup with some simple dialog. "Wow, do you remember how crazy I thought everything was when I first got here?"

"Yeah, you used to complain about how everyone was rushing around like they all thought they were just so important."

"I know! And now look at me--in as much of a hurry as everyone else around here. Hey, I'm late for a meeting, I'll catch you later, all right?"

I would say that writing out both versions would be a worthwhile exercise and you might surprise yourself and find a way to merge them both. Happy writing!

** If you have trouble writing the introduction then start working backwards following the basic arc of a story.

** I usually prefer stories that start with something happening, since I don't want to have to do a lot of reading to decide if this will be worth my time.

But if you know where you're trying to get to, it's easier to pick the best place to start.

** Start by actually making a plan, if you haven't already. What happens, when does it happen, how does it happen, who does it happen to and what is the solution? Make a plot, write it down in a few sentences and map out your chapters. Like that you'll have a red line to follow through while writing.

I'm personally a fan of dropping right into the action. No flashbacks, or overly forced dialogue reveal, though. Start at a point that gives enough information to give a good foundation for the story, but don't bother with minuscule details that require 3 chapters of beginning.
