** The chapters are written by santi, but they are around two years old.

They were originally posted on dark lord potter.

I doubt the profile is real.

** This is probably the plagiarism guy making his rounds on ff.net again. I've seen him a few days ago claiming to be Taure.

Very much doubt this is actually The Santi and those are all old chapters.

*** There were 23 chapters compared to the 12 on FFnet, and the additional 4 from DLP, so 7 new chapters? Not sure, sorry if I got it wrong!

**** Yeah, the later chapters were multiple parts and this guy just split them into multiple chapters. Chapter 23 ends right were Chapter 17 on DLP ended.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
