I'm thinking that she makes it back, but dies in Harry's arms.


** Auror Black Site, Undisclosed Location. November 21, 1997.

Dolores Umbridge slumped over, her face hitting the desk as she fell asleep from exhaustion.

"You still want to go through with this?" asked Kingsley. "It's only a matter of time before she breaks. She's gone through almost two days of sensory and sleep deprivation. Umbridge will talk soon enough."

Harry simply nodded. It had been over two years since Hedwig had been inadvertently killed, prompting Harry to seek revenge at any means necessary. He'd grown tired of people dying for him. Cedric's death was hard enough to deal with during that summer, Hedwig's death made him realize he would never live a normal life no matter how much he wanted to. Voldemort had seen to that the day he killed his parents. Since that fateful day, Harry began systematically assassinating the Death Eaters.

Lucius was the first on Harry's list. He was the one who gave the diary to Ginny, which nearly killed her and caused the Basilisk to run rampant in Hogwarts. After interrogating Lucius and finding out more of Voldemort's Inner Circle, Harry single-handedly began to wage war against Voldemort, tracking down remaining Death Eaters, interrogating them for information before killing them. At first, he was uneasy about whether he could take a life. After learning more about the First Blood War and what the Death Eaters did during their reign of terror Harry was no longer squeamish about it. There was no reasoning with a group of genocidal maniacs.

Harry entered the interrogation room and woke Umbridge up again.

"I am the Minister for Magic," said Umbridge. "The Aurors have no right to detain me in this manner and I demand that you release me this instant."

Harry smiled slightly as she continued to rant about her treatment at the hands of Aurors. Since he began to hunt down Death Eaters he'd been disguised as not to give away his identity. The Death Eaters had no idea who had been killing them, with their sources unable to come up with the identity of the Aurors or Order members responsible. While a part of Harry would've preferred to openly challenge Voldemort and his forces, he figured remaining anonymous would be just as effective in spreading fear amongst the Death Eaters as they had no idea what they were up against.

"We will release you when you give up the locations of the Death Eaters that you are harboring under the Ministry's protection," explained Harry patiently. "I know you're sympathetic to the Dark Lord's cause Umbridge..."

Umbridge glared at Harry. "Its Minister Umbridge, and when the Ministry finds out that I've gone missing you lot will be thrown in Azkaban. I know Shacklebolt assisted you and I will make sure you will be prosecut-"

"Well Umbridge," interrupted Harry. "It would be difficult for the Ministry to track down your whereabouts given that they have no idea where you are. I don't care about the Ministry, I want the location of the Death Eaters homes that are under your protection. I know Voldemort installed you as puppet Minister to make up for the losses of his Inner Circle being killed to buy him some time."

Umbridge laughed contemptuously while looking at Harry's disguised appearance. He was average height, average weight, had dull brown eyes and a forgettable face. This was Harry's preferred disguise as it allowed him to blend in. "You think you stand a chance against the Dark Lord?"

"Given that I've killed most of his followers, I don't think I can, I know I can. For the last time Umbridge, give me the names of the Death Eaters."

Umbridge shook her head. "I don't know what you're talking about. I am not in league with the Dark Lord. I don't have a Dark Mark."

"I guess we'll have to do this the hard way."

Umbridge's eyes widened as she realized what Harry meant. "You wouldn't..."

"What? Use torture?" asked Harry. "I'm not Bellatrix Lestrange. I don't get off on using the Cruciatus Curse. I would use Veritaserum if the Ministry didn't destroy the ingredients the Order procured. But there are other ways I can obtain information."

"You don't have what it takes," said Umbridge. "If you were that desperate you would've done it."

"Oh I don't mean I won't resort to it," said Harry dismissively. "I can cut off your fingers, reattach them, and start the process over until I get the information I want. But there is another way I can get information..."

Umbridge went pale as Harry described what he would do to her. "W-what are y-ou going to do?"

Harry smiled, but to Umbridge it looked more like a predator baring its teeth. "We're going to hold you for a week Umbridge. And then we're going to release you afterwards. After that you're free to do as you wish. You can report Shacklebolt and myself if you'd like. But I think you're going to find that someone else wants to have a chat with you as well..."

Umbridge recoiled in horror as she finally realized what Harry was planning. "You wouldn't let him do that. Y-you can't."

Harry shrugged in response. "I don't see how that affects me in any way. As I've said before, all I want is to know where the Death Eaters and Voldemort are. You give me information, and I'll grant you a quick death. If you still refuse, I'll use you as bait and lure out Voldemort and his thugs. Either way is fine by me."

Umbridge broke down, sobbing and muttering incoherently while Harry waited for her to compose herself. After five minutes had passed, Harry dropped his disguise and revealed his true identity.

"Last chance Umbridge," said Harry. "I won't ask again."

"Alright," said Umbridge, broken at last. "I'll talk."

**** Thanks. I wish I could write a whole fic based on Harry being a badass as its a guilty pleasure, but its a tough challenge to write an entire fic tbh. Ideas come easy but executing it well is tough. Harry in this prompt I wrote is really just a more mellow Mitch Rapp the way he interrogates Umbridge.
