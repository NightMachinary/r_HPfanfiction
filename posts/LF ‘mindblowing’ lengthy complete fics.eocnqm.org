hi guys, i'm looking for any fics that you feel like are completely different from anything else you've read. i've been reading hp ff for ages now and most of the stuff i read ends up just being rehashes of things i've read before.

i'm looking for: - preferably not romance centred. if it's included i dont mind if its slash or has smut or something i just prefer if the focus is on something else - this something else can be world-building or family or whatever i don't really mind. can be dark can be whatever. - doesnt have to be harry focused. - preferably the least amount of bashing possible mostly because it often just takes away from the quality of the fic - can be crossovers for sure too if they're sort of explanatory on the subjects that need explanation - lengthy more important to me than complete. i'm talking over 50k at least. but if incomplete it has to be really worth it, i've read so many incomplete fics my brain is starting to malfunction

i've read a lot of fics before but i don't mind if its recs that i've read before. just looking forward to seeing what you guys would classify as this and maybe rereading some. if u have some rlly old fics that would definitely make my day because i feel like those have slipped through what i've been reading

i know this is pretty unspecific but that's sort of the point. i really don't care as long as the writing and story is engaging

thank u!!


** I mostly read relationship centered fics but I'll try my best. Not mindblowing fics per se in the terms of what I think you are looking for but I feel like they are worth a look.

This Sherlock crossover, one of my absolute favs, very unique. Linkao3(1134255)

My current read, I feel like it's a different take on the usual MoD!fics but that might be because of the pairing since there are cliches in it, time travel etc but the pairing is Death/Harry which u don't see too often. Mostly focuses in the plot though and it's about 150k now, still going. The writing has improved since the first chapter and I found it enjoyable. Linkao3(17672156)

Eldritch!Harry, not something u see very often. Linkao3(6122017)

This crossover verse Linkao3(3205676)

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.
