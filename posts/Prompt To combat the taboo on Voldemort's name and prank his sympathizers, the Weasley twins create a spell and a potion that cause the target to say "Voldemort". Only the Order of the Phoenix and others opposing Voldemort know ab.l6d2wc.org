Chaos ensues after deploying these new pranking tools. Some of Voldemort's sympathizers start getting killed, including a couple high profile supporters. The unintended attacks begin to undermine support for the Voldemort regime and leads to "gray/neutral", and even a few "dark", pureblood families to leave Magical Britain, causing the Dark Lord to behave even more erratically in a downward spiral of events.


** I always felt the taboo was a serious tactical mistake for voldemort (if only the good guys weren't so stupid!)

Do you know what it's called when you know the time and place your enemies are going to show up and can prepare without them realizing it? /An ambush./

They should have been able to clear out all the ready teams of snatchers on at least one shift, maybe even 2 shifts if they timed it right, before /anybody/ on Voldemorts side realized it was a problem. And even afterwards, what are they gonna do? Voldemort would pretty much be the one on call at that point, since he's the only one he could guarantee wouldn't be slaughtered wholesale the moment he landed.

Then you just have to be screaming "VOLDEMORT!" all up and down the M62 at 200 KPH. Take shifts. Pick different motorways. Don't let him sleep /ever./

The Taboo was a mistake. Or it should have been.

*** I believe the taboo was intended to identify the Order members as quickly as possible (remember that most people didn't dare to speak Voldemort's name anyways) and it was supposed to be a secret. IIRC, they figured it out when Kingsley accidentally triggered it and barely escaped. By the time Harry triggers it, it made really no sense to remove it since most opposition had been forced in hiding or killed.

**** You're not wrong, but neither is [[/u/Astramancer_][u/Astramancer_]]. The events that happened in the story indicate that the Taboo could have been exploited the way Astra described, but the fact that they didn't was a major oversight for the good guys.

***** I disagree that it was an oversight and it was more of a people not caring and being divided. Even in real life, you get plenty of people speaking against a totalitarian regime once it has fallen but few actually do anything during its actual reign. I agree that if the Order would have been like a guerrilla force, that would have worked, but by the time the Taboo is actually implemented it's only Kingsley, the Weasleys and the Lupins that are still actively fighting the Death Eaters (other than the DA who is mostly fighting the Carrows and Snape), and Harry, who is the main symbol of resistance, is believed to be either captured, dead or ran away.

***** They're the good guys, duh, and good guys aren't supposed to kill anyone, because the act of killing splits the soul or something. I don't think they kill a single "bad guy" (on screen) until the battle of Hogwarts, only stun and body-bind. Or it is one of those fanons that got substituted for canon?

*** Snatchers were expendable thugs though, not Death Eaters. I doubt Voldemort cared about their well being. If anything their deaths would warn him that there was a serious enemy.

Also, people in fics that have Harry and co slaughter Voldemorts supporters seem to forget, that Voldemort would escalate in a similar fashion and no doubt go and kill people and families he thinks might be involved against him. For example, The Weasleys.

And well, he's probably better at slaughtering people, than the Order.

Which is part of the problem here. Voldemort having expendable troops. Sure, there are inferi, but even muggles can torch those. Having wand-wielding minions with a deep recruiting pool basically removes Voldemort's biggest weakness - numbers. He and his fifty Death Eaters are each a major threat, but there's too few of them to successfully project power over the whole island. They can be in only so many places at once.

Depriving them of the Snatchers would make the DE's very vulnerable to the diversionary tactics.

One, appeasment never works. Two, escalate how? You seem to forget that at the time muggleborns were being already gathered in camps, half-bloods were not having fun either, and even purebloods lived in fear.

One group that would be likely to use such tactics, can't be escalated against in any meaningful fashion. Dementors, inferi, death eaters hunting them... It was already happening.

The other groups, he would face backlash for punishing, because if he decided to kill 'good purebloods' for some uppity mudbloods acting up, he'd have much less unmarked supporters in very short order.

#+end_quote

Yyeah, obviously. But he's already done the slaughtering he could at that time (for the most part). His remaining targets are hidden, or ready to vanish at the moment's notice while his forces are visible and spread all over the country. It's not about getting a strong win here, it's about not letting him consolidate - and if he's busy putting out fires, he can't be hunting down more muggleborns.

** Alternatively, the twins modify their product, the Decoy Detonator, to be a random port key that is triggered by the appearance of a wizard apparating in within 100 meters. When deployed, it will start yelling "VOLDEMORT!" over and over and the port to a random place at 50 to 100 km away and repeat until the magic wears off which turns out to be around 10 to 15 ports.

** They didn't really kill people on the spot as we can see from an actual scene in the book (where the Snatchers don't even suspect Harry is Harry at first) so at most, people would be taken for interrogation, maybe be tortured for a bit and then some investigation would ensue. And then they'd burn the Weasley Wizard Wheezes to the ground, kill the twins and force the rest of the family into hiding.

*** True, but it's less specific and less scalable. Once you have brewed a potion, you can use it to contaminate *name a noun* and have it act, while you have to be present to cast confundus - and not get hexed for casting spells at your target AND get away before the snatchers arrive.

**** Hermione and Harry both pulled confundment charms off without anyone noticing in front of people so it seems to be a charm that's very subtle. You'd get more versatility out of it as well. If you're particularly skilled, you might even be able to confound them to ambush snatchers or confund other people.

A potion does offer other options, though less variable, than the confundment charm (which still leaves the proposed new spell unnecessary) but the logistics of the potion and act of poisoning is much more complex. You'd be better off just using a lethal or debilitating poison, whereas a confundment charm is far easier to deploy, takes much less effort, and is taught at hogwarts.
