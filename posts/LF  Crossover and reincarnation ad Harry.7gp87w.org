Hello everyone. I'm looking for some fics where a character from another fictionnal universe is reincarnated as Harry. Reincarnated alone if possible (for example I read a fic once with Anakin reincarnated as Harry and Padme reincarnated as Hermione, I'd like to avoid that kind of stories). I would just like to see a character discover the Potterverse from Harry's viewpoint, learn what the rules are and how to use magic (even more interesting if the character comes from a universe where supernatural abilities work differently and are not carried over)

Romance, both hetero and homosexual is fine, as long as it is not a central part of the story. And please no smut.

Thank you :)

  The world first saw Harry Bailey in a photo kneeling on a road before the Endbringer the Simurgh. The Simurgh's psychic scream drove entire cities mad. In Harry, it woke something else entirely. He never told the heroes what happened. After all, how could a young boy explain memories he could not possibly have, of a powerful, ancient sorcerer from a universe that preceded his own?

*** It was Anakin and Padme reincarnated as Harry and Hermione, not the other way around sorry. And I dont remember the name, just that the summary said something along the lines "Anakin lay dying on the floor of the Death Star and wish he could get a second chance"

** I would love to read a decently written harry potter/Naruto crossover like this, where Harry and Neville are Reincarnations of Madara and Hashirama respectively, although with a lot of abilities missing/unavailable (no sharingan hax and Yamato level wood style)
