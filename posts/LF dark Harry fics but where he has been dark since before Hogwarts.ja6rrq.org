All the dark!Harry fics have him become dark after he starts at Hogwarts. I'm looking for child Harry is a right bastard and then he becomes a wizard and he's like "hmmmm......I'm gonna rule these idiots"

Completed preferred. Any pairing, prefer slash.


** *The Rise of a Dark Lord* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2240236/Little-Miss-Xanda][Little.Miss.Xanda]]

Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

*/It is my favorite I love it, it is very well written and has an incredible plot/* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8195669/1/The-Rise-of-a-Dark-Lord]]

  He was a genius. He could paint, play music, talk to snakes, control fire. He was more powerful and intelligent then any knew. He had strong 'friends'. The problem was, he had few emotions. Dark Harry. I Do Not Own Harry Potter. -Slash-
