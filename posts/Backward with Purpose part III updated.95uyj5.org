It's been so long that I don't remember a lot from it and its previous installments but at the time I seem to remember it was good so here goes.


** Yeah, Deadwoodpecker has been back for a few weeks now. I think they just finished Yellow Submarine as well.

*** I just started reading that. Holy shit I won't spoil it but the things Malfoy did to Ginny. Fuck me, I don't know if I should curse or applaud Deadwoodpecker for coming up with it.

** Looks like it's not over either, even though the main plot point is wrapped up in the chapter that was just posted. Guessing there may be one or two more conclusion chapters and then we can close the book on this wonderful saga for good.

  Albus Dumbledore's death led to Mad-Eye Moody leading the Order of the Phoenix, to heart-breaking consequence. A story told in three parts. Yesterday, this had a more provocative name because of a very pivotal moment in the story. Today, I worry that the story will be taken down. Still flirting with titles; suggest one if you have a better idea.

  AU. Harry and Ginny, under the influence of a mysterious blue bottle, make a few decisions that end up changing their lives forever. Harry and Ginny never got together in HBP, although everything else is canon.

  Alternate Universe. Two hurting, almost broken people reach toward the sunlight. This story has implied sexual violence and a Ginny who is two years younger than she was in canon.

** Be sure to reread the prior chapter (as suggested by the author), because it changed quite a bit. Overall, the new chapter wrapped things up more quickly than I expected, but after reading it a few more times I decided that I like it. I'm glad to see this epic story finally draw to a close.

*** I'm thinking I'll have to reread all three books, never mind the last chapter. Kudos to the author for returning to it.
