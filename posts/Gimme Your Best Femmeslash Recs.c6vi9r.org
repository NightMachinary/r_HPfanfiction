I've never been a huge fan of Romance as a focus of a HP fanfic. I want to read about Magic, Harry, and the HP ‘verse.

That said, I enjoy checking out a variety of HP fic! I recently read a couple of Fleurmione fics that were well-written, plot-driven. When smut was involved, it wasn't super explicit, overtaking the storyline. This is basically the kind of fic that I'm looking for---femmeslash with a great story.

I prefer to read about Harry's generation, either during Hogwarts or post-DH, instead of Marauders' Era or nextGen. I know that if anyone has recs fitting my request I'll find them here! Thanks.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15832620][The Fire that Swallowed the World]] by RowlettLesbian is a wip that's just finished the first year, so while romance has been hinted at, there aren't any romantic relationships yet bc they're all 11. That said, it's well written, very unique, and endgame is f/f.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13988820/][blindfolded minds collide, and we fall]] by TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel is a shorter fic on Ginny and Luna's relationship book 2-4.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7307941#main][Dyad]] by holyfant is a oneshot of Ginny and Luna after the war.

  Hermione Granger fled Britain seven years ago after the Battle of Hogwarts, still battling against the horror she endured. She's finally content in her quiet life where no one knows her as the Golden Girl until unexpected post from Hogwarts offers her the chance she had once dreamed of. Now, she returns to the castle to find her dreams, her family and her life; she might also find a certain beautiful French witch along the way.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/40007?view_adult=true][The Scandalous Tale of the Diagon Nursery Calender]] - Similar to the plot line of the movie Calender Girls, if you've seen that. Funny and I think no smut at all, although it's been awhile since I've reread it. Hermione/Pansy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12217386/1/][Camelopard Dreams]] - Murder mystery, Ginny/Luna. I loved reading Ginny as a detective - if anyone has any recs that are similar, I'd gladly welcome them!
