** Canon compliant doesn't mean it's the exact same story as Canon, it just means it's set in the same world. It could be pre-canon, post-canon, or happening in the background.

Think about it this way. A story about Harry meeting Hermione as kids is definitely not Canon compliant since we know they only met when they were both 11. However, a story about Harry making friends with a snake when he is 6 could be Canon compliant, as long as nothing in the story contradicts Canon.

Or, to put it another way, Canon compliant fics could be about the next generation, Harry and co's kids, again, as long as nothing in the story contradicts what was laid out in the books.

As you can see, there's a large scope for interesting fic premise out there, especially if you prefer introspective stories, like a peek into Sirius's mind the night he gets rescued in book 3. And so on. I hope this explains?

*** For some things, yes. But what I don't get is the appeal of canon compliance in Marauder era fics since that means you know exactly how things will end (Pettigrew the traitor, the Potters dead, Sirius falsely imprisoned, Lupin fucking off to god knows where,...). Missing scene fics are one thing, and given that I came to fanfics looking for a better told Harry/Ginny romance, something I can get behind, at least in some cases. But in many other situations, canon compliant is little more than a dark shadow which looms over the fic, spoiling the end.

***** I think I see where Hellstrike is coming from with regards to Marauder ones specifically - the bad ending that they all get in canon does make it a bit harder to stomach in canon-compliant fics that flesh them out more, because we /know/ that's what's going to happen.

Where you win in the end but don't live to enjoy the fruits of victory. And Bioware got enough shit for that that they retconned Shepard surviving in the destruction ending.

And HP canon is the worst of both worlds, any victory against Voldemort does not feel earned because what defeats Voldemort is his promise to Snape to spare Lily, who asked for that not caring about Harry or James. Lily had a choice, but she only got it because Snape was simping after her.

Mostly, because they want to see /how/. /How/ will Harry defeat Voldemort? /How/ did Pettigrew betray his friends and why? What happens when Lupin fucks of, to where, why, and what brings him back? How do he and Sirius live together?

Canon compliant means the story takes place in the wizarding world as presented by JKR. That's it. Portraits talk, Hogwarts is a school, and Voldemort dies in 1998. It does not mean a retelling of the original stories, and may not even be focused on any of the main characters you are already familiar with.

Basically canon compliance does not = retelling the stories you already know.

Founders era fic? No problem. Marauders era fic? Easily done. What shenanigans did Susan Bones and Hannah Abbot get up to? No problem at all! How did Umbridge's reign affect the Ravenclaws' study habits? Done in a jiffy.

As long as /nothing in your fic contradicts canon/ you can write whatever you like and it is canon-compliant. You can write a fic showing us WHY things happened a certain way in canon. You can write a fic showing us what the characters were up to in the days and weeks JKR skipped over. You can even write a fic showing us how how the epilogue was a sham and a front, how Hermione and Ron's marriage is breaking apart and they are only staying together for the kids, how Draco is actually on day release from prison and how the issues with uneven cauldron bottom thickness severely impact British potions manufacture.

And frankly, "how can I make my idea fit into already established canon" is a far more interesting writing challenge than writing whatever comes to mind without care and calling it "AU". You have to actually understand what you can get away with and how to work arond the difficult bits.

****** Yes! This is why I don't get the statement they made about a lack of character growth. It's the canon compliant fics that add so very much depth to the original characters. Sure, their character growth from ages 11 to 18 is pretty much set in the books, but seven years is such a small part of a person's life. Also, I want to read more about the struggles of potion manufacturers.

My current fic is one I am weaving between canon events and it really does make for a challenge when you are also developing your own plot. It is kind of that happy medium between "here's my creativity" and "here's a few limits to work with". You have to be VERY aware of canon, but yes, you can do so much between the pages of the known stories.

****** Canon Compliant still leaves a /lot/ of wiggle room, especially if you're creative. In fact, I find that stories that are creative enough to manipulate and twist things so that they can stay canon compliant while telling a story that would be much easier to tell as an AU tend make for really great storytelling if you can find them.

The first one that springs to mind is Pride of Time, where Hermione accidentally goes back in time to the maurader's era at the end of fifth year, falls in love with Snape, and they get married and have a kid. Stories with that plot are usually a dime a dozen, except /this/ one is somehow almost completely canon compliant (with a bit of blurring between movie/book canon) until the very end of the final battle. It's much more fun that way 😉

*** To put it simply, I think it's because people who despise AUs (e.g. me) don't like to read something that isn't specifically about the characters they enjoy. The characters' relationships strongly depend upon the source material. If someone writes an AU where it's non-magical and "Hogwarts" is instead a muggle coffeeshop where the kids hang out like it's /Friends/, for example, there is not even a smidgen of interest in reading it if such essential qualities of the world and characters have been changed. It rings extraordinarily hollow; those are not the same characters, and so I have no interest in them. The same holds for most other lower-key AUs, like "What if Lily and James survived?" or "What if all the characters changed genders?"

I recognise why many people like AUs and similar, but I don't really understand the drive to read it. The canon-compliant works I read are both works that are strongly compliant, as well as ones that worldbuild with very plausible, realistic information.

While I'm sure it's out there, it certainly doesn't happen nearly as often. And I think the simple difference between those two scenarios is that AUs change a lot; canon-compliance alters little. For a fan of the series, there's generally not much to really /complain/ about in a canon-compliant fic, unless they hate the source material. Meanwhile, AUs can change /everything/. Anyone can take issue with how something is done in an AU -- and not just from canon-compliant-liking people. That's undoubtedly the major part of any vitriol we see in comments.

** Canon compliant fics can be a way to explore secondary characters we don't know much about. For example, a canon compliant fic featuring Bellatrix Lestrange could hit the major events we know that happen to her (which aren't many, to be honest) but the rest of the story would be filled in with other details, emotions, etc. It would make a compelling story out of an intriguing character we otherwise don't know much about.

If you look at stories as just a series of events, then canon compliant fics aren't going to offer you very much. But if you're interested in exploring the backstories and motivations for characters besides the Golden Trio, canon compliant fics are not boring at all.

** I only write canon compliant and only very rarely read AU. Writing canon compliant fics for me allows me to explore missing moments and alternate POVs that explore characters or world building in greater depth, as well as creating new plots pre or post canon. I have nothing against AU as a concept at all, I just never really stick with it because I end up thinking "but that's not what happened!" I also like to think closely about how events in a characters life shape their personality - when it comes to AU, I think changes in plot would inevitably change the personality of a character, and I read and write fanfic because I want more from the characters I know and love.

With canon compliancy, I was able to explore Ron's side of the argument in GOF and find his justifications for it. I was able to show what Ginny was doing in DH, and Percy too. During a time of personal grief I was able to write creatively with a bit of distance by thinking about how George would respond to the loss of Fred. I could take the time to be more abstract and add to the relationship between Harry and Ginny in greater detail than the books were able to show. I was able to great new plots with new characters post-Hogwarts and next gen, while keeping all the events of canon as firm "history" that both the reader and the characters have an understanding of.

It's interesting to me that it's often seen as an "intro" to fanfic, and I have had people condescendingly tell me I will get bored and go AU eventually. Well over a decade of writing now and I'm still not drawn to AU in the slightest. Everyone's different!

Sometimes its so different, though, that even I have to stop and say "wait, I need to reconcile this with the source material some more" lol. And that's what I love about fanfic, that I can just run with it and write a vivid story that explores entirely new possibilities.

But I without a doubt respect canon compliant writers because they can't use the fact that it's AU to hide any OOC moments. Y'all really have to recreate that characterization and feel of the original content. And that's impressive because it takes time and thought to really look at a character and get everything from their thought process to their conversation patterns just right.

I also respect AU writers that do the coffee shop, modern, medival AUs, etc. etc. Cuz its just so neat tbh.

More fundamentally, however, there are two main kinds of fanfic reader.

There's those who read fanfic because they love the original work and want more of the same.

Then there's those who read fanfic because they disliked something about the original work and want to "fix" it.

All that canon compliance means is that you can read this fic and the details will be consistent with the lore and world as presented by JKR. That's all. Harry gets with Ginny, Voldemort dies, and all that good stuff fans are familiar with.

BUT, oh ho ho, the fun part of canon compliance is that there is SO much world and SO many stories that can be told, and get told they do, in insanely creative ways. The founder's era, marauder's era, post the second war, and all the parts in between are fair game. So are the original stories. Did you like Prisoner of Azkaban but really would have rather seen it play out from Sirius's POV? There's a canon compliant story for that. Did you wonder what the fuck Charlie was doing in Romania while everyone else was attending Hogwarts classes? Canon compliant story. What does a day in the life of Arthur Weasley at The Ministry look like? Canon compliant story. Think of them more as untold stories in the world you are already familiar with.

But whaaaaaaa I already know how it will end, what fun is that, this is BS, whaaaaaa. Ok, if you pick up a canon compliant story told from Harry's POV, then yeah, he's going to end up with Ginny and become an Auror and you know that part of the story. Some people love that, some people don't. You choose what you want to read. BUT so much of canon compliant stories have nothing whatsoever to do with the trio or most of the main characters, because, they tell different stories about different characters who may or may not have been involved in the events from the books, and there are SO many good stores like this. I love how the canon compliant stories that are well written will make you read the books again and be like holy shit all of this other stuff was totally happening at the same time, to the point that you forget that it was a fan fic and not a "real" part of the lore. You'll suddenly have this entire backstory in your head for all the side characters that adds so much depth to the real world.

Basically, if you like untold stories, look more into canon compliant tales. If you're thing is more what if?, then AU is your cup of tea. I like it all. I don't care if I know how some parts will play out, I want to see the journey. Some of the most complex plots I have found are canon compliant stories that weave into the OG stories. They are all the adventure, characters, and world expansion you get from reading between the lines.

** There's different kinds of canon compliant fic. There's the kind that rehashes canon with a new perspective. Sometimes we want to see things through the eyes of a character and know what they're thinking. The entirely of Harry Potter is told through Harry's POV, so it'd be interesting to know all the things Dumbledore never told him or to see Snape's struggle as a double agent forced to look after the son of his school bully.

There's also the fics that take place before, after, or even during canon! Authors might add a scene that takes place between two existing scenes. Maybe they write out an event that was mentioned in canon but we were never shown.

I'm a sucker for AUs, but I think there's a lot that can be done with canon compliant fics that are really interesting and creative!

** I do not really like the kind of story that re-hashes Canon. It's sadly really common with 'let's change something up' fics - especially in the first years for at least the beginning, nothing much is changing expect details and maybe the inner dialogue of the characters.

Most Canon compliant fics actually avoid that trap, because they won't need to repeat Canon. Instead, they focus on a different perspective, or narrow the time frame, or fill the blind spots in Canon. I'd be hard pressed to remember a Canon compliant fic that goes over the first Diagon Alley shopping experience step by meticulous step like so many AU or For want of a nail' fic do.

** It's basically a look at this different perspective.

Like Neville in Deathly Hallows.

We see him stand up to the death eaters in part, telling them "Hey losers, he isn't here." In the train.

It tells us that, he's gotten confident and he's stepping up.

Also in part 2 we see him on the hog's head with scratches and bruises on his face, when the trio commented he said "Like hell I'd reckon, this is nothing Seamus is worse."

He's not phased by pain, he's used to it at that point.

And when he explains he says this "Today's dark arts lesson we practice the cruciatus curse, on first years, I refused."

This is where Fanfics come in, How did the rest of the students cope? How did they react to the news that they're doing dark arts, on first years no less?

It allows the author to follow a side character (Neville, in this case) to cover something because the main characters (Harry, Hermione and Ron) are busy doing canon stuff.

It can explain small stuff like how Hannah Abbot married Neville, did Hannah have a crush on him before he realised? Did Luna know and turn down Neville after the battle?

Small things like those that somewhat explains canon stuff that seemed random or maybe just take it into another direction.

Idk I spent too much time on this, so sorry for grammar.

I could reread the books but I still won't find :

What James did to make Lily changes her heart and finaly go out with him, and marry him.

The books won't tell me how Remus reacted when he heard that Three of his friends where dead, because the 4th one betrayed them all.

How the Dursley reacted when they found Harry on their doorstep ? And how they write-off teachers concerns when the kid was obviously mistreated and yet no one intervened.

Harry first day of primary schools.

What discussion, if any, Petunia and Vernon had when Harry showed his first bit of Magic.

Dudley's worst memory.

The Weasley's almost entire childhood.

How Remus and Tonks met, and how they feelings developped, and how their relationship built. The book will give me the saillant part, but not the feelings of falling in love, the uncertainity that is there, the actual fight when Remus left, Teddy's birth, and so much that I like in romance fanfictions. Even if I know how it ends.

Harry first training with the whole team, and just not Wood. And how they all react to his talent.

And so so much more.

They're a lot of stories to tell, pre-canon and post-canon. Stories of background characters. Stories of even main characters that aren't Harry.

Like Hermione and her reaction at discovering she was a witch. Again her whole childhood is a big unknown. Does she have friends outside of the wizarding world ?

Or even the 7 books told from McGonagall P.O.V., including everything we haven't seen on the day-to-day life of an Hogwarts teachers. Did you know that the Muggle-Borns Parents Association could be a bitch to deal with ? Me neither. I just came up with it.

Harry is an oblivious characters, and does really reflect or notice a lot of things outside his main concerns. It makes for an easier story to read. But since almost everything is from his P.O.V., it left countless of stories to be told in this universe while still staying whithin the constrain of canon.

Even with Harry as a main characters, there's a lot of stories left to be told, even during the 7 years.

Also, contrary of what this fandom seems to think, a fanfiction doesn't have to have 500 chapters and 2 millions words.

** Well, someone can do different things from outside canon and still be canon compliant. For instance, it is canon Hermione writes long letters to Krum. As the /content/ of those letters is never shown in canon, you can make a fic consisting entirely of letters to and from and it would be totally canon-compliant, while showing a interesting perspective on canon that we don't get to see canonically. Like, does Hermione just /mention/ what happened, or leave it out, or even ask for help? And what does she /think/ of them?

Where it /wouldn't/ be canoncompliant would be if Krum and Hermione fell in love, *unless* that relationship for whatever reason stopped and she got with Ron - as per canon.

** Well for me, when it comes to "Canon-compliant" fics, they're all about expanding on what's already there. In the original novels, barring a few standout moments, we follow Harry. We hear almost nothing about what Ginny went through her first year, or her sixth, for that matter.

We don't get to learn what life was like for the Marauders when they attended Hogwarts.

Hell, we learn very little about what caused Vernon to become a man so dead set on squelching anything he viewed as abnormal out of Harry.

There is a lot that fanfic authors can toy with that would still really fit into canon. I've even seen crossover fics that deal with the tail end of Voldemort's first rise that fits neatly into canon, being a prequel that expanded on, among other things, how Harry survived, and Voldemort's spell backfired.

** Yes, stories which just repeat The Stations of Canon without much change (and yes there are many) are incredibly boring. However, there is a lot of fun in stories which somehow extend the canonical stories (have you noticed all those “and then three months nothing special happened” comments? There are many of them in the books.), which took the same story from somebody else point of view (e.g., “Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince by RRFang” linkffn(5677867), or “Order of Mercy by MandyinKClinkffn(12181042)), or which extend the story beyond the books timeline. The last one is especially meaningful, because JKR cut the seventh book incredibly short (we don't have any closure on Harry/Ginny story, nothing more than a kiss from Hermione/Ron, WHAT HAPPENED TO LAVENDER BROWN???, etc.). Read for example the series “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Nineteen Years and Beyond by Northumbrian]]” (start with “Tales of the Battle” and go on), which makes whole Harry/Ginny romance much more believable than in the books (I claim that [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][Ginny is the worst written character in all books]]).

** It's funny, I have the exact opposite. I only read and write canon-compliant stuff. I think it's because being creative while sticking to canon is a very fun challenge, both writing from the MCs and from side characters perspectives. It's like: you've got this very rigid box of rules and you still have to find out a way to tell something new (as many people have pointed out, retelling the story is mostly not the point, here). As a writer, I find that it's a fun game. As a reader, I'm in awe of other's ability to master this exercise.

For AUs, as a reader, I mostly wonder what's the point? Like: What if James and lily had lived? Well, the story's kind of done, then, isn't it? What if Harry was in slytherin? Well, but then you're changing his entire personality, why? I've read some /really/ good AUs but i find that the quality has to be stellar for me to really see the point of them. Generally, I find canon better. As a writer, if it's to write a completely different story with different characters, I'd rather write my own stuff.

** for the simple pleasure of lazy reading. Sometimes authors add complex word building and change details about characters, events, places for no reason other than to be different. The changes hold no plot relevance and often the author forgets the changes and it leaves a lot of holes and gaps in the story. It especially helps when reading multiple fics that are all slowly being updated. Needlessly changing details can make it difficult to remember when updates are all a month apart. That being said no author will ever win because some will scream that isn't canon and others will yell the story is just a repeat of canon.

** Canon-compliant does not mean "it's just canon in different words", or with some minor difference like Harry being female (the latter is, in fact, the opposite of what canon compliant means). It basically just means that the fic doesn't contradict established canon. Quite often, it means whatever happens in the fic can be placed in-between the lines of canon - "missing scenes", pre-canon events that are never shown but might have been talked about, et cetera.

A canon-compliant fic could also be written from an entirely different perspective - thus showing a side of the story that you don't get purely from canon.\\
Not From Others, for example, shows the perspective of Ginny Weasley while Harry's off Horcrux hunting and Hogwarts is under Death Eater reign. It's one of my favourite "canon expansion" fics. linkffn(11419408)

Other examples might be fics that explore the nineteen years between the end of the Wizarding War and the epilogue, or a one-shot prompted by Cursed Child where Harry plays Exploding Snap with Ginny.

*** Can't say I'm a big fan of Ron/Hermione, actually. Nineteen years later, he's still lying to her to cover how he tampered with someone's mind in order to successfully cheat on a test. I never did grok the "bickering because they love each other" dynamic, but in some stories I can see it; that, however, goes well beyond just needling each other.

I've seen Ron/Hermione work well in some AUs, though.

**** People are way too harsh about the confunded thing, didn't Hermione do the exact same thing and literally nobody cared. You're acting like it's assault. I still think their relationship is one of the best and their bickering was really never as bad as everyone makes it out to be. After all if we're using the five page epilogue to judge their relationship then shouldn't that mean their marriage is going well since there is no bickering? I've seen plenty of canon compliant fics where their relationship is great.

A Plot-Compliant fic can take place in those instances, but still have the major plot points happen throughout the fic. Who knows, maybe there were some weird couples that we didn't get to know about, let's all admit it, Harry was oblivious as fuck.

** I know that I like stories where one specific thing is changed, and everything else is only altered via the butterfly effect, basically saying if you don't have to change something, don't change it. As an aside, I feel that whether or not there's a lot of changes or very few changes to the story, try and keep the universe's rules the same as they usually are unless that's the specific thing you're changing. I.e., if you're doing a situation that involves the Fidelis charm research, that charm first. ( I also feel the need to put out my pet peeve when stories involving the Fidelis charm forget that someone can't just torture the information out of The Secret keeper; the secret has to be shared willingly. It only adds a whole level of drama that doesn't need to be there.)

** Well, there are various types of 'canon-compliant'. Mainly:

1. Everything is as canon. That one is nice if you want to explore something that isn't shown - people already mentioned it, but stuff from other eras (i.e. Marauder's, Grindelwald War, Post-canon shenanigans)
2. Everything but plot of the story is canon (with maybe some possible expansion on things that we're not shown that falls in line with what canon is). Which is, IMO the best way to write fics with some point of divergence, like 'what if Harry was adopted by X' or 'what if Harry got into Y thing and it changed his views/personality/relationships'.\\
   Because it's not fun to read some sort of work where the premise is, say "Grindelwald won, what's next?" and then to find out that suddenly Harry is a condescending, indy prick with locked magical core that befriends the Goblin nation to inherit 10 different titles and beats Dumbledore with the power of arithmantic equations that cause nuclear explosions.

**** Nothing I said was rude. It is a fact that it is much more difficult to come up with a plotline that is all your own, just like it is much more difficult to write original fiction than it is to write fanfiction.

Downvotes don't change the reality of what I said. It's really safe and comfortable to cling to canon, because your readers all already know the outline of your fic, so a lot of the work is done for you, and therefore authors can get away with not having to think up creative or original ideas.

It doesn't mean I think they suck, or that they're bad writers. Hell, I've had fun reading some canon-compliant fics. Still doesn't disprove what I said.

I'm pretty sure it was, actually. As your explanation for canon-compliance being popular was "coming up with your own story is hard, so people prefer to just rewrite," you implicitly dismissed the hard work and tears of authors who may put a huge amount of effort into a highly original storyline that happens to not contradict canon.

If you'd clarified that that's just one reason among many for writing canon-compliant fics, that probably would have been fine.

***** I came up with several post hogwarts mystery plots of my own and it was canon compliant - it's taking canon characters and "history" of the world and building from there. It's pretty rude to suggest that it's impossible to come up with creative or original ideas. Of course there are some that don't, but I'm sure you would agree that plenty of AU writers don't either - how many times have people written Harry inheriting titles, going shopping for a magical trunk and realising Dumbledore is evil?

****** I don't understand what you're arguing with me about. My position is that taking a story that all of your readers know (HP Canon), and tweaking one or two things or exploring a different character's mindset is less creative and easier than coming up with a new set of circumstances for characters to grapple with. Writing outside the warm embrace of canon is just flat out more difficult to do, which of course means that there will be a lot of bad stories that don't succeed - my own certainly can be counted among their ranks.

What's the issue? If someone walked up and said "Gosh, it's a lot harder to worldbuild and create characters in original fiction than it is to write fanfics!" would you get upset and think they were rude?

******* That's not what canon compliant is - you're not tweaking anything. You're taking the characters, world and existing plot and working without changing any of that to create a new story or something more in depth. This can include an entirely new set of circumstances- for example, i write canon compliant Auror mysteries for Harry to work on. In some ways this can be harder - it is tempting to change the existing world building or character portrayal to suit your plot needs, but then that wouldn't be canon compliant. It's a different kind of story writing, and comes with it's own benefits and challenges, just like AU does.

******** When I think of canon-compliant, I think "Harry's first year he gets on the quidditch team, saves the sorcerer's stone. Harry's second year, Dobby shows up and the basilisk petrifies people and he has to rescue Ginny from the Chamber, etc etc."

I would say that HP adventures as a postwar auror are definitely AU, unless you have him as a bad father who lets war criminals slide like we see in the epilogue - because other than the characters, nothing in that fic would have anything to do with canon. Conversely, if you have a mystery that, idk, Draco is solving while Harry/Hermione/Ron are working to save Buckbeak and Sirius in the background, that's what I think of as canon-compliant.

Guess it's just different definitions. To me, what you call canon-compliant sounds more like just "fanfiction" in general. I'm not sure which of our definitions OP was referring to, but given that he mentioned re-reading the books, I suspect it is mine. edited to remove an apostrophe.

********* Then that is your, quite narrow, definition of canon compliant, though I would argue that you can still be very creative with alternate points of view and missing moments during Hogwarts years - I have a whole series of missing Hogwarts moments and some of them include pieces that I feel I was at my most creative and most hardworking with ([[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/1407286]]). When it comes to post-Hogwarts, or scenes away from Hogwarts, like what was happening at Hogwarts during DH, or how Percy is bringing down the Ministry from the inside (also.stories I wrote!), a canon compliant author still has to abide by certain established "facts" like end game ships and occupations of characters, while also keeping the characters both convincingly in character but also convincingly impacted by their canon experiences. You might not like the epilogue, but that's canon, so the canon compliant author that fills in the years between must creatively and convincingly bear it in mind. Slap an AU tag on there and you can get away with a lot more - you can pair them with whoever you like, you can get rid of plot obstacles, you can make the characters more hardworking or intelligent to advance the plot, etc.

I'm sorry if you were offended by me saying your statement was rude, but I think it is important to understand that fanfic authors of all genres pour a lot of creativity and hardwork into what they do. You don't have to like canon compliant stories, and I completely see the argument for wanting to read something different, but suggestions that authors are lazy or that it is less creative is naturally going to get people's hackles up. AU stories aren't my thing but I still have a lot.of respect for the authors that question how changes would shift things, or bring entirely new concepts and characters into the mix.
