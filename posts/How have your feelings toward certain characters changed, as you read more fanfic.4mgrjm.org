Adding reasons for why you feel that way would be nice too.


** I appreciate fanfics with well-written Snape, Ron, and Dumbledore. I have a better appreciation of their book characters after seeing them being portrayed wrongly in fanfics.

*** When I read the books, I didn't really care for Ron. I didn't hate him, but I wouldn't say he was one of my favorite characters either.

Then I saw how much hate he was getting from all areas of the fandom, and I had to point out that he was nowhere near that bad.

I've actually been enjoying Ron fics more than I would've without the hate.

*** Same here. I used to be a douchey Ron-hater in my early fanfic days. The last few years especially did a lot for my attitude towards Ron. Not that I'm his greatest fan or anything, but I understand him better, I think.

** Fanfic, over time, probably made me realize what a dumbass kid!me was for hating Ron as much as I did. Honestly, I'm not a Ron fan, but the ridiculous OTT nature of Ron, Hermione and Dumbledore bashing in fics I read at like thirteen made me draw myself out a bit and consider the characters more critically.

Bad fanfiction definitely motivates me to have better understanding of canon characters, and reading shitty fanfic as a kid forced me to take a more three-dimensional look at canon characters as I see them now.

** I've read some really amazing HP/LV fics and they have changed the way that I think about Voldemort. To write that pairing you really have to think outside the box and I feel that most of the fics I've read have supplied well thought out motivations, flaws, and strengths for his character. I think while reading the books he was always just The Big Bad but now he's more dimensional. Authors will create a backstory for him that is so believable and beautiful. I think because of reading fics where he's made to be more than just the psychopath killing all of the muggleborns I've learned to empathize with his past more than I ever thought I could and to appreciate his character (in all types of fics).

**** I really like this fic because harry himself doesn't idolize Voldemort. It really feels like they're in a relationship that includes compromise, something that can be lacking in a lot of fics with this pairing. linkffn(11652581) This fic is such an interesting AU. Warning: It's not just Voldemort in this fic. linkffn(9973394) This is one of my favorite HP/LV fics. It's so dark and twisted but so beautiful. If you end up liking the pairing I would recommend waiting to read this fic because it's hard to get through (but totally worth it). linkffn(3439784) linkffn(11685725; 10914532; 6953303; 3234179; 6621434)

  Life had a habit of taking unexpected turns. No one knew that better than Harry. He certainly hadn't planed on the path he had taken. It could be worse. Being a professional hitman wasn't all that bad. It paid well and he could get rid of some truly nasty individuals. So, all in all, life was good. Then one day he got a hit for one Tom Riddle. Harry knew he shouldn't have taken it.

He doesn't have to interact too much with Harry (plot-wise) but instead cares about and tries to protect a group of newly inducted Death Eaters, including Marietta Edgecombe and Percy Weasley (who's spying).

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

For Hermione, I just hate how they shoehorn her into being Harry's friend in everything. Nerdy Harry fic? Understandable. But putting her in a Dark Lord Harry fic where he was raised to hate Mudbloods?

I enjoyed linkffn(11674317) but even this winds up bringing Hermione back to Harry's side, along with a little monologue on how Ron was never her real friend.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

** I find myself annoyed at how many people turn HP characters into thinly veiled self insert characters. Obviously this is due to the age of many writers, but when people write 16 year old Harry sobbing and crying because he's in love with Draco, it just makes me want to headdesk.

As someone who has been working as a judge in a fanfiction competition recently, I've been running into a lot of this sort of writing, especially the kind where characters act weird for no reason or they just retell a story from canon in the most pedantic, boring way possible.

My least favorite thing in fanfiction has to be the really creepy house elf slavery fetishization thing that a lot of stories have where house elves are literally falling over themselves to be grateful for abusive, degrading treatment and it bothers me so much because it feels like it's glorifying slavery in general, which is gross.

**** TBH, Hermione wasn't "wrong," so much as she tried to force freedom on the house elves without there being any framework in Wizarding Society that would allow free house elves to survive or thrive. Even Dobby has to be taken in by Hogwarts.

The truth of the matter is that Hermione (at least according to JK), once she gets her job with Magical Law Enforcement, ends up doing a lot of crusading for non-human sapient magical creatures (house elves, centaurs, goblins) to give them more rights and choices. When she grows up, Hermione realizes that you can't force an oppressed class to make big, sweeping changes in a society that basically punishes them with death or exile if they rebel.

Abuse is obviously wrong, and yet I see so many fanfics that show house elves jumping for the chance to punish themselves. :(

** I notice myself disliking Ron more. I read alot of Harry/Hermione and a lot of authors seem to find it easier to accentuate his flaws to get him out off camera or create drama. I understand the motivation behind it, they're writing HHr because they want to write about Harry and Hermione, not because they want to write about Ron, but it's annoying. Before reading fanfic, I didn't think much about Ron other than he's funny and a bit clumsy.

It's not just HHr though. I've read Harry/Daphne, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Tonks a lot as well and Ron is usually presented as a bit clueless and annoying. A lot of authors don't seem to like Ron that much.

**** I haven't but I might give it a shot when I'm caught up on my current reading list. I think the reason I haven't read stories like that before is because I never really go looking for fics where Ron is a central character. Like I said above, I just don't find Ron as a character super interesting, so fics centred on him never grab my attention.

Even if in many fanfics, his behaviour is exaggerated, I wouldn't be able to remain friends with someone who believes you're a cold-hearted fame hungry bastard when someone is trying to kill you (GoF) or you're trying to save the world without a clue of what to do next (DH).

Hermione still believes in Harry and tries to help him but Ron just leaves.

** While I used to feel pretty indifferent about him, I've grown to hate Ron. His throwing jealous fits e.g. during GoF, happens practically every other fic and though, from what little of canon I remember it's in character, it's also incredibly tedious. That, in addition to the fact it's not unusual in Hermione femslash that she feels the need to stay friends with him, he's jealous, she agonizes over it, blah blah blah -also frustrating, are mostly what made my indifference turn into hate. Things go much smoother when he's dead/gone/marginalised.

Speaking of which, Hermione can often be pretty intolerable as well.

As can the weasly twins, simply because they're so often cast as the good weasly's. And every author has to do the twin-speech thing...

On the other hand, I like Bella a lot more, Bellamione ftw!

And Voldemort too, at least when he's not portrayed as comic book villain that keeps getting bested by an inexperienced child.

** I've come to realise that, canonically, most of the characters were fairly douchey and had their fair share of moments that made them unbearable, particularly as the series went on and became increasingly Dahk and Ejjy to appeal to the YA crowd.

I was once young enough to like most Indy!Harry, usually HHr, until I realised just how formulaic and just plain terrible a lot of the works in that genre could be. I liked nearly objectively bad things, back then. Now, I've moved away from Harry, because I realised that his role in the series was to be the camera with which we view the rest of the Wizarding World, and by extension, he doesn't have much of a character to call his own. He... exists, and occasionally does plot related things for often very sketchy reasons, because early HP books are basically Scooby Doo plots. A deep, compelling protagonist within a detailed, coherent, interesting world isn't really needed for a Scooby Doo plot.

I still prefer a proactive protagonist who actually accomplishes things through hard work and often personal suffering, but Harry is often used as a pure self-insert, so just about anyone else in that role is preferred. Usually Hermione seems like a good fit, though it's not completely in line with her canon characterisation. I'd still argue that her tendency to ignore the rules whenever it's convenient and be completely ruthless is one of her more worrying canonical traits, even if she's not the supergenius fanon often portrays her as. She's still the most consistently competent member of the trio, and she's involved in about 97% of the femslash in the fandom, so as an avid femslasher, I guess I'll have to put up with the fact that canon Hermione was... not that great, at the best of times. In hindsight, HP hasn't aged well.
