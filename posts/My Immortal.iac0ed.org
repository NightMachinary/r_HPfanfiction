Ok ok, so people say that the fanfic 'My Immortal' is *really* really bad. But what I personally don't understand is why? I myself didn't read it, and I'd like to know if I missed something or why it is so bad? Is the protagonist a Mary-Sue character? Is is just badly written with grammar and spelling mistakes? Plot holes? Etc, Etc...it's just. I don't want to read it myself because I don't know what to expect, but IF I will ever read it, I kind of want to know what makes others say it's so bad.


** All of the above.

** "*My Immortal*" is definitively an interesting fic, it is bad to a point where we are not even sure if it's a really terrible fic, or an amazing parody of a terrible fic. The fic condense pretty much everything that should not be done in a fanfic, some of its highlights are :

- The fic literally begin by " /Hi, my name is Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee/." It should tell you a lot about what's about to follow.
- MC is an OC Mary Sue vampire that is loved (or at least lusted) by pretty much all the others characters of the fic.
- There are AN in the middle of the chapters where the author is begging for likes, flame the "preps" and profess it's love for some music group.
- A loooooot of attention is given to what clothes the MC is wearing, like there is a fashion show every 2 or 3 chapters.
- Some torrid sex scenes including "Then he put his thingie into my you-know-what and we did it for the first time".
- A curious illness is transforming most of the canon characters into goth, some examples are Harry, who become "Vampire" (because he loves the taste of blood), and Ron or Neville, who become "Diablo". I think there is also Hermione who becomes "Willow", a pureblood Gothic Slytherin girl and best friend of MC.
- Some mild case of pedophilia from some characters
- This legendary line : " '/WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING YOU MOTHERFUCKERS'. It was . . . Dumbledore/".

I advise you to read it, or at least watch one of the video talking about it (there are even some public reading). It may be a terrible fic, but watching this trainwreck is an incredibly entertaining experience.

** There are plenty of video essays on Youtube to explain the whole myth and madness around 'My Immortal'. What made it so notorious, how it lives on in current fan culture, etc etc.

I recommend you watch a couple of them, it certainly helped me understand it all without actually having to read the fic (thank god).

** if you don't have much time, here's a quick reading of the first few chapters: [[https://youtu.be/qdv6Q68EutU]]

I don't know if it's bad per se. the author was clearly trolling. They accomplished what they were going for and much more, since this is like the third "what's my immortal?" thread I've seen in a couple weeks.

***** Inconsistency in writing. Particularly the characters' names. Made me grit my teeth every time. Try taking a look at internet historian's vid.
