** In the they shook hands series harry starts dating in 3 year and has 3 girlfriends each for around 1 year, he also has a couple of dates with other girls. And there are quite a few girls he did make out with a couple times. Its a Slytherin Harry fic and I think it handles personal interactions quite well. There is also no real bashing, there seems to be Ron bashing at firs,but while Ron is portrayed as rival and in quite a bad light, the author doesn't remove any of his good tratis

** Linffn(For Love of Magic) is more or less 'HP sleeps with everyone', and kind of stopped having a reasonable plot outside of that about a third of the way through. Didn't really like that, myself /shrug/

** linkffn(8666085) is the first in a Slytherin Harry series. Harry has various romantic entanglements from the 3rd book onwards. He dates around, has girlfriend(s), and gets dumped or breaks up with witches. The teenage romance drama is very realistic.

  (1/7) At Madam Malkin's, Harry Potter introduces himself to Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to help Harry navigate the bizarre, new wizarding world, and Harry accepts. While Harry finds magic to be strange and amazing, there is no class to teach Harry about the complexities of friendship and social life in Slytherin... AU, Slytherin!Harry.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** The only example remotely close I can think of is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory][A Cadmean Victory]] and what romance occurs before the main relationship isn't too crazy and sort of one-sided.

I would like to see more of this!
