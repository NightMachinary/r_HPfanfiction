There was another one that i read, but the "soul" died in a few months because it wasn't natural or something like that. And another that was part of a smut fic, called, i think, Overlord Vulcan, or something like that.

  The blood protection inside of Harry blocked His killing curse and burned His host body to ashes, yet failed to stop His soul from entering his body? Oh wait, it didn't! Harry's blood protection fights against Voldemort's soul and something new is created...a new soul and companion. Harry thinks it is unfair that she doesn't have a body of her own...well he is going to change that!
