Any fics that are plot heavy. Something that focusses on mystery or drama or the war effort. I find fics are too focussed on the pairings and romance and I find it hard to find stories with more of a thick, intricate storyline to them.

Ideally not:: Muggle AUs Crossovers Drarry or Harmony.

But I'm open to trying anything ,üòÄ


** 1) Blood Crest ¬ª Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings WIP

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest]]

2) The Sum of Their Parts ¬ª For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone. Gen Finished

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts]]

3) The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks ¬ª Harry recalls that a pale little girl called Sally-Anne was sorted into Hufflepuff during his first year, but no one else remembers her. Was there really a Sally-Anne? Harry and Hermione set out to solve the chilling mystery of the lost Hogwarts student. Gen Finished

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks]]

4)I know you said no muggle au but this is an amazing mystery that will definitely hook you in to the story so I hope you give it a chance: Gen Finished

The Serpent and the Mirror ¬ª Dr. Dumbledore suspects that Harry's hallucinations about Hogwarts and the Dark Lord hold the clues to a terrible family secret. What are the Potters hiding? And what is Harry's relationship to the shadowy Voldemort?

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6034766/1/The-Serpent-and-the-Mirror]]

5) Elizium for the Sleepless Souls ¬ª The crumbling island prison of Azkaban has been evacuated, its remaining prisoners left behind. Time growing short, Harry Potter will make one final bid for freedom, enlisting an unlikely crew of allies in a daring escape, where nothing is as it seems. Finished

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls]]

6) The Unforgiving Minute ¬ª Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours Finished Gen [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute]]

7) Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time ¬ª Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time Its Fleur/Harry but that's not the main focus of the story AT ALLL very adventurous fun and at times scary story. Finished

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time]]

8) Albus and Harry's World Trip ¬ª After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information. Gen (for now) WIP

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13388022/1/Albus-and-Harry-s-World-Trip]]

9) Make A Wish ¬ª Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live. Gen/Finished

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish]]

10) Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum ¬ª All they wanted was a normal school year and now they're willing to fight for it. An alternative take on the Trio's fourth year. WiP

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12302907/1/Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum]]

11) Made of Common Clay Lomonaaeren Finished Gen Summary: Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11699844/chapters/26343573?view_adult=true]]

12) Evil Be Thou My Good Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again Gen/Horror Finished

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good]]

***13) The Eyes ¬ª Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see Finished Gen excerpt from story:

The old man frowned. "My child?"

"They do not blink," Harry continued. "They do not breathe, drink, eat, properly talk or walk. They walk, but not well enough. They are not real. They are more than real. I see them," he whispered. "I see their shadows at night dance under the pale light of death's candle, and I'm afraid. Afraid..."

A sixteen year old would have been able to speak in such a way. At eleven with his shoddy and gaunt appearance, the words that Harry Potter, the saviour of the wizardry world, spoke were starting to make the back of Dumbledore's beard rise.

All of them have an intricate story line I tried to make it Gen because I don't know whether you are ok with Slash or Gen. No Lord Hadrian Potter here only well written nuanced stories that will hopefully intrigue you

** IMO all of these are among the cream of the crop, really great plots and very good writing.

*Alexandra Quick* is technically book-canon-compliant and is an entirely original story set in an alternate version of Wizarding America (i.e. not Fantastic Beasts). The writing is professional-quality and the gray morality in many of the characters makes for a really interesting plot. 5/7 books are complete in the series.

*NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series* is a next-gen seven-book series (complete) where another Dark uprising happened - and was successfully defeated - eight years after the Second War, spurring an industrial revolution in the Wizarding World. The plotting in this is so complex and layered that it's almost over-the-top, as some of the characters are. Some of the craziest plot twists I've seen in fanfiction. Great worldbuilding as well, while the writing isn't really on the level of the other two in terms of impact, it's mistake-free and quite effective.

*The Pureblood Pretense* takes place in a very different Wizarding World where Tom Riddle became a far-right demagogue instead of creating Horcruxes. The world created here is absolutely amazing and it is also quite plot-driven and avoids the typical tropes of canon. Ignore the summary - this is basically the farthest thing from the gender-bender fic it makes it out to be.
