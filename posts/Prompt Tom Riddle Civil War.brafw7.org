The diary possesses Ginny.

Voldemort Prime is still in Quirrel, who barely escaped.

The diadem possesses a upper year Hogwarts student who accidentally found it.

The Horcrux in Harry has been subtly controlling him for years.

The cup possesses a goblin who performed routine maintenance.

The locket possesses Kreacher - he's emotionally attached enough to it.

The ring possesses Dumbledore.

Only one can come out as the winner, because neither can live while any others survive.

May the odds be ever in their favor.


** I think the contenders would be Prime and Dumbledemort. Dumbledemort because of having a powerful host and Prime because of having the most up-do-date memory out of all of them.

Harrimort has an unstable host and the circumstances of its creation would make sure it to remain unstable.

Ginnimort is the most inexperienced one, both because of diary being the first horcrux and the host being a first-year student.

Gobbomort would be figured out by the Goblin Nation. Plain and simple.

Didaemort would be the same with Ginnimort because Tom created Diadem Horcrux before he started his terrorist campaign and its everyone's guess how strong the host would be.

Kreachomort, on the other hand, would be an upset in this race because he would be the sneakiest and most resourceful of all of them for being the House Elf, and for having access to the Black assets (which I assume is not just a fanon thing, correct me if I'm wrong).

*** Prime is pretty mentally unstable though after years alone in a forest. He's extremely weak and dependent on unicorn blood.

Dumbledore would probably try to fight the possession.

Harrymort would probably manage to fool everyone and gain a significant amount of trust.

**** I now want to see Riddledore and Harrymort trying to gain each other trust, destroying several Horcruxes in the process. Not knowing that the other is also the puppet of a Horcruxe, and that they both plan to kill the other the second he lower his guard.

*** Ginnimort and Harrymort sorta team up as their hosts have just enough influence to make them halfway trust each other but they have a super unhealthy paranoid but strangely narcissistic relationship where they occasionally make some token effort to betray each other.

****** But it /doesn't/ stop them from trying to Crucio the other into insanity ala Longbottoms to trap part of their soul in an insane husk.

Unfortunately at some point they start to realize that they both really, /really/ enjoy their Crucio sessions.

Cue Hinnymort.

*** Kreacher might suffer from house elf instincts and attempt to fulfill the prophecy by making everyone else live in luxury, so none of them are merely "surviving".

** You need to determine whether it's possession or soul merging.

The former can be fought off, while the latter should create a new independent being.

I doubt Harrymort, Ginnymort, Goblinmort, Diademort, and Kreachermort would leave Ring undisturbed.

Harrymort, Ginnymort, and Diademort would try to gain followings/minions within the school.

Goblinmort would try to take over Goblin Nation.

Kreachermort would try to bind other house-elves to him.

Honestly, it would become total chaos.
