By higher quality, I mean please don't recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5786099/1/][Cold blood]]. It's bad. A positive example is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6832576][The Dragon of Moria]]. I'll take dragon/phoenix animagus fics too, provided they're done well. More time spent as the animagus form is better, and it should be actually used for more than bragging purposes. I have never seen a good example of the latter, sadly enough.


** linkffn(Harry Is a Dragon and That's Okay)

Harry is, well...it's literally the title. Other non-human characters appear as well.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Aw man I just wanted to rec you the dragon of moria. I also know a fic In which Harry is Smaugs child (Hobbit x HP crossover). He shifts between his dragon form and human form. I liked the fic but it's not one of the best fics I read. Still enjoyable. Don't know if I have bookmarked it. I could look for it if you are interested though

  Smaug lost his son to orcs years before taking Erebor. In another world Harry Potter is experiencing some strange changes while attempting to compete in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. But how could the two possibly be related?

*** Oh yeah, inside_a_mind linked it, Incendio. It was cute, even though it could've done with some thorough revision.
