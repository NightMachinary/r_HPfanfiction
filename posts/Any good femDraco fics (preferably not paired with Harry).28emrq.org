I know it's a very, very specific small pocket of fic, but ff.net doesn't seem to have anything but Draco/Harry, and a fair amount are originally slash that have Draco magically turned in to a girl.


** It seems fem!Draco implies H/D on most of the websites/collections I've found. I found only one that is initially Cedric/Draco and later H/D: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8086276/1/No-Way-Back][No Way Back]]
