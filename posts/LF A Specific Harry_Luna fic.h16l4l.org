:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was Harry/Luna, and there was a scene where Harry is sleeping in Hufflepuff dorms for some reason. One of the Hufflepuff girls keeps trying to sneak into his bed, and Harry eventually snaps and threatens her - turns out, being scary actually makes the girl want him more. Eventually, Harry complains to Luna and she pulls the girl into a broom closet and forces potion down her throat that she says is a poison.

Basically, a "stay away from my man, bitch!" moment from Luna.

Thanks!


** Just read this it's linkffn(Harry Potter and the distaff side)

Harry ends up in a universe where (almost) all genders have been flipped and gender roles have been completely reversed. I really enjoyed it and want to read more like it

  Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.

**** No problem! If you don't mind me asking, are you a guy or a gal. I'm just curious cause I really enjoyed the whole layout and everything (plot/society) that was developed. Most people I know would see me as really weird for that cause im a guy lol

***** I'm a dude. I also thought it was a very entertaining demonstration of worldbuilding, though I think that the author's decision to simply reverse gender roles (women act like men, men act like women) was a bit limiting. I would have preferred a more realistic examination of how a matriarchal society would function.

Nonetheless, it was a ton of fun to read, shame the author gave up on it.

****** I see what you mean about a matriarchal society but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Wait?! It's completely abandoned? In the authors bio it says that they have part of the next chapter done. The last two chapters were painful without it being Sorted out :(

******* Last updated like 4 years ago, so I assumed it was done. To be fair, i didn't look at the author's profile.
