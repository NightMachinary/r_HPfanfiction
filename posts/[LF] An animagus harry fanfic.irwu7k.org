Please no cat or kneezel animagi fics I don't really find them all that fun to read like unless it's an absolute bop of a cat/kneezel animagi fic please don't reccomend it.

Could you reccomend story's 100k+ in length


** Do you want fics that focus on Harry becoming an animagus or fics with harry becoming an animagus

*** Either way I don't mind I think it's more the thought of honouring his father by following in his footsteps or something

** I just started Harry Potter And The Lightning Scar and so far it looks pretty good, Harry's Animagus form is a Thunderbird, fuck yeah, and it generally seems nice. Not literally, this shit is kinda sad. I can't really describe it but check out the desc and first few chapters to see how you fell about it

First time using Bot so hopefully, I don't fuck up.

*** Man I love that premise but I can help but look at the incomplete, last update November 2019. I'll give it 5 chapters and if I get hooked I shall be most cross.

#+begin_quote
  To escape the cold night on November 1, 1981, little Harry Potter's accidental magic kicks in, and he manages to turn himself into a snake and slither away before his aunt can find him in the morning. Raised by snakes, he forgets that he is actually a boy...and then one day he accidentally wanders into a place known by humans as the "Forbidden Forest".
