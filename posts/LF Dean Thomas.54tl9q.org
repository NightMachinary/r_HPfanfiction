I'm really fascinated by Dean Thomas and I'd love to know more about him, especially his axed back story about his wizard father. No preference for ships but I'd prefer they not be the focus! I like canon compliance.


** Wait so did his father erase his mother's memories of him or did he just not tell her about magic & then die in the war?

*** He never told her and left shortly after Dean was born, I think in an attempt to protect them. He ended up being killed by Death Eaters. Apparently he was supposed to find all this out during chamber of secrets but it was done away with, and JK Rowling ended up focusing on Neville's arc instead.

**** Huh. I've seen a number of fics that offhandedly mention this, but none that have it be a focus. Which is too bad really, it seems like it could be a good one off mystery as Dean tries to figure out who his dad was.
