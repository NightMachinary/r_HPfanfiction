pretty much what it says above, Im talking, neck scratching, grass rubbing, fish eating, eel hating. Or something along those lines. I just want Harry to tame a dragon like Hiccup


** That would be a hilarious SI moment. "Harry" walks into the area for the task, pulls an eel out of his pocket and throws it in front of the dragon. Hagrid, Charlie and the rest of the dragon-handlers flinch. The dragon starts whining and trying to back away. Hits the end of the chain and debates chewing off her foot to get rid of the chain to get further away.

Malfoy tries to accuse "Harry" of using "Dark Magic" on the dragon. "Harry" throws another eel and hits Malfoy in the face, and it falls into his robes. He reacts the same way as the Dragon did. Insert joke about Draco being close enough to Dragon for it to work.

I just checked. The book series came out in 2003, ended in 2015.

#+begin_quote
  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

Sex? Because there's actually a few of those.

One of which involves a committed relationship and a new nickname in the Daily Prophet. It's... odd.
