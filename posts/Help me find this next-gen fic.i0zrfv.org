:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So it was about the next generation, with Albus as the protagonist.

The story had some really whacky elements, like this underground city where noone could leave, or "geomagi", who were like animagi except they could turn into, like, rocks, or fuckin solid blocks of titanium.

There was also this really grating author insert who died randomly at some point, and who was /really cool/ with a phoenix animagus and everything, and whose only purpose was providing incredibly annoying and inconveniently placed fidelius charms and ending chapters with "obliviate". Probably had spiky hair, too.

I also remember, like, a god is summoned at some point? And he tears through the ministry with our boy until he gets to the Veil, and then walks through it like an idiot when the author insert gives him the finger from the afterlife.

And then there were these super-duper ultra spells called... Devotrix, or Devocriz or sonething like that, and using them would make you go mad unless you puked the madness into someone else. The protagonist does so to an innocent woman at one point and like nobody gives a shit.

I think in the end ya boy destroys an entire universe and makes using the super-duper spells impossible, only to deus-ex magic-8-ball a /CrYsTaL/ and ascend to a higher dimension.

Can anyone help me with this? There was a sequel hook at the very end and I want to see if it continued.


** [[/u/Uncommonality][u/Uncommonality]] was it on ao3 or ffnet or some other platform?

******* I found it! It was called "Albus Potter and the /something/", and it had seven parts. The first one was called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8417562/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Global-Revelation][Albus Potter and the Global Revelation]].
