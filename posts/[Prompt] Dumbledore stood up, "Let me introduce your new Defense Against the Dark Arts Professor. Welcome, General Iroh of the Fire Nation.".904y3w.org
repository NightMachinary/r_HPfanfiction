**** ATLA fics I've enjoyed are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/1/Embers][/Embers/ by Vathara]]. It splits off at the beginning of season 2, but it also establishes a pretty intense amount of well-researched worldbuilding. It focuses on Zuko, but other characters also get their time to shine. Even if the author disagrees with their worldviews (he has a hard time getting in Aang's pacifist mindset), he tries to give them all arcs and conclusions that work for the characters, and I think it worked out pretty well. It has just the right mix of canon plot and original plot for me, and even the parts taken from canon have their own spin on them. There's a oneshot, /Theft Absolute/, that is the immediate point of departure from canon, but as it goes on there's other stuff that happens/happened in the past too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10942328/1/Traitor-s-Face][/Traitor's Face/, by Loopy777]]. Admittedly, I'm in the middle of this one, but there's a few interesting for want of a nail things happening here: something going on with a deal a past Avatar made with Koh, and Iroh going into the Fire Nation Navy instead of the Army. I'm enjoying it so far

**** Here are some of my favorites from the ATLA fanfiction archive. I'll only mention the completed ones.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5055912/1/See-Behind-the-Mask][See Beyond The Mask]]

Rather than try to describe this fanfic, I will simply say this: Toph and Iroh Life-Changing Field Trip. That is all.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5363809/1/Falling-in-the-Water][Falling in the Water]]

This is a much darker story than you'd expect from the ATLA fandom, even accounting for /Korra./ Aang and his friends stumble across a village that's being plagued by a spirit, and this one ain't easy to appease.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6148203/1/Worst-Field-Trip-Ever][Worst Field Trip Ever]]

One of my first ATLA fics--Toph is disowned by her parents. A bit bogged down by grammar and modern talk. That said, curiously, this story does an excellent job with its introspective, self-examining scenes. Also, Toph's blindness is very well-done.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/738795][Slumber My Darling]]

One of the most heart-wrenchingly sad stories out there. Absolutely beautiful. A platonic love story for the ages.

*Crossover*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7679074/1/The-Dragon-King-s-Temple][The Dragon King's Temple]]

Stargate Meets Avatar: The Last Airbender. That's pretty much all you need to know. Also, I don't know Stargate, so don't worry if you haven't seen it. This is still one of my favorites.

“Look Harry, I'm not saying he's an evil, slimy probably-out-to-kill-you git,” Sokka says, punctuated with sharp jabs and narrowed eyes.

Harry rubs a tired hand over one of his eyes, setting his glasses on the bedside table and flopping against his pillows. “That's literally what you said earlier. During the feast.”

“Yeah, well.” He huffs. “He's a /Slytherin/. They're all at least a little bit slimy."

“I don't know,” Harry mumbles, rolling over to watch Sokka unpack his collection of Quidditch memorabilia. The posters fling themselves from his trunk to paste themselves on every available flat surface, and he snickers, watching one attempt to cover Neville's curtains. “Zuko isn't so bad. He helped with Buckbeak last year.”

Sokka snorts. “That's because he hates Draco more than us. You know what they say, enemy of your enemy is your time traveling friend.”

“That's definitely /not/ what they say.”

“Close enough!” Grinning, Sokka pounces onto the end of Harry's bed. “Dumbledore said Professor Iroh use to be the /Head/ Auror! Slytherin or not, an auror can't be /evil/!”

Harry leans back, away from the large eyes and broomstick his friend had forgotten to let go of. He scrunches his nose. “All he did was talk about tea.”

“Exactly!” he shouts, moves to clap his hands together and stares dumbly at the wooden handle. Sokka sets it carefully to the ground before swinging back to wrap a conspiratorial arm over over his shoulders, dragging him close. “I bet chai tea is secret auror code.”

He blinks. “For what?”

“For you!” he says, then casts a look at the still empty room. He turns back, voice lower. “Big tournament, foreign schools, and canceling Quidditch for a year? There's no way this doesn't connect back to He-Who-Must-Not-Know-When-To-Quit.”

Harry attempts to push him away. “You're being suspicious again.”

“When have I been wrong?”

He pauses, sighs, and lets his head meet the red of his comforter. “Just because you were right about the chamber,” he mumbles, “doesn't mean you were right about the werewolves in the dungeons-"

“Okay, so one was in the /shack/.”

“-or the house elf rebellion-"

“Still could happen!”

“-or Lockhart being a secret agent,” Harry finishes.

Sokka opens his mouth to retort, then shrugs. “Okay, so I was wrong once. Big deal.”

“Iroh could still be evil,” he points out.

“Nah, I got a good feeling about this. This is definitely going to be our best year yet!”

Harry groans, trying to sink further into the bed. “I don't like your idea of fun. We always end up in Hospital Wing.”

A hand pats him on the back, and Sokka chuckles. “What's a few bruises when my trusty Bludger always saves the day?”

"No, that's," he starts. Stops. Using logic to convince Sokka to use his wand in duels hadn't worked in the last three years he's known him. Blindly, his fingers find a pillow and he wraps it around his hair. "I just want this to be a normal year. Maybe Voldemort will bugger off for once."

"Not likely." Sokka jumps off, nearly tripping on his broom, but straightens himself and winks, whispering, "But I got your back, Chai Tea."

***** Sokka struck me as a Ravenclaw, in that he actually thought through solutions and was quick on his feet: He figured out how to get Katara into the Earthbending Prison in "Imprisoned"; he figured out to use the perfumes to confuse the Shirshu in "Bato of the Water Tribe"; he bonded with the Machinist in "The Northern Air Temple."

Katara is interesting. She's compassionate, but she also can be condescending and self-righteous and cold. I'm honestly not sure where I see her--Slytherin would be amusing if only for the tantrum she'd throw.

Aang is Hufflepuff.

Toph could be Slytherin--she's desperate to prove herself--or Gryffindor.

Zuko has the heart of a lion-turtle. He's a Gryffindor, even if he doesn't know it.

Azula would be a Slytherin but is so completely evil that the Hat would scream "Aaaaaah! Get her off! Get her off!"
