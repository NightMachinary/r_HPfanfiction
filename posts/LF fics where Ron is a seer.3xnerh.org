I'm mostly chalking this up to "this has to exist" but I can't seem to find any. I can't be the only one who has noticed that Ron's predictions in divination are ridiculously on point ("you'll be stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend") and his random off-hand comments ("maybe he murdered myrtle, that would have done us all a favor") indicate that he can actually see the future. Someone HAS to have written this. Anyone have a lead?


** linkffn(Choices by random-fruitcake04) is quite good! Long and has been updated recently.

  Ron has the ability to see the future and he has the choice to either let it happen or change it for the better. Not Powerful!Ron. Pairings undecided as of the moment. Last chapter of 4th year now uploaded! Thanks for reading! Will continue until 7th year.

** Not quite what you are thinking but... Linkffn(harry potter and the demon's soul)

Edit: it has been years since I read it. But character's had these powers in necromancy, warlock, seer etc. Ron was a seer if I recall correctly

Edit 2: I'm not sure that it is on fanfiction. So here is where I read it. [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6253]]

** The Book of Morgan Le Fey linkffn(1634421) and its sequel The Final Reckoning linkffn(1700997) are 6th & 7th year fics that feature Ron learning to be a seer. They're both pretty long and heavily R/Hr. One of my favorite series from years ago.
