So, I just began reading a fic. All goes well. It's a next gen fic focused on Albus Potter. So, they're on the train to Hogwarts and Albus and Rose meet someone new. It appears to be a pureblood... from America.

Lets leave this fan fic and have a look through a list of them...this one look-nope... how about...-noo. Do you see where I'm going with this?

Every time I see an American character in a Harry Potter fan fic that seems to be set resoundly in the UK, I click the x in the top right hand corner of my screen. To me, it just screams 'insert self' Theres nothing wrong with having Americans in fan fics but keep them in America. The likelyhood of any wizard coming over to Britain from the US is slim to none, there is no history of it happening that we know of. I understand that you want to show how your country deals with magic, but why not have it set in the US where, if you want, you can even include yourself! The Alexandra Quick series seems to be along this lines and, while I have no desire to read it, I have seen a fair few people endorse it.

Maybe I'm just slightly snobbish, but any American characters in a very British setting, just seems wrong to me.


** I started reading a fic recently where Harry and Ginny had another daughter and named her America. To be fair, the writer was German, not American. But seriously. I was dying of laughter at the thought of any British person naming their child "America."

Personally, I half-agree with you. I don't like American characters at Hogwarts, I don't think it's particularly realistic considering literally everyone at Hogwarts seems to be British. Hogwarts is not a well-regarded muggle boarding school where students from other countries are relatively common. I didn't seem like there were any international students at Hogwarts, with the obvious exception of the Beauxbatons/Durmstrang students.

That being said, there are ton(ne)s of Americans in the UK. So it would not bother me in the least if a character was married to an American or even interacting with an American colleague. As long as it's done realistically, I don't find it any more annoying than I would if the American character was Spanish or French.

To be honest, an American character doesn't bother me nearly as much as a British character with a very anachronistic/American name. Names like Mackenzie and Landon were not popular among British parents in the 90s, and still aren't.

*** Considering the tiny size of the wizarding community in comparison, any American would be hard to find in the wizarding world.

** Not to completely disagree offhand, but why is there 'no chance of an American wizard coming to Britain'? No such possible thing as an exchange program, someone raised American until they were nine or ten moving to Britain and then going to Hogwarts, etc etc. I can think of reasonings like that off the top of my head.

If you say that 'you prefer no Americans', that's one thing, but to say it's all but impossible is another. And 'never happened that we know of', our actual knowledge is limited to Harry's POV for the most part, and what reason would he have to look it up? The only way that I could see your opinion as fact would be if Harry had had any occasion to look up past foreign students of Hogwarts and said "Huh, that's strange, no Americans."

*** I did not say that there was 'no chance of an American wizard coming to Britain' I said that the chance of it happening was slim to none only because, there is no history of it happening in the series before. Of course, it doesn't mean it couldn't happen, And yet again, I did not say it was impossible, I said the chances were slim.

He would never have any reason to look it up, meaning my earlier point remains until Jo says that there have been exhcange students in the past, in which case I'll retract my statement.

**** Sorry, basically my point is, what are you basing your 'slim to none' chance on? On the fact that in the 6 years (since he didn't attend his 7th) at the school, Harry never mentioned one?

***** I'd base it on the frequency of people coming to the UK from the US for High School in real life. It's slim to none.

****** I had two different US students during the five years I was at boarding school, and that was just my year. There may have been others in differenct years who I never knew.

I do think OP is being a tad snobbish. Noping out as soon as you see a US student strikes me as being much the same as noping out as soon as you see an OC because you think it'll be a Mary-Sue. Sure, there may be a strong chance the characters will be a MS and/or self-insert, but I figure they should at least be given a chance before hitting the back button.

******* Yeah but that's not the norm.

I kinda get it, there's no need for OC characters to be American other than self insertion and usually someone to brag about how much better the US is than Britain. Everyone has there little things about fanfiction and I think this one is reasonable.

******** Just like everything else in fanfiction, I think it can be done well, depending on the writer. There is almost nothing that can't be done well with the right writer.

And no one said it was the norm. If it was the norm, there would be American students all over the place. But 'rare' and 'impossible' are two different things. Being a good fanfic writer is all about finding the 'hook' and making it work.

***** Okay, maybe I'm over-exaggerating the chance. The fact remains that the books have never mentioned someone who has come over from the US (or any country for that matter) to study at Hogwarts. My guess would assume that anyone who isn't a first year would most likely remain in their home country due to the fact that transitioning to another country to learn, you wouldn't understand the language, and level of education you have may be different to what is currently being taught with regards to your current age. Not to mention that any school in another country is likely to be a boarding school anyway so you're not going to see much of your parents anyway. First years are a different story in that they dont have any magical knowledge in the first place.

This is fanfiction, the whole point is exploring new stories within an existing world.

  you wouldn't understand the language
#+end_quote

As the people in question are Americans in Britain this isn't an issue.

#+begin_quote
  and level of education you have may be different to what is currently being taught with regards to your current age
#+end_quote

Probably not that different. People in the real world move all the time and end students end up dealing with a slightly different curriculum than what they left behind.

How is this any different from the situation of the native students?

Also, what if the families of the American students immigrated to Britain?

******* In addition to those very good points, I was also going to add that a student could potentially be born in Britain and end up on the Hogwarts student list, then move to America as an infant and grow up as an American.

**** Bill had an exchange student in the books and there was discussion of him going over there, although the Weasleys couldn't afford to send him there (to Brazil, I believe). His exchange student sent him a hat that shriveled his ears. I believe this was mentioned in GoF. So there canonically are exchanges between Wizarding students of different nationalities.

** It just depends on how they are presented. If they are a background character like "Oh, Shawn, that American exchange student, was sorted into Slytherin"I really don't see the problem. What would be fun would for the american to be a total britaboo and fan it out with colin and the rest over harry. Just to have a funny background event.

Done seriously, just like there are halfbloods and muggleborns in canon, there are kids who have a brit parent and an american parent and they happened to live between the both of them off and on due to their careers, military service, financial situation, etc. So it's not that far fetched. Hogwarts already is host to at least one non-native [Cho Chang comes to mind. There is nothing you can say to convince me she is an english pureblood/halfblood. nope] in canon so why not a few more.

I do applaud you for not bashing the writer for including something you don't like. Most people would give them grief for it.
