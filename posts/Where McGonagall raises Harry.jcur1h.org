** There's one where McGonagall takes baby Harry away from Privet Drive as soon as Dumbledore leaves and takes him to her nephew to raise instead. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry-McGonagall]]

** Harry McGonagall is probably the most popular one.

There's also the Minerva McGonagall and the Troublesome Boy series, but it is Drarry.. linkao3(What An Unfortunate Child)

There's the Promise series if you're looking for something long.. linkffn(9104885)

By the Light of the Moon is one more, but it's abandoned.. linkffn(2513584)

  By some twist of fate, Minerva McGonagall encounters a young Harry Potter and realizes that his home life is not safe for him. So she takes him away to introduce him to the magical world and raise him herself, whether Dumbledore agrees to that or not. This time, when he meets Draco Malfoy he isn't so quick to dismiss the other boy as a bad apple.

  First in the Promise series. AU from the end of PoA. When McGonagall finds out what Dumbledore condemned Harry to by leaving him with the Dursleys all those years ago, she is determined to do something. Now being translated into German by EliasAmyNightcorePotterGleeFan!

  She was a teacher, not a mother. But in the aftermath of a Death Eater attack, Minerva McGonagall found herself rearing two orphaned werewolf boys as her own, one of whom the darkness would do anything to destroy...Harry Potter. AU.
