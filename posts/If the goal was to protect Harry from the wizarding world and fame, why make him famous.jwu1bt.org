so .. if the potters' house was under fidelius, who told everyone about Harry? if what would be better is just tell people that James and or Lily died defeating him and protecting Harry. it doesn't make much sense for me to tell everyone that Harry somehow survived the curse of death, and yet who saw him survive the curse?


** I always imagined a tipsy Hagrid bellowing the news to the Leaky Cauldron while Dumbledore was off somewhere making plans.

*** As if Dumbledore himself is not an incorrigible gossip.

  "What's that, Alastor?" Dumbledore asked loudly. He was sitting at his chair at the High Table in the Great Hall, with all the students arrayed before him for dinner. Mad-Eye gestured for him to keep his voice down, but it was to no avail. "The Potters are dead and Voldemort defeated, you say?" Dumbledore continued, talking so loudly that all the hall surely heard it. "And Harry Potter survived? My goodness! We must keep this a secret!"

** You are assuming Harry can magically defeat Voldemort, but not assuming there is a magical way to tell.

Basically, that seems like an unbalanced view to me (it's a common notion/trap though). I find it plausible that Law Enforcement came to the house, "magic leaves traces", and people reconstructed what had happened in a jiffy. Combine with testimony from Death Eaters, Voldemort's absence, and the picture is clear.

** Some people think Dumbledore spread the rumor, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me unless you assume Dumbledore is malicious enough to paint a target on an infant, stupid enough as to give his enemies such vital information, and prescient enough to predict the next decade+ of events in the wizarding world, all the way to Voldemort's defeat. Dumbledore certainly knew more than most and has his fair share of fuckups, but I'm skeptical of laying such an accusation at his feet.

JK doesn't seem terribly interested in laying out a timeline or even telling us how word got out about the Potters, so I personally headcanon this:

James and Lily aren't the only people in Godric's Hollow, and the Fidelius came down somehow (I always figured Voldemort's curse rebounding on him shattered the Fidelius, or at the very least destroyed the property enough to cancel it out), so I imagine their neighbors caught a glimpse of things, or put two and two together when they saw they could see the house again, or what's left of it.

Dumbledore must have found out pretty quick, because he had Hagrid bring Harry to the Dursleys. I would imagine he had someone at Godric's Hollow to keep an eye on things, maybe even Hagrid himself, considering Hagrid can't apparate but he got to Harry before almost anyone else. Hagrid is famously bad at keeping secrets so I imagine, if bombarded with questions by enough people, he let something slip to the tune of 'You-Know-Who was after the Potters!', and the story spread rapidly from there.

*** You forget the blood wards Dumbledore erected at Privet Drive. Dumbledore erected those not only for Death Eaters or Voldemort, but to assure that the Wizards do nothing. Dumbledore needed to paint Harry a Hero to create Hope. Dumbledore has already a good grasp of the plan of war ahead the moment he has seen Harry Scar. It is obvious, there is no need for manipulative Dumbledore when everything is so obvious.\\
The moment that Harry is a Horcrux automatically , Dumbledore choices are very restricted because he needs Harry to have a very precise personality because everything hangs on sacrifice. As a war general. Dumbledore choices were the only one good enough.

**** Nowhere is it indicated that Dumbledore knew Harry was a Horcrux as soon as he saw the scar. In fact, he only received proof that Voldemort made any Horcruxes at all when Harry gave him the Diary in second year. I have always been confused on this point as people seem to either not realize or forget that Dumbledore knew Harry would survive the AK a second time form book 4 onwards.

  “He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's,” Harry told Dumbledore. “He said the protection my --- my mother left in me --- he'd have it too. And he was right --- he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face.”

  For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's eyes. But next second, Harry was sure he had imagined it, for when Dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk, he looked as old and weary as Harry had ever seen him.

Unless, of course, you interpret that as to meaning Dumbledore was happy Harry could be killed, in which case you have me cornered.

***** When I say sacrifice, I mean that Harry has to be willing to receive the AK a second time.

“Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?” “Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. Harry Potter 1, Chapter 1 This little answer from Dumbledore is telling us that Dumbledore has know from start the exact nature of the Scar. And your citation, confirms it by adding that Dumbledore is now certain that Harry could survive the AK a second time. The only mystery is why Dumbledore did not inform Harry that the shared blood is anchoring him ?

Would a Slytherin Harry accept that he has to accept to be AK a second time ? I don't think so. It is not ambitious.

****** Ambitious...? You make it sound like walking to ones own self can be measured in terms of ambition, which confuses me. Also, quote from DH:

#+begin_quote
  “But . . .” Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It did not seem to be there. “But I should have died --- I didn't defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!”

  “And that,” said Dumbledore, “will, I think, have made all the difference.”

Harry needed to believe he was going to die or it would have not worked.

******* Well I do not think going to Voldemort to be killed to guarantee Voldemort vulnerability is ambitious. A Slytherin Harry for ex would try everything before abandoning. Defeat Voldemort in a great show and be named Minister just for that is what I call ambitious.

******** Ambition doesn't have to be politically ambitious, like reaching a high rank, or lots of glory. His ambition might be just to defeat Voldemort. Once Harry realized he had to die in order for Voldemort to be defeated he would still have done it because there's no other way for Voldemort to die. Harry was not abandoning; he was trusting that his friends could finish the job for him. And besides Slytherin isn't solely based on ambition.

  “Listen to me, Harry. You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his handpicked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue --- resourcefulness --- determination --- a certain disregard for rules,” [Dumbledore] added, his mustache quivering again.

Resourcefulness and determination both happen to be traits Harry had in large amounts.

** It's the little discrepancies like that, that give flexibility to fanfic authors to explore story arcs that contain a manipulative/evil Dumbledore.

On one hand you can quite easily see Hagrid in a bar crying in his drink lamenting the loss of James and Lily and how poor little Harry is now an orphan. But how do you get from that to Harry being the BWL who survived a killing curse? I mean Hagrid was kicked out of school and doesn't have a fully functioning wand so how would he know that Harry was hit with a killing curse and survived?

Isn't it more likely that Lily set some sort of booby trap etc that took out Voldemort before he could harm Harry. And that Harry's wound was caused by some falling debris rather than from surviving the killing curse, which we are told doesn't ever leave a mark.

So it's much more likely that Dumbledore put the story that Harry survived the killing curse out there. And it had to be Dumbledore who had something to do with the Harry Potter kids books because they described Harry's look correctly but no other magicals had "contact" with Harry so how did they know what he looked like.

Of course without these questions and others fanfic authors would have a lot less to explore.

** JK doesn't really provide any information on it but, as with most amazing things that have no witness in real life, there could have been a lot of speculation since at least some people knew Voldemort was hunting down baby Potter and out of the whole family, he was the only one to survive. As we find out in GoF, the dark marks faded the moment Voldemort lost his powers so a panicked group of Death Eaters might have been what gave away the fact that their master had been defeated. Also it might not be entirely outside the realm of the in-universe possibility for the Ministry to find out what had transpired by extracting Harry's memory (as young as he was, he still saw the events) or any other magical means.

** Voldemort attacked the Potters in the evening. There were still kids out on the streets celebrating Halloween, and Harry had not been put to bed yet. Around 7 pm, perhaps? Then Voldemort got defeated, Hagrid came to fetch Harry and begun to fly to Little Whinging, which is in Surrey. Godric's Hollow is in West Country. The distance is not that big. On a flying motorcycle you should cross the distance in two hours.

However, the next day Vernon Dursley overheard wizards talking about Harry Potter defeating You-Know-How. The next night after midnight Hagrid finally arrives. What did he do during the over 24 four hours he was unaccounted for? I guess he gave an interview to the Daily Prophet and showed the baby Harry to a photographer. That way everyone knew Harry had a lightning-shaped scar even though no one saw him before he first entered the wizarding world on his eleventh birthday. So, it's Hagrid who is to be blamed.

But there is an alternative explanation: Dumbledore spread the news. It was Fate that made him do so. You see, Dumbledore is famous as a vanquisher of a Dark Lord (Grindelwald), and he made Harry famous as a vanquisher of a Dark Lord (Voldemort), thus marking Harry as his equal! This is an obvious hint that the old goat is the evil mastermind after all.
