Sorry y'all my mind only recalls little bits of the story. I read this fan fiction a long time ago. Ginny and Harry are divorced and he takes his kids out. The kids end up running into Scorpious and Draco. They fall in love with mpreg Draco. The kids can all talk to snakes also. They end up gettin them and Harry also watches Teddy. This takes place obviously in the 19 years later realm. I remember it being on fanfiction.net. Was not finished.hopefully someone can find this!
