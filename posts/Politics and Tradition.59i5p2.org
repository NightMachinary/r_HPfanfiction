Looking for fanfics centering on the politics in the wizarding world. Also the more traditional aspects. Doesn't have to be blood purity stuff, just wizarding traditions, I personally have a hard time understanding how magical people can be ok with christian traditions after the witch burnings. Can be anything from Harry discovering these things to just being a side character. Reading about Sirius taking up the mantle of Head of the Black family would be interesting.


** Harry traces his family tree and finds that he's Pansy's second cousin through his mom, and Pansy starts teaching him wizarding traditions in first year. Hermione and Pansy clash a lot but are both still friends with Harry. It's a good look at various POVs with nobody demonized for their differing traditions.

  Harry doesn't want to learn magic or go to Hogwarts -- he just wants to be normal, like the Dursleys. But a meddling, crazy old wizard won't take "no" for an answer. Harry might have to learn how to be a normal wizard instead - but will he learn from Light wizards or pure-blood friends? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore. Complete. Part 2 of "Perfectly Normal".

** I've written "Patron", where the wizards abandoned Christian traditions after they went into hiding to spite the witch-hunting muggles. They did "revive" their "ancient traditions and gods", but it's anybody's guess if what they ended up with in the 18th century actually was close to their pre-Christian values and beliefs. It also has a more magical/fantastical Wizarding Britain, which is not just "Old England, with some spells". I also added different cultures for Magical France, Bulgaria, Jamaica and Sscandinavia. Politics play a role as well, though to a lesser degree - Dumbledore is more on top of the situation, and therefore the Ministry is far more capable, and less undermined.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

**** Marauder's Plan is terrible. "I have more powerful titles than you" politics, convienient plot devices (hospital), manipulative Dumbledore, Grim animagus, pretending to diverge from canon plot, yet not fit with setting, screwed up magic settings (scarring tissues of magical cores), and many other problems.

  Harry returns to the Dursleys thinking about everything that's happened in the past 3 years. Something is not adding up, and he keeps having more and more questions about everything. He finds help in unlikely places! Finished year 4 and now taking year 5 by storm! Mild spanking. Sirius/Remus pairing. Other F/M and M/M pairings, but main focus on family not PLETE
