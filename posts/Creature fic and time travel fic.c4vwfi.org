:END:
Looking for two separate fics that I read years ago, so I don't remember the titles. They were both on FFN if I remember correctly.

The first is a creature fic where harry is at the dursleys and suddenly gets deaged, and turns into a panther. A panther severus snape adopts him and there is some sort of clash with werewolves I believe. It was a really interesting fic.

The second was a time travel fic where harry ends up back in lily's womb. He overhears them talking about making pettigrew secret keeper and freaks out. I also remember him having the hiccups and talking with them telepathically.

Any help finding these two fics would be greatly appreciated!!
