*** To be fair, it's not difficult for the Muggle government to be better than the dystopian nightmare that is wizarding Britain.

In wizarding Britain people get sent to life imprisonment with unending torture without even the nicety of a mock trial (Sirius, Hagrid). The leader of Wizarding Britain has participated in (or attempted) the summary execution of several people, once again without trial (Sirius, Crouch Jr.) There is only one widely read source of news, and it is controlled by the regime. Within the past 20 years the equivalent of the police have been authorised to use torture and lethal force.

The Muggle government could be a bureaucratic trainwreck and still look like paradise in comparison.

I've seen people justify her actions because she probably has a mental illness (which, if the double standards don't strike again, would apply to Tom Riddle, who you can check off against a list of symptoms of a personality disorder). And that because she has served prison time for her actions, unlike Draco, her criminal actions are a lesser moral sin than Draco's.

**** But like, as soon as she was broken out she went right back to doing the things that got her put in Azkaban, so like, is it really a "lesser moral sin"? As far as we know, aside from his brief foray into wizard Nazism as a teenager due to his upbringing by one of Voldemort's top DEs, Draco basically "grew out of it". He's still an arse, but he doesn't appear to be a wizard Nazi. Bellatrix continued to make choice after choice reinforcing her position, actively choosing to torture and kill various people, and likely chose to be a Death Eater with minimal duress given that she's probably among the first lot of Death Eaters! And even if she has a mental illness, lots (most) people mental illnesses don't become top-tier wizard Nazi murderers.

It's a bit weird but probably explainable because Bellaxtrix is "hot".

This is the only divergence point (other than time travel AUs) where I can get behind a Bella redemption. She had been through hell on earth for more than a decade, her debt to society is repaid (unlike the Malfoys and Snape). If she, at that point, decides to leave her past behind, fine. Don't expect me to buy her as good though, she makes a good anti-hero at best.

And before anyone cries double standards, there are plenty of scenarios where I can get behind a good Draco. Most require a post-PS/pre-"mudblood incident" divergence which still keeps all other Death Eaters evil, and as far as I know, that has not been written (he questions why the mudblood is beating all proper purebloods, starts to think critically, stuff happens).

3. Okay with Ron bashing because you don't like that he was an ordinary boy who gave as good as he got, but loving Dramione as you ignore that Malfoy was your typical rich, white nationalist who wished death on Hermione and all muggleborns.

4. Bashing Ginny, Molly, and Ron for the same traits and actions Hermione has and does.

***** Right, but in the real world (or, at least, in my location in the real world), the law is 18. As a result, it's not exactly a double standard for readers in similar locations to have a problem with Hermione/Krum, but not Harry/Fleur. It's operating off the same set of rules for everyone, and the rules are perfectly fair to all genders.

If the in-universe characters in a fic had a problem with those pairings and used that as their defense, they would be wrong, because by that logic both pairings are equally culpable.

There can't be. That's my whole argument. Legally, Hermione is unable to consent. Harry and Fleur can't, either, but it isn't rape because they're both doing it to each other. Krum is the only one - speaking purely by local law - who is intellectually capable of understanding the consequences of sex, and thus the only one who can meaningfully consent.

******** And my point is that the people who have a problem with Hermione/Krum but not Harry/Fleur aren't citing case law, and if they are, the age of majority in the wizarding world is 17. That's the age at which a witch or wizard is an adult. You're presenting 18 as *the* unimpeachable age of consent when it isn't. It varies by location, but the unifying guideline is that it isn't /more/ than the age of majority. It's possible that it could be lower than 17, but it's definitely not above 17. By that measure, there is no difference between Harry/Fleur and Hermione/Krum except for any double standards the reader brings into it.

Don't really see this as being hypocritical. I'm a bi dude but I've never read a good slashfic and don't care to try and find one. Besides, what are the options? Harry/Ron, Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape (or other Death Eater/Voldemort), Harry/Sirius or Lupin? Or Harry/OC (or named character that might as well be an OC). None of those pairings appeal to me (some disgust me, in all honesty).

I also wouldn't want those pairings with Fem!Harry either. I just find the female characters more interesting, so I prefer to read about straight/lesbian relationships.

Also, I'm fine with gay relationships, I'm talking about main characters where the relationship ia focused one. I don't mind Sirius/Remus or Ron/Draco (I've seen some that made their advisarial relationship into one of sexual tension that were alright), but I wouldn't read it if they were the main characters/focus of the story.

I fucking love everything about Drarry and anyone who doesn't can... Enjoy their own life because we don't always like the same things.

But the people who look down their nose at Drarry can fight me.

Hell, the people who look down on anything because it's target demo is "teenage girls" can fight me.

Teenage girls creating stories by and for themselves is some inspiring shit, especially after all the crap they get from society for any one of their interests.

Drarry is fun. Drarry is sexy. Drarry is subversive. Drarry is life.

Fight me.

********* The fact that it's expected makes it all the more impressive.

I'm not kidding when I say that teenage girls get shit on for every one of their interests. "Popular with teenage girls" is literally a way to deride any media property. From One Direction to Twilight to Justin Bieber, society sees a thing that is beloved by a large demographic and wrinkles its nose at it. Hell, even early Beatles were not well-respected musically because they were mainly liked by teenage girls. Why are their tastes so unworthy? The typical interest of a teenage boy isn't met with the same scorn. An interest in cars isn't seen nearly the same way as an interest in makeup. Fight Club did not receive nearly the same amount of vitriol that Twilight did. Sure, DnD is nerdy but at least those kids aren't sitting around listening to Justin Bieber.

Are you or have you ever been a teenage girl? It's hard man. Either you like what your peers like and are hated by society, or you join with society and make fun of your peers and get ostracized. I chose the second route, and I'm not proud of that time. There are no right answers there.

So yes, writing Drarry is subversive. It's refusing to lie back and take that dismissal of interests. It's creating something, for yourself, for your peers, even knowing that nearly all of mainstream society would make fun of you for it.

The fact that it is always expected to show up somewhere, somehow, shows how resilient those writers are.

********* Do you want to be confused? It's simple. Turning Draco Malfoy into a love interest breaks suspension of disbelief. It pulls the story so far out of the original that, I can't bring myself to read it. Daphne, on the other hand, is basically an oc with a canon name. That feels more like a further examination of the HP world instead of perversion. And this isn't about homosexuality. I have no problem Harry going for A. Goldstein. I have a problem with Harry falling for a guy who basically looked his best friend in the eye and told her he hoped she'd die first. I have a problem with Harry being with someone who gets magnificent animals killed for the sick pleasure of it.

So, I like the question of what would have happened if Harry found himself attracted to a girl in Slytherin?

But, there are limits to that, I think. And those limits are Harry with Death Eaters or their similar minded children.

Again, this is purely my taste. Other people may have different tastes and they damn well should. Diversity is the cornerstone of originality, innovation and evolution.

It does not, however, explain to my satisfaction how you can claim to be sticking to canon by using what is basically an OC.

Disliking Drarry or whatever is perfectly fine, but don't try to justify it with an issue of canon compliance by brining up Daphne's characterizations. Virtually none of them are canon.

On the other side, ypu have Harry falling for a random girl who happens to be a Slytherin. Or a ravenclaw if you want it to be, Lisa Turpin exists in universe.

You can write Harry/Daphne or Harry/some other undefined character without changing Harry Potter. You can't do the same with Malfoy. At least not without a hell lot of character development for Malfoy.
