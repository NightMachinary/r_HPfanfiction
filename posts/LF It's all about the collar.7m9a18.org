This is bugging me. I'm trying to recall a fic I've seen a couple of years ago and the only stand-out item in it I actually remember is a scene where Harry and his (I think) fiancee are going through the Potter family book of bridal collars (like dog collars, not the saner fashion items) and he is trying to steer her towards the more filigrane, unobtrusive designs while she is having nothing of it. Finally fed up with it he suggests the biggest most obnoxious neck iron he can find to which she responds positively.

I want to say the girl was a Slytherin pureblood (probably Daphne Greengrass) but I'm very uncertain about that.

So anyone recall something like that?

** That sounds great, but I have not heard of that fic. I wanted to recommend you a different fic to tide you over until yours is found, but then discovered that mine had disappeared too, likely deleted and gone forever : - (
