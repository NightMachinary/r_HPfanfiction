I'm looking for something that has sexual tension throughout it. Not just oh shit let's bang and be super OOC cause were just having sex now. That stuff is so over done and tiring. How about something with tension and build up. Any paring, preferred no draco or snape cause they're creepy. Thanks.


** Linkffn(The Merging) has plenty of tension.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
