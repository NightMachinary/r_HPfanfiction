** How willingly are we talking? As in real Death Eater, or he joined them willingly but he's actually a spy, or he's sort of a real Death Eater except not but it's complicated?

I haven't quite been keeping up with it, but Sirius ends up becoming a Death Eater by something of an accident in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/Like-a-Red-Headed-Stepchild][Like a Red-Headed Stepchild]]. The early chapters are quite funny, but I haven't been keeping up with it, unfortunately.

**** The problem with that is it'll then just be an OC with the name Sirius Black. For him to be a willing death Eater, ALL of his life would not have happened.

***** Wouldn't Dumbledore not pushing for him to get a trial be a valid breaking point for him, one that would potentially encourage him to seek other options?

****** Well, where should I start?

First of all, in order to get to the point where he goes to confront Pettigrew over getting his best friend and his muggleborn wife killed, who, together with him were fighting against the dark lord, he would already be best friends with James Potter.

In order for that, he wouldn't be siding with his family's beliefs at all, aka he would already be opposing the dark lord. His whole character is being against his family, against dark magic.

IF you say he agrees with his family, he would never be sorted in Gryffindor, respecting his family's wishes and going to Slytherin. So, he wouldn't ever be a marauder, have the same friends, the same ideologies, wouldn't have faced adversity from his family, wouldn't have the kind of personality he has, which caused him to stand against them and think for himself, aka you could just ask for stories about Regulus Black.

On the other hand, if you say he goes against Dumbledore when he didn't get a trial (when it's more Barty Crouch's fault, but moving on), he would already have been best friends with the Potters, and would have opposed the dark lord, so when the dark lord returned, he would never agree to be against his godson, and anyway, why would Voldemort even take him in rather than kill him? He would have then been a third party, against both Voldemort and Dumbledore.

It's just... The entire character of Sirius Black is such that you couldn't make him a Death Eater without it being just a complete OC.
