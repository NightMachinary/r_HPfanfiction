I started reading that story years ago and got to something like the fourth book before I decided I had to stop because I had important stuff going on in my life at the time. Fast forward and I have not continued reading it, in all these three years, because I am afraid of the hold that story has on me. It's so incredible, so beautifully written, that I know if I start reading it again I let my real life fall to the background in order to savor it. This wouldn't be a problem if it were only a couple hundred thousand words long. Or even a million. If memory serves me right though, the whole series expands over millions and millions of words. So I am wondering if someone else has finished the series, all the way through... and how they were able to pace themselves. I swear, it's like a drug.


** I finished it earlier this year.

I ended up limiting myself to three chapters a day to stop it from taking over my life. Once I started limiting myself I found that I actually enjoyed reading the fic more because I had time to digest ideas and plot developments.

Even though it is an overwhelming read I definitely recommend finishing it, it is definitely one of my favourite pieces of literature of all time. I almost want Lightning on the Wave to pull a 50 Shades of Gray and publish it as original fiction just so that more people read it and she actually gets money for such a great work.

PM me if you ever want to talk about the series, I love literary discussion. :)

*** You don't know how relieved I am to hear that you had to limit yourself. I was wondering if I sounded crazy, talking about a piece of literature that was so amazing I was addicted to it. It's been two/three years since I stopped reading it and I still think about the thing, after all!

#+begin_example
  I think I'll do that. In just two months, as soon as I am done with my externship, I will start reading it again. Oh goodness I hope I haven't forgotten anything vitally important. I remember having a list in my mind of mysteries that I was anxious to see if she answered, or forgot and became overwhelmed by her plot. 
#+end_example

Will DEF message you/ Bye!

** /raises hand/ I have. I read it during my senior year at college, so I had to limit myself to reading once homework was finished. It made for a lot of late nights, but it was a good story. (: I need to go through it and read again; like you, I was sucked in and I just needed/wanted to finish. I had to get it read so I could focus on my thesis, but I want to re-read at a more leisurely pace.

** I did!! They were sooo amazing!! I had never read fan fiction until then and now I am obsessed with fan fiction. It was awful for everyone else in my life when I was reading them, I didn't want to do anything else! So basically I could not pace myself, instead I hookwinked a couple friends into readint them with me. I am so glad I discovered them after college or I would have failed out haha
