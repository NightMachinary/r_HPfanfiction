** linkao3(Accio, Ballgag) Harry Potter. Man-Who-Conquered. Master Auror. Terrifying duelist. Shoggoth owner. Mistress Hermione's beloved little slut.

And then they start dating their best friend Fleur. Fleur is... how you say... hung.

It's incredibly kinky, and goes into some pretty extreme places. That it also puts a lot of effort into showing how much the three love each other, and what they're doing to each other, makes it a lot hotter than most stories.

  Fast-forward, ten years later. Mistress Hermione is so proud of her little Harry! She knew this was exactly how things were supposed to happen right from the start. She's sometimes slightly dysfunctional, just a little possessive, but still adorable... although disagreeing with Mistress Hermione is not recommended. She has a little problem, though. ‚ÄúHappily forever after‚Äù is more complicated in real life than in books...
