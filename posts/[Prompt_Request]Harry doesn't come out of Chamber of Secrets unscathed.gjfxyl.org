Most CoS divergence fics either has Haary gaining new powers through Basilisk venom and/or Phoenix tears or Harry/Ginny getting a soul bond or Ginny dying if they really want to go dark.

But something I've only seen once is Harry getting physically damaged throgh the ordeal and not getting fully healed. It was in linkffn(A Veela's Curiosity). Even in fourth year, Harry still has Basilisk venom in his bloodstream. He is almost constantly sick. Gets easily exausted. Fawks also couldn't heal his arm wound fully. It gets reopened and Fawks has to heal it regularly.

I want to see more fics like this.

#+begin_quote
  As Harry Potter slays the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, blood and venom get in his eyes, mostly blinding him. While Harry learns to adapt, he makes some new friends. But this is more than a story of adaptation and friendship as there are threats... and Harry isn't the only one with a past that haunts him. Blind!Harry POV. Disabled OCs. Very slow-build. No pairings.

  Fleur came to Hogwarts to compete in the Triwizard tournament. Her mind was filled with expectations of glory and honour, instead she finds a messy haired student by the name of Harry, who is different to every other student in the derelict school. A Veela's curiosity is a dangerous beast and Fleur's demands that it is sated.

** The Story Harry Potter and the Accumulation of Power by Zyachta has Harry having issues due to the chamber. Though it is a WIP with over 76K words regrettably it is abandoned as the last update is 2013. Several tropes but they have at least a plausible explanation for how/why they happen.

linkao3(845179)

And you could also try The Basilisk's Gift by Half-blooded Slayer. It's a WIP updated Nov 2019

linkffn(8616023)

And I see someone already recommended Basilisk Eyes

  In the Chamber of Secrets, the basilisk venom had already been in his system for several minutes before Fawkes healed him, what if Fawkes was too late ? Super!Harry / Harry/Many / Gray Harry, rating for later chapters.

  What would happen if magic was more than anyone realized. What if the creatures of the magical world could bestow gifts upon those that had earned their favor? Starts at the end of year two and will go on for as long as I want. Pairing at the moment will be H/Hr but may include more. Rated T for the moment but might go to M.
