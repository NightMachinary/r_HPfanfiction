I really enjoyed linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist by BrilliantLady) and linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom by Mizuni-sama). Looking for other fics that feature ritual magic or include demon summoning.

I've also read linkffn(Too Young to Die by thebombhasbeenplanted) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome by Ihateseatbelts).


** It's a crossover, but in my story linkffn(Champions of the Two Worlds) Hermione is warlock who specializes in demon summing using SQL (Summoning Query Language). She basically uses a demon as her lab assistant because she's a bit of a mad scientist. She is more of a side character though, Harry the Paladin and Ron the Shaman (he summons and binds a fire elemental which is pretty important) are who the story focuses on.

You mean with the same syntax as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL][the SQL]]?

Then for Harry, you should let him speak the [[https://www.python.org][Python Language]].

**** This is one of Hermione's demon summoing spells:

01100110 01110010 01101111 01101101 00100000 01010011 01010101 01001101 01001101 01001111 01001110 01011111 01010100 01000001 01000010 01001100 01000101 00100000 01110011 01100101 01101100 01100101 01100011 01110100 00100000 01001001 01001101 01010000 00100000 01110011 01110000 01100101 01100011 01101001 01100110 01111001 01011111 01101111 01100010 01101010 01100101 01100011 01110100 00100000 01010000 01001001 01011010 01011001 01000001 01010000

The translation is something along the lines of:

from SUMMON_TABLE get IMP specify_object PIZYAP

Harry actually prays and sings hyms when he casts more complicated ritual spells, because he's a paladin. Specifically he's trained by draenei vindicators so he worships the Holy light and the Naaru. So far, he hasn't had a chance to speak to snakes, though I might just make it so he can speak Nazja if it ever comes up.

******* !!! I didn't realize you said you were the author; props!

Since SQL runs on a non-classical logic, you could use some weird expressions that seem illogical in standard logic

Select * From Summon_Table Where Creature = NULL

(Expressions returns the third truth-value UNKNOWN even if there's a row where the Creature field contains NULL)

Hermione can then ammend her statement in /Philosopher's Stone/. It's not that wizards don't have an ounce of logic, they just use a different logic.

This is probably a terrible idea, heh. This is what thinking about maths too much does to one

**** It would help to know the very basics. If you ever played Warcraft III or WoW you'll know plenty as a deep knowledge of the lore isn't required (but might help you see a couple of plot twists coming). Really, just watching the original [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhNr563aJWs][World of Warcraft cinemati]]c and the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCr7y4SLhck][Wrath of the Lich King]] cinematic will tell you plenty. You don't even have to do that, but it will set the table to show you more or less what the difference races look like and show you what kind of high fantasy setting you're diving into. And why Arthas is a stone cold badass you do not want to fuck with, because he can make dragon zombies.

Edit: Also, if you've never played WCIII, you really should. It's hands down one of the best RTS games of all time, and its gameplay and story hold up even today. Especially the Frozen Throne campaigns.

Edit again: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch4rc5W4dKY][The Wrathgate]] shows Arthas in action, kicking ass and taking souls. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8XtohlqEeM][The Burning Crusade cinemati]]c will show you what a draenei looks like.

** Princess of the Blacks certainty has the ritual magic, arguably has the demon summoning later in the series. It's a teensy-weensy bit darker than the examples you gave, though - the MC is perfectly willing to kill random people for her goals or safety, and starts the series working in a child brothel.

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
