Relying on each other to survive, characters having breakdowns and such.

Not looking for shipping, but if there is any I'm fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be on any site. Anyone can be the main character.

Would rather not have character bashing, characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but an author going out of their way to bash on a character is normally a no go. If it's on the more minor side, that'd be fine, but I'd rather have no bashing at all.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhk√§se.

** There's one on AO3 by Esama where there's a portkey accident at the GoF first task, and most of the students all get sent to an island in the middle of the ocean.

Pretty good, wish it was continued/more, can't remember the name.
