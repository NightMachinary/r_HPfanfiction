  It was Mrs. Figg who suspected first. She noticed many things, sitting on her side of her fence with her cats chasing butterflies and nuzzling her ankles, Mundungus and the other watchers dropping by for tea now and then. Mrs. Figg noticed that Petunia was a nosy bit of work with insecurities hanging from her every harsh angle. She noticed when Dudley learned the word MINE-- the whole neighborhood noticed that one. She noticed that Vernon glared at owls.She noticed that when Petunia gave Harry a truly horrendous haircut one year, it grew back in at a normal rate. Harry was uneven and weird-looking for ages, hiding under beanies when he could. When Mrs. Figg had Harry over for carefully miserable afternoons of babysitting, she noticed nothing moved that shouldn't. He didn't accidentally make flowers out of fallen leaves, or levitate anything during tantrums, or turn toys funny colors. Mrs. Figg called up her mother, interrupting the wizarding bridge game she was winning against the nursing home staff, and asked her how she had known, decades back, that her youngest daughter was a squib.

  Every inch of wall space is covered by a bookcase. Each bookcase has six shelves, going almost to the ceiling. Some bookshelves are stacked to the brim with hardback books: science, maths, history, and everything else. Other shelves have two layers of paperback science fiction, with the back layer of books propped up on old tissue boxes or lengths of wood, so that you can see the back layer of books above the books in front. And it still isn't enough. Books are overflowing onto the tables and the sofas and making little heaps under the windows.

  THE HEAT of the August sun beat down on my neck. The air in the small valley didn't move at all, it weighed muggily in the depression, and it was only midmorning. I wiped my forehead with the sleeve of my robes, dark blue, Auror-standard. I'd eat a Hippogriff if there wouldn't be a thunderstorm before nightfall.

  As of yet, however, the sky was still steely blue over the flat chalk hills in the south-western corner of Suffolk. The gravel path on which I was walking wound its way down through the valley and up the counter slope, to an expansive two store building, which gleamed white in the bright light. It was surrounded by well-kept, extensive gardens and enclosed by a wrought-iron fence, with an imposing gate including a coat of arms, through which the road led and where I now stood: I had reached Greengrass Hall.

What's a particularly good (or at least technically skilled/widely acclaimed) book in your mind, then? One on Gutenberg, if you so please. I can certainly say that while the books I've read there might not precisely resemble Unatoned, they certainly don't begin like HMPOR does. Or, in general, have that sort of writing.

I recall HPMOR having half-page or page-length internal monologues (and not infrequently), full of that telling you seem to so despise.

*********** Please don't drag Anna Karenina into a nonsensical defense of HPMOR. For that matter, Tolstoy's isn't the only style in which great literature is written; fanfic, for the most part, has different goals than original fiction partly because it owes its existence to, and is in dialogue with, already established works of fiction; and the OP is specifically asking for great prose, which isn't actually one of the qualities Tolstoy is known for (at least in translation), and is distinct from great storytelling or brilliant plotting or innovative structure.

I could go on linking objections via semicolon, but frankly, planting HPMOR's flag on the hill of literature without a single shred of proof - and plucking Anna Karenina out of thin air as if HPMOR somehow belongs in the same company - is breathtakingly arrogant.

I don't really think HPMOR would be of much use to the OP, because whatever reputation it has certainly doesn't rest on the beauty or elegance of its prose.

And while it's true that JKR infodumps more than she ought to, especially in the later books, to say that the Harry Potter series is "almost exclusively telling" is demonstrably wrong. Most of the books are made up of active, bustling scenes in which a whole whimsical society unfolds. The characters didn't become beloved figures around the world by simply standing there and being mouthpieces explaining the action.

But /now/ you're saying it's not okay that the canon series has telling, because really the canon series is utter trash, but it's certainly okay if HPMOR does it because HPMOR is special.
