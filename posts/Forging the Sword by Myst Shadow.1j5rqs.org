** Description:

#+begin_quote
  Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.
#+end_quote

A "for want of a nail" story where Ginny dies in the chamber, an event that has dramatic consequences, as it impels Harry, Hermione, and Ron to become serious about learning magic and to distrust authority. The story went on hiatus for awhile, but has updated twice (about 30k words) in the last couple of months. It is still a WIP. I find the writing to be quite good with an original plot.
