Hey guys, I'm looking for a good HP fanfiction to translate it for a Russian fic translation contest. It's not a big deal, but I'm not too confident in HP fandom overall, let alone English part of it. So here's a few requirements:

- must be complete (and not part of a series)

- must be short(-ish) - preferably less than 25 kb (about 5000 words?), but can be up to 4x that long

- must be well written

- must not yet have translation to Russian (fine if it has other languages' translations)

- could be mature rated, but best if it's not too hardcore

- can be Gen/MF/MM/FF/whatever else, I'm fine with anything as long as it's good

- actually, considering it's June and my country could use some extra LGBTQ+ education, I'd even prefer if it has something useful for the reader in that regard - either some positivity or the reverse: drama/tragedy that proves the point that discrimination is a no-go. But it's not a mandatory requirerment

- bonus point if it has some unexpected take on any kind of subject and is generally kind of "wow I didn't see this coming"

- it's best if it's popular and has quite a few kudos and comments... but it's also fine if it had zero attention while matching other criteria

- better if it's not too ancient, but it doesn't have to be a very recent work either (mostly for the sake of asking author's permission)

- it's ok to suggest your own work or anything you've read and liked

Sorry if by any means this is not ok to ask here, just delete this in that case. Thanks in advance.


** It's definitely alright to post this here. Maybe flair it as MISC but Request should also be ok.

** Here's two that I think fit the criteria, although I'm not certain about length, as I've never downloaded them.

linkffn(8068437); linkffn(10916225)

Both aren't too long, are very articulate, eloquent, and feature an interesting twist on the material. No lgbt themes though, although it'll take a lot to change most Russians' opinions on that matter.

Удачи!

*** Thank you! <3 I'll check them out, beginning looks promising already.

About size: yeah, I just noticed english fiction websites has no kb counter, that's strange lol, I'm used to measure in those. Just checked it roughly: seems like Out of Mind fic is ~50kb, which is 10k-something words, so apparently 25kb is ~5000 words. But that's fine, it's not too long, just goes into different contest category :)
