Exactly what it says on the tin. Looking for fics where Harry raises Teddy as his son, and all the fluff involved. Preferably no pairings. Thanks!


** linkao3(18611800; 18513241) are beautiful one-shots, not ashamed to admit that the second one made me tearful.

  Harry has some exciting news, and feels he must tell Teddy first. Requested by and written for the lovely eldabe on Tumblr.

*** I prefer the focus to be on the father/son relationship, and a love interest often derails that in fics. I'm not necessarily against pairings though, as long as it's not that one where he had several kids with Andromeda Tonks and they called him "Mapoppy". That was weird.

  Canon-compliant up to most of DH, more than 10 years later in a hyper-magical, post-apocalyptic Britain, a spectator sneaks into the empty Once-Ministry to watch Harry Potter and Voldemort's final duel. Unfortunately, just as victory finally arrives, an unlikely escape triggers an unexpected beginning.
