** Y'all should look up the animations for /Harry Potter and the Portrait of what Looked Like a Large Pile of Ashe/. They're hilarious.

** Harry and Ron are in love with the same witch. Hermione is too busy trying to have a magical baby, Harry is jealous of her, and Ron does not want to learn it. All the students hate Hermione and are angry at her, though.

"Hermione, you need to talk to me."

She takes one look at Ron and decides it is a smart idea to confront him. After some back and forth Ron tells her he is not trying to get her out of it (they all agree) and she makes her decision.

"You've said that you want to learn more about Wizarding customs. How can you do that for me? I don't know what you were really thinking." This is a bit ironic for the next year. Ron looks into Hermione's eyes and sees it; that he is jealous of her (after all he knows what she's going through). This is a good thing since if Hermione had just known before they were going to have sex it would only have been a matter of time before Ron would be upset or angry and Hermione wouldn't have accepted.

When Harry hears Ron's story he doesn't think much further and tells her his own experience about having two friends who love each other very much. They kiss and then both leave the room in total shock and Ron is understandably furious. Hermione has a great meltdown and gets dressed and runs out

** The other day some person here told me that most fic authors were just very complex word generators and I thought that was hilarious and quite mean, and not only was that user right, but holy shit now those authors don't even have /that/.

** It did it for me even without a Harry Potter-related prompt:

"*She wasn't thrilled with his tone of voice, but she followed him anyway.*

"Yes," she said, but he didn't respond.

Harry didn't think much of it when Hermione came out of the washroom, the way she always had.

"Hermione?" asked Harry's teacher a little later. "What's a bit of a surprise for you in the washroom?"

Hermione nodded to the door to her room and then turned back around, looking away. "Harry's got lots of things in the washroom, but this one has one particular place from his favourite book. You know, the one in the picture?"

Harry stared at the picture for a long moment, turning his head to look at Harry's friends.

"Ah," said Draco the youngest, "Well that must be the one he read when he was a kid."

A look of pity crossed Harry's face, "You should have guessed," said Ron, with a laugh, "You think the other Gryffindors think it's the one?"

"The thing that struck you? That's right, Draco," said Hermione with a smirk, "I think that was Ron."

"It's okay," Draco said with a wave of his hand, "That's okay."

"And I thought it was supposed"
