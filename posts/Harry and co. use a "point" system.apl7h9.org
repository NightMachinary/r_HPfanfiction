This is going to be super vague but I remember reading a fanfic awhile back where Harry and his friends would say "point" if someone made a convincing argument, etc. and they ended up turning it into an actual points system. I'm pretty sure it was a Dramione fic or at least a good Draco fic. And Harry didn't grow up with the Dursleys, but I can't remember if it was a James/Lily survival story or that he grew up with Sirius or something else.


** That is linkffn(The Brightest Black) by Enigmaticrose4

From the Author's note: Points of change -- 1) Sirius did not go to check on Pettigrew and find him gone, he got assigned on patrol instead. 2) Bellatrix got a hankering for some bloodshed and randomly picked the Grangers from a list of muggleborns she was given.

  On that fateful Halloween night Bellatrix Lestrange decided to sate her bloodlust on an innocent muggleborn family. Life is never again the same for the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black.

  Objectively speaking, Hermione Granger knows Britain has a monarchy, just as she knows Prince Draco (the grandson of the current King of England) is probably off somewhere living his royal life in total unrelation to hers. Seeing as she isn't delusional, she doesn't really expect to be his friend. She doesn't expect anything that comes after, either. Dramione, modern royalty AU.

** Gave me an idea.

They make a point system for whenever someone does something like one of the other Houses.

Obviously, it can get to the point where the trio has the most points to the House the fandom thinks they are, but then Cormac gets "Dumbass House" points for every stupid thing that he does (remember when he said he ate Doxy eggs for a bet? 50 points to Dumbass).
