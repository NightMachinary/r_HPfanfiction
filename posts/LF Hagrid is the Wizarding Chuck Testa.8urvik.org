Care of Magical Creatures Starts and there's a Nundu, causing the class to scream. "You might have thought this Nundu was alive, or this Dragon was alive, or this Hippogrif was alive. Nope. Rubeus Hagrid" (Not writing Hagrid's accent, it's a pain, and more irritating to write than writing a WH40k Ork)
