Having read a lot of fanfictions I have discovered quite a lot of 'memes', by which I mean phrases, situations, characteristics, descriptions etc. that are very often used.

So I was thinking, let's have a game. Which memes have you noticed?

Let me start:

- The Potter curse about redheads

- Shoulder length hair (for some reason a lot of writers want Harry to grow shoulder length hair)

- Animagus training. Harry is suddenly very interested in becoming an animagus and has incredible proficiency in the field.

- (Let's not talk about bashing)

- Almost every (I have yet to read one) fifth year fic has Harry having some stupid reason not to tell on Umbridge.

So join the game. I am sure I know more, but this it is no fun if I start rambling.


** - Harry with long hair
- Harry is a latent metamorphmagus (sp?)
- Harry is an animagus
- Harry's animagus form is a phoenix
- or a griffon
- or a dragon
- has two (or more) animagus forms
- Harry gets an earring
- Harry is actually super rich
- Harry is actually a Lord of an Ancient and Noble House
- Harry is the Heir of Gryffindor
- of Slytherin
- of Ravenclaw
- Hermione is the Heir of Ravenclaw
- no, that's Luna
- Well, they're all in a harem, so what does it matter
- the Weasleys are evil
- or, Molly and Ginny are evil
- Ron is not a loyal friend (at least has canon evidence)
- Draco is mentally retarded
- Draco is a homicidal psychopath
- No one in the magical world knows how to throw/take a punch
- No one in the magical world has any knowledge of modern weapons or technology (at least has canon evidence: the head of their Muggle-tech department doesn't know what electricity is...)
- The goblins are actually really nice dudes
- The mermaids are evil
- The goblins are evil
- Dumbledore is evil
- Dumbledore is insane
- Dumbledore is senile
- Dumbledore is a manipulative bastard, but not evil (wait, wasn't that what happ-- /Obliviate!/
- Magical wards are super important
- the /Fidelus/ Charm is easy to cast
- The Dursleys are SUPER EVIL
- The Dursleys don't matter
- The Dursleys were manipulated by magic/blood wards/Dumbledore
- the Wizengamot is all powerful
- the Wizengamot has no power
- being on the Wizengamot gives you supreme power, at any age
- the French are your friends
- the French are evil
- being friends/boyfriend with Susan Bones / Daphne Greengrass / Luna Lovegood / anyone else solves all your problems

** - Hermione's parents are totally okay with her getting engaged at, like, fourteen because Harry is /that great a guy/.

- Harry is secretly a genius, despite always being perfectly average in the books. The reasons for this vary (evil!Dumbledore somehow blocks his learning ability, he was trying to not be any better than Ron, etc.) but the minute he decides to start learning he is the best at studying ever.

- Magical blocks. Someone is always putting a block on Harry's magic, despite this not being a thing in the books at all. Oh, and he's actually the strongest wizard since Merlin. Usually this accompanies manipulative/evil!Dumbledore.

- Harry doesn't have eyes, he has "shining emerald orbs"

In the books he's actually well above average. At least where it matters. He managed to get an E in most classes, one where the teacher hated him. The classes he did badly in were a joke in the first place. I could also understand him having bad studying habits, as it was mentioned in the first few chapters of the first book that he had to make sure never to do better in school than Dudley.

He's by no means a genius of course, just not average either.

**** yes, yes it is. They donÂ´t fit with the canon idea of what Slytherin/Gryffindor embodies. A sly person with big ambitions who knows how to do things on the sly by acting as a puppeteer behind the scenes? Yeah, that's clearly Malfoy who acts pigheaded by assaulting and insulting people in the open.

A person ruled by morals and his/her heart. A person who is sometimes selfless to a fault. Many describe the person as a witch/wizards who jumps into the fray wands blazing, but it doesn't have to be that way. It is all about acting honorable and helping people in any way they can. Hermione might be some of that, but she is too dependent on others rather than herself. If people are in trouble she wants to or does go to a teacher instead of getting involved.

If they are prince or princess of something that would mean they either inherited the title or embodied it. None of that is the case.

*** Ugh. I /hate/ this. Chess is not military strategy. The field of battle is constant, unchanging, and has no effect on the battle. The participants are evenly matched, have the same resources battle-to-battle, and all of your resources reset after each conflict.

In an actual battle, the terrain is uneven, unmatched, and mutable. The participants are unequal, don't have a perfect knowledge of what the other side has, don't know what their opponent is doing, and don't even know if there even is only one other participant (depending on the conflict). Your resources are alive, and resistant to sacrifice -- and you may need them in the next battle, too.

If Ron had been a master RTS player, and excelled at Starcraft or the Civ games... yeah, maybe he's a good strategist. Chess? No. He's just good at chess. And eating. ^{ugh} ^{he's} ^{so} ^{useless,} ^{even} ^{in} ^{canon.}

**** theory by someone with below average knowledge of sociology who has never read any male pregnancies fics, or in fact male slash at that -

1) slash pairings are by an extremely wide margin written and read by females.

2) Most females still love the idea of babies/kids.

3) It is much easier to love kids when one doesn't have to produce them personally, and/or imagine themselves doing so - pushing the capability on another gender entirely goes a long way to freedom from those hassles... (seriously, if we lived in a world where it's the men who have to go through the whole baby factory thing, I would sure as hell be fantasizing about women learning to do it for me)

4) Given a setting where anything is possible because magic and all the above reasons, why not?

And no, they aren't because they work so well. They work well if done right. Reading a story where Harry suddenly learns his animagus form somewhere inbetween a day or 2 months is just annoying. It is clearly because it satisfies the writer, not because it brings anything important, or for that matter believable, to the story.

And cliches are in general more vague. Therefore meme is also prudent because it is very specific.

- Snape - that dude gets tortured by everyone and their grandmas. Seriously... Ph.D in getting tortured to the brink of death.

- Harry and Ron - for 5 to 6 years they pretty much only tolerated Hermione and are in fact ready to drop out of her life almost entirely for weeks and months for practically any reason. (still ready for a quick cameo to behave like shits to her current love interest)

- Everyone would just love to be Head Boy/Girl and if not that than at least a prefect - it's not like there is something better for teens to do at a magic school than spending their evenings patrolling hallways to piss off classmates. And the mandatory assignments for school event organization - kids of Hogwarts apparently just live for that.

- Personal house elves: the only reason Voldermort and all Death Eaters weren't delivered to Azkhaban roped into a ball in embarrassing sexually compromising positions before being transported to the moon along with all Dementors and corrupt Ministry officials is that no one thought to order a house elf to do it.
