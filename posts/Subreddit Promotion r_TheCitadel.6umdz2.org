So about a week ago, I made a post likening the shipping wars from Harry Potter to those from Game of Thrones.

 

In the thread, crossover and GoT fanfics were discussed with interest!

Well I'm here promoting a brand new sub dedicated to Game of Thrones Fanfic: [[/r/TheCitadel]] !


** Someone promoted this yesterday already: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6ua7dg/introducing_rthecitadel_the_first_game_of_thrones/]]

You guys might want to avoid spamming subs with promotions.
