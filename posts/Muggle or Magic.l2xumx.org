Something that always confused me about fanfiction was the dichotomy between the "Muggle Methods" stories and the stories where problems were handled with magic. Why does it have to be one or the other? Magic can do a lot of things muggle technology can't sure, but that doesn't mean that the muggle method might not be the better solution for the problem. I generally like to see characters in stories develop /solutions/ to the problems they face, ones that don't boil down to hit it till it dies.

Guns might not be able to immediately kill wizards, but what about the creatures that inhabit the magical world? But none of that really gets rid of the problem of the dichotomy, what if we gave wizards muggle equipment for potions? Would they be able to perform different tests? Muggles are constantly expanding the field of science, would it kill us to have a few stories that say "Hmm, Muggles developed the test tube. Yoink, it's mine now."

I'd just like to see stories that say "Muggles have found something that could be helpful, now let's develop some magic that will allow us to use it in the way we want." They're two separate societies creating solutions to different problems, I just want to see our characters being creative and thinking outside the box, rather than being stuck in a new box of "Muggle Methods"

kinda has both. Harry and Hermione at least plan (it's been too long since I read it to be sure if they ever do) to incorporate potions into muggle medicine and I think make guns that fire stunners (that second one might be from another fic)

** I'm in the camp of muggles kinda stomp in an all out battle but wizards would annihilate them in the long run.

You might be saying WHAAAAAT well guns shoot bullets really fucking fast and a shield can probably counter bullets to some extent but that's only effective if the shield is up before the bullet is shot. Spells are also colorful as shit and will reveal your position.

But wizards can turn invisible, control minds, kill without a trace, and also shit like dementors that Muggles literally can't touch

*** Well yeah, muggles are going to be better at killing people. We've had more major conflicts in which warfare developed. Wizards can win a conflict, but muggle weapons could generally be used to a devastating effect especially with magic improving their functionality.
