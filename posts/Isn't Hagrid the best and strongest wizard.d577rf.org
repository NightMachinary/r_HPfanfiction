Think about it.

He uses magic with an umbrella (which may have wand splinters in it, but that's probably just fanon, even if it isn't, it's still just splinters and not an actual wand)

With said umbrella, he performs partial human transfiguration

He performs said magic with said umbrella when he hasn't actually finished his third year of schooling.

  Hagrid racked his brain for what he'd been doing twelve years ago and how he could have fathered a child and forgotten him. He didn't see many of his features in Billy save possibly the chin and hair, but if Dumbledore said he was his son, then he must be his son! "I was part of a secret group during the war," Hagrid said slowly. "To keep people safe I had the Headmaster obliviate me at time, 'cause what I didn't know I couldn't spill."

  "Oh," Harry said, wide-eyed as he thought about Hagrid's hidden wand and how he'd first thought it was something out of James Bond.

  "What?" Billy asked, not knowing why Hagrid was talking about the war or why Harry had reacted that way.

  "My name is Rubeus Hagrid... and I'm yer Father," Hagrid said solemnly, placing a hand on Billy's shoulder.

  "What's obliviate mean?" Seline asked, hiding behind Harry.

  "It's a spell that removes memories," Hagrid explained.

  "You were like James Bond," Harry explained.

  "Who?" Hagrid asked.

  "A spy who saves the world," Harry explained. "He doesn't have magic, he's a muggle, so he uses a lot of tools and blows stuff up. Part of his job involves meeting lots of women and keeping secrets."

**** I mean it is actually hinted at. I'm sure it's in the Philosopher's Stone, when Harry is getting his wand, Mr. Ollivander says, "Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped in half when you got expelled?" Hagrid replies he kept the peices and Ollivander sharply says, "But you don't use them?" Which Hagrid denies while gripping his pink umbrella tightly. It's meant to be a hint, considering he uses the umbrella for spell casting.

#+end_quote

I assumed his umbrella /is/ his wand, with some ribs and fabric as a disguise. I think /snapping the wand/ it's simply a phrase and it means a person has been banned from carrying a wand by the Ministry. Perhaps there actually is some kind of ritual in which the person's wand is snapped by a Ministry official, as when army officers who disgraced themselves used to have their sword snapped and their badges of rank ritually torn from their uniform.

But this doesn't stop the person acquiring another one, say from the Diagon Alley junk shop that sells old wands. Perhaps it won't be a /good/ wand as going to Olivander would likely not be an option and the wand would be a poor "fit". But Hagrid seems to do effective magic regardless, and he's circumspect when using it, so avoids getting into trouble.

*** You fudged the formatting of that quote a bit- it's repeated at the end.

I think 'snapping a wand' is quite literal, considering he tells Ollivander that he still has the pieces. We also know that Dumbledore likely knew Hagrid was innocent, and that he could repair a wand since he had the Elder Wand. So it's not an unreasonable jump to think he saved the pieces of his wand after it was broken, and then Dumbledore repaired it for him.

Dumbledore got him his job at Hogwarts.

You can't use a broken wand. At all.

The Elder Wand can repair wands, despite repairing a broken wand having been stated by the foremost wandmaker in the world to be impossible.

/Ergo/ it seems logical that Dumbledore probably repaired Hagrid's wand at some point, and hid it in the umbrella, telling him that he was to keep it a secret.

What really doesn't make sense is that, following Hagrid's innocence being proven in CoS, he wasn't specifically/formally told that he was allowed to use magic and carry a wand again.
