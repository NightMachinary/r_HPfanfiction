Preferably with them as a pairing and please no wifebeater Ron stories. Going to the seventies would be more interesting but Hogwarts era would be ok too.


** linkffn(The End and the Beginning by muggledad)

It's a bit quirky buy it's also fantastic. It's also lengthy and complete so all good things there.

*** I read it and didn't like it very much. The concept seemed too overpowered and the various generations of beacons and rune sets were very confusing (stopped after 2/3 of the story because I lost interest).

One time jump works best for my suspension of disbelief.

**** Indeed. The idea was very promising but the fic became later way over the top and confusing although IMHO it didn't jump the shark.

It's the only harmony where both time travel that I know though.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

  An older and more experienced Harry and Hermione return to their first year at Hogwarts. Their goals? Assassinate Death Eaters, destroy Horcruxes, and deal with Voldemort's hidden contingency plan... by any means necessary. And maybe they'll fix a few other things along the way.

** In linkffn(Stages of Hope) they jump dimensions without traveling in time, but it feels a lot like a time travel story. No explicit H/Hr pairing, but you can easily read it that way if you want to. Ron is dead and sorely missed by both.

linkffn(Sanctuary by DigiFruit) is a one-shot with all kinds of time and dimension shenanigans. I think it's an amazing story, but its not your typical time travel fic.

In linkffn(A Switched Chance by LunaStorm) Harry and Hermione go back to their childhood but end up in each other's bodies by accident.
