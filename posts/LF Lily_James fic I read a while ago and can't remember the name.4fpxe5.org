Okay guys so I read this Lily / James fic a while back and I can't remember the name of it. I think it starts maybe 6th or 7th year and it focuses on Lily and her friends, along with James and his friends. I remember Lily's friend Mary Macdonald had a Scottish background and (spoiler alert) is killed along with her family during the school year. Unfortunately that is all I can remember! If you guys know what I'm talking about please help! :(

PS I am on mobile sorry for the bad formatting!

  Sirius was laughing. "Have you always been this funny?" he asked, an odd expression on his face. I shrugged. "Well, you know what they say. You have to watch the quiet ones." He muttered something under his breath that sounded like "Clearly."
