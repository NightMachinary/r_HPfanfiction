I've looked back at many discussions on if Voldemort knew of the existence of Ron and namely Hermione and their quest in helping Harry defeat Voldemort. The general consensus at the time (mind you, the post I was looking at was from about a year ago) was that Voldemort was probably aware of their existence, though he was so focused on Harry that he didn't pay much attention to the pair, which partially, not wholly, led to his downfall.

But, if Voldemort knew how much of a role Hermione (and Ron) had in helping Harry, as per Lucious and/or Severus, do you think he would've considered an alternate route in taking down Harry, through Hermione and/or Ron? I mean, when you think of it, Hermione tends to share several similarities with a young Voldemort (i.e. Tom Riddle Jr.). One of the most striking examples I can think off from the top of my head is their ability to persuade teachers (Hermione with Lockhart and Tom with Slughorn) and also their power to lie or conceal the truth (Hermione with Bellatrix and Tom with Dumbledore). Hermione is also shown to display some more traits of Slytherin (e.g. jinxing the D.A. list and showing absolutely no remorse over Marietta's disfigurement).

It just seems like an opportunity wasted on J.K.'s part that there wasn't any further "interaction" between Voldemort and Hermione, in my opinion. Of course, the books are from Harry's POV so we have a very limited perspective in what Voldemort was doing/thinking most of the time but I just wonder what Voldemort would think of Hermione if he knew that she was a brilliant student, displayed "some" Slytherin-like tendencies (although firmly placed in Gryffindor), and being a Muggle-Born, showing her pure talent. Of course, Hermione doesn't come without her flaws but I think knowing what he thought of her and a possible meeting between the pair would've been fascinating.


** I don't think it's in character for Voldemort to care about Ron or Hermione. Who are they? A blood traitor and a mudblood. Hardly worth the personal attention of the greatest dark wizard of all time.

Voldemort cares about Harry because of the prophecy and because he has faced him personally multiple times. And he (not entirely incorrectly) thinks that Harry only succeeded at escaping/defeating him before was due to luck and the protection of other more powerful wizards. From Voldemort's perspective, none of that had anything to do with Ron or Hermione.

Look at how he responds to setbacks involving Harry. Twice, he develops an almost monomaniacal focus on an artifact with deep magical properties: the prophecy in Book 5 and the Elder Wand in Book 7. This makes sense for a man who makes horcruxes.

In Voldemort's mind, the secret to defeating Harry isn't to take things away from Harry; it's to make himself even more knowledgable and powerful. Again, this is completely consistent with his character. Besides which, Harry's greatest ally, Dumbledore, is already dead. Who are Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger next to Albus Dumbledore? And who are /any/ of them next to Lord Voldemort?

As for a meeting between Hermione and Voldemort, there's plenty of evidence as to how that would go: a swift "Avada kedavra" dealt out in anger. Could Hermione be useful to Voldemort? Yes. But Voldemort only gets creative about using all assets available to him when he has no choice. He is at heart a tremendously gifted schoolboy with a large ego who prefers to get by on superior talent.

*** You're right that it's not in character to care of Ron or Hermione, but I was trying to phrase this as a more "what if" type of scenario. To me, JK Rowling didn't craft Voldemort well at all, but in her defense, Harry Potter did start off as a children's series then grew progressively more adult; it's too bad that the main villain stayed pretty much the same as from the beginning and didn't bother to learn much from the mistakes he made that led to his first downfall.

Hermione is obviously gifted and extremely intelligent (though she's nowhere near Tom Riddle Jr. and many others) but her closeness with Harry makes me wonder if more would've been said or done on Voldemort's part to Hermione rather than a swift "Avada Kedavra."

I used to think this to, but in crafting my response, I realized that Voldemort does at least have a consistent characterization. This is a key insight:

#+begin_quote

So if you are going to write a fic where Voldemort uses Hermione to get to Harry, and if you want to maintain consistent characterization, I think it should be set during Harry's fourth year as Voldemort is scheming his return to power. Replace the Bertha Jorkins and Barty Crouch Jr. stuff with a plot that somehow centers around Hermione. It could be pretty good.

*** In this context, how talented or skilled she is compared to those listed is actually less important than how organized, prudent, and ruthless she is. For Harry, losing her would be losing a level-headed friend who will tell him when he's about to do something stupid; who will plan ahead, organize, and prepare things when Harry has neither the skills nor the inclination to do so; and who will occasionally do sneaky, underhanded, and even vicious things to protect him that Harry lacks the disposition or the means to do himself.

That's purely a matter of opinion, methinks. Going solely from canon, it could go either way (with a slight bonus in my camp if you account for /Cursed Child/), and it's far from clear-cut that Hermione isn't future Dumbledore material. Of course, teenage-Hermione wouldn't be a match for /adult-/Snape or Marauders, let alone adult-Voldemort, but I think it's extremely plausible that at equal age, she's on level with someone like Remus, and possibly (and I prefer to think so) even Dumbledore and Riddle.

I think the profanity is unwarranted. The movies have their flaws, but I wouldn't go as far as to call them by the s-word. Secondarily, like /Cursed Child/, you may or may not account for them in your headcanon, but you can't dismiss them as representation of Rowling's vision of her world and characters --- she had oversight of both and did in fact veto the thing she said didn't fit her artistic vision (such as adding "little people" living in Hogwarts in /Prisoner/, or scrapping Kreacher's character). Weirdness like the Horcrux mind-link got in for plot convenience reasons, but I don't think she would have let the movies build up on Hermione's brilliant if in her mind she considered her to be average.

Binding magical contracts a thrown around willy-nilly in fanfiction, but I believe this one and the Goblet thing are the only ones seen in canon, which does make me think they've got to be /unusual/.

It can be hard to keep perspective of this since the books are centred around them, but Harry, Hermione and Ron are /children/. Looking at it rationally, it's patently ludicrous that any of them play a significant role in anything, and it's only Harry's unique Harry-ness that brings him to Voldemort's attention.

** I've always been saying that Hermione was basically a good version of Tom Riddle.

Diary Riddle in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/][Applied Cultural Anthropology, Or]], linkffn(9238861), really likes her.

So yes, if Voldemort had known her better, he would have definitely made an effort to recruit her, Muggleborn or not. But Voldemort would also have killed anyone who knew about his Horcruxes immediately.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** As many others have said, why would Voldemort care about a schoolgirl? He only cares about Harry due to the prophecy and more importantly, because Harry "killed" him. Someone as prideful as Voldemort will never accept that someone was more powerful than him, even if, in reality, it was due to Lily's protection. To Voldemort, it's all about himself.

Also, Hermione and Voldemort are nothing alike. Not even close. Harry and Voldemort are much more similar.

The reason Hermione persuaded Lockhart is not due to any skill or charm on her part - in fact, she's closer to socially inept, based on her upbringing - but bceause Lockhart is an egotistical bastard. I'm sure he would have done the same thing if Harry had asked to "research about famous people in the Restricted Section." Lockhart is an idiot. On the other hand, Slughorn is an experienced and intelligent teacher, with great cunning. Tom was charming; he knew how to make himself appealing, and managed to get his way into Slughorn's good graces (also due to his talent).

Hermione not spilling the beans under torture vs. Tom getting asked an awkward question and hastily covering it up due to his charm. If she was real, I'd highly respect her, but those are two different things.

And everyone shows some traits of Slytherin, god damn it. And Gryffindor. And Hufflepuff. And Ravenclaw. This is one of those things that didn't really transition properly when the series went from "children's books" and "young adult fiction. Everyone has some cunning, everyone has some ruthlessness. Jinxing shit isn't a Slytherin trait, that's called being a teen.

In essence, Hermione is just your typical girl bookworm/nerd/teacher's pet, with some Mary Sue elements. She's smart, but that's cause she obsessively reads books and studies, in part due to her need for approval/attention that she never got from her peers. Tom is a genius. He studies not because he wants to be the top academically, but because he's fascinated by magic. It's like the difference between the guy who gets A's on every single math test, and Albert Einstein.

** Waw... another Hermione fanatic. Hermione is nothing like Voldemort, when did she convince Lockhart? It was Harry who did.

To answer your question, Voldemort would have done nothing, because Hermione isn't important. She never did anything helping Harry. All Horcruxes were destroyed by either Harry, Dumbledore, Ron or Neville. During the seventh year, like an idiot she packed books but not one can of food... I could do this all day long, but a simple lecture of the books would show you how useless she was.

*** While I understand your annoyance at people believing Hermione is perfect in every way, you're still selling her short by calling her /useless/. There's a middle-ground between "Angel!ChildProdigy!Hermione" and Hermione-Bashing.

Also, I fail to see how finding similarities between Voldemort and Hermione is immediately equated to Hermione-fanatism. You can make a case for Hermione to be a very capable and powerful witch without any shade of her being similar to Riddle, and vice-versa.

*** You say that all the horcruxes were destroyed by either Harry, Dumbledore, Ron, or Neville...yet let me ask you: Who destroyed Helga Hufflepuff's cup? Next, did you read Chamber of Secrets? She [Hermione] falsified Lockhart's autograph into getting access into the Restricted Section, not Harry. Then you claim she's an "idiot" who packed books but not one can of food...tell me, which food items did Harry and Ron think to bring along? Finally, "she never did anything helping Harry"? I'm not even going to bother to correct you on that one. If you don't believe, please read the ENTIRE Harry Potter series again.

I understand if you don't like Hermione, and I'm cool with that. But your response shows that you know very little of her character and her importance, yes importance, she had in the series in defeating Voldemort, because, whether you know it or not, she played a part in his downfall. Also, since you don't like Hermione all that much, why on earth would you click on a post in which she plays a major part? I mean, her name is in the title after all?

**** Hermione destroyed the cup only AFTER Ron had the idea (and managed) to enter the Chamber of Secret. So again, she was useless in this case. She "tricked" Lockhart to getting acces into the Restricted Section. Did she find anything there? Nop. And tricking Lockharts isn't like tricking Slughorn. We are not talking about Harry and Ron now, we are talking about Hermione so she is an idiot for not packing foods, regardless of Harry's and Ron's preparation. Now, if you have any passages where she helped Harry AND got results, then please be kind enough to post them.

***** I have a serious question for you: Do you read over your replies before you post them? I'm being serious. You initially said this: "All Horcruxes were destroyed by either Harry, Dumbledore, Ron, or Neville." Those were your exact words. However, since Hermione destroyed Hufflepuff's Cup, that means that your initial statement was incorrect. I mean, in your response to me, you contradict yourself in the first line. It doesn't matter if Ron initially got the idea - Hermione STILL DESTROYED A HORCRUX.

Next, you said: "When did she convince Lockhart?" I never said in my initial post that she convinced him; I said she persuaded him. Persuade and trick are synonyms of each other. Your contradict yourself again. And it didn't matter if she found anything there or not; the fact is, is that she tricked a professor (a rather unintelligent one at that) but Hermione still did it. Of course, I'll grant you that Lockhart is no Slughorn.

Third point, throughout the series, it's shown that Harry and Ron are not dumb; in fact, they are both intelligent and skilled in there own fields, just like Hermione is in terms of studying and being book-smart. So then why would Hermione be the SOLE member of the trio to think of something to pack to eat? Eating is something humans do every day, with Ron complaining the MOST about FOOD. Do you see where I'm going here?

Finally, like I said before, dust off your Harry Potter books (assuming you have any) and read them. I can't tell you how many countless passages there are of Hermione helping Harry AND getting results. Don't believe me? Goblet of Fire: Chapter 20 - The First Task. Hermione helps Harry master the Summoning Charm which helps him win the first task. I was kind enough to post it.

You're blinded by your hatred for Hermione's character and it shows in your responses. Too bad though that your replies are laced with inconsistencies and contradictions that you seem to have no idea what you're even talking about.
