***** Absolutely agree. I've read almost every type of Daphne story, including all of the ones that portray the trope/s I dislike so much now (everyone has a phase lol), but I still want to read more with her as the primary female character. It's justso hard now to find a good one that doesn't follow all the annoying tropes.

**** I don't hate the trope per se, it's just that most fics I've read of this type doesn't really deliver on the whole "Ice Queen" thing. It always turns out that it's just a "persona" and she's really just a sweet girl inside. I've only ever known one fic who actually double's down on the whole "ice cold bitch" thing.

*** I enjoyed the one-shot where Daphne was physically abused as a child and suffered brain damage and thus became the ice queen because she's effectively autistic. It was a much needed deconstruction of the cliche.

**** Linkffn(Ice Princess by Luan Mao) is what you are referring to. As did I, I think it did an excellent job. It also managed to make Harry and Daphne both seem like teenagers; the writing of their relationship remained true to their age.

*** "leather pants draco" always makes me thing of the early 90s movie production of "Much Ado About Nothing" where Keanu Reeves is the villian and wears tight leather pants like the /whole/ movie and it's hilariously bad but also well-acted Shakespeare? Anyway, weird movie, amusing mental image, and they got connected in my brain to that trope of Draco.
