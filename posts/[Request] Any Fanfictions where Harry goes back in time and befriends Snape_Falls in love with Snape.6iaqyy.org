I don't mind slash, as long as it's rated T or lower. Please link completed fanfictions.


** linkao3(Rapture by mia_ugly) is beautiful and poignant and one of the best Snarrys I've read. The prose and characterization are superb.

linkffn(Elective Affinities by Caecelia) is also really good but it's unfortunately abandoned. It's quite unique and goes a bit into Snape's experiments with crafting spells.

** Seconding Rapture, which is my favorite romantic (as opposed to dysfunctional) Snape/Harry fic, and Elective Affinities, which sadly never reaches the point of bringing the two of them together or explaining the mystery of what Harry's doing there.

And in no particular order:

linkao3(Sweet Afton by babygray)

linkao3(In Time, Once Again by avioleta) (rated M)

linkao3(The Life of Another by jin_fenghuang)

linkao3(Escaping the Paradox by Meri) (rated M)

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=1265][Cockroach Clusters, Please]] by ziasudra (rated M)

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=1929][Just Another Soldier in the War]] by ziasudra (rated M)

There's also a charming fic about a spell that goes wrong and regresses a post-Shrieking Shack Snape to the age of 18. He returns to his canon age at the end, though.

linkao3(The Sleeping Prince by who_la_hoop)

  It's hard to ignore your past --- and impossible to do so when you can't remember your future. But a meddlesome portrait, a dragon with an ancient grudge and true love's kiss teach an unlikely Prince that a regrettable past doesn't have to mean an unhappy ending.
