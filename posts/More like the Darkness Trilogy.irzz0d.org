Just finished The Darkness Trilogy by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4137775/cleotheo][cleotheo]] and was wondering if you guys knew any others like it. You know Hermione being the Dark Lord's daughter, kidnapped, thought to be dead by the Dark. Harry and her joining said dark. It doesn't even have to be her. It could be Harry. I like the idea of one of them being Tom's kid and watching as Dumbledore's plans crumble when they figure out who their family really is. If not, stories where the Dark are family like or close, like in this series and for some reason Harry joins them. Maybe others like Hermione, Neville, Luna.


** Not sure if you have read Goddess of Vengeance and children of the dark series both also by cleotheo. They are one of my favourite stories. Almost every story which has some kind of similar concept ,which I've read, now that I checked are written by cleotheo....
