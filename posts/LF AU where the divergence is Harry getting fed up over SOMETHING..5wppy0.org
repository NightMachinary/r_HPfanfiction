Be it the Dursley's treatment leads to him running away, Snape's treatment leads him to get Snape fired, the students make him leave Hogwarts with their rumoring and gossip, whatever. Harry gets fed up and stuff happens. Preferably something big enough to not have plot regurgitation.

Dark!harry, slash, crossovers and bashing are fine. Please no harems, genderbending, romance/smut-focused plot, mpreg or pottercest. Thank you!


** This way too generic a request to be satisfied by one story. I'll instead point you towards an FFN community called 'Independent Harry'. Most of the fics there satisfy your request.

*** Yes. But I hate looking for my own fics because I'm all invested then boom. Harry's pregnant cause the author didn't warn about mpreg. Or I love what's happening then suddenly Harry's doing everything that moves. It's such a waste of time.

**** That's a risk I'm afraid you have to take when you're in fanfiction, one of the weirdest places in the internet. The only way to fully fit a story inside your own safe bubble is to write it.

***** Not really. I've found dozens of fics I love that don't contain what I dislike.

** You may like The Renegade Cause. It sort of satisfies your request, basically there is a slight change is made in the beginning of Order of The Phoenix and things wildly diverge from the canon plot. It has a sequel story that was never finished, I'm not sure if it's still being worked on or not.

I found it to be reasonably well written, but there were a few things that bothered me with it. For one, important events seemed to often be left vague in the story until pages or chapters later when they were clarified, maybe this was just me. For example there are things like, "[person] was just hit with a nondescript spell", and you are supposed to infer that they died, but they don't say it directly until a while later. This was mostly just a frustration for me, it didn't really detract a ton from the story.

It has a couple good new original characters and fits them into the world splendidly. There are a few nonsensical, though important plot points that happen, but overall it flows nicely and it's not like you're left confused or anything.
