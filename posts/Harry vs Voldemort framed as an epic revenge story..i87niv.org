"My name is Harry James Potter. You killed my parents. Prepare to die." And all that jazz.

A Harry that would dedicate his life towards killing Voldemort regardless of whether or not the latter knows of the former's existence. A Harry that would do his absolute best to hunt Voldemort down even if he genuinely retired and was living as a hermit on some deserted island somewhere.

Maybe there isn't even a prophecy and Harry is just another orphan that Voldemort left in his wake - this is just a thought, not a requirement by any means.

 

Does anybody have any recommendations for good fics like that?


** I like the idea of Harry not being special, just another orphan who rises up to slay the dismissive Dark Lord. Being toyed with and underestimated until he finally annihilates him.

*** I mean, canon Harry isn't really special either. The prophecy is self-fulfilling.

#+begin_quote
  "But, sir," said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, "it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or-"

  "Got to?' said Dumbledore. "Of course you've got to! But *not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried!* We both know it! *Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!*"

  Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. HE thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.

  "*I'd want him finished*," said Harry quietly. "*And I'd want to do it.*"

  "Of course you wold!" cried Dumbledore. "You see, *the prophecy does not mean you* */have/* *to do anything!* But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to /mark you as his equal/... in other words, *you are free to choose your way*, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to haunt you... which makes it certain, really, that-"

  "That one of us is going to end up killing the other," said Harry. "Yes."

  But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tel him. It was, he thought, *the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to death and walking into the arena with your head held high.* Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world.

**** A self-fulfilling prophecy is still a prophecy. Harry is spared because of Lily's sacrifice, which only occurred because of the prophecy. He's still the chosen one.

Dumbledore's point is that /after/ that happened, the prophecy was just spelling out what any idiot could have predicted and what Harry would have chosen for himself if there had been no prophecy.

*** Yeah. There's just something about it. Voldemort with all of his power and resources and ruthlessness is focused on his grand ambitions and his great enemy Albus Dumbledore, not really realizing or appreciating that, by operating the way he does, he has his whole life been been planting the seeds of his own defeat. Eventually one took hold, and while he's busy focusing on his his lofty goals, a nobody rises up to defeat him. You reap what you sow.

Though I do also enjoy the whole prophesied chosen one idea.

***** I'd be very interested in an AU where Voldemort actually DID die that night, but Sirius still doesn't escape from Azkaban until year 3. Maybe since Dumbledore knows Voldemort is gone, he's able to place Harry somewhere he's actually wanted, so when Sirius breaks out it's not as important that Sirius take him into his home and instead Sirius focuses on using the Black fortune and name to destroy the lives of the people who destroyed his.

Peter Pettigrew is a stay at home dad with a healer wife. His daughter sees him get a reducto to the face.

Greyback calls his pack the crazy 88 and owns a cool nightclub in Romania

The Bride is played by Sirius Black, try to get his godson back from the revived lord Voldemort, who is actually a possessed Regulus Black to provide emotional impact.
