**** Well Voldemort has also had had so many years for himself. As for the Deathly Hallows, the resurrection stone is of no use. The elder wand is like ok. I mean Voldemort is a magical prodigy, his magical powers are on a different level. So perhaps the elder wand may help Harry come to Voldemort's magical level but he will not be able to surpass it I believe. The invisibility cloak may be his best chance, but I can't think of Voldemort letting his guard down without having the best protections available. And I don't know if he ever sleeps.

Now I don't have anything against Harry, but according to the Canon Harry was a skilled and powerful wizard but Dumbledore and Voldemort were on a whole different level. Harry cannot defeat them in a legit face to face duel. The fanon tends to magically over power Harry.

***** Now, that is unfair with the stone. The resurrection stone could potentially be used as a way of bridging the gap and even getting more powerful than Voldemort by using it as a way of accumulating knowledge. The stone represents by itself access to all scholars, military leaders, duelists, sages, and teachers, to all cultures, all kinds of magic, almost all secrets... coupled with a wand that will allow the user to make use of this knowledge with perfection and a cloak that will protect the owner when they aren't on guard... it is not the almost godhood of many fanfics (though the recipe of the philosopher's stone would be achievable making immortality kind of a go) but together they can help a magical to get /much/ ahead of even powerhouses like Voldemort and Dumbledore, though admittedly, it could take a while.

**** Can almost see the conversation.

Harry: So the prophecy says only I can kill you and you me.

Tom: Go on.

Harry: We're both basically immortal right now. Now I dont know about you, but I kinda like the idea of never dying.

Tom nods

Tom: I see... and what do you propose?

Harry: Well I pretty much hate the Wizarding World right now, what with its corrupt Ministry, its bigoted school system, the press getting away with saying whatever they want with no consequences and the populus in general being nothing but pathetic sheep. To be honest, I could care less what happens to them.

Tom: So you're saying...?

Harry: I'm saying... how about we call a truce? You can have the Wizarding World and I'll just... oh I dont know... scoot off to a tropical island somewhere filled with naked or nearly naked women and just enjoy eternity. If you want, we can meet up for dinner or something say... ever hundred years or so... just to catch up.

Tom grins.

Tom: Works for me. I'll even give you say... a week to snag any girls you want and take them with you. I might suggest the Black sisters... sure Bellatrix is crazy but you do have to admit, all three are pretty attractive.

Harry grins and nods. They shake hands and Harry leaves. One week passes and Harry is on a tropical island with Dobby and a couple dozen of the hottest women in the Wizarding World... while Tom takes control of the Ministry.

  A very bored Harry Potter starts writing to the Dark Lord over the summer after his fifth year at Hogwarts. An equally bored Voldemort decides to write back. And thus, a summer of secrets is born, and the enemy named boredom is fended off. Slash fic!

******* Because Harry is not a sociopath nor a complete idiot. If he just says "screw it" it's not going to be the people at the top who are jerking him around who suffer, it's going to be the people they are oppressing.

Not that you can't write him as a sociopath/complete idiot, but it's a huge leap character wise. Many of the people in his life who he cares for would be on the chopping block.
