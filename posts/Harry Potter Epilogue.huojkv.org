Was anybody else really weirded out when Ginny and Harry ended up together? Think about it. From the earliest moment we know Ginny, 10 years old at the platform, she was “in love” with Harry Potter. She liked what Harry Potter was about. His adventures and the heroics that were Harry Potter, know what I mean? I know it's supposed to be cute and romantic and all that but I found it really weird, even when I was younger, 15 now, I was about 10 when I first read the series. It's like when you have a celebrity crush but you expect that celebrity to want to marry you so you're really weird about getting their attention?

** I am quite certain that Ginny's crush when she was eleven was nothing like her feelings about him when she was fourteen (in the middle of OotP, when she returns back to the spotlight). Yes, of course, (as one Ginny in one fanfiction said) it is hard not to crush on the super famous Harry Potter who just saved your life and is leading you out of your death with the ancient magical sword on his shoulder and magical huge birds on the other one. However, she then completely evaporated from the story and the only redeeming quality of [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][this mistake]] is that she had an opportunity and time to reasses the boy and to see him in the more realistic manner. Which I hope she did.

However, the biggest problem of Hinny (and I do ship Hinny) is not that the relationship would be against her character as revealed in books, but that she has not character whatsoever. Read the link above.

** Honestly, now that you pointed it out it is weird... I mean, the initial crush was kind of cringey but then I kind of forgot about it when it moved towards the two of them being into each other (maybe because it took some time to get to it and I forgot by the time I reached the “proper” romance? IDK). But now that you put one next to the other it is weird - or rather unrealistic. I mean, honestly, how likely is it that your celebrity crush turns out to be the person you make them out to be? I'd say it's kind of a Mary Sue moment if you know what I mean...

** It is a bit weird if you think about it, and I don't really see Harry being interested in her, considering her fangirling over him at the beginning. And since the relationship was written so badly in the books (and even worse in the movies), I could never get behind this pairing.

*** Out of curiosity: who do you think he should've ended up with? (Not saying you're wrong, just curious, like I said)

**** Not the OP but the answer is probably a) nobody. Not everyone needs or wants a partner to be their best self. I'd totally read a fic about him third wheeling Ron and Hermiones marriage and keeping them together. B) cassia Smith a raven claw two years down from them. (Who is not real and I just made up. The point being someone who was close enough to the war to understand it but mentally well enough that they don't drag each other down.)

**** No one. I would like it better if JKR didn't rush to pair everyone off in the epilogue. I think it would be better if she focused on the adventure and friendship part of HP. I'd be kind of nice to have an open ending to the series, where everyone could imagine Harry's life after Voldemort's defeat however they wanted.

If I /had/ to choose someone then, I'd probably go with Hermione or Luna (though I prefer Luna for Ron), simply because there are not many well-developed female characters in the series, and those two are the only ones I can come up with.

​

Still, in my opinion, JKR should stay away from Romance in HP. She did well with meaningless relationships like Harry/Cho, Ron/Lavender or Hermione/Viktor, but the serious ones were written awfully, and I found them completely unrealistic.
