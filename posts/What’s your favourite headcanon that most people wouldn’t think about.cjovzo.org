Mine is that goblins specifically made it 17 k to 1 s and 29 s to 1 G (493 k to 1 G) because those numbers suck in a base ten counting system like the one most humans use. Goblins on the other hand use a base six (and far superior) system, which makes it 25 k - 1 s and 45 s -1 G. Which is nice, only one less than 30 and 50, but my favourite part is that 1 G is 2141 k. Which is just perfect. 25,45,21,41. Goblins are so sneaky.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this, an any other ideas!

Edit: For more information on why base six is better I refer your to ‘A better way to count' [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qID2B4MK7Y0]]


** The actual purpose of a seeker has barely anything to do with quidditch, its purpose is about finding out who is going to be relevant in the future. Wizards assume that fate will cause important people to end up in that position, because its the only position that actually matters in quidditch. Basically, wizards are aware that their universe is to a certain extent driven by a narrative that can notice things like goodness and actively cause ironic things to happen, and this is their way to find out who to watch out for.

I mean lets be honest 3 out of 4 Triwizard Champions were Seekers, and if Fleur didn't dislike brooms she probably would have been one too.

My headcanon has pretty much all important people have a history as seekers, including Dumbledore, Voldemort and Grindelwald. And really if any of them had played quidditch I doubt that they would have been satisfied with one of the useless positions. I also imagine that the barely mentioned seekers like that Slytherin in Harrys first year or Charlie Weasley had adventures that had nothing to do with Harry.

My personal idea for the names of teachers at least is similar to renaming in Skulduggery Pleasant, where names have power (hence incantations) and naming yourself Pomona Sprout helps increase your affinity to herbology. Side note: this is why Harry's name is so bland, because sometime in school his parents expected him to change it to amplify his magic.

******* You're trying to impose post-Norman salic law rules on a place to which those institutions wouldn't come for several centuries. That time and place, it was either brehon law or whatever the pictish equivalent was. Assuming Rowena wasn't insisting on /ius civile/, which isn't out of the question since she /did/ latinise her name and gave her daughter a greek name. Any of those options had entirely different rules about inheritance to the salic law that the modern english-speaking world's inheritance law is based on. And they all had different rules about naming in the 10th and 11th centuries - the first recorded surname /ever/ in the British Isles doesn't appear until the very late 11th century (or possibly the early 12th century, I'm not going and looking it up, you can make do with my recollection on this one.)

And 'baron' didn't mean then what it does now, a particular rank among the peerage (it still doesn't entirely mean that now in Scotland, where the equivalent rank is Lord of Parliament because the title of baron is still an incident of landholding there, or was until they were made alienable and inheritable apart from the land they ran with in 2004).

It really only amounted to 'landowner with enough of an estate that he was assessed for military obligations' with the number and type of armed men he had to provide varying whether he held his land under the Anglo-Saxon system (/fyrd/, I don't think there was a money alternative) or the Norman system (Knight-Service, or at least scutage in lieu). He could quite easily have been a small-b baron inflated a little by subsequent misunderstanding. And even if he was a capital-B Baron and a tenant-in-chief of William I - which would tell us that Helena came along when Rowena was quite old by anyone's standards, because the earliest that could have happened would be 1067 when Rowena was /at least eighty/ - he wasn't under Rowena's authority because /all/ of the Barons made after the conquest were the direct liegemen of the King, that's what being a capital-B Baron /meant/.

If he was doing as she asked, he was doing a favour, not his lawful feudal duty.

** Many of the magical forms of fast transit are comparatively recent inventions, or only became feasible recently- within the last few centuries, since the founding of the Ministry and the Statute of Secrecy.

Brooms are much faster and more comfortable in modern times. The Floo network needs the Ministry to set up and subsidize Powder production/distribution. Apparition used to be considered an advanced/secret technique, but is now expected of schoolchildren (we know Neville's grandmother prefers not to apparate). Portkeys are difficult to set up and organize (Dumbledore setting one up isn't indicative of the general difficulty).

Additionally, before the statute, where magical folks could live and mingle with muggles more freely, all-magical communities like the Alley or Hogsmeade were much smaller and less central to the general culture.

So what this means is that while magical transportation was ahead of muggle, it didn't allow for quick and easy cross-country travel. Magicals were also much more spread out, without large marketplaces like the Alley. The expectation was that an individual or household would be more independant, and look after their own needs- food, clothes, potions, supplies magical and mundance, etc., rather than nipping on down to the Alley for some afternoon shopping. And even if that's not the case now, magical society is long-lived, conservative and slow to change.

And that's why Herbology and Potions are core, required courses, even though many modern students won't step foot in a garden or touch a cauldron after graduating.

Dammit, I really need to get to writing that story.

1. The wizarding economy is non-existent, basically a post-scarcity world (basic necessities are cheap/free, think a lifetime family supply of food for the price of a wand) with extremely expensive artifacts. Magical artifacts take a portion of a lifetime to complete (think 3/life), and the 'super rich' families are simply those who have accumulated enough of these legacy artifacts.

2. The wizarding Britain really does survive on a yearly class of less than 40. This means the wizarding world can't be more than 4000 adults total. It kind of.. changes everything.

I saw a fic that had this. A ... Dimensionally displaced, I think, MC was having reservations about Hogwarts and so Dumbledore took them on a tour of the ministry school at diagon alley, where the kids were drugged to the gills with emotion suppressors to keep them from literally exploding and killing themselves and others via hormone fuelled accidental magic. Apparently there's some unreplicatable aspect of Hogwarts that completely prevents accidental magic and greatly suppressed it over the summer holidays.

So it's either attend attend Hogwarts, with all it's flaws, become a potion zombie, or literally explode. Those are your choices (it wasn't addressed, but presumably durmstrang and beaubatons has similar enchantments.)

** Goblin coins are enchanted to self-stack; gold with gold, silver with silver, bronze with bronze. There are children's games about flipping knuts to guess how they'll stack. It also serves as a simple way to detect fake ones- toss a handful onto a special plate and the real ones stack as expected, leaving the fakes to land haphazardly.

This is how they keep stacks of coins in the vaults under control, and all the magic for it is embedded in the runes along the edge. The coins begin as strips of flat wire, inscribed with their particular magic as each coin is spooled into a disk. They are then stamped and the final inscriptions are laid on the outer edge, including a complex mark identifying the minter -- e.g.: Thriftgilder's work #11005.

- Wands are interpreters; it's the wand that is enchanted to understand Wizarding Latin and it is alive enough to learn other spells through its connection to the owning wizard

- Legilimency is very helpful in learning languages

- basic Occlumency is taught to duelists to keep others out of their head and to facilitate self-control, but Harry needed something more in order to control Voldemort's access to his brain

- Becoming an Animagus makes Occlumency harder to learn and vice-versa

- Runes are a method for sustaining and modifying Charms; Ancient Runes is a history of enchantment which covers the elements used in the past to build the modern rune libraries

I guess because neither is explained fairly well in the books (and that Animagus ritual JKR came up with is retarded) I took up the fanon that both rely on similar meditation-like exercises. With Occlumency you clear your mind and focus on building up defences, and with Animagi you focus on connecting with your "inner self/animal."

Your's makes sense, though, and could definitely lead into more varied practices to work on the individual skills rather than using meditation as a cure-all.

** Salazar Slytherin and the Peverells are part of the same family tree, and Harry's Parseltongue abilities was passed down through his ancestry rather than the Horcrux. He kept the ability after Voldemort was killed, and the previous generations of Potters also had Parseltongues, but it was kept secret due to the implications.

The Deathly Hallows are somehow related to the Veil within the Death Room. My current theory is that, before it was moved into the DoM, the Veil was an ancient spiritual/ritual site, and that it's some kind of portal or window into the afterlife/underworld. Thestrals came into this world some time ago via the archway, which is why only those who have seen and accepted death can see them. The Stone is a piece of the archway, the Cloak is cut from the Veil itself, and the Wand uses a thestral core within part of one of the Elder trees that used to grow around the Veil. This is also why Luna mentions Harry just having to look "behind the Veil" to see Sirius again at the end of OotP, her father is searching for the Hallows so she would obviously know about the Stone. Whether or not she knows of the connection is up for debate, but she might have put the pieces together since she could also see the Veil like Harry and had knowledge of the Hallows.

** Late again - I have a (bit wobbly, frankly) headcanon that Narcissa isn't really /blood/ related (but a sister nontheless) to the Blacks. She's actually a Brown, and was informally adopted to serve as a bit of a buffer between Andromeda and Bellatrix. It could explain the difference in appearance + how her name isn't a star/constellation.

It's mostly just for fun, though!

** Fave headcanon #2:\\
Most Asian wizards no longer live with muggles at all.

The terracotta warriors and surrounding necropolis were constructed so that they could be transported into a Hidden Realm of magic, enabling a sudden presence for the first Emperor and his host to establish a stronghold in the foothills of this fairy land. What was left behind were the shells of their muggle-side presence.

This is the land sometimes called Shangri La, Xanadu, Nirvana, Hy Breasil, Avalon... the city of clay is only one gateway to this promised land, an unearthly paradise only open to magical beasts and beings.

The Age of Sail and the growth of European imperialism forced the hand of the Asian wizards- many were uninterested in living lives of secrecy and chose to migrate to the Hidden Realm. A substantial drop in Asiatic magicians may have accelerated the success of the invaders, making the lesser portion who had stayed unable to resist the imposition of European Confederacy rule.

In modern times, those few new wizards who arise in the populations from the western edge of the Himalayas all the way to the Pacific coastline are offered the simple choice; stay with the muggles, living an inconsequential life with strict control over when and how magic may be used, or migrate to the Hidden Realm.

The only mainland Asian wizards still kicking around are descended from British, French, or Russian families.

**** I'm not entirely sure you know what I mean by decimalisation. In 1971, the currency in the UK changed to a simpler form. It used to be 12 pence to a shilling, 20 shillings to a pound. One penny also used to be worth more, and so did a pound. One pound in 1970 is about 15 pounds now

** Harry has multiple godchildren. It's an honour his friends kept bestowing upon him, especially after seeing how good he was with Teddy. He's closer with Teddy as he stepped in as surrogate father / uncle. I imagine he's godfather to Rose Weasley and possibly some of the other next-gen kids.

At least one of the Weasley grandchildren has Harry as a middle name. I personally picture it as Louis Weasley, the son of Bill and Fleur and the first grandson born into the family. Harry felt he didn't deserve it but Bill and Fleur were adamant that Harry saved everyone in the family at least once and they wanted to name their son after him.

Neville becomes Head of Gryffindor.

Neville was actually raised by both of his grandparents on the Longbottom side. His paternal grandfather died a few years before he started Hogwarts and that's how he's able to see threstals.

OotP, Chapter 21

It is canonical that Neville witnessed his grandfather's death so I just filled in the gaps. He only ever talks about his gran so I imagine by PS it had just been Neville and Augusta, otherwise he would have mentioned him when they were talking about their families at the Sorting Ceremony. Neville seems to be very private (not mentioning his parents until OotP) so it's possible he was raised by both the elder Longbottoms until his grandfather died or it could have been Alice's father he was referring to.

** Demelza Robins is the daughter of Bellatrix Lestrange. After the arrest of the Lestranges, the Aurors found a toddler without any registered as missing and therefore assumed that it was just some random muggle child whose parents had been murdered. So they placed her in the muggle foster system. She found a loving family, calls her adoptive parents mum and dad, thinks herself a Muggleborn and is completely unaware of her parentage.

Harry raised Delphi after the war and got his ultimate revenge on Voldemort by having his daughter call him daddy.

******** Canon Voldemort would not care either way since he has no need for a child. Disregarding that, it would be a classic example of /revenge through kindness/ and Harry taking the spot which could have been Volde's if he had been a good father (and lived).

As I said, CC contradicts canon through its very existence, but if you are willing to look past that, there are not many options on how you could deal with the altered post-war situation. Also, adopting Delphi has the benefit that you ensure that CC cannot take place.
