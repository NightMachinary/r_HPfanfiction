Im starting to write a fic and am still in the planning stages of it and I'm brainstorming ideas for pranks but im not very good at it, they all feel very unoriginal, does anyone have any ideas they are ok with me using? I might work on them a bit/ edit them a bit to make them fit the story. :)


** Making a potion that changes people's voices into animal sounds. So, for example, the Slytherins would moo, Ravenclaws neigh,etc. Anyway, the marauders would make this potion and bribe the house elves into putting the potions into each house's drinks.

*** Nah, they'd make it house-themed. Slytherins hiss, Ravenclaws caw... what sounds do badgers make?

** Changing someone's hair colour or clothes is a pretty common prank that I see. Maybe you could include a prank that spells the victim into doing something stupid or embarrassing every time they hear a trigger word?

By the way, if this fic includes Harry, don't use “cub” or “pup” as a pet name for him given by the marauders as it's weird and most people don't like it.

*** If it's Sirius who does it I'm usually fine with it. But Remus? Honestly the guy hates himself for being a werewolf, why would he give Harry a nickname like that?
