There's this fanfiction that I can't find for the lift of me. It is a harry/draco fanfic, and there is some sort of potion that dumbledore wants harry to take that makes his mind super prone to visions. He is able to go to this sort of spirit world, and later in the fic draco goes in with him, and snape I think, but it's mostly harry. Harry continues to take the potion despite draco and snape not wanting him to, because he just wants to help in some way, and he thinks this is his way to help. I think harry might have also been resorted into slytherin or just spends a lot of time around slytherins.

I remember plenty of details from it, such as in the end it is just a battle scene with snape there, draco, and harry against these other guys in the spirit world. Harry throughout the fic sees this one little girl being tortured and eventually I believe killed, all in his mind because of this potion. I can remember a lot of details but not anything specific enough to get a name from. Any help would be appreciated.


** I believe that's /Faith/ linkffn(1318020) though I didn't make it overly far into the story.

*** I finished this a long time ago. Everyone basically turns on Harry for no reason at all. In fact a lot of stuff happens for no reason. Since it was released before HBP , it has a unique plot, which is a plus. Huges doses of unneeded angst everywere though.
