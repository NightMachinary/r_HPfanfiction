** Congratulations, you have discovered the breaking point of Rule34 and an opportunity to make a name for yourself in the subculture by being the first to write one.

I eagerly anticipate your further exploration of Harry/fem!Hagrid, Harry/fem!Buckbeak and the holy grail, Harry/fem!Mjolnir.

*** I long since came to the conclusion that "Why" is a redundant question in fanfiction.

** Dude. Just do one big thread asking for Harry or FemHarry with the various FemCharacters you want. We don't need a new thread every 2 or 3 days asking for the same thing over and over.

** I have noticed a pattern of different user names (that I'm coming to suspect are the same person) appearing every few weeks with progressively more ridiculous fic requests until someone calls them out on it. This person's style seems to match up with those other users.
