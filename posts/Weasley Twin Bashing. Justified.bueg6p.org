Whenever I see fanfics that bash the Weasley family, the outliers will almost always be Fred and George, as in, when a writer wants to leave a member of the Weasleys out of the bashing, it tends to be Fred and George. I want to see it that is justified or not. Are the twins really that different from the family that they would assist Harry rather than their flesh and blood? Sometimes abandoning Dumbledore along the way? Or are they just fan favorites that writers really do not want to bash? I want to know why people might argue either side so please, let the discussion begin!


** Twins are left out of even complete bashfests because they are fan favourites, although it's a missed opportunity, really. Just think about it, if you want greedy, selfish Weasleys who don't care about other people and employ mind altering potions potions, F&G are the easiest to twist that way. They are the ones who can (and do) make love potions, they are ambitious and need money for their projects, and they are often callous in their jokes and can be considered bullies.

*** Except the throwaway line in PoA, sure. But F&G seems more, at least as the series progress, about the "craft" of pranking rather than to be callous assholes. That is called growing up while still retaining their younger spirit.

**** But my point is that they are the easiest out of all the Weasleys to spin as villains in a bashfic, objectively. You'd have much more to work with than with Molly or Ron.

** In Reverse, in which all the characters are the opposite of their canon selves in some way, they're professional torturers, thinking up new and even more evil ways to inflict pain.

**** Found it. It's very well-written, and has the cleverest use of a boggart I've ever read. I could do without the detailed descriptions of torture, though. Sadly incomplete.

** Fred and George, who lose points constantly, treat Harry badly, not even referring to him by name during Quidditch, to the point Harry wanted to quit.

#+begin_quote
  But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn't speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him "the Seeker. "

** Bashing in general has no basis in justification. Someone doesn't like a character, so they exaggerate their negative and remove their positive attributes.

** Their testing method for their "candy" would have them lose any license for such an activity in the real world. Not only did they use preteens without parental consent for their experiments, but they also did so without any medical supervision nearby. If any of the first graders would have had an allergic reaction, the child might very well have died before help could have been called for. And they didn't even do their dubious experiments to find the cure for a deadly disease, they did so to make a profit. The term gross negligence comes to mind.

If you want to pull them through the mud, you don't need to make up anything since canon alone is enough to "bash" them with.

** They are bullies with no regard to other peoples feelings or if they hurt anyone.

But they are the "fun" characters and have kind of spoken up against Ron and Percy, and went against the adults with the extendable ears. So...

** You could, fairly easily, bash Fred and George - you play up the meanness of their pranks, equate them with the Marauders (and of course, you heap a great deal of disapproval on the Mauraders and ignore the fact they grew up, Snape gave as good as he got etc). The Lie I've Lived does a decent job of bashing them even without that - it just overplays their protectiveness of Ginny, makes them out to be bullies etc.

That said, Fred and George are also two fan favourite characters, who in canon have done some slightly mean pranks in the past but grew up and are now just fun, and who have a clear and obvious dislike for rules and authority which makes them potentially the easiest to win over from Dumbledore, Molly etc.

** Given bashing is usually based in stupidity you'd just be wasting your time trying to justify why some were and some weren't bashed.
