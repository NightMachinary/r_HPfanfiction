  Yeah, Harry was acting bloody weird with it around his neck, so when we found Sword of Gryffindor, Harry was like, "Ron, just take the sword and swing it at the Horcrux, while I catch my breath". So yeah, I took the sword, and kinda stabbed it with the sword.

** But come to think of it? Didn't Ron already achieve what most of his brothers did and eventually did even better than them? He was a Prefect and also a part of the Quidditch team and won the House Cup for them too when Harry wasn't playing in both fifth and sixth year. He rode a dragon, broke into Gringotts, helped fight Death Eaters and destroyed Horcruxes. That's more badass than all the Weasleys combined!

*** I think the post meant their dreams, not the actual accomplishments. Like imagining Charlie's dream was to free the Gringotts dragon. Perhaps Percy's dream was to...um...win an Order of Merlin, and maybe Bill liked imagining himself as a dashing hero saving the day...or perhaps just his mum not making a fuss over his choice of wife ;) George could've dreamed of being the main hero in a Quidditch match, and Fred probably wanted to be a successful co-owner of a popular joke shop franchise...

**** YES! The reason i read slash is because the male characters in harry potter are so much more interesting and full of depth than the female characters in harry potter imo. And most if it doesn't have a lot of smut. Especially if you read the stuff on ffn rather than ao3. Unpopular opinion, but I'd much rather read something centered around Harry and Voldemort. Rather than Tonks or Fleur, who are practically OC's. And, most of them are pre-slash anyways, so it's about the relationship dynamic, not the sex. And again, unpopular opinion: But a working dynamic between complicated and opposing characters like Harry and Snape, Harry and Riddle, or Harry and Draco, has a lot more possibilities than Harry with veela Fleur.

**** I'm quite curious about why this is being downvoted when it's a valid point.

In my experience, and regarding polls, most slash is written by females. If you go into smut, the sex is incredibly dull, often forced and slanted, and the relationships fall into stereotypes. Harry is either feminine* to the core or bursts out in tears because someone, mainly his crush, said his hair looked messy.

I meant feminine as in he has the handwaving, flamboyant thing going on that I have not seen done in everyday life before.
