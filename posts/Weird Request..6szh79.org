I'm looking for stories where the Trio, or members of the Trio, are thieves. And I mean like their thievery is a big part of the story, not just something their known for. I prefer longer stories but any will do. I prefer an H/HR pairing, but no pairing would work too. This is weirdly specific I know, but Reddit has always seemed to pull through for me.


** Starfox5 just started a story with Hermione as a thief and HHr pairing. *Harry Potter and the Lady Thief* linkffn(12592097)

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
