I'm sorry for the delay in getting this chapter out. It's been a bad year.


** Sorry to hear that man. Hopefully the enjoyment everyone gets out of your writing brings you some measure of satisfaction.

For anyone who hasn't read this yet, it's the most popular HP crossover fic of all time. It's literally a must-read in terms of originality, quality, humor, pacing, everything.

*** I absolutely love The Havoc Side of the Force and am extremely happy to finally see it updated. This might actually even call for a full re-read, again.

But the title of most popular HP crossover I would easily give to Browncoat, Green Eyes. Except maybe if you go exclusively by something like Reviews to measure popularity.

***** Follows are as bad as reviews when measuring popularity. A story that is from 2006 where it was finished within 6 months will obviously not have as many follows as a story from 2012 that is still being posted 7 years later. Follows are useless for a finished story.

I just go with my own observations over the last 13 years. Browncoat Green Eyes has been the very first answer whenever threads requesting good crossovers were posted. First on the fictionalley.org "Help! I'm looking for..." forum and now here. Your argument about a fun story-line and good writing can be equally, maybe even more so for the quality of the writing, applied to Browncoat Green Eyes.

But as I said, I am not arguing against Havoc Side here, read it at least 4 times and love it. I just don't put it up there with the absolute classic of HP crossovers. Yet. Maybe some day I will consider them both equally great.

****** I don't think I've seen someone recommend Browncoat more than two or three times. It's a decent story, but you have to really be following Firefly to know what even 3/4 of the necessary information is. I 100% don't know anyone that considers it a classic, either. And I know a lot of people that love FF, and follow a lot of the communities.

Your own arguement could be used for Havoc against Browncoat.

******* Yea, you don't need to know anything about Firefly lol. And if you only saw it recced 2 or 3 times you are either very new to the fandom or are trolling. I saw it recced 2 or 3 thousand times. Quit talking out of your arse lol.

****** I think havoc is indisputably more popular. what metric are you using to conclude brown coat is more popular?? There's a case for wand and shield (even though it's dead) but a Firefly fic?
