Anyone know of an archived copy of "Caught in the Act" by Grander?

It was one of two Hermione/Lucius fics that 'Grander' wrote in 2009-11 and featured Lucius catching Hermione as she was writing a 'scandalous' love letter to Ron and used it to blackmail Hermione into agreeing to be his personal assistant, a position with which he eventually used to seduce 'Mione.

I was able to save copies of Grander's other fic, "May the Best Man Win" which featured Draco and Lucius in a bet to see who could seduce Hermione.

There are two versions of "Best Man," the first one featured a dub con seduction of Hermione which Grander rewrote after complaints that it was borderline rape/brainwashing, but then the rewrite turned out to be even darker with Lucius torturing Hermione in the middle of the sex, and Grander eventually deleted both versions and "Caught in the Act" and disappeared from the fandom.
