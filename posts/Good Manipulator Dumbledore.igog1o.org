** Headcanon: wizarding Britain started falling apart bit by bit after Dumbledore died. At first no one noticed because hey it was wartime things were supposed to be a mess. Then it got more obvious as time went on. Turned out he did a bunch of maintenance behind the scenes with the elder wand and now Britain needs to figure out how to cope without him.

Aka the fic I'm writing but is still stuck on the first chapter of.

*** Just imagining a journal left behind by Dumbledore and Fawke's last mission was to deliver it to whoever ends up controlling the Elder Wand after an short gestation period (totally reasonable to assume it would switch hands a few times after his death).

In the first couple pages of the Journal, he writes a few letters depending on his best guesses of who would end up with the wand.

If Harry, he implores him to once again take up the crown of responsibility that he never asked for, but wears so well.

If Voldemort, an appeal to his humanity that, while they may have never seen eye-to-eye, the wizarding world was still his home and it was necessary that these things be done to keep it operating smoothly.

If Dobby, question reality.

The rest of the journal would be descriptions and instructions of each of these weird and unexpected things he had learned needed to be done to keep the world functioning properly.

Every Monday, check for an Imperious on the Comptroller General.

Every Tuesday, refill the fountain of magical creatures in the atrium of the ministry.

Every Wednesday, make sure Dobby hasn't accidentally acquired the Elder Wand.

***** Dobby proceeds to declare war on the Wizards who mistreated House Elves. He is unstoppable, wins the war and declares himself the King of All Magic. Then he proceeds to enslave all humans and put House Elves in positions of nobility. Because of his kindness, Harry is allowed to be Dobby's personal pet slave.

******* Dobby: Harry Potter must bark like a dog for Dobby's amusement.

Harry: Dobby, stop telling me to do that.

Dobby: Harry is Dobby's slave and he must do as Dobby says.

Harry: I told you to stop that...

Dobby: Master Dobby...

*His lips curl and proceeds to beat himself with the fire poker.
