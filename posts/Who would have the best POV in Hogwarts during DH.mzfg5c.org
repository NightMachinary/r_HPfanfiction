There are a lot of immediate choices: Neville, Ginny, and Luna- the leaders of the DA.

But Lavender seems like it would be a fascinating POV to write from, to get her perspective (at least partially) on the Lavender/Ron relationship from HBP.

Snape might be interesting too, to get a look in on his efforts to protect students/maintain his position.


** The best POV /for what/?

I'd like Pansy's POV. The Carrows would be interesting as well, but in a different way. And the best story would probably be told by some no-name pureblood either in Slytherin or Ravenclaw.

** Lavender's POV would be awesome. Another would be maybe a puff, who naively though Hogwarts was so magical and amazing and suddenly (to them) the school is a war zone and they're trying to cope with the changes. It it'd be a great incomplete pov (I forget the correct term)

** I personally think Snape would have been super interesting as someone who was in on both sides, but I actually think there could have been SO many interesting perspectives because JKR wrote some really fantastic characters.

** I think any of the teachers... particularly McGonagall or Flitwick who were on quite friendly terms with Snape before he killed Dumbledore. Now they are forced to work under him while believing he is one of Voldemort's followers and having to keep their mouths shut as they see students being tortured.

Snape would have an interesting perspective as well. The side you fight for hates you, the Carrows go over your head despite telling them not to torture children and meanwhile you are so alone in this world only with a portrait of the man you killed to keep you company.

Draco Malfoy's fall from grace would be interesting to see as well. See him abandoned by his friends, probably even be the subject of some nasty pranks from DA.

The Carrows would also be fun to watch how they struggle to enforce the new world order while being constant subjects of the DA's pranks.

Of course Neville, Ginny, Luna.

*** The Carrows would be hilarious from a satiric POV, to watch them get smacked down...

But I love your point about the teachers. There could be all these little instances of doubt that are immediately crushed because they know Snape killed dumbledore and his “support” of the Carrows abuse.

I love the idea of Snape too! He's such an interesting POV to write, I'm never certain I do a good job...

Thank you so much for your comment! It went really in-depth and helped me think it through

** I feel that the best POV isn't always the people at the centre of the action it you want to explore something highly charged, because they are limited in what they see. If you are focussed more on what happens to everyone rather than what an individual is thinking, then you might be better off with a wallflower. Maybe a pureblood younger sibling of a DA member who can act as a wandering pair of eyes and ears freely going wherever the narrative demands. If you want to take that further, you could use someone people wouldn't pay attention to at all, a ghost, portrait or house elf.
