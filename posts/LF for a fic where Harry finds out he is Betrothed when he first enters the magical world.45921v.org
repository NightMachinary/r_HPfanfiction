As stated in the title. Even better if its Daphne Greengrass and Harry gets sorted into Slytherin. Either he finds out from the goblins or his betrothed approaches him on the train or something. Otherwise I don't really care. I just want a fic where harry finds out he is betrothed in first year. Thnx.

**** To each their own. I sometimes like the "awful" fics. Fanfiction to me is a lot of wish fulfillment, so if I want an over-the-top story then that is what I want.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

I can already guess that isn't actually true. There are some Harry/Draco fics where they are bonded/betrothed before the train, and I don't think that is what you are looking for. There is also at least one Snape/Harry where they are bonded when Harry is born. As I like /romance/, I avoid fics which make a pair 'destined' to avoid building an actual relationship, so I have no recs for you, but you might want to be more specific in future.
