I know we all rant frequently about bad tropes and head canons in HP fan fiction around here, but what about the good ones? What are some of your favorite fanon tropes? Any fics you reccomend that follow them" what about tropes you don't usually like, any examples of fics that did them well or subverted them?


** Not sure i'd say it's my favorite but Parselmagic is cool. Gives it more to do than open doors in the girl's bathroom. Not sure for what it /does/, but I just like it doing more.

I have my own headcanon that the Marauders found/invented a new method to become Animagi. From memory Sirius describes what they did as "dangerous". The official method isn't dangerous, it's tedious. So I say that they invented/found a new way, one that was faster but more dangerous.

*** The official method is tedious if you do it right. JKR didn't detail the consequences of attempting but failing the process.

**** If nothing else the official method just sounds /boring/. Why don't more wizards become animagi if it's this easy? Sure, maybe brewing the potion is hard, but is there a reason you can't get someone else that's good at potions to make it for you?

***** Probably for the same reason that people don't gain useful skills in real life.

Like, knowing advanced mathematics significantly increases your career prospects and earning potential. The only thing stopping most people from acquiring this skill is that it is tedious to acquire. And that's enough to prevent the vast majority of people from doing it.

****** Well there's also, you know, the FUN component. Changing into an animal is fun, getting a headache over advanced mathematics isn't. Unless you are among the chosen ones who actually enjoy solving equations that is.

******** I always wondered how they managed spell casting without messing up the incantations for two years, like I know James at least shows some ability in silent magic during the O.W.L exams, but they started the process in third year.

****** Okay, fair.

Counterargument: you can't learn advanced mathematics in a month (plus however long it takes to find a thunderstorm).

You have good points, and I really don't, so I'll leave it here.

** These ideas don't form part of my headcanon, as there's not enough support for them in the books (and some, such as the House Elves one, directly contradict the books), but here are some ideas I enjoy:

- The Wizard's Council, which we know ruled magical Britain before the Ministry, was a wizarding sub-committee of the King's privy council, such that the Muggle King had authority over the magical world. During this period of time, the King would award prominent wizards titles of nobility.

- A magical civil war took place in parallel with the English civil war. Monarchists who supported the Wizard's Council and opposed the idea of wizarding secrecy on the one side. Pro-statute wizards who wanted an independent magical government and a split from the monarch on the other. The Wizard's Council lost, Britain supported the Statute of Secrecy, and the Ministry was created.

- From this time on, no wizards would receive Muggle titles of nobility, and those wizarding families which held pre-existing titles had been on the losing side of the war. Those titles, associated with Muggle rule and the demonised Wizard's Council, quickly fell out of fashion and it was considered a point of wizarding pride to be simply referred to by the egalitarian title of "Mr".

- Pure-bloods disagree over what constitutes a pure-blood and there are different schools of thought on the matter.

- House-Elves more closely aligned with Brownie folklore - they spontaneously appear in sufficiently magical households, and are tied to the property rather than a wizard Master.

- There were several attempts on Harry's life during his childhood with the Dursleys.

- The Moon is made of cheese, Wallace and Gromit style. Due to all the craters, the Swiss claim that the Moon must be a form of Swiss cheese and therefore belongs to them. The Dutch contest this.

- The 11 countries with top-tier magical schools are like the Great Powers of the magical world and are generally able to dictate terms to the rest of the magical community.

- The educational norm in the international magical community is for young wizards to be taught magic informally by their local community, a form of collective homeschooling where the families in a given area come together to homeschool their children as a group. Once the children are in the older teens, they may take up an apprenticeship for a more formal type of education. As a result, most wizards have quite a narrow specialism, only learning the magic that has been passed down by the families in their community.

- Over time, some of these community schooling groups can become more established and develop into something resembling a school. However, they tend to disappear after a number of years - either because there aren't enough students (because the local magical population isn't big enough to support them and years can go by without any new children being born in that area) or because key individuals move on or die. The 11 great schools are unusual in their permanence.

- Magical (Western) Europe is considered dangerously liberal by most of the world when it comes to their approach to wizarding secrecy, permitting Muggleborns at their schools and allowing wizards to marry Muggles. In most of the world, there is no blood-related conflict because pure-blood dominance is so complete that it isn't even a question.

** These are my Favourite Headcanons, not tropes

- When Dumbledore became Headmaster he placed an enchantment on the student body at Hogwarts which altered fate so no Student dies while at school, which resulted in lots of coincidences that prevented students from dying when they should have, like nobody directly meeting the gaze of the Basilisk. Its basically the opposite of the jinx Voldemort placed on the Defense against the Dark Arts position. This enchantment faded after Dumbledore died.
- When objects and beings are exposed to magic they increasingly start to work by rules of stories and fairy tales rather than physics, which results in stuff like animals starting to behave more like they do in fables with intelligence similar to humans and technology starts to behave in a dramatic rather than predictable way(the Weasley car for example randomly developed sentience)
- The Greek gods were wizards, but not in the sense that there would have been one powerful wizards who was worshiped as one particular god, but rather that there were multiple wizards over longer periods of time who muggles ended up interpreting as a single god. This fits nicely with how. Greeks often absorbed foreign mythologies and tried to fit the various gods into their own. And also explains why they often have multiple contradicting myths and occasionally act very out of character.
- The point of the Seeker position is find out which people are going to be relevant in the future. Wizards assume that fate will cause important people to end up in that position, because its the only position that actually matters in quidditch. Basically, wizards are aware that their universe is to a certain extent driven by a narrative that can notice things like goodness and actively cause ironic things to happen, and this is their way to find out who to watch out for.
- It was Ginny's decision to name a child after Snape. We know from the books how bad she is at naming(see Pigwidgeon) and she had much less reason to hate Snape. Harry agreed because he got to name their first child, and it was better than her other horrible suggestions.
- You cant us Transfiguration to create potion ingredients because while its physically the same object it wouldn't change the magical significance of the objects, meaning a cat hair transfigured into a dog hair would still count as cat hair for the purpose of magic, despite the molecular structure being identical.
- Similarly using charms on the ingredients to increase the amount(enlarging and duplication) would leave magical traces on the ingredients which would render them useless for potions that require the original ingredient.
