Would love if Harry told Cedric not to touch it as well, and maybe they fire some lights or something to get help from Dumbledore or whoever else sees it. (Doesn't have to be exactly that).

All it was said was that Harry had to complete the three tasks, never said anything about touching the trophy. Plus it's obvious from Harry's perspective that someone had placed his name in the Goblet without his knowledge.


** I remember finding a crack fic sorta where he repulsos it and it hits a giant beastie like a weird magic elephant rhino in the maze and it kills pettegrew and Voldemort cause in the giant cauldron it has three infants of it's species as ingredients and mama beastie goes nuts, Mr. Diggory the elder is sent to the scene in Little Hangleton and ends up dealing with the beast and touches the cup being ported back to the maze and wins the tournament on accident. The power Voldie knows not is Angry Mama animals

  We've all experienced moments of dread. A gut feeling that something was very wrong, but Harry Potter has been through so much more than most in his short life and has a higher threshold for weird feelings. Meaning when he gets one, he listens to it. So, what happens when he gets this feeling before grabbing the Triwizard Cup and instead accidentally knocks it into one of the many dangerous beasts in the maze with him?

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.
