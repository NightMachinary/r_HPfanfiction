Hello writers and readers! I am trying to write a book with all the Harry Potter Cliches I can possibly fit into a book series. I currently have two (2) chapters up right now [Harry Potter and the Overrated Stone (on FFN currently)] and am currently working on the third.

What I am wanting to get is a compiled list of all the cliches and tropes in HP fanfics you have seen. You've probably seen several of these on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] and some on this subreddit, but they're all just people complaining about the ones the OP have listed. Like I said in the first sentence, I want a compiled list of all Cliches and Tropes you know of (TV Tropes isn't that good in regards to this sort of thing, it's not specific enough for my tastes).

So far, the cliches I have gotten are (w/o spoiling the book):

-Good Dursleys

-Bad Dursleys

-Exceedingly Normal Dursleys

-TimeTravel Harry (Entirely Accidental, of course. probably)

-Sorta-not-second personality Stockholm Syndrome Harry

-Sorta!Slytherin Harry

-Smart Harry (He was an adult, okay?)

-Cursing Coping method Harry

-Good Dumbledore

-Bad Dumbledore

-basically all characters will be pretty much Bi-polar w/ good-bad stuff. I like to call this the 'Tsundere Effect'

-The Giant squid turns into a girl

And the Cliches I have w/ Spoiling the book:

>! -Female Harry!<

>! -totally OP Harry!<

>! -Heir of nearly everything Harry!<

>! -Animagus Harry!<

>! -Metamorphmagus Harry (either extremely limited or unlimited)!<

>! -Because of The Giant sqid being turned into a girl, it is now an anime girl!<

But like, nearly all of the above are just going to be Harry just rejecting them until he finally accepts him turning into a female. by like, 4th or 5th year. maybe. He still hates the others though.

That's all I can think of right now, but I might add some to the list when I think of them.

If you want to Rant/Complain about certain Cliches or Tropes, then I'll [[https://i.imgflip.com/38ekff.jpg][probably put it in there]], but feel free to go ahead and rant/complain.

Thanks in advance for your help!


** I'm not sure if you've already looked but TV tropes has a couple of pages that would be useful for you -

[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FandomSpecificPlot/HarryPotter]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanon/HarryPotter]]

You might also find it helpful to search â€˜tropes' on this subreddit as there are quite a lot of threads centering around tropes and cliches in the Potter fandom. Good Luck and I hope you share your completed list and fic!

*** Thanks! I hadn't gone far into TVTropes, as its formatting was confusing and I didn't know it worked exactly.

I'll take a look at these, thanks again!

** You had me at "Giant squid turns into a girl"

Here's a bunch of plot devices/Tropes/etc that I see ALL the time:

- Crazy Dumbledore (he's not good, or bad, just batshit crazy, which is worse)
- Senile/Sick Dumbledore (He's old, someone is potioning/spelling him (usually Snape), Battle Fatigue (being in a battle ready state for over 20 years did a number on him, lack of human contact for ten years [this one is usually tacked onto bad dumbledore])
- Ron being infinitely useless/jealous/etc
- Potion Queen Molly Weasley
- Master of Death (and the fifty thousand shades of it, each with different abilities, flavors, and flair)
- Helpful Goblins
- Harry seems to be related to half the wizarding world with 20 bajillion Lordships
- Harry owns over half the wizarding world because of the above bulletpoint
- Harry is rich as shit
- His parents will is as thick as Hogwarts a History, and explains a whole ton of crap that sends a lot of people to jail, fixes a lot of wrongs, and has bad humor in it. And/or Lily smacking James.
- Dragons speak Parseltongue

** Surprised nobody already said these ones :

- 10 000 words shopping trip with a very long list of every items Harry bought (all of very high quality, and very expensive)
- Harry buys an enchanted trunks with a 10 rooms appartment inside, which is never mentionned again
- Goblins can do paternity test, determine your animagus form (and some nonsens like "Shadowmage"), know if you have a block on your magical core, and can determine your ancestor of 900 years ago, thanks to 7 drop of blood on a paper.
- Harry is the Heir of a lot of "Ancient and Noble House", and has a majority on the Wizengamot by himself.
- James and Lily left a 10 page will with the scenario inside.
- Ice Queen Daphne
- Voldemort had a point
- He was not that bad really
- Did you ever heard about the true enemy, Moustache Twirling Dumbledore?

** So, apparently, FFN has decided to delete my story on the grounds of /"Not the property of uploading writer Please note we do not allow users to post lyrics to songs they did not write. Exception being works in the US public domain."/

If you've read the work before it was taken down at 6:31 PM CST, January 13, 2020, then you know that it held no relation or Lyrics to any song in it. Due to this, i have uploaded Harry Potter and the Overrated Stone to AO3, linkao3(Harry Potter and the Overrated Stone) which can be found below.

Tomorrow, I will re-upload it on FFN and see if they will try and take it down again. If they do, I will change my location to the United States just so it won't be taken down.
