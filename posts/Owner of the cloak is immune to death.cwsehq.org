** My headcanon with the cloak is that you are truly undetectable with it on. You can't be heard, seen, smelled, gravitationally detected, nor will any change in air pressure occur. The most lethal curses stop when they hit it. Any and all wards will fail to stop you. It is the Cloak of Death and it is beyond magic.

*** I remember the scenes of snape groping around to try to find Harry, but I can't remember if he ever was found that way

**** I can't remember anything on touch either, but I would be okay with the cloak being weak to physical attacks.

The big issue with the headcanon is that Mad Eye Moody was able to see Harry under the cloak, but that was a legitimate plothole in the actual books so....

***** The closest explanation is to assume Moody's eye was made by Dumbledore, with the Elder Wand. But it is more simply a pothole

***** Sorry, but how was that a plothole? The Cloak was never really elaborated on the extent of it's powers other than myths (like hiding under it protecting you from Death-only referenced by the Tale of Three Brothers), so as far as I know that doesn't contradict anything established within the story. As far as I know you can still detect someone physically or by sound, and probably through Homenum Revelio (can't remember if that was ever used in canon so that's speculation on my part). The only special features I recall seeing in canon is that it can't be summoned (if I'm not mistaken Death Eaters attempt to summon it when the 3 break into Hogsmeade during DH), and it lasts longer than normal invisibility cloaks (since it's been passed down through who knows how many generations), it doesn't remove you from reality.

****** The cloak was said to be truly capable of hiding anyone from anything. This specialness was further demonstrated near the end of the last book where the cloak was revealed to be immune to summoning spells and other forms of detection such as the cauterwalling charm.

I could posthoc rationalize Moody seeing Harry as Harry not truly being a master of the cloak at this point or some rubbish, but it seems more likely that Rowling forgot a key aspect of the cloak three books before it was revealed.

Honestly, if you think some fancy blue eye can find Harry when the embodiment of death itself cannot, then I don't know what to tell you.

******* This is assuming that the mythology behind the Cloak is true, which isn't confirmed within the books. It's quite possible that the three brothers were exceptionally talented at creating magical artifacts, one made an amazing wand, another made a necromantic stone, and the third made a powerful invisibility cloak. Going by this logic there is no "Master of Death," and the only Hallow which would have a master is the Elder Wand, due to wands as a whole having some form of minor sentience where they "choose" their master. If this is the case, then Moody's eye could be explained as being a piece if technology that was only recently developed (meaning within his lifetime, or even within the last 100 years or so, since the Hallows are so old), and therefore the Cloak didn't have any protections against it since the tech didn't exist at the time of its creation. Whereas, with summoning, that charm would have most likely been around during the Peverells' era, therefore it would make sense for it to have an anti-summoning enchantment on it.

Really, this is all speculation on both sides of the argument, and we have limited information in regards to the Hallows' creation and the nature of their powers. If you choose to believe in the mythology behind them, then sure, it's a plothole. But given the factual evidence within the text, this doesn't directly contradict with anything, and would actually be supportive of the idea that the Hallows are nothing more then some powerful, but not infallible, artifacts created by some talented wizards rather than gifts from Death itself.

******** I did say this was headcanon. While it is possible that the Death part is a myth, it is also possible that it is legitimate. In a world of magic, souls, dementors, ghosts and an afterlife, I have to raise an eyebrow at the idea of Death, the literal entity, being beyond the realm of possibility.

I still stand by the position that Moody's eye shouldn't have been able to. It is clearly capable of it as it happened. My issue is that this short, forgettable scene very much diminishes the reputation of the cloak and makes it far less intriguing from a story perspective. In an ideal story to me, the Hallows have some significance.

** I like the idea of this one. I've read a lot of "Master of Death" fics because of the Hallows, but not one along these lines.

Wish I could point you to a story, but I don't know of one!
