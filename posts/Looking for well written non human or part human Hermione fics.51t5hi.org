I read this one fic a long time ago where Hermione was part angel and it was an interesting premise, so I'm looking for something along those lines.


** In [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=5185&chapterid=&agree=1][Forever Knight]] she is a vampire. I have found the fic to be above average in writing style, but wasn't a fan of the plot. You should give it a try, though, as there aren't many fics out there that adhere to your request's parameters.

She is one (or something akin to one, anyway) too in my own fic linkffn(The Bloodmoon Rises), but if you want a complete or fast uploading story, refrain from reading mine yet. Also I can only say that I am above the bad writing of fanfiction.net. I can't really judge my writing any higher without feeling, and probably sounding, arrogant.

  Voldemort had not only sent his Death Eaters to the Ministry, but vampires as well. Hermione and Harry fall to them and find themselves in new, undead lives. While Harry struggles to remain human, Hermione becomes what was believed dead long ago. She becomes a Countess, an heir to Dracula. Unfortunatly, there are no books on that. Vampire!Hermione/Harry, Dark!Hermione Dark!Harry

  Response to GoldenSteel's My gf is a what? challenge. GoF: Hermione has a secret. One that even she doesn't know. When she unearths a highly dangerous ritual to help Harry in the first task, the two of them never expected that secret to hit them both and change them into Great Dragons! Are they doomed to be treated as beasts? What does this mean for the TWT? H/Hr; AD/RW/MW putdown.
