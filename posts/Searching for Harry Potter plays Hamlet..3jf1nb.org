So this is a request for a fic I once read whose title whisper at the back of my tongue. Sort of like an old song whose tune you know but cant remember the band's name. In it HP runs away from home and falls in with some shady sorts at a pub. He ends up working as a fortune teller, surprisingly being eerily accurate. With a friend he auditions for hamlet and due to the lead dropping out to elope with his GF, Harry becomes Hamlet for a night. I would be eternally grateful if someone can point me in the right direction.
