Are there any fics that have the concept of Lords similar to Wind Shear and I'm Still Here ? Where "Lord" isn't just a title but an actual state of being or level of power

edit

no slash or fem!potter


** in !linkffn(The Odds were never in my favour), there are "Lord level" magic users with ten times the magical capability of the average witch of wizard. We know that among the Hogwarts populous, nine of the students have Lord-level abilities.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

** If you don't mind slash, linkao3(Common Sense by Grohiik) is a fantastic WIP based around the idea of Lords of Magic.

**** Harry/Blaise. But the series is only up to year three, so there isn't actually any romance involving Harry and others his age. It's just that there's also a rather explicit m/m romance involving older people that's too much of a spoiler to reveal and is quite integral to the plot, hence the warning.

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)
