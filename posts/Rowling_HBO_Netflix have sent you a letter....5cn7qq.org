...and have said they want your help to come up with a Wizarding World series. What ideas do you propose to them? What is the tagline to the series? Any other info? (We are talking Game of Thrones level budget,)

For example- My first idea would be a more adult orientated series based around the Unspeakables. Rowling never (I haven't found evidence) specified what the Unspeakables do except that they are mysterious, and are researchers/magi-scientists.

What if we took the cliche idea that they are also the Mi-6 of the Magical world and made it more believable?

*THE UNSPEAKABLES* Tagline - /Hidden In Sight/ No. Of Seasons - 5. Eps - 13per season

(Inb4 someone says "books 1-7 tv series" or "Marauders tv series" yes it would be great)


** *The Dark Arts* - /Magic's most vile/

Mature themed series that follows the rise and fall of wizarding history's most notorious dark lords or ladys. The first season could start with Herpo the foul in ancient greece and his creation of the horcrux and hatching a basilisk. The history and creation/creators of the Unforgivables is also a worthy contender. Merlin and Morgana's rivalry could be a very interesting season. With Grindelwald's life being the possible series finale.

** Hmm...

*Wandlore*

Wands weren't always as commonplace as they are in the present day of magical Britain.

When they were first invented, they turned magical practice on its head. Potioneers, ritualists and diviners needed time and space to work their magic, but a wand-user could enchant, curse or kill someone in less than a second.

Look back in time to the days of Ancient Greece, 500 BC, when the wand was first invented, and see different factions of wizards and magical beings vie to control understanding of the technology behind them.

*** Another idea; In some gnostic traditions, Jesus is depicted with a [[http://www.biblejunkies.com/2014/06/magic-wands-in-early-christian-art.html][wand]]. Why not have Jesus be the inventor of wands, and all his "miracles" are actually a new and flamboyant style of magic using his invention?

**** Yes, and spark a massive s#!tstorm from the 1/4 of the world population who think he's god. Bible-thumpers already have enough of a problem with the hp-verse due to a phrase somewhere in the bible about witchcraft being evil....I guess since they are willing to believe a book describing impossible things being real, they assume anyone will do the same, and start to "worship" Mr. Potter, thus losing their revenue. Ugh.. i digress... though really, the modern church is really the best long-term scam I'vÃª ever seen. George Carlin says it best folks...

** I've got to say, I'd love a piece around the events of WW2 and Gridlewald's war. HBO knows how to do the time well, ALA Band of Brothers, and there's a lot of potential there for some spectacular drama.

Better yet it gets us away from most of the established characters, and those that remain are almost unrecognizable and are still developing into who they will become.

** There are so many directions you can go with the series format:

1.) Mid-twenties Harry and Ron (with occasional help from Hermione), hunting down dark wizards and witches in a magical version of True Detective. Or a series of detective-style mysteries with revolving main characters: one could take place in 2005 and star the trio, the next in 1965 with Moody as the main investigator, and still another could take place during Harry's Hogwarts years as a side-story to whatever the year's main plot was, similar to The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks.

2.) Ginny and the world of professional quidditch. Though my personal preference would be to star her (or whomever the main character is) as a manager, rather than a player.

3.) Fearing reprisal directly after the war, Draco does what all cowards do: he runs. Leaving his family behind and his wealth untouched, Draco disappears into the muggle world. The show would then detail his life on the move, as well as his interaction with and growing admiration for muggles as he becomes more familiar with the world outside his own. If nailed just right, it could be a really unique coming-of-age series, as well as provide longtime fans greater incentive to empathise with Draco than the "Tom Felton's so hot" fangirl reasoning for liking the character.

There are probably a whole host of others, but it's much too early in the morning to be thinking of them right now.

** I'd love a series set in the late 1700's in the States, just before,during and after the war of independence. HBO tier of course (full-on violence, nudity, gritty realism etc).

There's so much good stuff there to explore: how the magical government was formed, how the local magic-users react, the new continent's magical creatures, the settlers arriving, magical outlaws, magical lawmen, the potential tension with the British ministry... a gold mine for a series really.

** Fantastic Beasts, and Where to Find Them

None of that "we have a dark wizard letting a bunch of magical beasts run rampant through nomag NY" shit, but instead a Planet Earth style documentary series where it focuses on the actual magical creatures; their habitats, their predators and prey, a typical year cycle for them. Build a world where these amazing beings are untouched by wizards and live in the wild, instead of how we see them in the films.

Series, 1. Episodes, 10 (focusing on maybe three interconnected or loosely associated animals an episode)
