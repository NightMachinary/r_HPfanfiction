** 1. We don't know how it was mapped out. Whether it had to be done by hand or if it's some spell linked to Hogwarts.

2. We don't actually know why they didn't notice that. It is possible - and this is just my personal speculation - that the Marauders had the option to change their names from their normal name to their Marauder nickname. Either that or Peter found out the twins had it and, as one of its creators, was able to mess with it so his name read 'Scabbers' or removed his name entirely until Remus got /his/ hands on it and undid that, expecting Sirius to be the one who popped up on it.

3. We know the map shows Peeves so one assumes it shows the ghosts. And it probably does show other animagi, since they likely knew McGonagall was one.

4. Nope. I mean, presumably animals don't show up on there so you've got to be human but otherwise you turn up in Hogwarts and you appear on the map - Room of Requirement and Chamber of Secrets not included

5. We don't know /when/ it was confiscated by Filch. It could well have been the last week of their seventh year at which point, why would they bother trying to get it back when it shows their school and they're leaving the school. And leaving it in Filch's office means only those who are the bravest, most daring or most cunning would get their hands on it. A worthy legacy for the Marauders, no?

6. Depends. If it's wiped then it could just be mistaken for a normal bit of parchment and written on, damaged, destroyed etc. If it's not wiped then presumably the student could use it until they said the words 'mischief managed'. Whether they'd be able to open it again or not depends on whether the defensive sentience in the map which insulted Snape was able to tell potential mischief makers how to open the map.
