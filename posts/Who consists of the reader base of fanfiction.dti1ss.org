** Yes, and authors seem to consist overwhelmingly of teenage girls.

But this sub, at least those regulars who vote on annual surveys, is dominated by 18-25 men.

*** To be fair, reddit is dominated by exactly that demographic anyway, so is it really surprising? Its plausible though that male readers are less interested in X pairing story and more in different types of stories, which may be why more of them come to find new stories or discuss than women.

Honestly, I wonder what the difference in the split is between casual authors/readers (been in fanfiction 0-2 years, drop out due to boredom/life) and dedicated fanfic authors/readers (>2 years, sampled a wide variety of fics and multiple fandoms to settle on their particular tastes).

** Most of the readers are American. At least when I look at my story stats, Americans seems to be more prominent than all other nations combined.

*** In English? Well yeah. Fictional novels tend to lose some charm when translated from their mother tongue.

** I used to tell myself that my fic didn't get many readers because the characters were in their thirties. But then I wrote about teenagers and twenty-somethings and I still didn't get readers so . . . I'm rambling. I think it's best to ignore those sort of statistics, they don't help with anything. You have no way of knowing how old anyone is on these sites. It's the internet: anyone can be whatever they like. I'm a willowy blonde twenty-five-year-old.

** I don't know exactly when I started, but the end of April 2018 caused a major preference shift, so definitely longer than that. Perhaps 2 years? I'm 25 atm, a Swedish male.

** I'm a 26-year-old female who grew up on HP and finds it difficult to let go of writing/reading fanfiction for it. But it seems to be mostly teenagers on sites like ao3 and ff.net, yeah.

** Well I started reading as a 21 year old guy but now I'm a 25 year old girl so I guess it runs the gambit.
