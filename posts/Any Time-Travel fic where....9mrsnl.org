  Teen Tom Riddle travels to the future where he is known as Lord Voldemort
#+end_quote

Worth noting that teenage Riddle already called himself Lord Voldemort among his budding circle of cronies, though obviously he wasn't known by that name to his professors. He probably created the name as soon as he found out Riddle was a Muggle's name.

  You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if things went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?

** Not sure where you stand on Tom/Hermione (Tomione) but there are quite a few that have premises similar to this, some have a Horacrux Tom in a role that puts him in a position against himself.

War Paint is a great one where Hermione gets the Diary instead of Ginny. linkao3(1731827)

Renatus is a WIP: linkao3(14655447)

Restricted by Flaignhan; linkffn(4693651)

There's also a TON of Time Travel fics, but usually it's Hermione going back and he learns about what he becomes and his path changes but not really any show downs between past/future selves in these.

A Big ball of Wibbly-Wobbly; linkffn(11508846)

Choosing Grey, a bit on the epic side in length; linkao3(5121731)

​

EDITS: I botched this by accidentally copying the wrong numbers for the fics. I've edited but hopefully FanfictionBot will correct?

  Hermione has always been a warrior for the Light. But when an attempt to salvage more than a Pyrrhic victory lands her in 1944, she quickly realizes that sometimes it is best to allow a lesser evil to flourish, because defeating it only creates the conditions for a greater one to rise. With conspiracies, schemes, and difficult choices in every corner, and a charismatic young Tom Riddle who is increasingly interested in her, she will eventually have to answer the question: How much darkness and grey in him can she accept?
