How do you explain the Wizarding money, in a way that makes sense in your story?

Would the Wizarding money be different; from say Britain, to America, to France; et cetra? Or would it stay the same?

If it's different, what kind of money would other places, outside of Britain use? And how?

If they're the same; how would they correlate to American money? Or other money?

Any ideas?

Rowling has also mentioned that she pretty much sucks at math (I do as well; so I can't really blame her). But just something I was wondering about.


** It's very simple: wizards use money mostly because it makes running their society easier, but fundamentally, they don't need it. Money buys /conveniences/, but a competent sorcerer could live in luxury without a penny to his name. With enough Transfiguration and Space-Extension Charms you can create a palace out of a shack.

As such, their economy doesn't /need/ to make sense. If the Wizarding Economy crashed overnight (as it surely has in the past), the material consequences would amount to having to delay buying that new broomstick or wand you wanted for a few weeks (long enough, perhaps for the Ministry to imprison/bribe whoever's actons caused it to crash in the first place), after which Minister Fudge will just make a speech about how Galleons are once again worth whatever they were worth before, and everything goes back to normal.

And with what little contact they have with the Muggle world, it /certainly/ doesn't need to correlate with Muggle money in a very solid way. The Goblins and Ministry dictate an exchange rate for the purpose of Muggle-Borns who are starting out in the Wizarding World, but it's probably not particularly significant or representative of the money's actual value (insofar as it has one).

The only one who understand any of it properly are the Goblins of Gringotts, and possibly, /possibly/ some underpaid Ministry clerk somewhere.

I think different Wizarding Nations mint their own coins (they /certainly/ have different names), but probably keep the same gold-silver-copper scheme. So presumably Wizard Americans pay in "Magical Dollars" or "Simoleons" or whatever, but but when you actually weigh the gold coins they call that, they're more or less equivalent to Galleons.

*** I would imagine the gold, silver, and copper scheme ultimately trace back to goblins. I do wonder how significant the roles of goblins are in other magical societies. Maybe they're just native to Britain? They do seem to play a significant role in the magical history without mention of other lands.

Also, I think an area where money would have a significant value would definitely be buying land. You can just enchant areas to be bigger with an extension charm, but I don't know if that applies to open spaces.

** Wizard currency is sort of a parody of the old British pre-decimal currency -- the type of British currency that was in use up until the 1970s. If you think wizard currency makes no sense, it has NOTHING on what British Muggles used;

Two farthings make a ha'penny, two ha'pennies make a penny, four pence make a groat, six pence make a sixpence, two sixpence make a shilling, two shilling makes a florin, two and a half shilling (or five sixpence) make a half-crown, two half-crowns make a crown, four crowns make a sovereign or a pound.... and then there was the guinea, which was twenty-one shillings... I've probably forgotten some.

Course, all this was long before my time, but I've read enough old English kids' books to know how confusing the system was... and yet, and this is kind of funny, when the UK went on the much more logical and easily-grasped decimal system (you know, 100 pence in one pound and done), a lot of people complained because the new system MADE NO SENSE and the old system was so much EASIER....

Which just goes to show that if you're used to something you don't realize how absurd it looks to people on the outside.

** Dragot is MACUSA's equivalent to a galleon, and a sprink being some subdivision.
