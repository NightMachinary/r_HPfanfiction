** Because maybe there were more important things to be done than getting his dick wet? Because (horror of horrors) it's entirely possible for a dude to be friends with a girl without wanting to shag her?

Besides I'm pretty sure Hermione was following Harry, not Ron, to destroy the horcruxes, not out of a particular burning desire to have sex in the woods

*** Nah, Hermione is just there for the dick. I mean charming your parents memory of you away just because you want to destroy some immortality-soul-containers of someone who wants to kill you? Never, who would do such a thing for something that unimportant and boring?

But to have sex? Of course!

** Surprise surprise, Harry actually cares about people instead of fulfilling a neckbeard's wet dreams!

** The answer is in the books. I don't care if those “many of us” have never read them.

** I always thought Harry should just let go and enjoy the pleasures of human flesh. Release all that pent up stress, I'm sure there were plenty of fan-girls wiling to drop their panties for the boy-who-lived just gotta be smart about those love potions.

** Because Harry would rather cut his own d**k than sleeping with Hermione? Don't you know that she isn't Emma Watson in cannon but an extremely bushy haired girl coupled with a rodent face and a bossy attitude?

*** There's nothing wrong with bushy hair. And she needs to be bossy because otherwise Harry wouldn't get shit done.

But the most important thing that you forget is the fact that Hermione chooses Harry over anyone else. She completely trusts him and follows him into danger despite knowing it's a trap. She is the one true friend Harry has. Such a friendship is the base of a lifelong, happy marriage.

**** How I HATE this argument about Hermione is making Harry get shit done. The more you push someone into doing something, the less he is going to do. If Hermione didn't exist, Harry would do it alone and better. Secondly, no Hermione doesn't completely trust Harry, remember about sixth year? When Hermione didn't believe Harry when he told her that Draco was working for Voldemort? Result: Dumbledore died! Or in seventh year when Harry wanted to visit Godric's Hollow but because of Hermione they did it much later? Result: They almost died because of Nagini (and Hermione) and this annoying bossy idiot broke Harry's wand. So no! This isn't the base of a lifelong happy mariage but of a disaster! She followed him when Harry thought that Sirius was in danger even if she believed if it was a trap. What kind of sick relationship is this? You don't let your husband go to a deathtrap. I'm sorry to say to you that Harry has no "true" friend. He made bad decisions by befriending Ron and Hermione and almost get killed more than once because of them. (Poor guy doesn't need it, he already got a Dark Lord after him.)

***** Dumbledore staged his own death. He was already dying after touching the cursed ring.

Sirius would have been kissed without Hermione's time turner and while Harry's wand got broken during the Nagini fight at least she got them out alive. And Harry was going to the DoM, with or without her. What should she do, stun him? Umbridge was about to cast the Cruciatus on Harry so she improvised. The others took care of the Inquisitorial Squad and she didn't suggest the thestrals either. Things just escalated from there on.

Also, who do you suggest would be better friends? The Slytherins? A house that, while not unanimously following Voldemort still did nothing about its rampant bigotry?
