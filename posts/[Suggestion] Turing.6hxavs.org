Dumbledore knows, or knows about, Alan Turing. Dumbledore helps Turing, either faking his death and aiding him in escaping to somewhere less unfriendly (and thus being in line with our timeline), or does something more egregious, ending up causing a better future/present.

***** He probably didn't. That's the most outrageous part of it.

Scientist using cyanide in his work dies of cyanide poisoning. Coroner rules it a suicide because he thinks that's what gay people do.
