I keep seeing Responses to fic searches or requests with “idk why u don't just use the search function in ao3/ffn”

Nah you are right, we shouldn't try to help each other find cool fics that we like. What's the point of a Reddit community anyway?


** To a certain extent, you're right. But some people really don't put in the tiniest bit of effort before posting. I've seen posts from people looking for a specific fic that I found by just googling some of the exact terms they used. And I've seen posts asking for recommendations that someone else already asked for (and got several responses for) mere days or even hours before. Those people deserve every downvote they get.

*** I never mind people asking for similar (or even the same) recommendations that others have. It always has the chance to be seen by other people who might have more fics to recommend. Also, reddit search is horrible.

**** If it's been a few months, then sure. If it's been a few hours, then no, they're just being rude and wasting time. Somewhere between those two points is where it becomes acceptable to ask again, and I'm not going to speculate where exactly that point is, because it's probably different for everyone.

And yes, reddit's search is horrible, but it's perfectly capable of handling this sort of thing. Most, if not all, of the common requests can be summarized in just one or two words that you can search for, like "healer," "dark Harry," the name of the ship you want or the characters in that ship, or the name of the other fandom you want to read a crossover with. That will probably give you plenty of posts to look at, and if you still want to ask, sort the results by new and make sure no one else has asked recently.

** I've seen it both ways. People asking questions they could easily search for, but also experts expecting questioners to basically complete a course in computer science before asking a question. We could all meet in the middle more.

Meaning, nobody wants to be your personal servant. Yes, we would like to help and we all share tips for good stories, but nobody is happy to do the simple work you can do. Like making one quick search on Google/AO3/FFnet. Show us some effort first, show us some ingenuity. Asking for the best completed stories of all times every other day, or the best WBWL story, best fem!Harry story, etc. shows that somebody didn't even bother to search through this subreddit. And we are inundated with these stupid questions, so people tend to get a bit edgy about them.

*** Well I was trying to re-read some fics that I had initially read 10-15 years ago and no one responded probably because most people don't even remember them. If people don't want to respond to fic request posts about fics they know, they don't want to respond to fic request posts they don't know... then what's the purpose of this community? May as well shut down this sub.

One would hope that the purpose of the community was more than asking other people to give you their labour for free. I had always operated under the assumption that the principal purpose of the subreddit was to /discuss/ Harry Potter fanfiction, not to serve as a search function.

***** I would disagree that there's much labor involved. My case for example is that if I know something off of the top of my head I will respond because I can spare two seconds for that. If I don't, I don't.

However I do agree that there should be more discussion and I personally enjoy your detailed analysis of various aspects of the HP universe. But many times there are posts with prompts (some really stupid - I am guilty of some) or discussion threads that have no responses or maybe a one or two that don't really lead to any entertaining discussion.

**** Don't make overly general requests. Pull out from your memory all even irrelevant bits of information which could help to identify it. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/m14p3m/looking_for_hermione_g_james_p_story_where/][Requests like this]] or [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/m1imwz/lf_fic_where_harry_meets_his_family_and_is/][many others]] are [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/m1i7ma/help_finding_two_fics/][definitely]] acceptable and there are plenty of them answered every day. (I don't care about any of these, and I am not saying that they are perfect, just that they are recent and nobody was attacked in comments). And yes, two out of three have no replies, but c'est la vie (and when the requests here are used as the last resort, it is probably something really difficult).

*** Agreed, unlike the worm fandom, where a good portion of stories are on spacebattles or sufficentvelocity, which are forums that suck to search, it seems the vast majority of new fics are coming to indexed sites like ff and ao3. Hp FanFiction could benefit from the organization they show over on the subreddit
